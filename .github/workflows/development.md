# LibraryOfBabel Development Workflow

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
- **`main`** (production): Stable, QA-approved releases only
- **`dev`** (development): Active development, all agent features merge here first
- **`feature/*`**: Individual feature branches for specific agent work

### Development Process

#### For AI Agents Working on Features:

1. **Start from dev branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/agent-name-task-description
   ```

2. **Work on assigned tasks**:
   - Make focused commits with clear messages
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Follow coding standards and conventions

3. **Prepare for QA review**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
   git push origin feature/agent-name-task-description
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**:
   - PR from `feature/agent-name-task-description` ‚Üí `dev`
   - Include detailed description of changes
   - Request QA Agent review
   - Wait for approval before merging

#### QA Agent Responsibilities:

1. **Review all PRs to dev branch**:
   - Code quality assessment
   - Test coverage validation
   - Performance impact analysis
   - Documentation completeness

2. **Testing process**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/branch-name
   python tests/test_suite.py
   python tests/performance_benchmarks.py
   ```

3. **Approval criteria**:
   - All tests pass
   - Performance targets met
   - Code follows project standards
   - Documentation updated

4. **Production promotion**:
   - Only QA Agent can merge `dev` ‚Üí `main`
   - Create release notes
   - Tag stable releases

### Branch Protection Rules

#### Main Branch (Production):
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews
- ‚úÖ Require QA Agent approval
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
- ‚ùå Allow force pushes
- ‚ùå Allow deletions

#### Dev Branch:
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews
- ‚úÖ Allow agent self-approval for minor fixes
- ‚úÖ Require status checks for major changes
- ‚úÖ Allow squash merging

### Commit Message Standards

```
type(scope): description

feat: new feature implementation
fix: bug fixes
docs: documentation updates
test: test additions/modifications
refactor: code refactoring
perf: performance improvements
chore: maintenance tasks
```

### Examples:

```bash
# Librarian Agent working on EPUB processor enhancement
git checkout -b feature/librarian-epub-audio-sync
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat(epub): add audio-text synchronization support"

# DBA Agent optimizing database queries
git checkout -b feature/dba-search-optimization
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "perf(database): optimize full-text search indexes"

# QA Agent adding test coverage
git checkout -b feature/qa-integration-tests
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "test(integration): add end-to-end processing tests"
```

### Release Process

1. **Development Phase**: All agents work on `feature/*` branches
2. **Integration Phase**: Features merge to `dev` after PR review
3. **QA Phase**: QA Agent tests complete `dev` branch
4. **Release Phase**: QA Agent merges `dev` ‚Üí `main` with release tag
5. **Deployment**: `main` branch represents production-ready code

### Emergency Hotfixes

For critical production fixes:
```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix-description
# ... make minimal fix ...
git commit -m "fix: critical production issue"
# PR directly to main with QA emergency approval
```
