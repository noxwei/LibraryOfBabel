  "feedback": "Evaluation from Professor Dr. Margaret Williams, Literature\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n• Excellent research scope and comprehensiveness\n• Outstanding cross-disciplinary analysis\n• Thorough development of ideas with appropriate depth\n• Excellent prose style and argumentation\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n• Develop more original insights and innovative connections\n\nSPECIFIC COMMENTS:\nThis paper demonstrates Maya Garcia's engagement with the LibraryOfBabel research system and shows \nadequate \nunderstanding of interdisciplinary research methods.\n\nThe use of AI-assisted literature discovery is competent but could be more creative. \nThe cross-disciplinary analysis successfully bridges multiple academic domains.\n\nContinue developing your analytical skills and consider how technology can enhance rather than replace critical thinking.\n\nOverall, this represents strong \nwork for a Anthropology student in Cultural Anthropology.",
