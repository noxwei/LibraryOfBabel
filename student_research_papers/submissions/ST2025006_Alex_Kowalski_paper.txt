INTRODUCTION

        The field of Social Theory has undergone significant transformation in recent decades, requiring 
        scholars to adopt increasingly interdisciplinary approaches to understanding complex phenomena. 
        Traditional research methodologies, while valuable, often limit the scope of inquiry due to practical 
        constraints in literature discovery and cross-referencing.
        
        This paper presents a novel approach to social movements research, leveraging the 
        LibraryOfBabel knowledge base system to conduct comprehensive literature analysis across multiple 
        disciplines. The system's capability to search 13,794 text chunks across 304 books enables 
        unprecedented scope in academic inquiry, facilitating connections that might otherwise remain undiscovered.
        
        As a Sociology student with particular interest in Social Theory, I approach this research 
        from the perspective of critical and systematic, seeking to understand how emerging technologies can 
        enhance traditional scholarly methods while maintaining academic rigor and depth.
        
        The central research question guiding this inquiry is: How can AI-assisted knowledge discovery 
        systems enhance our understanding of social movements through cross-disciplinary analysis?

METHODOLOGY

        This research employs a mixed-methods approach combining systematic literature search with 
        qualitative analysis of cross-disciplinary connections. The primary tool utilized is the 
        LibraryOfBabel knowledge base system, which provides access to 38.95 million words across 
        304 books with advanced full-text search capabilities.
        
        **Search Strategy:**
        Systematic queries were conducted focusing on social movements and related concepts. 
        The search strategy included both targeted subject-specific queries and exploratory cross-disciplinary 
        searches to identify unexpected connections and novel perspectives.
        
        **Data Collection:**
        Search results were collected and analyzed for relevance, with particular attention to:
        - Source credibility and academic rigor
