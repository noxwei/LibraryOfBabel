INTRODUCTION

        The field of Cognitive Psychology has undergone significant transformation in recent decades, requiring 
        scholars to adopt increasingly interdisciplinary approaches to understanding complex phenomena. 
        Traditional research methodologies, while valuable, often limit the scope of inquiry due to practical 
        constraints in literature discovery and cross-referencing.
        
        This paper presents a novel approach to memory systems research, leveraging the 
        LibraryOfBabel knowledge base system to conduct comprehensive literature analysis across multiple 
        disciplines. The system's capability to search 13,794 text chunks across 304 books enables 
        unprecedented scope in academic inquiry, facilitating connections that might otherwise remain undiscovered.
        
        As a Psychology student with particular interest in Cognitive Psychology, I approach this research 
        from the perspective of empirical and methodical, seeking to understand how emerging technologies can 
        enhance traditional scholarly methods while maintaining academic rigor and depth.
        
        The central research question guiding this inquiry is: How can AI-assisted knowledge discovery 
        systems enhance our understanding of memory systems through cross-disciplinary analysis?

METHODOLOGY

        This research employs a mixed-methods approach combining systematic literature search with 
        qualitative analysis of cross-disciplinary connections. The primary tool utilized is the 
        LibraryOfBabel knowledge base system, which provides access to 38.95 million words across 
        304 books with advanced full-text search capabilities.
        
        **Search Strategy:**
        Systematic queries were conducted focusing on memory systems and related concepts. 
        The search strategy included both targeted subject-specific queries and exploratory cross-disciplinary 
        searches to identify unexpected connections and novel perspectives.
        
        **Data Collection:**
        Search results were collected and analyzed for relevance, with particular attention to:
        - Source credibility and academic rigor
        - Theoretical contributions to the field
        - Methodological innovations
        - Cross-disciplinary applications and connections
        
        **Analysis Framework:**
        As a researcher with empirical and methodical approach, I employed systematic thematic analysis to 
        identify patterns across sources while remaining open to emergent themes and unexpected connections.
