INTRODUCTION

        The field of International Relations has undergone significant transformation in recent decades, requiring 
        scholars to adopt increasingly interdisciplinary approaches to understanding complex phenomena. 
        Traditional research methodologies, while valuable, often limit the scope of inquiry due to practical 
        constraints in literature discovery and cross-referencing.
        
        This paper presents a novel approach to diplomacy research, leveraging the 
        LibraryOfBabel knowledge base system to conduct comprehensive literature analysis across multiple 
        disciplines. The system's capability to search 13,794 text chunks across 304 books enables 
        unprecedented scope in academic inquiry, facilitating connections that might otherwise remain undiscovered.
        
        As a Political Science student with particular interest in International Relations, I approach this research 
        from the perspective of strategic and global-minded, seeking to understand how emerging technologies can 
        enhance traditional scholarly methods while maintaining academic rigor and depth.
        
        The central research question guiding this inquiry is: How can AI-assisted knowledge discovery 
        systems enhance our understanding of diplomacy through cross-disciplinary analysis?
