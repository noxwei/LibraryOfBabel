PERFORMANCE SCORE: Academic Research as Embodied Practice

Performer: Echo Nightshade (ST2025036)
Training: Performance Studies - Embodied Knowledge
Date of Performance: June 26, 2025

[Stage Direction: The researcher enters, carrying the weight of institutional expectations while maintaining authentic voice.]

## Scene I: Setup

[Researcher stands at center stage, surrounded by books and papers. Lighting shifts to warm amber.]

**RESEARCHER** (to audience): You want to know about Embodied Knowledge? Here's what the books don't tell you.

[Movement: gathering papers, letting some fall]

The body knows things the mind hasn't learned yet. When I read about Embodied Knowledge in these academic texts, my shoulders tense. My jaw clenches. The knowledge feels heavy in my chest—not because it's complex, but because it's incomplete.

[Interaction with space: reading while walking, papers trailing]

**RESEARCHER**: "According to Smith (2019)..." [voice becomes robotic] "This research indicates that Embodied Knowledge functions as a mechanism for..." [breaks character] 

No. Stop.

[Direct address to audience]

**RESEARCHER**: My grandmother could have told you about Embodied Knowledge without citing a single source. She knew it in her hands, in her daily practice, in the way she moved through the world. But her knowledge doesn't count in the academy because it wasn't published in a peer-reviewed journal.

[Physical demonstration: embodying different ways of knowing]

When I approach Embodied Knowledge through embodied research methods, different truths emerge. The phenomenological reality that lives in breath and gesture and the spaces between words. The affective knowledge that pulses through communities but rarely makes it into academic databases.

[Costume change: putting on and removing academic regalia]

**RESEARCHER**: See how the clothes change the performance? How the institutional costume makes certain movements possible while constraining others? That's what studying Embodied Knowledge in the academy does—it enables some forms of knowledge while systematically excluding others.

[Soundscape: layering voices, audio from interviews]

**VOICES** (overlapping): "It's not like what they write about..." "They never asked us..." "We've been doing this for generations..." "The research doesn't match our experience..."

**RESEARCHER** (weaving through voices): The embodied knowledge of Embodied Knowledge exists in the margins of academic discourse, literally marginalized by research methods that privilege abstract analysis over lived experience.

[Climactic moment: researcher removes all academic paraphernalia]

**RESEARCHER**: What if we studied Embodied Knowledge the way performers develop a character? Through inhabitation rather than observation? Through relationship rather than analysis? Through transformation rather than documentation?

[Final image: researcher and audience sharing space, boundaries dissolved]

**RESEARCHER**: This is what Embodied Knowledge actually looks like when you let the body into the research. Different, isn't it?

[Lights fade as audience is invited to move and respond]
