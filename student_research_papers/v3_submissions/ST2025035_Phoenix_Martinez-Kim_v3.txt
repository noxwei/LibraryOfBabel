## Access & Context

I need to be direct here: most academic writing about Cognitive Liberation is inaccessible nonsense designed to make simple ideas sound complicated so professors can feel smart. I'm going to explain this clearly because neurodivergent people deserve to understand research without having to decode academic bullshit.

**What I actually found:** Cognitive Liberation affects neurodivergent people differently than neurotypicals, but most research ignores this completely. The studies I found in LibraryOfBabel mostly use neurotypical assumptions and then act surprised when their findings don't apply to everyone.

**Why this matters:** When researchers study Cognitive Liberation without considering neurodivergence, they create knowledge that actively excludes us. Then that incomplete knowledge gets used to make policies and programs that don't work for neurodivergent people. This isn't just bad science—it's ableist science.

**Problems with current research:**

1. **Sensory assumptions**: Most studies about Cognitive Liberation assume everyone processes sensory information the same way. Wrong.

2. **Communication bias**: Researchers privilege verbal communication and miss how many neurodivergent people express understanding differently.

3. **Pathology model**: Too much research treats neurodivergence as a problem to solve instead of a natural variation to accommodate.

4. **Masking erasure**: Studies often can't tell the difference between genuine participation and masking/camouflaging behaviors.

**What actually works:** Research that includes neurodivergent people as partners, not just subjects. Studies that ask what we need instead of assuming what's wrong with us. Methods that accommodate different communication styles and processing speeds.

**My analysis:** Cognitive Liberation becomes completely different when you center neurodivergent experiences instead of treating them as deviations from a neurotypical norm. The patterns that emerge show how much mainstream research has been missing.

I'm tired of having to translate academic language to access knowledge that affects my community. This research should be understandable to the people it's about. If you can't explain your ideas clearly, maybe your ideas aren't as good as you think they are.

**Bottom line:** Cognitive Liberation research needs to be redone with proper neurodivergent inclusion, or it's just more knowledge about neurotypical people disguised as universal truth.
