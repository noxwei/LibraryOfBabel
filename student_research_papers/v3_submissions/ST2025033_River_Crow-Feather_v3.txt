## Land & Relationship

In many Indigenous knowledge systems, understanding emerges through relationship—not just intellectual relationship, but embodied relationship that involves the whole person in connection with land, community, ancestors, and future generations. As I approach Decolonial Methodology from this perspective, I'm called to consider how my inquiry itself participates in the web of relationships that constitute knowledge.

Traditional Knowledge Holders have always understood that research is ceremony. It requires proper protocols, acknowledgment of responsibilities, and awareness of how knowledge moves through communities across generations. Western academic frameworks often abstract Decolonial Methodology from these relational contexts, treating it as an object that can be studied in isolation. But Indigenous methodologies invite us to consider how Decolonial Methodology lives within relationships and how our understanding of it must be accountable to those relationships.

From my conversations with community Elders and Knowledge Keepers, several important principles emerge for approaching Decolonial Methodology in a good way:

**Reciprocity**: Research should give back to the communities that contribute to knowledge creation. How does our investigation of Decolonial Methodology serve the needs and priorities that communities have identified for themselves?

**Responsibility**: We are accountable not only to academic institutions but to the living systems—human and more-than-human—that our research affects. What are our obligations to future generations in how we approach Decolonial Methodology?

**Respect**: Traditional protocols guide how knowledge is shared, with whom, and under what circumstances. Not all knowledge about Decolonial Methodology is meant to be public or extracted from its cultural context.

**Relevance**: The questions we ask should matter to the communities most affected by Decolonial Methodology. Academic curiosity alone is not sufficient justification for research.

These principles challenge the extractive tendencies of colonial research practices. Instead of taking knowledge about Decolonial Methodology from communities, we are invited into relationships of mutual learning that can serve collective healing and empowerment.

The stories my Grandmothers tell remind me that Decolonial Methodology has always been with us, taking different forms in different times but carrying forward the teachings we need for survival and flourishing. Western science is beginning to catch up to what Indigenous peoples have always known about Decolonial Methodology, but the challenge is integration without appropriation—learning to weave different knowledge systems together in ways that honor their distinct contributions.
