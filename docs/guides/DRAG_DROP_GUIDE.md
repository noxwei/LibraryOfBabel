## 🔔 **Notification System**

### **What You'll See:**

1. **📚 Processing Started:**
   ```
   📚 Processing: example-book.epub
   LibraryOfBabel started processing your ebook
   ```

2. **✅ Processing Complete:**
   ```
   ✅ Complete: example-book.epub  
   Ebook successfully added to knowledge base
   ```

3. **❌ Processing Failed:**
   ```
   ❌ Failed: example-book.epub
   Ebook processing failed - check logs
   ```

## 📁 **Folder Structure**

Your ebooks are automatically organized:

```
ebooks/
├── downloads/          # 📥 DROP EPUBS HERE
├── processed/          # ✅ Successfully processed books
├── failed/            # ❌ Books that failed processing  
├── large_files/       # 📏 Files >50MB (skipped for size)
└── torrents/          # 🌱 Torrent files for seeding
```

**Workflow:**
1. **Drop EPUB** → `downloads/`
2. **Auto-processing** → PostgreSQL database + search indexes
3. **Success** → moves to `processed/`
4. **Failure** → moves to `failed/` (check logs)
