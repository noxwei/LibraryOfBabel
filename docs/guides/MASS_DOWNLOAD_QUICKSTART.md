# Mass Download System - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ **For Future Agents: How to Use the Integrated Download System**

This guide provides a quick reference for AI agents working with the Babel's Archive + LibraryOfBabel integration.

## ðŸ“‹ **System Status Check**

```bash
# Check if both systems are running
curl http://localhost:8181/api/health  # Babel's Archive
curl http://localhost:5560/api/health  # LibraryOfBabel

# Check audiobook database
cd /Users/weixiangzhang/Local\ Dev/LibraryOfBabel
sqlite3 database/data/audiobook_ebook_tracker.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audiobooks;"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Priority Download Workflow**

### **Step 1: Process Reading Completion Data**
```bash
# Update database with completed books
python3 process_reading_completion.py

# Check completion statistics
sqlite3 database/data/audiobook_ebook_tracker.db "
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_books,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN is_completed = 1 THEN 1 END) as completed_books
FROM audiobooks;"
```

### **Step 2: Run Mass Download**
```bash
# Start mass download (default 800 books limit)
python3 mass_download_orchestrator.py

# Monitor progress
tail -f mass_download_*.log
```

### **Step 3: Verify Processing**
```bash
# Check downloads directory
ls -la ../babels-archive/downloads/

# Check LibraryOfBabel processing
python3 src/automated_ebook_processor.py

# Verify database ingestion
python3 database/schema/ingest_data.py
```

## ðŸ“Š **Key Files and Their Purposes**

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `process_reading_completion.py` | Parse reading history, update database | When user provides reading completion data |
| `mass_download_orchestrator.py` | Coordinate bulk downloads | To download priority books automatically |
| `completed_books_download_queue.json` | Priority download list | Generated automatically, shows what to download |
| `src/automated_ebook_processor.py` | Auto-process EPUBs | Runs automatically or manually trigger |
| `database/schema/ingest_data.py` | Ingest processed books into PostgreSQL | Final step to make books searchable |

## ðŸ”§ **Configuration Options**

### **Download Limits**
```python
# Adjust download capacity (default 800)
orchestrator = MassDownloadOrchestrator(max_downloads=500)
```

### **Priority Levels**
```sql
-- Check priority books
SELECT title, author, date_completed 
FROM audiobooks 
WHERE reading_priority = 1 
ORDER BY date_completed;
```

### **API Endpoints**
```python
# Default endpoints
babel_archive_api = "http://localhost:8181/api"
library_api = "http://localhost:5560/api"
```

## ðŸš¨ **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **"No books matched"**
- Check reading data format: `Date Started    Date Finished    Title`
- Verify audiobook database: `sqlite3 database/data/audiobook_ebook_tracker.db .tables`
- Adjust matching threshold in `process_reading_completion.py`

### **"Download API errors"**
- Ensure Babel's Archive is running: `curl http://localhost:8181/api/health`
- Check if rate limit reached: Look for "403" errors in logs
- Verify network connectivity and timeouts

### **"Processing failures"**
- Check disk space: Downloads can be large
- Verify PostgreSQL is running: `pg_isready`
- Ensure EPUB processing pipeline is functional

## ðŸ“ˆ **Success Metrics**

### **Expected Performance**
- **Matching Rate**: 30-40% of reading history should match audiobook collection
- **Download Success**: >90% of found books should download successfully
- **Processing Speed**: ~0.12 seconds per book for EPUB processing
- **API Response**: <100ms for search, <30s for download initiation

### **Monitor These Statistics**
```python
# From mass_download_orchestrator.py logs
{
  'total_requested': X,
  'successful_downloads': Y,
  'failed_downloads': Z,
  'books_not_found': W,
  'success_rate': (Y/X * 100)
}
```

## ðŸ”„ **Automated Workflow for Future Use**

### **For New Reading Data**
1. User provides reading completion list
2. Run `process_reading_completion.py`
3. Run `mass_download_orchestrator.py`
4. System automatically processes downloads
5. Books become searchable in LibraryOfBabel

### **For Expanding Collection**
1. Adjust download limits based on daily capacity
2. Process non-priority books in background
3. Monitor and maintain optimal performance
4. Scale processing pipeline as needed

## ðŸŽ¯ **Integration Benefits**

### **For Users**
- Reading history drives intelligent book acquisition
- Completed books get priority processing
- Seamless research workflow across platforms

### **For AI Agents**
- Access to user's proven high-value content
- Enhanced search across completed reading
- Knowledge graph connections between books

### **For System Performance**
- Efficient resource utilization
- Rate limit compliance
- Scalable architecture for growth

## ðŸ“š **Next Steps After Setup**

1. **Verify Search Capabilities**: Test semantic search across processed books
2. **Enable AI Agents**: Activate Reddit Bibliophile with completed book collection
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track processing speed and success rates
4. **Scale Gradually**: Increase download limits as system proves stable
