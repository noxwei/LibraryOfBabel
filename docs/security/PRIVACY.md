# üîí Privacy & Data Protection

## Overview

The LibraryOfBabel project includes AI agents that may process personal information during development and operation. This document outlines our privacy protection measures and data handling practices.

## Protected Information

### üö´ **Automatically Git-Ignored (Never Committed)**

#### User Personal Data
- Real names and personal identifiers
- User profiles and biographical information  
- Personal notes and private communications
- Social media handles and personal details
- Location information and personal addresses

#### Agent Performance Data
- HR analytics and performance reviews
- Individual agent interaction logs
- User session data and request history
- Workforce assessment reports
- Personal feedback and evaluations

#### Database Content
- PostgreSQL dumps containing personal data
- User tables and agent interaction logs
- HR data exports and analytics reports
- Any database backup with personal information

### üìÅ **Protected Directories & Files**

```
# HR and Performance Data
reports/hr_analytics/
agents/hr/reports/
*comprehensive_hr_report*.json
*workforce_registry*.json

# Agent Personal Logs
agents/*/logs/
agents/*/personal_data/
agents/*/user_profiles/
agents/*/memory/
agents/*/conversations/

# Name-based Files
*wei_maybe_foucault*.json
*weixiangzhang*.json

## Data Handling Principles

### üè† **Local-First Architecture**
- **All personal data stored locally** - Never transmitted to external services
- **PostgreSQL database local only** - No cloud storage of personal information
- **Agent memory stays local** - Conversation history and learning data remains on-device

### üîê **Privacy by Design**
- **Minimal data collection** - Only collect data necessary for functionality
- **Automatic anonymization** - Remove personal identifiers from logs when possible
- **Granular gitignore** - Comprehensive protection against accidental commits

### üõ°Ô∏è **Access Control**
- **Database authentication** - PostgreSQL user-level access control
- **File system permissions** - Protected directories with appropriate permissions
- **API key protection** - No personal data in API responses

## Specific Protection Measures

### HR System (Linda Zhang)
- **Performance reviews** - Individual agent assessments remain private
- **User interaction logs** - Detailed request/response data not committed
- **Cultural assessments** - Bilingual feedback and personal notes protected
- **Workforce analytics** - Aggregate data only, no individual identification

### Agent Development
- **Learning data** - Agent memory and adaptation data stays local
- **User context** - Personal preferences and interaction patterns protected
- **Conversation history** - Full interaction logs excluded from version control
- **Debug information** - Development logs with personal data filtered out

### User Information
- **Profile data** - Complete user profile (education, background, etc.) protected
- **Reading habits** - Book preferences and reading history kept private
- **Search queries** - User search patterns and interests not tracked externally
- **Performance data** - User productivity metrics remain confidential

## Compliance & Standards

### üåê **Privacy Regulations**
- **GDPR-like practices** - Right to privacy and data protection
- **Local data sovereignty** - All data remains under user control
- **No external transmission** - Personal data never leaves local environment

### üìä **Data Lifecycle**
- **Collection minimization** - Only necessary data collected
- **Purpose limitation** - Data used only for intended functionality
- **Storage limitation** - Regular cleanup of unnecessary personal data
- **Accuracy maintenance** - User control over personal information updates

## Developer Guidelines

### ‚úÖ **Safe Practices**
- **Run privacy check before commits**: `./scripts/privacy_check.sh`
- Always check gitignore before commits involving user data
- Use environment variables for any personal configuration
- Implement fallback systems that don't expose personal information
- Regular review of logs and data files for personal information

### üîç **Privacy Check Script**
```bash
# Run before every commit to ensure no personal data leakage
./scripts/privacy_check.sh

# If issues found, resolve before committing:
git reset HEAD <file>          # Remove from staging
echo "file" >> .gitignore      # Add to gitignore
./scripts/privacy_check.sh     # Re-run check
```

### ‚ùå **Avoid These Actions**
- Never commit files with real names or personal details
- Don't hardcode personal information in source code
- Avoid logging sensitive user data without protection
- Don't export database content that includes personal information

## Future Considerations

### üîÆ **Scalability Planning**
- **Multi-user support** - Row-level security ready for expansion
- **Cloud deployment options** - Encryption and anonymization for cloud scenarios
- **Third-party integrations** - Privacy-preserving API design
- **Data portability** - User control over data export and deletion

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Enhancements**
- **Encryption at rest** - Database-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Audit trails** - Privacy-preserving access logging
- **Automated anonymization** - Scripts to strip personal data from exports
- **Privacy dashboard** - User interface for privacy control

## Contact & Questions

For privacy-related questions or concerns about data handling in the LibraryOfBabel project:

- Review this documentation and gitignore files
- Check agent code for data collection practices  
- Ensure local-only deployment for personal use
- Implement additional protection measures as needed
