# 🔐 Deployment Security Guide

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES**

This guide contains **SANITIZED** information for public repositories. Follow these security practices:

### ✅ **What's Safe in Public Repo**
- ✅ Architecture and code structure
- ✅ Configuration templates with placeholders
- ✅ General setup instructions
- ✅ Security best practices

### ❌ **What Should NEVER Be Committed**
- ❌ Actual domain names
- ❌ Seeker mode keys/passwords
- ❌ Cloudflare credentials
- ❌ API endpoints or server IPs
- ❌ Environment files with real values

## 🔧 **Secure Deployment Steps**

### **1. Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Copy template and configure with your real values
cp babel-backend/.env.production.example babel-backend/.env.production

# Edit with your actual configuration (NEVER commit this file)
nano babel-backend/.env.production
```

### **2. Domain Configuration**
```bash
# Set your actual domains in production environment
PRIMARY_DOMAIN=your-actual-domain.com
SECONDARY_DOMAIN=your-other-domain.com
SEEKER_MODE_KEY=your_unique_secret_key_here
```

### **3. Cloudflare Setup**
- Follow cloudflare-setup.md instructions
- Replace placeholder domains with your actual domains
- Keep tunnel credentials secure and local only

### **4. Production Security Checklist**
- [ ] Environment variables configured with real values
- [ ] Seeker mode key is unique and secure
- [ ] CORS configured for your actual domains
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS enforced through Cloudflare
- [ ] Firewall configured on Mac Mini
- [ ] Logs configured but not exposing sensitive data

### **5. Server Hardening**
```bash
# Set proper file permissions
chmod 600 babel-backend/.env.production
chmod 600 ~/.cloudflared/config.yml

# Ensure only authorized users can access production files
chown -R your-user:your-group babel-backend/
```

## 🎯 **Access Control**

### **Public Access**
- Regular Library of Babel experience
- Educational procedural generation
- No sensitive content exposed

### **Seeker Mode Access**
- Activated with `?seekermode=YOUR_SECRET_KEY`
- Enhanced features and real content access
- Logged for monitoring purposes

### **Domain-Specific Security**
- Each domain isolated in configuration
- Separate theming and feature sets
- Independent security configurations

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

### **🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY PROTOCOL: MANDATORY LOCAL TESTING**

**GOLDEN RULE: DO NOT DEPLOY UNTIL LOCAL TESTING IS COMPLETE**

Before ANY production deployment:
1. ✅ **LOCAL TESTING FIRST** - All changes MUST work locally
2. ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE LOCAL VERIFICATION** - Test all endpoints on localhost
3. ✅ **DATABASE FIXES VERIFIED LOCALLY** - Run test suites locally
4. ✅ **PAGINATION CONFIRMED LOCALLY** - Verify Page 1 ≠ Page 2 locally
5. ✅ **ONLY THEN** → Proceed to production deployment

**This prevents:**
- Production failures
- Security vulnerabilities from untested code
- Broken deployments
- Wasted time debugging in production

### **Secure Deployment Standards**

The production system is designed to be secure by default:
- **MANDATORY local testing before deployment**
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure defaults for all settings
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

**Remember: Security through obscurity is not security. Use proper authentication, authorization, and monitoring. NEVER deploy untested code.**
