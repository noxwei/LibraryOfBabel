# üîê Deployment Security Guide

## üö® **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES**

This guide contains **SANITIZED** information for public repositories. Follow these security practices:

### ‚úÖ **What's Safe in Public Repo**
- ‚úÖ Architecture and code structure
- ‚úÖ Configuration templates with placeholders
- ‚úÖ General setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Security best practices

### ‚ùå **What Should NEVER Be Committed**
- ‚ùå Actual domain names
- ‚ùå Seeker mode keys/passwords
- ‚ùå Cloudflare credentials
- ‚ùå API endpoints or server IPs
- ‚ùå Environment files with real values

## üîß **Secure Deployment Steps**

### **1. Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Copy template and configure with your real values
cp babel-backend/.env.production.example babel-backend/.env.production

# Edit with your actual configuration (NEVER commit this file)
nano babel-backend/.env.production
```

### **2. Domain Configuration**
```bash
# Set your actual domains in production environment
PRIMARY_DOMAIN=your-actual-domain.com
SECONDARY_DOMAIN=your-other-domain.com
SEEKER_MODE_KEY=your_unique_secret_key_here
```

### **3. Cloudflare Setup**
- Follow cloudflare-setup.md instructions
- Replace placeholder domains with your actual domains
- Keep tunnel credentials secure and local only

### **4. Production Security Checklist**
- [ ] Environment variables configured with real values
- [ ] Seeker mode key is unique and secure
- [ ] CORS configured for your actual domains
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS enforced through Cloudflare
- [ ] Firewall configured on Mac Mini
- [ ] Logs configured but not exposing sensitive data

### **5. Server Hardening**
```bash
# Set proper file permissions
chmod 600 babel-backend/.env.production
chmod 600 ~/.cloudflared/config.yml

# Ensure only authorized users can access production files
chown -R your-user:your-group babel-backend/
```

## üéØ **Access Control**

### **Public Access**
- Regular Library of Babel experience
- Educational procedural generation
- No sensitive content exposed

### **Seeker Mode Access**
- Activated with `?seekermode=YOUR_SECRET_KEY`
- Enhanced features and real content access
- Logged for monitoring purposes

### **Domain-Specific Security**
- Each domain isolated in configuration
- Separate theming and feature sets
- Independent security configurations

## üöÄ **Production Deployment**

The production system is designed to be secure by default:
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure defaults for all settings
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

**Remember: Security through obscurity is not security. Use proper authentication, authorization, and monitoring.**
