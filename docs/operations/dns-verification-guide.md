# DNS Verification Alternative for Let's Encrypt

Since port 80 isn't forwarded, let's use DNS verification instead.

## Steps:

1. **Stop the current certbot process** (Ctrl+C in the certbot terminal)
2. **Stop the verification server** (Ctrl+C in the verification server terminal)
3. **Use DNS verification** instead:

```bash
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d api.ashortstayinhell.com --email admin@ashortstayinhell.com --agree-tos --no-eff-email --config-dir "/Users/weixiangzhang/Local Dev/LibraryOfBabel/ssl/letsencrypt-config" --work-dir "/Users/weixiangzhang/Local Dev/LibraryOfBabel/ssl/letsencrypt-work" --logs-dir "/Users/weixiangzhang/Local Dev/LibraryOfBabel/ssl/letsencrypt-logs"
```

This will ask you to add a TXT record to your DNS instead of serving a file on port 80.

## DNS TXT Record Steps:
1. Certbot will show you a TXT record to add
2. Add it to your hover.com DNS: `Type: TXT, Host: _acme-challenge.api, Value: [provided value]`
3. Wait for DNS propagation
4. Press Enter in certbot

This method doesn't require any port forwarding!
