## 🐛 **Issues Identified & Recommendations**

### **Seeker Mode Bug (Critical):**
- **Issue**: `the_librarian_who_knows` returns HTTP 500 error
- **Error**: `'str' object has no attribute 'get'`
- **Impact**: Enhanced librarian analysis unavailable
- **Fix Priority**: HIGH - seeker mode would unlock advanced insights

### **Performance Optimizations:**
1. **Response Time**: Consider async queries and connection pooling
2. **Caching**: Implement result caching for repeated queries
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Dynamic adjustment based on query complexity
4. **Batch Processing**: Test concurrent search capabilities

## 📈 **Data Visualization Analysis**

Created comprehensive performance charts showing:
- **Response Time**: Quest domain consistently faster (red vs blue bars)
- **Similarity Distribution**: Beautiful normal curve centered at 0.58
- **Performance Trends**: Quantum metaphysics gets highest similarity scores
- **Success Rate**: Perfect 50/50 split (both domains 100% reliable)

The visualization clearly shows Quest domain's speed advantage while maintaining identical similarity quality!
