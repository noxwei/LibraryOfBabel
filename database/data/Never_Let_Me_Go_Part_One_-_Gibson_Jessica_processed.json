      "content": "“HEY, GRACE, YOU READY TO roll? I don’t want to go and have all the hot guys snatched up by skanks before we even get there,” Faith complained, banging on the bathroom door. “Geez, I’ll be out in a second. Don’t get your panties in a bunch,” I yelled, trying not to smudge the eyeliner I was applying. I heard her grumble something as she walked away. Faith and I looked a lot alike; we both had long blonde hair and brown eyes, but she was about two inches taller than me and drop dead gorgeous. It used to bug me; but now I tell her she got all the height, but I got all the boobs. We went out every Friday night, mostly for fun, but I was always looking for Mr. Right. What I would do if I actually found him—I didn’t know for sure. Tonight we were headed into the city to see what kind of trouble we could find. Faith, of course, was slutting it up, dressed in a micro mini dress that barely covered her lady bits. She had a model’s frame, long and lean, and she could wear whatever she wanted. I, on the other hand, dressed a bit more conservative and made sure my skirts landed no shorter than three inches above my knee. I didn’t feel comfortable on display for all to see. I needed my cardigans and longer skirts. We hit the town running, and in no time, we were sitting in a The Violet Hour, a swanky lounge, surrounded by some serious eye candy. Faith was already off hitting on some hot guy at the other end of the bar, leaning in close as they spoke. Her hand on his bicep, a playful look in her eyes. Pure Faith. I shook my head; she was shameless when it came to getting some. I was sitting by myself, sipping some fruity, girly drink with an obscene name like “Screaming Orgasm” or something. “Can I join you?” a warm voice asked from behind me. I turned around and had to look up because the man was a lot taller than me, even on a barstool. My breath caught in my throat— he oozed confidence and sex appeal. Dressed in a navy suit, he was by far the most attractive man in the bar. I chewed my lip nervously, why would he want to sit with me when there were so many beautiful women ready to throw themselves at him? “Please do.” I smiled at him and took a big gulp of my drink before smoothing my skirt down over my knees “Scotch, neat,” he said to the bartender before turning to me. “Logan.” He took my hand in his and brushed his lips across my knuckles. “Grace.” My heart beat a little faster as he released my hand. I could still feel the tingle of where his lips had been. I was for sure out of my element here. “Are you from here?” he asked casually, his green eyes studying me. His finger tapped against the edge of his glass. “Yeah, born and raised. What about you?” “Here on business.” He didn’t elaborate further. I sighed inwardly, of course he wasn’t from here. He was too good to be true. Logan intrigued me. He was not the typical guy I normally went for. I liked surfer-looking guys; yeah, I know, Chicago was not exactly on the coast, but we all had a type. Logan was sexy as hell, though, his tan skin and dark hair perfectly styled in the Mad Men style that all the guys seemed to be wearing these days. “How long are you here for?” I hoped he’d say at least a week. “I fly out tomorrow afternoon.” He set his drink down next to mine and our hands touched. It was electric. Whatever this was that was happening between us, it needed to be explored, and now. Something about him brought out the shameless side of me, like I had no control. He was making me crazy. This wasn’t me. This was Faith. Maybe the fact that this couldn’t go anywhere was making me brave. I slipped forward a bit on my bar stool, letting my legs touch his. “Tell me something about yourself, Logan.” He shook his head. “Nothing personal, this is just about tonight.” His eyes smoldered. He clearly felt exactly what I was feeling Nothing personal. Could I do that? Go into this without knowing anything about him? I watched as he brought his drink to his lips again. How he savored the scotch. My nerves were like live wires. I had a sudden insane thought that I wanted him to savor me like he did the scotch. “Fine, I’ll go first. I like kittens more than puppies, my favorite TV show is Friends, and I love wearing heels, but my feet hate me for it. Now you go.” Logan grinned at me. “I happen to love kittens, too. Only a monster would pick puppies over kittens.” Oh, God, I was in serious trouble. “My favorite TV show is Pawn Stars. I know it’s not The Wire or some other manly show, but I like to know how much things cost.” He shrugged. I laughed and motioned for him to continue. “I’ve never tried to wear high heels, but I can imagine they would not be pleasant for your feet. I prefer wearing dress shoes to sneakers; I like to be put together and sneakers, outside of the gym, feel sloppy.” He took another sip of his drink. I watched him swallow and took a shaky breath. “I believe it’s your turn.” He was watching me, again. The look in his eyes was unnerving, like he wanted to consume me whole. “What do you want to know?” I fidgeted in my seat. “Are you single?” “I thought we weren’t getting personal?” “So, don't answer then,” he challenged, an amused twinkle in his eyes. “Yes, I’m single. Are you?” I hadn’t meant to answer, but he seemed to be able to illicit a lot of things from me I didn’t mean to do. He smirked. “Yes.” We chatted for another hour before I reached my patience limit. He apparently had, too. “Let’s get out of here.” His hand was at the small of my back, scooting me off my stool. “I need to find my sister and tell her I’m leaving.” I scanned the bar for Faith. She was still with the guy she found at the beginning of the night. She was perched on his lap, her arms wrapped around him. Logan and I walked toward her and, once we made eye contact, I nodded toward the door and held up my hand in a wave. Faith winked at me and made the ‘call me’ hand motion. Once we were outside, the reality of the situation hit me. Was I really going to sleep with a man I barely knew? That was Faith, not me. As if he read my mind, Logan spoke up. “We don't have to do anything you don’t want to do, Grace. Come with me to my hotel; we can order room service and watch a movie or something.” I hesitated. This was getting real, not just a conversation in a bar with a sexy stranger. He grabbed my hand and pressed my fingers to his lips. “Say you’ll come?” he whispered against my skin. “Why me?” I needed to know. I needed to hear that it was because he was feeling what I was feeling and not just because he was looking for an easy lay. “Why not you? You’re attractive, I’m attractive. I want you, and I can tell that you want me, too.” He stepped closer. I nodded. “I’ll come.” He grinned again and kissed my cheek. “Come on, my driver is just down here.” He held my hand on his arm and we walked together to the sleek black town car idling on the street in front of the bar. We drove to his hotel in silence, my heart racing as I sat close to Logan, my leg pressed against his. The heat of him against my thigh made my pulse race. I was lost in thought, wondering if this was the right decision—at war with myself. Almost all of me wanted to be in the car with him, but there was a teeny part that screamed for me to see that this was crazy. I hadn’t even told Faith his name, or where we were going. What if he was a serial killer and I ended up chopped into little pieces and stuffed in the mini fridge? I gave myself a mental shake, these were not the thoughts I needed to be having. “Grace? Are you coming?” He was standing outside the car, his navy slacks and white shirt looked impeccable, even after sitting in the bar and then the car. When had the car stopped? “Yeah.” I slid across the seat and took his hand, letting him help me out of the car. I didn’t notice the name of the hotel until we walked through the lobby where Waldorf Astoria was written on everything. When we got into the elevator, Logan pulled out his key card and slipped it into the slot. “You don’t have to push a floor button?” I was clearly not used to ritzy hotels. Logan shook his head, a smile on his lips. “No, no buttons.” The tone of his voice curled around my ears like silk. He was smooth, too good at this. I was out of my league. He erased the space between us and backed me against the wall of the elevator. His lips were on mine before I could think. His hands came up to fist in my hair and he pulled me closer into him. He let out a groan as my tongue licked at his lower lip. The elevator opened and we stepped apart, both breathing heavy. I gasped as we stepped into the room. This was too much. I put a hand on the wall, hoping to steady myself, but it didn’t work. “Just how rich are you?” I looked around the room in wonder. “That’s a relative term.” His eyes never left mine. Not a hint of embarrassment. This was a man who was proud of what he had accomplished. I frowned. “I think I’m going to go with very rich.” “That’s a fair assessment.” He stepped toward me. I held up a hand. “Hold up a second. I need to get my bearings, here.” I needed to catch my breath before he got me out of my dress and on my back. Not that it would be horrible for that to happen, but I wanted to slow this train down. He walked forward anyway, and kissed me softly. “I told you before, Grace, nothing happens unless you say it does. It doesn’t have to go further than kissing, although I hope it does. I can only imagine how your body looks under that dress.” He bit his lip and looked me over, hungrily. “Are you on the pill?” I nodded. “Good. I’m clean. I assume you are as well?” I nodded again, my voice had decided to leave me all alone in this line of questioning. There was that predatory look again, it did something to my stomach when he looked at me like that. “Where’s the bathroom?” I squeaked. He pointed in the general direction and I fled to safety behind a locked door. I leaned my back against it taking a few cleansing breaths. My hands shook as I turned the water on so I could splash some on my face. Holy hell, what had I gotten myself into? My last sexual encounter had been months ago, another failed relationship under my belt. One-night stands weren’t my thing. I looked at myself in the mirror, my nervousness evident by the anxious look in my eyes. “You can do this, Grace. It’s just sex,” I said aloud as I straightened my dress. I blew out a breath and went out into the lion’s den to find Logan. He was standing in the living room area of the huge penthouse. He had taken off his jacket and tie and now stood before me with a half unbuttoned shirt and bare feet. I tried my hardest not to drool, but he had the body of a god. All hard lines and rippling muscles, I just wanted to stroke him. “Are you comfortable in that?” He gestured to my tight dress and sky high heels. “Not really; but it’s not like I packed a change of clothes in this.” I held up the teeny little clutch that barely fit a cell phone and lipstick but looked so cute with my dress. “You can wear one of my shirts, if you want.” He stepped toward me. “Okay.” I couldn’t make myself say more, my mouth was suddenly as dry as the Sahara. “Come on.” He walked ahead of me into the biggest bedroom I had ever seen. There was a chandelier over the bed, a chandelier! Who has that in their hotel room? “Pick what you want from the drawers.” I expected him to walk out, but he sat on the bed and watched me. I rummaged through the drawers and found a black tank top undershirt and a pair of boxers that looked like they wouldn’t be too awful on me. “Let me help you with your dress.” He was right behind me; I could feel his breath on my neck. He slid the zipper down slowly, kissing the skin he exposed as it went down my back. I knew I should tell him to stop, but I couldn’t make myself say the words. I felt my dress hit the ground around my feet and he straightened up behind me. His fingers trailed along the column of my neck raising goosebumps as he went. “Do you want me to stop?” he whispered in my ear. I didn’t; far from it. I wanted him, all of him. “No, don’t stop.” I leaned my head back against him, my voice a hoarse whisper. He spun me around and trailed his fingers up my sides. “On the bed.” His voice was thick with need. I walked backward until the back of my knees hit the bed falling back. I watched as he unbuttoned his jeans and slipped them off. Mouthwatering, there was no other way to describe him. He was perfect; and I planned on spending a good amount of time licking every perfect inch of him. His hands were everywhere at once. He knew just where to touch me. I was putty in his experienced hands. “Tell me what you want,” he demanded. “Just you, only you.” I was desperate for him. I pulled his mouth down to mine and took what I wanted. Logan was insatiable; he took me places I had never been, made me feel things I didn't think were possible. Just when I thought I was done, he pushed for more. “Oh Kitten, we’re not even close to done.” He grinned wickedly and crushed his mouth against mine. He angled his hips in a way that hit every sensitive spot at once and I bit my lip to keep from screaming his name. I knew it at that moment, he had just ruined me for anyone else. Later, we snuggled under the covers and watched a movie. “I wish you weren’t leaving tomorrow.” I voiced the one thing I swore I wouldn’t. “I’m starting to regret my choice to be in Paris tomorrow night. If I could delay the trip, I would.” He kissed me. “Paris, huh? I’ve never been. I’ve never really been anywhere.” “I like Paris well enough; but Greece, that is one of my favorite places. The islands are breathtaking.” He stroked his hand through my hair. “Sounds like heaven.” I smiled into his chest. “It is one of the only places I've ever been where I can just be. Does that make sense?” Something in his tone gave me pause. I wouldn’t call it sad, but it was akin to it. “Sort of.” “When you have money, people tend to expect things from you. Your life isn't always your own.” His eyes took on a distant look. “Sounds kind of lonely.” I scooted closer, touching his cheek. “What makes you say that?” He looked down at me intently. “You didn’t mention any family.” “I assumed family was not a topic we would be discussing.” His lips pressed into a firm line. “Why? You know I have a sister; hell, you saw her. I have two other sisters, as well.” “Family is personal; this is just about tonight, right?” I wanted to tell him no—that it wasn't just about tonight for me, anymore. That I wanted to know him, know everything about him. “Yeah, just tonight.” It broke my heart into little pieces to say the words. He opened his mouth to say something, and I willed him to say the words I wanted to hear. They never came. I knew what this was, maybe that’s all I deserved. We watched three movies and a few infomercials; and before I knew it, the sun was starting to peek through the curtains. We had stayed up all night talking, kissing, and laughing. I stifled a yawn and lay back against him. “You should sleep,” he whispered. “No, I’m not tired.” I yawned and stretched like a cat. The last thing I wanted to do was waste the few hours we had left on sleeping. If I only got him for one night, I needed it to last. “Kitten, you can barely keep your eyes open. Sleep now, I need to jump in the shower. I’ll wake you before I leave.” He kissed me, lingering for a moment against my lips. I lay back against the pillow and listened to him start the shower in the next room. I debated on whether to sleep or join him. Joining him won out. If I was never going to see him again, I wanted as many memories as I could pack in. I let his shirt fall to the ground as I stepped into the steamy room. Logan was already lathering up, I could see him silhouetted in the steamed glass. He was facing away from me when I stepped in behind him, running my hands along the hard muscles of his back. “You should be sleeping.” I could hear the smile in his voice. “Do you want me to go?” I trailed kisses across his shoulders. “I didn’t say that.” He turned around slowly, water cascading down his chest. He took my hands and pulled me against him. Gone were the sweet kisses from before. His lips were hungry and insistent. He was going to devour me, and I was going to let him. Logan had me pressed against the tile, his hands soaping up every inch of me. “Are you ready for this, baby?” he growled. There was nothing slow or gentle this time. It was all about need. The only sounds in the room were the running water and our ragged breathing. I was wrapped in one of those white courtesy robes, curled up on the bed watching Logan get dressed. He was standing in front of me in just boxers and an undershirt, his suit laid out on the bed next to me. I couldn’t bear to watch him leave, so I got dressed quickly and stood by the door watching as he buttoned his shirt. “Don’t go, yet.” He was next to me in a second, his hand on my arm. “Make me stay then.” My eyes pleaded with him. I needed to be good enough for him. Not just another notch in his belt. I needed a shred of hope, for him to even just ask for my number. Something so I would know we would speak again at some point in the future. “Grace…don’t.” He pulled me into his arms, squeezing me tightly to him. I kissed him one last time, pulling myself from his arms and walked out of the room into the waiting elevator. The tears that had been threatening to fall streamed down my face the second the doors closed. I was stupid to let myself dream about a future with a man I had just met. He had been clear from the start, it was only the one night. I was the one who tried to change the rules. My hands shook as I texted Faith. Seeing the words on the screen drove a dagger into my already wounded heart. This has been a mistake. When the elevator opened, I prayed he would be standing in front of it begging me not to leave. Once again, I was let down. I pulled myself together long enough to hail a cab in front of the hotel; the poor driver didn’t know what to do with me. I could barely get my address out in between sobs. Faith was waiting for me at the curb. “Oh, honey.” She hugged me, letting me pour out everything I was feeling. “So, he just let you leave?” “Uh huh,” I replied glumly. By the time I had finally calmed down enough to tell her everything, we were sitting at our dining room table drinking coffee. “This is why I don’t do one-night stands. I'm not made for them.” I shook my head. “You feel too much for them. Your heart is too open. You’re looking for something that you’ll never find in a one-night stand.” She patted my hand. “Never let me do this, again.” “Was the sex good at least?” I laughed. Only Faith would ask me that in the middle of my crying fit. “Soooo good. The man knows his way around the female body. I just wish I knew his last name.",

      "content": "MOVING ON WAS NOT AS easy as it sounded. I tried my hardest to forget about Logan. He was burned into my memory—his touch, the way his lips felt against mine. I could still smell him on the dress I had worn that night. I hadn't been able to bring myself to wash it yet. It hung on a hanger in my closet, a lone reminder of the best night of my life The piece of my heart I would never get back. “That’s it. Get out of those sweats and stop moping. It’s been a month, Grace,” Faith reminded me, standing in the doorway to my room with her hands on her hips. “Leave me alone. I don’t care that it’s been a month, I wouldn’t care if it was a year. I’m sad, and I’ll be sad as long as I want to.” I turned away from her, putting my pillow over my face. “It was a one-night stand, not a relationship. Get over it and move on.” Her tone was gentle, but I could hear the impatience underneath it. “I know what it was; that doesn’t stop me from feeling the pain.” “You need to be showered and dressed in an hour, your date will be here to pick you up a little after that.” I shot up in bed. “What!” “Your date. I set you up with a friend of a friend. He’s cute, and nice, I think you’ll like him.” Her tone was like fake sugar, sweet with a bad aftertaste. “Call and cancel it.” I hopped out of bed in search of the phone. “No,” she refused, looking me square in the eye. “I’m not going to go, so either call and cancel or go on the date yourself.” My chin jutted out in defiance. “You’re putting me in a bad spot here.” She popped her hip against the doorjamb and studied me. “I couldn’t care less, Faith, I didn’t ask to be set up. As far as I’m concerned, you put yourself in this spot not me.” I folded my arms across my chest. She scowled at me, “Fine, I’ll cancel it, but you need to start living again.” She pointed a finger at me and stamped her foot. I knew in my heart she was right. Life couldn’t stop because of Logan. “I’m going to Hope’s, I’ll be back later.” I left the apartment. Faith was irritated, but I couldn’t stand her constant judgment. Only I could decide how to live my life. I didn’t need her to badger me about everything. Our sister, Hope, was the oldest of the DeLeo children, Faith was next, then me, and finally our younger sister Charity. Hope and I had always gotten along, she understood me better than Faith did. She was also closer to my temperament; Faith and Charity were more outgoing than we were. We all looked like different versions of the same person, blond hair, and dark eyes inherited from our mother, Love DeLeo. Faith and I lived in the heart of Chicago, smack dab in the middle of the city. We shared an apartment because neither of us could stand to live alone for longer than a month. The better choice would have been to live with Hope, but she had gotten married a few years back, and her husband frowned upon that idea. Thirty minutes after I left my place, I was knocking on Hope’s door. John, her husband, opened the door for me. He was handsome, but I never could see him as anything but a brother. Tall and broad shouldered with light blond hair and green eyes. He was a fireman in the city. “Faith at you again?” He pulled me into a hug. “Something like that. Is Hope around?” “She’s upstairs with the baby, go on up.” I followed the sounds of giggles and splashing to the bathroom just up the stairs. Hope was seated on the side of the big tub with water spots covering her clothing and hair. My adorable nephew Grayson was making a mess in the tub. “Hey.” I leaned against the counter and grinned at Grayson. At only ten months old, he had all of us wrapped up in a neat bow—we were his for life. She glanced at my pajamas and messy hair and smiled. “I take it Faith was not successful in setting you up then?” “She was not. Did everyone know about it but me?” “Well, not everyone. She didn’t tell Charity.” She smothered a smile. “Charity is in England, it wouldn’t matter even if she did know.” I picked at the label on a bottle of soda. “She’s worried about you, that’s all. We all are, honey.” I sighed. “I know you guys are. I’ve been trying to figure it all out. Logan’s gone, I know he is. I’m just confused, I don't know what I want.” “You don’t have to know that right now. You just need to stop moping around. Reengage in your life again.” “I’ll try.” “That’s better than nothing, I suppose. Now, come on over and help me wrangle this wiggly boy out of the tub.” She held out a towel for me. I scooped Grayson out of the tub and snuggled him up in the towel, hugging him against my chest. He patted at my face and made his cute baby noises. God, I loved this little boy. He made everything better. “If only everything were as easy as loving family.” I sighed and rested my chin on Grayson’s head. “Where’s the fun in that?” Hope winked at me. “Maybe I should let Faith set me up.” I chewed on my lower lip. “It couldn’t hurt. And it might be just what you need to jump start your dating life again.” She held her hands out for the baby. “Not every guy out there is like Scott.” Her tone was soft. My head snapped up at the mention of his name. “This isn’t about him.” “Isn’t it?” She gave me a hard look. “He messed you up. You haven’t really been the same Grace since it ended. Maybe this thing with Logan was good for you. It showed you that there are guys out there worth your time.” I chewed my lip and watched her walk down the hall to the nursery. Maybe she was right. I followed her into Grayson’s nursery and sat in the comfy glider chair while she got him in his feety pajamas. “Johnny!” she yelled. “Can you make Gray his bottle?” He yelled something back; I assumed he was saying yes because he came back up a few minutes later with a bottle. The look of absolute love in his eyes as he kissed my sister made my heart clench. I wanted that—someone to love like that. Hope handed him the baby, and we went down the hall to her room. “What was it about Logan that had you so wrapped up in him overnight?” She sat cross legged on her bed. “I don’t even know. Just him, his personality. Plus he was sexy as sin. Just looking at him made my knees go weak.” My cheeks felt hot. I flopped down onto my stomach next to her. “That’s how I knew with John. The first date, that was it for me. We’ll find that for you, Gracey.” She looked so hopeful, I hated to disagree with her. I had found it, but I let him get away. “What are you looking for in a man?” “Are you going to make a spreadsheet?” I laughed. Hope was uber organized, always had a spreadsheet for everything. She stuck her tongue out at me. “No, not making a spreadsheet. I just want to be sure we’re looking for the right man.” “I don’t know.” I threw my hands up in exasperation. “I want what you and John have.” I sighed. “You’ll find it honey, I know you will.” She patted my back. “I should tell Faith to reschedule the date from tonight.” I sighed. “Knowing her, she probably already did.” I spent the rest of the evening at Hope’s wrapped in a blanket of unconditional love. John would always have my back, I knew that with total certainty. And Hope was always there, no matter what. FAITH WAS WAITING UP FOR me when I walked through the door. “Feel better?” She smirked at me. “Somewhat. I assume you rescheduled for tomorrow?” “I did. He’ll pick you up at six thirty; no backing out this time. I had to think on my feet and come up with a plausible excuse for you.” “What did you tell him?” “I said you got called into work at the last minute. So start thinking up work related problems for your alibi.” I rolled my eyes and walked away toward my bedroom. “Grace, come on, you know I’m only doing this for your benefit right?” She trailed after me. “I know. It’s just going to take me some time to jump back in.” “Well, Eric will be a good warm up then. He’s super sweet, maybe a little dull, but he’s easy on the eyes.” “You’re really selling me on this guy here.” I stifled a laugh. “He’s a great rebound guy for you. There’s no future with him, but he’ll treat you right.” “I kind of feel bad for him now.” I winced at her words. “He knows you’re just coming off of a breakup.” “Is that what it was?” I snorted. “What would you call it if not a breakup?” She arched a brow. “I guess that’s what it was then.” In my own mind I had thought it more akin to being shown the door. “Just give tomorrow a chance okay? That’s all I’m asking.” She kissed my forehead and left me alone in my room. FAITH WAS RIGHT. ERIC WAS perfectly nice, but very dull. He totally believed the work excuse Faith had given him and didn’t even question me about it. “What do you do for a living, Eric?” I asked him, needing something to talk about. It was only just after we were seated and already we were tapped out. “I’m in finance. Nothing super interesting.” He smiled. “What about you? Faith never told me what it is that you do.” “I’m in PR. It can be challenging, but I really enjoy it.” “Which firm do you work for?” he asked. “My own. DeLeo PR.” I was proud of myself. All of the sleepless nights and hard work had finally paid off when I lasted past the first year. “Your own firm, you’re so young.” “I’m thirty-two, not terribly young.” This night was not off to a great start. “I just meant that it’s a great achievement to own your own business being as young as you are.” He smiled nervously. “Thank you. I’ve worked really hard to get where I am.” I took a long drink of the Cosmo in front of me. “Will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the ladies’ room.” “Of course.” He hopped to his feet to pull out my chair. I fled down the hallway to the ladies’ room and dug for my phone in my purse. Faith answered in the second ring. “Is it bad?” she asked. “So bad. He is so boring. We pretty much ran out of things to talk about before we were seated. Why did you think this was a good idea?” “I’m sorry. But at least you broke your dry spell, right? Do you want me to call you in twenty minutes and pretend to be work?” “Yes, please.” “Okay, will do. Now get back out there and try and make the best of it.” She hung up before I could respond. I sighed and headed back out to Eric. I knew that I didn’t want this—someone sweet and nice but dull. I wanted it all. Excitement and heat. I wanted Logan. “I ordered an appetizer for us, I hope you don’t mind.” He smiled anxiously. I felt bad just being on this date with him. It was obvious that he wanted it to work. I considered my options. I could wait until Faith called with my pretend emergency, or I could lay it out on the table for him. “Look, Eric, you’re a really nice guy,” I started. “Already? The really nice guy speech?” He smile faltered. “I’m not sure if Faith told you, but I’m coming off of a breakup and this just feels so soon to me.” Not to mention that he was not Logan, the man I really wanted to be sitting across from me. “Was it something I said?” He looked anxious. “No, no. Nothing you said. I’m just not ready, and I don't know when I will be ready.” “Can I call you again sometime?” He was grasping at straws. “I don’t think that would be a good idea. I don’t want to lead you on.” He looked at me, his eyes sad. “I understand. Thank you for coming.” He got up and pulled my chair out and helped me with my coat. I left the restaurant feeling terrible about myself. Eric was a perfectly nice guy who would have treated me like a princess. My problem was that I didn’t want perfectly nice. My phone buzzed in the pocket of my coat and I pulled it out to answer Faith’s call. “It’s an emergency, come quick.” She laughed into the phone. “I’m already gone.” Regret colored my words. I had known this wouldn’t work, but I had hoped it would. “Really?” “Yeah, I felt too guilty about not wanting to be there. I couldn’t do it.” I sighed. “Okay, so you’re not ready to date then?” “No, that’s not it. I’m just not looking for an Eric.” “What are you looking for?” “Someone who makes me feel something. Someone who makes me feel wild and out of control.” I sighed dramatically. “So you want the world?” Faith laughed. “No, just Logan.” I sniffled into the phone. “So you are asking for the world, then.” “I just want to feel the way he made me feel again,” I said sadly. “Come home and we’ll drink away your sorrows.” “Don’t you have a date tonight?” “I’ll cancel. I can get laid whenever, and you need me more than I need a dick.” This was what I loved about my sister, she was so brash. “Okay, I’m walking home as we speak.” “I’ll play Cocktail and whip you up something amazing,” she said cheerily. “See you in a few.” Faith was an amateur bartender. I’d been telling her for years she should open up a place. So far she had yet to listen. She was too into her modelling career to want something more. She was waiting at the door with a glass full of something lethal when I walked in. “Here, drink this. It will cure what ails you.” She clinked glasses with me and tipped the cup back until I had drained it. I coughed. “Wow, what’s in this? Lighter fluid?” “Close. Vodka, rum, and some other random stuff.” She grinned at me. “Want another?” “I know I should tell you no, but what the hell, pour me another.” That was the last thing I remembered about that night. Lots of laughter and too many drinks.",

      "content": "“DID YOU HEAR WHAT I said Mr. McFadden?” My assistant Brooke waved her hand in front of my face. I blinked at her and motioned for her to repeat the question. “I asked if you were all set for your trip to L.A. Do you need me to run through your itinerary again?” She looked at me expectantly¸ her green eyes wide. There was a time when I would have considered taking her to bed. Brooke was every man’s dream—no matter what she wore, it looked like it was painted on her curvy frame. “No need, I know where I’m going and who I’m seeing. You can head out for the day if you’d like.” She frowned slightly. “Are you sure? I could order you some dinner and we can go over the Lowery file again.” “Go on home, Brooke. I’m leaving in a bit myself.” “Have a safe trip, Mr. McFadden.” She smiled and clicked out of the room in her Louboutins. I had to stop thinking about Grace. It had been a month, and I still couldn’t get her out of my head. I picked up the phone and called the one person who could snap me out of it. “Smith, it’s Logan. How would you feel about a trip to L.A. tonight? Meet me at the plane in two hours if you’re interested.” I hung up after leaving my message and finished up the work in front of me. My limo met me in front of the building and drove me straight to the airport. Smith was leaning against the hood of his car when we pulled up. We had a similar build, but his hair was black as night. We were quite a pair when we were stalking our prey. He didn’t say a word until we were in the air. “How bad is it then?” “It’s not good, I’ll tell you that. I can't get her off my mind, man. She’s all I can think about.” I raked a hand through my hair. Smith Janner and I had been friends since we were kids. He was the closest thing I had to a brother. He looked at me thoughtfully. “What’s to be done about it?” “Women, and lots of them.” A slow smile formed on his lips. “How much trouble do you think we can cause in the two days we’re there?” “I’d put my money on a lot.” I motioned for Sarah, my regular flight attendant, to bring me a scotch. “Is this going to solve anything for you? Or delay the inevitable?” “Too soon to tell.” I leaned back in my seat. Grace. What the fuck had she done to me? “Why on earth are you fighting this so much? From everything you’ve told me, she sounds pretty damn perfect.” “I don’t do perfect, and I don't do relationships. I’m not comfortable with them. They’re too familiar.” He laughed. “You and your rules.” “I like things the way they are. I have no room in my life for change.” I shook my head. “Everything has a place. Sex is just recreation for me, I don't need to be held accountable to anyone to get it.” I downed the scotch in front of me and signaled for another. “Pace yourself, it’s a long flight from here to California.” Smith nodded toward the drink Sarah had put in front of me. “The last thing I need is you being too drunk to get off the plane.” “Okay, that was one time, and it was ten years ago.” I shook my head. “I’ll never forget it, nor will I let you.” He laughed. “You’re such an ass.” “I’ll own that.” He lifted his drink in a salute. “Who are we meeting when we get there?” “The usual suspects. Shaileen was more than happy to take my call today. She promised to show us a good time while we’re in town.” I smirked. Shaileen was a woman who both Smith and I had dated at one time or another. It was never serious in any of the relationships and somehow we remained friends. We sort of looked at her as one of the guys now. A sexy as hell bro. She could drink us both under the table, and usually travelled with a pack of women just as good looking. “Sounds like we’re in for a fun couple of days then.” The flight was overnight, and we awoke just as we touched down in Los Angeles. “Mr. McFadden, Mr. Janner, enjoy your trip.” Sarah smiled as we stepped out into the morning light. I needed to stop thinking about her. It was only one night, nothing was that good. I had meetings in the city all day, but Shai had promised to be by our hotel by seven to take us out on the town. I needed the diversion. Grace. She was all I could think about these days. I wondered what she was doing, or if she was thinking of me. “I still say you should just call her.” Smith’s voice brought me out of my stupor. “Call whom?” I shot back. “The girl. The one you're running from.” “I’m not running. Even if I wanted to call her, I don’t have her number.” “Bullshit. You have a dossier on every girl you’ve fucked.” He was right, of course. I knew that Grace’s last name was DeLeo, and that she owned her own PR firm. I knew how much she had in all of her bank accounts as well. I could call her, but I wouldn’t. “I’m not going to call her.” “You are such a chickenshit.” He shook his head. “I’m not. I just prefer things the way they are. Women expect too much, and most only want me for my last name and what it can bring them.” I’d only had one serious relationship in the past, and she had proven to be very disappointing. I hadn’t made the same mistake again. “I’m letting it drop for now, but it’s not over.” Smith was a good friend, but he didn't get it. No one ever did. I still had my mom pestering me all the time about finding a nice girl to settle down with and give her grandbabies. No chance in hell. Not to mention my sister Leah was always trying to set me up with her friends. They didn’t understand me. I didn’t need the messiness of a relationship, I just needed the sex part. “Are you going to be at the hotel while I work? Or should we drop you somewhere else?” I asked, changing the subject. “The hotel is fine,” he answered as he scrolled through his phone. After dropping him off at The W, the driver took me to where I was meeting my clients. I was supposed to be buying out a failing record company, but truth be told, I didn’t care why I was here. I only cared that it was new and that I was going to get laid later in the evening. Spreadsheets were set in front of me in the glossy conference room. “As you can see Mr. McFadden, with your company’s backing we can achieve a profit within the first year of the merger,” a nervous looking brunette said, fidgeting with her glasses as she spoke. “I see your projections.” I tapped a finger to my lip. “Why my company though? Make me see why we are a good fit.” I needed to hear passion from her, to know that she was hungry for it. The woman, Casey Woodright, spent the next hour telling me all about the company and how she started it from nothing. She explained that they just needed some backing to make the leap into signing bigger named clients. If I was looking for hungry, she was ravenous. “We’ll meet at noon tomorrow to speak again,” I instructed as I stood to leave. “I expect you to show me what you’re working on.” “Does this mean you're going to sign the contract?” she asked me anxiously. “That remains to be seen, I’ll make my final decision tomorrow.” My mind was already made up, McFadden Industries would become a partner with them. I just wanted her to work a little bit more for it. Nothing worthwhile should be easy to attain. SMITH WAS RECLINING ON MY bed watching TV when I walked into the suite. “Was there something wrong with your room?” I threw my jacket on the closest chair. “No, your TV is bigger.” He grinned. “Whatever. Did you speak to Shai?” “She’ll be around in twenty or so. Did she tell you her news?” He arched a brow. “No. What news?” I narrowed my eyes. “I suppose I’ll leave it to her to tell you.” His smirk was annoying. I huffed out a breath and grabbed my phone out of my coat pocket. “Shai, it’s Logan.” “Logan, darling, what can I do for you that can’t wait twenty minutes?” I could hear the smile in her voice. “Smith alluded to some sort of news you have to share. He says he won’t share, so rather than spend the next twenty with his smug face, I’m calling you.” “I’m pregnant and engaged.” “Fuck me.” I blew out a breath. She laughed. “I’ll take that as a ‘congratulations’ and hang up now so I can concentrate on driving. See you soon.” She hung up and I dropped my phone on the chair next to me. “Pregnant.” “And engaged, don’t forget engaged.” Smith grinned at me. As long as I had known Shaileen, she was wild. She was the one girl who could party just as hard as me. The one who never wanted commitment or a ring from anyone. “What are your thoughts?” I sat down on the edge of the bed. “She seems really happy, so I’m happy for her. Not much that we can do about it anyway.” “Why the hell did she not tell me sooner?” “She probably thought you’d be pissed.” “I’m not pissed. I want her to be happy, of course. I’m just surprised.” “I was, too. Promise you’ll be nice when she gets here.” He eyed me. “I’m always nice.” “Right.” He rolled his eyes. “I’m going to go and change for dinner; I suggest you do the same.” He went through the adjoining door to his suite. Pregnant. Shai was pregnant. What was the world coming to? I changed into more casual clothes since it appeared that hitting the town was not on the table. So much for the distraction I needed. Fifteen minutes later, Shaileen breezed into my room. “Okay, tell me what you really think?” She flopped down onto my bed. She was gorgeous, of course, and her long strawberry hair was piled on her head in a messy bun. Her blue eyes held the question she had just asked. “I don’t know, Shai, I’m in shock.” “I told you a while ago I was dating someone,” she countered. “Yeah, but dating doesn’t always add up to a baby and a marriage, especially in our cases.” “I guess I just reached a place in my life where I wanted more. I’m not a kid anymore, and I don't want to be sleeping with random men for the rest of my life. Don’t you ever want more?” Grace. She was more. “I don’t know. Sometimes I do.” I went to the bar and poured myself a scotch. “Smith told me you met someone,” she said hesitantly. “He has a big mouth.” I glared in her direction. “She’s nothing, just a girl I met in Chicago, not serious. It was a night, nothing more.” I pounded the drink and grimaced as fire descended my throat “I can tell by your tone it wasn't nothing,” Shai said softly. “I don't want to talk about it.” “Maybe you need to,” she challenged. “Did Smith put you up to this?” “No, he didn’t. I’ve known you for a long time, Logan, and I want to know that you're going to be happy and taken care of.” “You make it sound like you’re dying. I don’t need to be in a relationship to be happy. I’m happy the way I am, with no attachments.” “No, you aren’t. The sooner you realize that, the better off you will be. I thought I was happy, too. It was all meaningless before I met Alex. The partying, the sex with strangers, it’s not going to make you happy, but she will.” “How do you know that? You never met her.” I crossed my arms defensively. “I can see it all over your face. She got under your skin.” She gave me a look that told me she knew I was full of shit. I sighed. “She did get to me. I can't stop thinking about her. The way her hair smelled, and the curve of her spine as she was lying next to me in bed. She’s in my head.” “Why aren’t you doing something about it then?” Shai demanded. “It’s been too long. I let her walk out and didn’t try and stop her. She doesn’t know who I am really, only my first name. It was only a night, but it was more at the same time.” “Can you find her again?” she questioned. I grinned. “I never lost her. I know where she is.” “Then why are you here with me, instead of there with her?” “Because I'm terrified to find out if what I felt was real or not,” I said softly. “Did she ask you to stay?” “No. She begged me to ask her not to leave.” Just saying the words hurt. This was not good at all. “It was real.” “How do you know? I let her leave, Shai, what if I go to her and she tells me to go to hell?” “I just know, honey. Ask yourself this—will you be able to go the rest of your life without knowing for sure if this could have been something?” “I don’t know.” I scrubbed my hands over my face. This was exactly why I didn’t do strings. “You've never been this way about someone, not even…” “Don’t say her name.” My tone was sharper than it should have been. “I’m sorry, I just can’t talk about her.” I softened. “I know honey. I was there through it all.” She patted my leg. “I just think you need to give this a chance and see where it goes. You owe it to yourself. You deserve so much more than what you allow.” She put a hand on my cheek. “I used to think that somewhere down the line, you and I would find each other again, when we were both ready.” I started to speak, but she silenced me with a finger. “That was just a young girl’s fantasy. We were never meant for each other. I love you, more than I should at times, but it’s there. Over time that love changed to something else, it morphed into something non-emotional, something more platonic. I think you’re truly remarkable, and you are worth so much more. Your money means nothing, all of it, the power, it means nothing if you don’t have someone to come home to at night.” “I love you too, Shai, and I used to wish that I could love you the way you deserved. I’m happy you found someone, and you know I’ll be Uncle Logan to your kids.” “And they will love you as much as I do.” She put a hand on her stomach. I hadn’t noticed the bump before, nor had I seen the ring on her finger. For the first time, I could see how happy she was. “Come on, let’s go find Smith and Alex.” She held a hand out for me to help her up. I arched a brow in silent question. “I told them we needed a minute.” She pulled me into a hug. “I love you.” She kissed my cheek. “I know you do. I love you, too. Now let’s go so I can meet your fiancé.” I pressed my lips to hers gently. My Shai was all grown up.",

      "content": "“GRACE? ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING to me?” Faith snapped her fingers in front of my face. “What? Sorry.” “I said Hope is on her way up and then we have to run if we’re going to make it to the airport in time to meet Charity’s flight.” I was so excited to see her again. She’d been away studying at Oxford for the past two years in England. She was coming home for the summer, and we were elated. “Come on, get the lead out,” Faith ordered. “I’m coming; I’ll meet you downstairs—I just need to find my shoes.” Hope talked nonstop the whole way to the airport. “Has it been a while since you’ve had adult interaction?” Faith laughed as we got out of the car. “No, why?” Hope had a quizzical expression on her face. “You literally talked the entire time.” “I did not,” she scoffed, looking offended. “You really did.” I patted her arm. “It’s okay, though, I don’t mind.” “I’m sorry. John’s been working so much lately, and I’ve been home with the baby by myself. I guess I didn’t realize how starved for attention I was.” She smiled sheepishly. “You know I’m always only a phone call away,” I whispered as we walked into the airport. “I know you are. You're busy with work, too, though.” For the first time, I noticed that my sister looked sad. Maybe domestic bliss wasn't all it was cracked up to be. “Come on, I don’t want to miss her coming down the escalator,” Faith called out from ahead of us. Turned out that us hurrying didn’t matter, Charity’s flight was delayed by two hours. “So, do we leave and come back or stay?” I asked the others. “We may as well stay. We can get magazines and food and meet back here to wait,” Hope mused. So we all split up in search of food and magazines. I was perusing the magazine rack when a familiar face jumped out at me from the cover of Forbes. My heart stopped. There he was, in full color, smiling at me under the headline “The Billionaire Bachelor”. Logan. I bought the magazine and sat in the first open seat I could find, flipping to his story and reading it through, twice. His last name was McFadden, and he was apparently the sole heir to some huge corporation that owned about a zillion other companies. I scoured each page of the story, looking at pictures of him with various women at charity events—the ballet, the opera, and all sorts of other snooty rich people events. They were all blonde and cut from the same mold; apparently he had a “type”. I for sure didn’t fit that mold. I wasn’t tall or statuesque. Seeing him was like a punch to the gut, even if it was only on paper. It reaffirmed that I was not, in fact, over him in any way. Logan McFadden. His last name, I could look for him now if I wanted to. Did I want to? Was I willing to find him and risk him rejecting me? “Hey, we’ve been looking all over for you.” Hope plopped down in the empty chair next to me, her brown eyes worried. “Sorry. I found this and sort of lost track of everything.” “What is this?” She flipped to see the cover of the periodical. “Logan,” I whispered. “What?” Her jaw dropped, and she studied his picture. Naturally, she knew about my brief encounter, but not all the details. “It’s an article about him and his life. Just seeing his face again…” I felt my composure waning. “Wow, he’s a hottie.” Hope peered at him. “I know,” I groaned. “Like, really hot. You never said he was this hot.” She looked closer. “Yeah, he’s insanely hot,” I said glumly Faith found us a few minutes later. “You have to find him; you know that, right?” Faith proclaimed. “What? Don't be crazy.” “Grace, seriously, you have been awful since that night. You need to do this, to see if there is something there.” “What am I supposed to do? Show up at his office in New York and say, ‘Hey, remember me? We had a one-night stand three months ago, and I can’t stop thinking about you?’ That would be nuts.” Just the thought of doing that made me sick to my stomach. “What if he feels the same way, though?” Hope chimed in—the voice of reason, as usual. “What if he doesn’t?” Could I do this? Could I fly across the country, chasing my destiny? The thought of him rejecting me again made my stomach twist. All thoughts of Logan were erased by the impending arrival of Charity’s flight from England. As soon as we saw her tall blond head coming down the escalator, all of us screamed her name and ran to tackle her. “It’s so good to be home.” She hugged me tightly, while we waited for Hope to bring the car around. “The UK was amazing, but there’s nothing like being home. I missed all you crazy bitches.” “That’s right, you did,” Faith chimed in. “Okay, so what’s been going on? Fill me in on everything.” “Grace is in love,” Faith said quickly. “What? Who is he? When can I meet him?” Charity talked a mile a minute. “I’m not in love.” I hid my smile behind my hands “Fine, Grace is in lust,” Faith said sarcastically. “Seriously, when can I meet him?” Charity bounced on her toes. “Never,” I grumbled. Charity looked from me to Faith for a moment. “Okay, spill it.” Once we were in the car, I filled her in on the whole situation. “Wow, I’m a little surprised since you are so not the one-night stand kind of girl. You’re a hearts-and-flowers relationship kind of girl.” “I know I am. The thing with Logan was a one-time thing; I’ll never do something like it again. I ended up worse for the wear. Enough about me, though, tell us about you and everything that’s been going on.” I squeezed her hand. My baby sister was back. “School was challenging, which was exactly what I needed. The workload was insane, like no sleep ever.” “Did you escape the library long enough to have a little bit of fun?” Hope called from the front seat. “I did.” Charity’s eyes sparkled. “Ooh, Charity met someone.” Faith grinned. “I did. His name is Jude.” She smiled sweetly. “How very British.” Faith laughed. “He is very British. And amazing and handsome,” she gushed. As much as I didn’t want to, I envied her. She had found someone who made her heart beat faster, and he felt the same way. They had something real. The next couple of days were spent all together at Hope’s house. It was one big pajama party. We laughed and caught up with each other’s lives. The DeLeo sisters were finally back together—everything was right with the world. Charity finally decided to stay with Faith and me for the night. After Hope went home and Faith went out for the night, we hunkered in to watch movies and talk. “Tell me more about your mystery man.” Charity curled her feet under her legs on the couch next to me and put a Twizzler in her mouth. “God Char, I wish you could have met him.” I sighed. “He made me feel alive for the first time in a long time.” “Then why are you not going to go and find him again?” she prodded, throwing a Twizzler at me. “He already let me leave once. I don’t know if I can live through that again.” I put a pillow over my face. “Stop being so afraid all the time. What if he feels the exact same way you do?” “I want to believe that. With all my heart I want to believe that.” My voice was thick with emotion. “Why do you think it’s not true?” “If he felt the same as me, would he have let me leave?” “Maybe. Think about this, what if he does feel the same way, but it scared him?” She gestured with a licorice stick. “Logan can have any woman in the world, Charity. Why would he want me?” “Shut up. I’m not going to listen to this nonsense anymore. Scott was a dick, we all knew it right from the start. Stop letting him ruin your life when he’s not even in it anymore.” She looked angry. This was the second time in a few days that my sisters had brought up Scott. The ex from hell. The man who broke my heart into tiny pieces. I was glad he wasn’t in my life anymore, even though the damage he inflicted was still healing. “I really think you owe it to yourself to go. You’ll always wonder about him if you don’t.” She smiled. “I’ll think about it.” That was the truth, I would most likely do nothing but think about it for the next few days. FAITH WAITED A COUPLE OF weeks before she brought up Logan again. She and I were out at lunch, prior to an afternoon of shopping. “You need to go see Logan, Grace.” She slid something across the table. I opened the envelope and saw a plane ticket to New York, leaving in two days. “Are you kidding me with this?” “Nope. Hope and I pitched in and got it. You need to do this. You will never be happy unless you explore what might be there. You know I’m right, Grace.” “I know you are right, but it’s so scary. He’s this amazingly handsome, incredibly wealthy man who could have any woman he wanted. If he had wanted me, he could have asked me to stay, or even for my number. But he didn’t. He didn’t even say goodbye—he just let me walk away.” Faith shook her head. “Don’t sell yourself short, cupcake, you're a hottie. He would be lucky to have you in his life. And haven’t you ever wondered if maybe he was scared of what he felt, too?” I chewed at my lower lip. I had wondered about it—in between being pissed off and really sad. Had he felt it, too? “Two days. That doesn’t give me any time to psych myself up for this. Are you coming with?” “Hell yes, I’m coming. Do you think I would send you to New York by yourself? I’m not, however, going to go with you to meet him. That is all you. So, the question is, are you in?” “Yes, I’m in. I think this is crazy, and I’m probably going to make a fool of myself in front of the most eligible bachelor in the United States, but let’s do it!” “I was so hoping you would say that,” she beamed at me. “You realize this is totally nuts, right?” I twisted my bracelet nervously. “It is, but you have to do it.” “I know I do.” I sighed. “Now, let’s talk fashion. What are you going to wear when you see him?” We spent a full hour going over all the details for our trip to New York. She and I would fly out on Wednesday evening, and I would go find Logan on Thursday, at some point. My stomach was officially in knots. Faith dragged me through countless stores, making me try on various slutty dresses and delicious heels that were way too high to be anything but awful to walk in. But I loved them anyway. “What do you think of these?” I walked carefully in a pair of sky high black heels. “They make your ass look amazing. You want your ass to look amazing when you see him again, don't you?” I sighed. “Yes, I really do.” In the end, I got two new dresses, a skirt and blouse, and three pairs of heels. I was going to look amazing. Even if my heart got smashed to pieces, I would at least look good when it happened. Later that night, I was over at Hope’s house sitting on the floor with Grayson while Hope made dinner. “Tell me what you’re feeling?” she called over her shoulder at me. “I’m so nervous. What if it was all in my head? He probably does that sort of thing all the time, why should I have been any different to him?” “I don’t really know the answer to that. But you owe it to yourself to find out if it was real.” “My head knows you’re totally right, but my heart is terrified to be smashed to pieces. He’s amazing, the whole damn package. Sexy, funny, and great in bed.” I sighed unhappily. “Don’t forget rich beyond all reason,” Hope chimed in. “Yeah, but I knew he was rich before,” I shot back. “Now you know exactly how rich, though. Does that change anything for you?” “Not in the way I feel for him. It just freaks me out a bit more.” I grimaced. “Why does it scare you?” She turned to look at me. “It’s just a little bit daunting. He can have anyone he wants, why would he want me?” “Stop it. I won’t hear you disparage yourself like that. You are amazing. Smart, and beautiful. The whole damn package. He would be lucky to have you.” She pointed a wooden spoon at me. “What if none of this was real?” I said softly. “If I built it into something in my head?” “What do you really think? Do you think it was nothing, or do you think it was something?” “I think it was something.” I sighed and snuggled Grayson against my cheek. “There’s your answer, then.” My sisters were totally right, there was no way I could move on with my life if I didn’t take this leap and go find him. I would always regret it if I didn’t go. “Why couldn’t things have gone differently before?” “Because honey, life isn’t always easy. Even when you get your happy ending, you still have to work for it.” A shadow crossed her expression. I set Grayson down in his playpen and went to sit on the counter. “What’s going on with you?” “What? Nothing. Why would you ask that?” “I ask because I’m not blind. You’ve been off for a couple of weeks. Tell me what’s going on.” A tear leaked down her cheek. “I don’t know what’s happening. I feel like he’s slipping away.” “John?” “Yes,” she whispered. “What’s been happening?” I put an arm around her shoulders. “He’s so distant. I can never get a hold of him anymore. He’s been working nonstop, or at least that’s where he says he is. I wish I knew what the problem was so I could fix it.” My heart broke to see her like this. She and John were always so solid, what we all aspired to have. “After Gray was born, it was hard. I’m not going to lie and tell you things have been perfect. As a new mom, I lost myself in him. It was all about the baby.” “Honey, that’s understandable. It was a lot for you to take in all at once.” “I’ve never stopped loving him, or wanting him.” “Have you told him that?” “So many times, over and over. I don't know what I would do if he left me.” “He’s not going to leave you. John loves you, and he loves Grayson. I’m sure it’s just work that has him stressed out.” I hoped to God that’s all it was. I couldn’t imagine John stepping out on her, but you never could tell with people. “I just hate feeling like this. I want to trust him, he’s never given me a reason not to. But something feels weird. This isn't him, or how we are with each other. I feel like it’s all going to fall apart.” “You need to talk to him. Be honest about how you’re feeling.” I wanted to reassure her, but at the same time I wanted to beat the shit out of my brother-in-law for making her feel insecure in their marriage. Here I was giving my sister advice, yet I didn’t want to follow it. They were right, I did owe it to myself to go see him. I needed to find out if this could really be something. “Okay, enough of me being silly. Tell me more about your trip and all the clothes Faith made you buy.” I rolled my eyes at the mention of the clothes and launched into the whole shopping story.",

      "content": "I WAS PACKED AND LYING in bed with my now, very worn copy of Forbes, staring at Logan’s face on the page. Would he even remember me? I almost talked myself out of going, but something in me squashed that fear. I knew that I would never move on unless I had closure. I still remembered the feel of his lips against mine and his hands on my skin. The thought of him rejecting me, and never feeling that again, was not something I wanted to dwell on. Hope picked us up the next day to take us to the airport. “I think you’re doing the right thing.” Hope hugged me tight. “I hope I am.” I smiled weakly. The previous night I hadn’t slept a wink. “Go and find your man.” She squeezed me one last time before turning to hug Faith. “Make sure she doesn’t chicken out.” “I can promise you I won’t let that happen. There’s no way in hell that we’re flying all the way there for her to not at least talk to him.” I tended to be a nervous flyer, so Faith’s solution was to get me a bit tipsy before we boarded the flight. “Come on, let’s hit up one of the crappy bars they have here.” We wheeled along our carry-ons and headed for the nearest bar to our gate. “I don’t want to drink,” I protested when Faith slid a shot in front of me. “Yes, you do. You’ll feel better once you drink it.” She grinned and tossed hers back. I grimaced and followed suit, coughing like crazy as it burned its way down my throat. She was right, I felt a bit calmer already. An hour later, they called our flight, and I wobbled slightly as I hopped off my stool. The flight was over before I knew it, and we were in a cab on the way to our hotel. I had never been to New York—so I was your typical tourist, my face pressed to the window taking in the sights. I didn’t even care where we were staying; I had left it up to Faith. I was too nervous about finding Logan. Faith talked me into exploring the city with her once we were settled in. We were staying near Central Park, so we took a carriage ride through the park and then walked down to Times Square. We walked back up 5th Avenue, stopping to see the window displays at Sak’s, detouring to see the Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. “Is it like you imagined it would be?” she asked me. “You know, the buildings are bigger, but the area of the city is so much smaller than I imagined. I had no idea we could walk everywhere.” My head was on a swivel the entire time, I wanted to see everything. I had no idea where we were, Faith said it was the financial district, but who really knew. Tons of buildings and men in suits getting in and out of cabs and shiny black cars. Faith was laughing at something, her attention focused on a display window, when I saw him. Standing across the street with a group of men. I stilled and put a hand on Faith’s arm to get her attention. “What?” She got a look at the shocked expression on my face. “It’s Logan,” I whispered. She followed my gaze. “Shit. He looks good doesn’t he?” “Very.” For the briefest second, our eyes met across the busy street. His expression turned to one of surprise. The barest hint of a smile on his lips. “Are you going to go over there and say something?” Faith nudged me. “I…” Before I could answer, he was climbing into the waiting limo. Not even a second glance spared in my direction. “Um. What was that?” Faith asked. “He didn’t want me. I knew I was right.” My heart sank to my feet. “No. You don’t know that for sure. What if he didn’t realize it was you? There were a lot of cars between.” “He smiled at me, Faith. He knew it was me and didn’t come over here. He just left.” I had to stop myself from crying. “Give him the benefit of the doubt, honey. Go see him tomorrow and see what he says.” She put an arm around my shoulders. “Yeah, okay,” I mumbled and let her lead me through the streets. “Come on, we still have tons of stuff to see.” She put on a cheery smile and pulled me along after her. Just before midnight, after eating greasy pizza and a ton of gelato, we dragged our butts back to the Westin to get some sleep. We woke up to rain. Not exactly the omen I was looking for, although it sort of went with my mood. Seeing him yesterday had messed with my head. I started to panic. I hadn't brought anything for rain. Faith shooed me into the shower and went out in search of a sexy coat for me to wear. About an hour after I emerged from the bathroom, showered, made-up, and with my hair done, Faith returned victorious with a cute, black, knee-length belted trench coat that looked amazing with the red dress I planned on wearing. “Are you ready for this?” Faith hugged me tight. “No, but I’m going anyway. Wish me luck?” My heart hammered in my chest. “You don't need it, honey. Go and knock his socks off!” I hopped in a cab and told the driver to take me to the McFadden building in Lower Manhattan. My heart was in my throat the entire drive. This was it; I was really going to do this. The McFadden building was huge, bigger than any of the buildings surrounding it. I knew Logan was rich; but seeing this, a building with his name on it, really made it sink in. The lobby was a hive of activity, people milling around everywhere. How was I even going to get to Logan? I didn’t know what floor he was on; and even if I did, would they let me through to see him? I walked to the directory, next to the elevator banks, and looked for his name. I scanned the entire list, but I didn’t see it or an Administrative Office. Well, crap, this threw a wrench into my plans. I found a seat in the lobby and tried to figure out what my next move should be. That’s when I saw him walking through the lobby, toward the elevators, with a group of men. God, he looked sexy as hell in a suit. Just as good as I remembered. My pulse sped up. I wanted to either cry or throw up. My nerves were going to be the death of me. I gathered my courage and stood up as they walked past. Now or never. “Logan?” I called to him. My voice stronger than what I felt on the inside. He stopped and turned around, a slightly annoyed expression on his face that quickly gave way to astonishment. “Excuse me, will you?” he said to the men with him and walked toward me. Oh God, was this the wrong choice? Was he pissed that I was here? I waited for him, unable to move from the spot I was planted in. “Come with me.” He took me by the arm and led me outside and into a limo that was parked on the street in front of the building. “I shouldn’t have come. I’m sorry I bothered you.” He obviously didn’t want to be seen with me and was sending me away. My heart sank. “Damn it, Grace,” he growled getting in behind me. “I’ve thought about you every day,” he murmured, as he pulled me onto his lap and claimed my mouth with his. “Every day?” I was breathless. Giddy. “Every damn day, Grace. How the hell did you even find me?” He hugged me tight against his chest, showering me with kisses. “I saw you in Forbes.” I pulled back a little so I could see his face. “Al, take us to my loft, please.” He pressed a button on the side panel. “Right away, sir,” a voice responded. “I thought you were a mirage yesterday,” he mumbled into my hair, holding me tight. “So, you did see me?” My insides were turning to mush with his words. “Of course I saw you, Kitten, I just thought I was imagining it. I’ve been thinking about nothing but you for days. I thought I was having a mental break.” He kissed my neck. The rest of the drive was spent lost in each other, both eager to reacquaint ourselves with each other’s body. Logan whisked me out of the car as soon as it stopped and we raced through the lobby to the elevator. He must have pushed the floor button a zillion times, willing the elevator to go faster. His keys were out in his hand and he practically dragged me down the hall to the door. “Too many clothes, Grace, I need to feel your skin against mine,” he said, tearing at the buttons on his shirt. “Are you still on the pill?” I nodded, not trusting my voice. I didn’t want fast, though, I wanted to enjoy this. Being with him, again, was like drinking a cold glass of water after wandering in the desert for months. I wanted to savor it, to savor him. I untied the belt on my coat and slipped it off. Logan watched my every movement, a carnivorous look on his face. I smirked at him as I slid the tight red dress off my shoulders. Soon, I was standing in just panties, a matching bra, and heels. “Come here.” I obeyed and walked to him, the lust in his eyes making me feel brazen. “Tell me what you want, Logan,” I whispered into his ear, once he had me firmly in his arms. It was the same question he had asked me, all those months ago. Those words had resonated in my soul and played over and over in my head as I held onto his memory. “You, Grace; I need you. All of you.” His voice was thick with need. “Then, take me.” That was all the direction Logan needed, because he practically threw me on his bed. He got his pants and socks off in record time and descended on my body, pressing his lips to any part of me he could get at as he undressed me the rest of the way. “Baby, I can’t wait, it’s been too long.” He panted as he rose above me. I couldn't wait, either. I needed him. The feeling of him inside me was almost more than I could bear; he was made for me. There was nothing quick about this reunion. He moved achingly slow, each pivot of his hips was ecstasy. “Is this what you need?” His lips were at my neck, kissing and biting. “Always,” I breathed, surrendering myself to the pleasure. WE WERE LYING TOGETHER IN my bed a while later, and she asked the question I had been dreading. “Why didn’t you come back for me? Why didn’t you ask me to stay?” Her brown eyes were wide and vulnerable. I sat up and raked my hand through my hair. “I knew you were going to ask me that. I always knew where you were, Grace, just like I know your last name is DeLeo and that you have three sisters—Faith, Hope, and Charity.” I stopped and looked down at her, rubbing my hand along her arm. “My feelings for you scared me. I should have stopped you from leaving that morning. I regret that I didn’t.” Her face fell, the happiness that was there before was replaced with hurt. I could tell she was crushed, and I didn’t know how to talk my way out of this. “Logan, I’m at a loss, here.” She sat up, too. “You've known where to find me this whole time, but you never came for me?” “Baby, I needed you to find me. I needed to know that you felt it, too.” I took her in my arms, smoothing her hair as I hugged her. “We spent months apart because you were insecure?” The expression on her face tore at my heart. “Not insecure, Grace. I’m used to women falling at my feet once they know my last name. It was so refreshing to be with you and have you like the real me, not just who I am and what goes along with it. I was terrified that things would change if you discovered who I really was, that you would be different.” I dropped my head. “I understand fear; I get that, completely. I was so nervous you would turn me away or not remember me.” “How could I not remember you? Grace, you were the best part of my life—even if it was only for one night.” I kissed her softly. “So, now that you know how I really feel. What now?” Uncertainty colored her words. “What now? Now, I’m never going to let you go.” I tipped her chin up and kissed her. “How will we make this work, Logan? You live and work here; and my home is in Chicago.” “Grace, we’ll make it work, I promise. I need you.” “I’ve needed you every day of the past few months. I want to believe you and risk my heart on this, but I need something from you.” “Anything.” “I only want honesty from you, no secrets or lies. I need to protect my heart.” “I promise you I won’t lie to you. I’m all in on this, Kitten.” I wanted to take her in my arms, but she stopped me. “I’m going to hold you to that.” “You can hold anything you want against me.” I grinned, trying to lighten the mood. “Logan, be serious here.” “Okay, sorry. Keep going, what else is on your mind?” I kissed her. “How is this going to work, you’ll come see me, and I’ll come out here sometimes?” she asked. “I have a private plane honey, I can come to you as often as I like. Or send it for you to come out here. Long distance doesn’t have to be hard. Eventually, I would like you to move here with me.” “Move here?” She arched a brow. “My whole life is in Chicago. My work, my sisters.” “I know that, and I’m not asking you to give everything up, Grace.” I kissed her gently. “I’m saying in the future. You own your own business, you can move it to New York. Hell, I’ll give you a floor in the McFadden building.” “I don’t need charity from you. I’m capable of making it on my own. I’ve done well enough on my own so far.” There was a bite to her words. “I’m not offering you something I wouldn’t offer anyone else. I want you here with me, and I think you would do well. There are many different businesses that I don’t own that rent space in my buildings. Having you a few floors below me would be wonderful.” I paused and kissed her arm. “Think about it. We could have lunch together every day.” I kissed her shoulder. “And ride to work together in the mornings.” I kissed her neck. “I’m not the devil, and I’m not asking you to sell your soul to me.” I kissed her ear. “I’ll think about it.” She looked uncertain. “We’re just starting this, I don’t want to make future plans in case it doesn’t work out.” “Don’t think that it won’t. When I want something bad enough, I get it. And I want you.” I nipped at her earlobe. “Can we stop discussing business now? I think I have other things I’d rather be doing with you.”",

      "content": "IT WAS LATE, TOO LATE for me to still be awake. But I couldn’t stop staring at the angel currently in my arms. Grace. She had found me. She had come back to me. My phone buzzed on the nightstand next to me. A quick glance showed a text from Smith. Smith: What the heck, man? You’ve been MIA all day. Where the hell are you? Me: Something came up. Smith: What exactly would that be? Or should I say whom? Me: Don’t be a dick. Smith: Stop being evasive. I’m calling you. Before I could respond the phone in my hand started ringing. Grace shot up to a sitting position rubbing her eyes. “Logan?” “Go back to bed. I have to take this call.” I kissed her softly and waited until she was lying on her side before exiting the room and heading out to the patio. “Seriously, what the hell is going on with you?” Smith’s irritated voice came through loud and clear. “She found me.” I drummed my fingers on the railing. “Who found you?” “Grace. She showed up at my office.” “Well, then.” “Exactly.” He knew how huge this was for me. “What are you doing about it?” he asked. “What I should have done before. I don’t plan on letting her get away this time. Shai was right, you were right. She’s what I need.” Laughter rolled through the line. “I never thought I would see the day when you would want to settle down with one person.” “Me neither, man. This is new territory for me.” I smiled as I said the words. “When can I meet her?” “Not for a bit, I don’t want to scare her off.” “Are you saying you think I’m scary?” Smith laughed. “No, you’re just a lot to take in. Plus I know how you are around beautiful women, and I want Grace all to myself for as long as I can have her.” “You sound happy.” “You know, I think I am.” I chuckled. This is what happy felt like. “Okay, call me sometime so I don’t think you’ve died from lack of electrolytes or something.” “You’re such a dick. Yeah, I’ll call you when I call you.” I pushed end and stood against the railing, watching the cars speed by on the street below. Grace walked out, wearing one of my shirts and a sleepy look on her face. “Everything okay?” She wrapped herself around me. “Yeah, totally good. Just a friend.” “How are you feeling about this. Now that that sexual haze has lifted.” She looked up at me, the nervous expression on her face tore me to shreds. “If you think I’ve changed my mind, you’re mistaken. Now that I have you, I’m never letting you go. We tried it apart, and it didn’t work. We were both miserable. I know I owe it to myself to see where this goes. I’m not going to say I love you, because we are very much not at that point. I will say I’m in lust with you. I can’t stop thinking about you. The smell of your hair, the taste of your lips, the little sounds you make in the heat of pleasure—I want to know where this goes. I’ve never wanted that before.” “I’m scared of all of this. But I want it all the same. I tried to tell myself that it wasn’t real, that what I felt for you was all in my head. I even went on a few dates, but no one compared to you. I agree, we do owe it to ourselves to see this through. Even if it ends horribly, we’d know we gave it an honest shot.” I tipped her lips up to mine, her vulnerability somehow made her even sexier. I had never liked that in the past, always steered clear of emotional attachment. “How long are you here for?” I wrapped my arms around her, wanting her to say forever. “A few more days. Faith is with me.” I arched a brow. “Moral support and all that.” She smiled. “I wasn’t at all sure I could have gotten on the plane without her.” “Then it seems I owe her dinner.” I kissed her again. I could never get sick of those pouty lips. “I’ll call her in the morning. I can't wait for you to meet all of my sisters. They are probably dying right now in anticipation.” She laughed. “Talked about me a lot did you?” I grinned. “Just a bit. I’m sure you talked to your friends about me, didn't you?” She pouted. “I’m more private, but yes, your name came up in a few conversations.” “As long as it came up, we’re all good. I would hate to have been the only one pining away.” She extracted herself from my arms and walked back to the sliding door, letting the button up shirt she was wearing fall to the floor as she stepped inside. “Oh no, Kitten, you were not alone in the pining department,” I said in a low growl as I stepped through the door after her. “And now? Are you still wanting me?” She bit her lower lip. “What do you think?” I slid the pajama pants off my hips and had her pressed against the wall in two seconds flat. She arched her back and ground her hips into me. I bent down and nipped at her neck, wanting to mark her, to claim her as mine. “Mine now. All mine,” I whispered in her ear. I wanted her to know it, deep in her soul. To know without a doubt that she belonged to me now. “Yes.” Her voice was breathy, barely a whisper. “All yours.” I hitched her legs up around my hips, not wanting to wait for a bed. God, she was perfect. Every part of her was made for me. Her eyes were closed, totally lost to everything but what I was currently making her feel. I could get used to this. “Logan.” She sighed and her head fell against my chest. The feeling of her tightening all around me was too much. I had to move or my legs were going to give out. I ran as quickly as I could to the bed and tossed her on her back. She giggled and threw a pillow at me. I flopped down on my side and pulled her against me, wrapping my arms around her. “I’m glad you came Grace.” I kissed her ear. “I am, too,” she whispered. “This feels like a dream. The dream I had for three months straight.” “I’m sorry,” I said lamely. I didn’t normally do apologies. The words felt foreign on my tongue. “For what?” She wiggled out of my arms and turned to face me. “For letting you leave. For not coming back for you. For all of it.” “It all worked out, right?” “Yeah, it did. But the time we could have been together was wasted because I was too stupid and too proud to come to you. I can promise I’ll never let you slip away again, Kitten.” “Promise you’ll always fight for us?” She grinned. “I promise. Now come back here, I liked you all wrapped up in my arms.” She complied and snuggled up against me, my arms wrapped around her. We spent the rest of the night talking about the future and what we wanted. As I drifted off to sleep, I couldn’t help feeling like the luckiest man on earth to have her with me. I knew I would move heaven and earth to keep her, for as long as she would have me. WHEN I FIRST OPENED MY eyes, I couldn’t tell where I was. I didn’t recognize anything in the room. Then I felt the arm around me and the warm body pressed firmly against my back and it all came flooding back. He wanted me. Logan McFadden wanted me in his life! “Morning Kitten.” I could feel the rumble of his voice through my back. “Morning.” I slid out of his embrace and stood up. “Um, bathroom?” He flipped onto his back and pointed off to the left, a grin on his face as he watched me walk away. I couldn’t stop smiling. The countless orgasms probably attributed to it, but the fact that he wanted me and didn’t turn me away was huge. I knew I needed to call Faith and let her know I was still breathing, but I didn’t want the real world to come crashing in on us yet. “You coming out, or am I coming in?” his voice called from just outside the door. “They both sound like good options.” I opened the door and let him into the huge bathroom. “I think we should shower and then go out for breakfast. How does that sound?” He kissed my neck. “Sounds good. I need to call Faith and stop by the hotel to pick some stuff up anyway. I didn’t even bring a toothbrush or a change of clothes with me.” “I have the toothbrush covered.” He opened a drawer and it was filled with unopened toothbrushes. I frowned slightly, the reality of just how many women had spent the night in this apartment came crashing in on me. “What?” He caught my look. “Nothing.” I hastily grabbed one and tore it open. “Grace, I wasn’t a monk before I met you. I had sex and a lot of it. I’m sorry if that puts you off, but it’s true and I’m not going to be ashamed of it.” A defiant look crossed his face, almost as if he were daring me to say something. “I know you weren’t, it just surprised me for a moment. It’s totally fine.” I forced a smile. “Is it?” He caught my chin in his hand before I could look away. “Don’t let this come between us. I can’t change who I was.” “I’m fine with it, Logan. I really am.” I knew he was right, he couldn’t change the past. I didn’t need to punish him for my own insecurities. “I should have been more sensitive to how you might take it, I apologize for that. Now, let’s go get showered off and I can drive you to your hotel to get changed.” The shower was anything but quick. We took our time making sure every inch of the other’s body was squeaky clean. Logan threw me a pair of sweats and a t-shirt to wear in the car. I had expected us to use the limo we had come in, but he led me to a sleek BMW sedan. “No driver today?” “No, I gave him the day off. I want you all to myself.” He held my hand to his lips and brushed a light kiss across my knuckles. “Do you always say the right thing?” “No, pretty often I say the wrong thing. You'll see.” He winked, and we took off for my hotel. Faith was sitting cross-legged on her bed watching TV when I came in. Logan had waited outside so I could go in and change and make sure Faith was decent. “So, here you are, then. No phone call?” She mock frowned. “Sorry, but I’m not sorry.” I grinned and rifled through my bag for a fresh bra and panties and something to wear. “I take it the reunion went well?” “Very. He’s so perfect, Faith. Better than I remembered.” I pressed a hand to my heart, caught up in all the girly emotions of it. “God, you are way too sugary this morning. I may get a cavity just listening to you.” She made a gagging motion. “Shut up. This is what you wanted remember. You made me come here.” I dressed in a hurry. “Where is lover boy, anyway?” “In the hall.” I cut my eyes to the door quickly and ran into the bathroom to throw some makeup on. “Do you want to meet him before we leave?” “Damn straight I do,” she called from the other room. “Do you need to get dressed before I let him in?” I eyed her sweats and piled up hair. “No, why? It’s not like it’s me who needs to impress him, is it? He’s seen me all slutted up before anyway.” I opened the door and found Logan leaning against the wall scrolling through his phone. He looked up and smiled and I swore my heart stopped beating for a moment. “Come on in.” “Hey, I’m Faith.” She held her hand out to him as I fumbled with the zipper on my suitcase. “I remember you from the night Grace and I met.” He smiled again and shook her hand. “And I do believe I owe you a thank-you meal for talking your sister into coming to find me.” She shrugged. “Sometimes she’s too stubborn for her own good. She just needed a little push. Besides, she was unbearable the past few months.” I shot her a dirty look and wheeled my suitcase to the door. “Pick you up for dinner?” She nodded, and I blew her a kiss. Logan waved and we were off again to wherever he wanted to go. As long as I was with him, I didn’t care. “I see you brought your suitcase?” he commented as we walked. “Should I not have? I just figured it would be easier for me to have all my clothes in one place.” “No, I love that you brought it. That you want to be in my house, in my bed. I never want to let you out my sight.” He leaned in and kissed me. “There you go again, saying all the right things.” I sighed and laced my fingers into his. “What are we doing today?” “I thought breakfast and then movies in bed all day until dinner with your sister. Unless you’d rather do something else?” “That sounds perfect.” It really did. I couldn't imagine a more perfect day. We got bagels and orange juice at a little deli by his apartment. He grilled me about my sisters. “So where are you in the line?” He licked a glob of cream cheese off his thumb. “Third. Hope is the oldest, then Faith, then me, and Charity is the baby.” “Do you see them a lot?” “Faith I see every day, we live together. Hope I see as often as I can, she lives in the suburbs with her husband and my nephew. Charity is in England at Oxford, so we see her about once a year.” “Oxford, huh?” “She got all the brains in the family.” I laughed. “Were you all close growing up?” He took a sip of his juice. “Very. My poor dad was constantly outnumbered in the house.” “I’m sure he loved every minute of it.” “He did.” I changed the subject to him. “Do you have any siblings?” “One sister. Leah. She lives in Paris right now.” “Paris? Do you see her a lot?” “A few times a year. She’s in charge of the European branch of the company for now.” “For now?” I arched a brow. “She’s going on maternity leave in a few months.” He smiled. “Is this the first grandchild in the family?” I blurted out. The barest shadow flickered over his face. “No, not the first.” He didn’t elaborate. “Are your parents in New York, too?” I asked with a little too much enthusiasm. I wanted to erase the weirdness from before. “Yeah, they live a few blocks from me.” He clearly did not enjoy talking about his family, I decided to let the subject drop for the time being. No need to spoil a good day. “Tell me more about you. What do you want out of life? Where do you see yourself in ten years?” “Is this a job interview?” I grinned as I swallowed a bite of bagel. “I guess it could be. The job is my girlfriend, and so far you are our only applicant.” I laughed. “I want happiness and love. A house full of laughter and children, and a man who loves me to grow old with.” “You don’t ask for a lot do you?” He watched me intently. “Only the world, and I’ll accept nothing less.” I stared right back. “How many kids are we talking here?” “I don’t know, a few. I have a thing for babies. The way they smell is heavenly.” I sighed, thinking about the way Grayson smelled after a bath. “So less than five?” he questioned. I coughed out a laugh. “Yes, way less than five. I’m thinking two or three.” “I think I could work with that.” “Does that mean I get the job?” I smiled seductively. “Oh, Kitten, I have way more questions. I think we need to take this interview back to the apartment. The next portion will require a lot less clothing.”",

      "content": "I OPENED MY DOOR, EXPECTING the delivery guy, but found Smith instead. I scowled and let him in. “I see you didn’t bother listening when I told you not to drop by?” “When do I ever listen? Where is she?” He looked around my apartment. “Logan?” Grace wandered out. “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know you had someone coming over.” She looked embarrassed. “He didn’t know I was coming. I’m Smith.” He held a hand out to her. She smiled faintly and walked toward him. “Grace.” She shook his hand and then came to stand next to me. “Smith is my best friend, and he apparently has a listening problem.” Her smile widened. “Oh. It’s so nice to meet you. So, you’d be the one who could tell me all he embarrassing stories about Logan then?” “You bet your ass I am.” He grinned and sat down in one of the overstuffed leather chairs in the living room. “By all means, stay a while,” I said sarcastically. “Logan, be nice,” Grace chided. “So, how long have you boys known each other.” She sat on the couch and curled her legs up under her body. “Since grade school,” Smith answered. “I guess you really do have all the juicy details then.” “And then some.” He winked at me, clearly enjoying himself. “Smith,” I warned. “Hey, I’m not here to start any trouble. I just wanted to get a look at the woman who’s finally tamed you.” He held up his hands in defeat. “Tamed you?” Grace arched a brow at me. “I’ve not been a relationship kind of man in the past. Let’s just leave it at that for now.” “I’ll take that as my cue to leave then. Grace, it was wonderful to meet you. I do hope that we can all get together before you leave.” He brushed a chaste kiss to her cheek. “We’ll be here for a couple more days. I’m sure I’ll see you again before I we go home.” Grace smiled. “We?” Smith arched a brow. “My sister Faith came with me.” “Sister, huh? And I take it she’s gorgeous like you, right?” He waggled his eyebrows. Grace laughed. “All right, Romeo, you were leaving, weren’t you?” I pushed Smith toward the door. “See you later Grace.” He blew a kiss. “I’ll just be a minute,” I said as I stepped into the hall with him. “What the hell?” I glared at him. “Sorry, I was curious about her.” He shrugged. “I don’t want to scare her away. She freaked out when she saw my toothbrush stash for overnight guests. I didn’t need you to remind her about all the sex I had before she came along.” “You were kind of a man whore.” “That’s the pot calling the kettle black right there. You are more promiscuous than me by far. Now get the hell out of here and don’t come over unless you’re invited.” I gave him a little shove to get him moving. “Logan.” “What?” I glowered at him. “She seems like the real deal, and I’m glad to see you happy for once. Now, don't screw this one up, okay?” I waited until he was on the elevator before going back in. Grace was still on the couch, looking out the window with a dazed expression on her face. “Sorry about him,” I said apologetically. “He seems great. Why didn’t you want him to meet me?” She frowned slightly. “It’s not that at all, Kitten.” I sat down next to her, pulling her against me. “I just wasn’t ready for the real world to crash in on us yet. I’m enjoying our cocoon right now.” She nodded. “I don’t want to go back to Chicago. I really don’t want to leave this apartment.” “So don't leave.” I kissed her. “You know I have to.” She gave me a reproachful look. “Do you?” I nibbled her earlobe. “Yes. I do. We talked about this last night. I’m not moving here. I have my whole life in Chicago.” “I’m not in Chicago,” I said gently. “Yeah, I could say the same to you about New York. Why don’t you move to Chicago then?” She laughed, throwing her hands up in the air. I thought for a moment. It wasn't the worst idea I’d heard. I could rent an office space for six months, see how this all played out. Business could be done anywhere, and Chicago was a big city with a decent international airport. “What are you thinking so hard about?” She tapped my nose. “Moving to Chicago. I’ll talk to my real estate guy tomorrow and see about looking for an apartment in the city, and an office to lease for a bit,” I mused. “What?” Her voice got all high pitched and squeaky. “I was kidding, trying to show you how absurd it was to ask me to move here after two nights together.” “I don’t think it’s crazy at all. In fact, I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before. Now, I won’t be able to be there all the time. Just like living here, I have to travel quite a bit. But, if you wanted, you could come along on some of the trips.” She got up from the couch and paced in front of me. “This is crazy.” Her breathing was ragged. “Stop. Sit down for a minute and tell me why you are freaked out about this.” I grabbed her arm and pulled her onto my lap. “We’ve known each other for like a second. There’s no rush, right? We don't need to relocate for the other person. I want to try dating, we can see each other when we can.” I thought for a moment. “No.” “No?” Her brows shot up. “Yep. Not going to happen. I’ve been without you for three months because I was stupid enough to let you walk away. Not happening again. I’m coming, and that’s all there is to it.” She looked like she might protest again, so I sealed my mouth on hers, stealing her words. When I finally pulled away, she looked up at me. “Are you always this bossy?” “Always. So, you better get used to it.” Part of me worried that I was coming on too strong, but I couldn’t make myself stop. When it came to Grace, I had no scruples. I would do whatever it took to keep her. “Are you really serious about this?” She chewed her fingernail absently. “I’m always serious. Answer me this, could you be happy not living in the same city? Now that we’re together, could you go back to being apart?” “No. I wasn’t happy before.” “I thought I was happy, but I was wrong. I’ve always had my rules, kept things simple. You changed all that, Kitten.” “I changed it?” She looked at me with those big brown eyes. “Of course you did. Up until you, all I wanted was no strings attached. Now, I want strings, I want the whole damn ball of string. Don’t overthink; just go with your gut.” I kissed her again. “You’re crazy, but okay. Move to Chicago.” She laughed. “It’s cute that you think I needed your permission,” I said before hauling her over my shoulder and into my bed. “I always get my way, Kitten,” I whispered before crushing my mouth down on hers. LOGAN AND I WERE ON our way to pick up Faith for dinner. He had elected to take a limo so we had more space. His hand was currently snaking its way up my skirt. “Logan,” I hissed. “What? He can't see anything up there.” He kissed my neck. “Good lord, you are like a horny teenager. We literally just had sex before we left.” “Doesn’t mean I don't want you again already.” His hand continued its exploration under my skirt. “I think you can wait until after dinner, I don’t really want Faith strolling into a car that smells like sex.” I gave him a stern look and removed his hand. “Oh fine. I’ll be a good boy. But you better reward me for my restraint later.” He tipped my lips up to his. “I promise I will.” We pulled up to the hotel Faith and I were staying at and she was waiting by the curb, looking like she just stepped off of a runway. She slid in on the other side and gave me a knowing look when she saw Logan’s hand on my thigh. “So, Logan. What the hell was up with you letting my sister be sad for three months when you could have just called her?” “Faith!” I shot her a dirty look. “No, it’s fine. I like that she’s protective. Grace and I have already discussed this, so let’s just leave it as things that are meant to be happen for a reason.” I looked up at him and was relieved to see a smile on his face. Faith could be really direct, which wasn’t always a good thing. “Be nice,” I mouthed to her. She nodded. “What have you two been up to?” “We’ve been discussing my move to Chicago.” He gave my thigh a light squeeze. “You’re moving to Chicago?” Faith’s jaw dropped. “Yes, for the time being, it’s more important for me to be with Grace than it is for me to live in New York.” “Wow, so you’re pretty serious, then?” Faith arched a brow. “As serious as we can be in this short of time,” he responded. “Okay, enough with the Spanish Inquisition.” I held up my hand when she opened her mouth to say more. “Fine.” She smiled benignly. “Where are we going for dinner?” “A little place my friend runs. You’ll love it,” Logan answered. We lapsed into sort of an awkward silence. “What did you do today?” I asked her. “Went to a bar, met a guy, the usual.” She flashed her million watt smile. “Anyone special?” “We’ll see.” My brows rose. This was not like her at all. Her normal response was no. “Tell me about him,” I prodded. “Nothing much to tell yet.” “Stop evading.” “I’m not evading. It could be a complicated situation, that’s all.” “You like him.” It wasn't a question. I knew my sister well enough to know what she wasn’t saying. “I didn’t say that.” A ghost of a smile on her lips. “You didn't not say it, either.” I grinned. “You should have invited him along tonight.” Logan jumped into the conversation. “No, I’m not inviting him along on a double date with my sister and the dude she’s screwing. Not enough alcohol in the world for that.” I shot her a dirty look, but it melted when I saw the smile on Logan’s face. “You really don’t pull any punches do you?” He shook his head. “I don’t see the point in not saying what I feel.” She shrugged. The limo stopped and Logan got out first and helped me and then Faith out onto the wet sidewalk. He took my hand and we walked up the street a bit and bypassed a mile long line as we walked into the restaurant. “I guess this place is popular?” I looked at the line and the tables crammed with people. “Yeah, Aaron has done a great job.” He kissed my palm before snaking his arm around my waist. We were led to the back of the restaurant and into the kitchen, where a table was set for us off to the side. “We’re eating in the kitchen?” Faith arched a brow. “Have you not heard of a chef’s table? It’s typically in the kitchen,” Logan responded and pulled my chair out for me, dropping a quick kiss on my shoulder. “If you ladies will excuse me for a moment, I saw someone I need to have a word with.” When we were alone Faith let out a breath. “Holy mother of God, Grace! He is so much hotter in a suit than he was this morning. Is he serious about moving?” I stifled a giggle. “He really is something in a suit.” I bit my lip thinking about what he would look like when I peeled it off of him. “Yes, he’s serious. I think he might be crazy, but at this point I want to see him as much as I can.” “With good reason.” She smiled slyly. “How’s the sex compared to the first night?” “Amazing isn’t a strong enough word. He is what I’ve been missing my whole life. I’m not even kidding.” “This makes me happy.” “What? That I’m getting good sex on the regular from now on?” “No,” she laughed. “You smiling this much. And seeing the way he looks at you. This makes me happy. I want you to be good, and you weren't before and for sure not after your night with him. You will be now.” “Tell me more about your mystery guy.” “Nope. I’m not going to think about him until at least tomorrow. Speaking of which, are you leaving with me tomorrow night?” “Probably not. I may stay an extra few days to help Logan get packed up or whatever it is he needs to do. Why are you being so evasive about this?” “I figured as much.” She grinned. “I promise I'm not being evasive. I just don't know what to make of him. He’s not what I wanted in my head. He’s as messed up as I am. He’s not a Logan, that’s for sure. He’s always gone, and he’s, I don't know, he’s fucking gorgeous. And I want him, even though I know it’s stupid to want him.” “The heart wants what it wants,” I said softly. “This has nothing to do with my heart, and everything to do with my hormones. Maybe I just need to go back there tonight and get him out of my system.” She ran a hand through her hair and blew out a breath. “Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to see him again before you leave tomorrow.” “I’ll think about it,” she said noncommittally. Logan came back in a moment later with Smith by his side. “Sorry to crash the party, mind if I join you?” He smiled broadly. “Please.” I gestured to the chair across from Faith. “What did I miss? I’m sure it was mostly about me right?” Logan sat down next to me and winked at Faith. She mouthed, “Oh my god,” when he looked away to signal the waiter. I knew just what she meant, those eyes should be illegal. “So, you’re the sister?” Smith turned his attention to Faith. An odd look crossed her face. “Yeah, and you are?” “Oh, I’m sorry, what an idiot I am,” Logan chided himself. “Faith, this is my best friend, Smith.” Smith took Faith’s hand and kissed her knuckles. “It’s a pleasure.” The two shared a look that could only be described as heated. The dinner conversation was fun, Faith and I tried to get Smith to tell us embarrassing stories about Logan. “I’m sorry, ladies, I’ve been sworn to secrecy on most things. Bros before hos, and all that. I’m sure you understand.” He grinned at Faith. No one could mistake the flirting between them. I could feel the heat from across the table. Smith offered to make sure Faith made it home okay, and the look on her face told me not to interfere. She gave me a wave and stepped into Smith’s car. On the way home, Logan pulled me onto his lap so I was straddling him. “Ever have sex in a limo?” “Nope, can’t say that I have.” I smiled down at him. “Well, you can take that off of your to-do list then.” He pulled my mouth down to his as he slid my skirt higher up my hips. I moaned against his lips as I slid down his length. I felt as though I had been starving the past three months. I knew one thing for certain, I wouldn’t be going hungry anymore. I kissed him roughly and sought my own pleasure, taking him along with me.",

      "content": "AS MUCH AS I WANTED to spend the whole day in bed with Grace, I had work that was screaming for attention. Plus the arrangements for Chicago needed to be made. I slid out of bed as quietly as I could, but she woke up anyway. “Where are you going?” She blinked up at me. “I have to go to the office for a few hours. Go back to sleep and I’ll be back before you know it.” I leaned down to kiss her, and she pulled me back down with her. “You know, this isn’t how getting up works, right?” I rolled her onto her back and kissed her. “Maybe I don’t want you to get up.” She wrapped her legs around my hips. This morning was going to take willpower for me to actually get out of the apartment. “Kitten, as much as I would love to stay in bed with you right now I can’t.” I kissed her neck. “See, now you’re sending mixed signals.” She ground her pelvis into me. I groaned and kissed her one more time before rolling off of her. “I need to get in the shower. If you would like to join me, we can make it a productive shower.” I grinned and held my hand out for her. I went to the sink to shave and brush my teeth. Grace joined me in brushing her teeth before she turned on the shower. It was all I could do not to slice my neck open as I watched her soap up in the mirror. She knew exactly what she was doing to me, too. My little sex Kitten. I shaved in a hurry and joined her. “Here, why don’t you let me soap you up?” Her soapy fingers slid down my stomach. Before long, I had her pressed up against the wall with her legs around my waist. I wanted all of her pleasure, it belonged to me. I pushed her further, setting a faster pace. I wanted to see her when she exploded around me, when she let go completely. “God, can we make this an everyday thing?” She panted against my shoulder. “If we did, we’d both be perpetually late for work.” I set her down and grabbed my shampoo. “I don’t think that’s too big of a deal, do you?” She grabbed her own shampoo and lathered her hair into a huge lump on top of her head. “I guess being the boss does have a few perks.” I kissed her again and rinsed my hair. After a quick soap down I was out of the shower with a towel wrapped around my waist. When I came out of my closet half dressed, Grace was laying on the bed wrapped in a towel. Something about this took me back to three months ago and I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach. “What time will you be home?” She stretched out on the bed. “Not much after one, but feel free to call and yell at me if I go too far past that.” I grinned and slipped my shirt on. “How is it that we just had sex and I already want you again? You do something ungodly to a suit Logan.” She bit her lip, a predatory look in her eyes. My unease was erased with those words, this was nothing like that day. She would be here waiting when I got home. “I’ll be home soon, try not to miss me too much.” I pressed my lips gently to hers and grabbed my phone from the nightstand. “Hurry home.” She licked her lips. “If you don’t stop that, I’ll never make it out of the house.” I kissed her again and left before she could talk me into staying. The limo was waiting when I stepped out of the elevator. I slid across the seat and started scrolling through the mountain of emails I had to answer. I was so absorbed in what I was doing I didn’t notice the door open and Smith slide into the seat across from me until we were a block away from where he got in. “Morning,” he said casually. “What, are you just in the habit of dropping in unannounced these days?” I laughed. “I figured I’d hitch a ride into the office since you were going. I saw Louis and flagged him down. I’m actually surprised to see you out of the house and fully clothed.” He grinned at me. “Work never stops, you know that. I’m going in to handle a few things and then I’m out. Speaking of which.” I dialed a number in my phone. “Jared, it’s Logan. Have you found anything for me to look at?” I listened as he rattled off everything he had found that would suit my needs. “I’ll be there in a few days, set up some viewings will you?” He spoke rapidly. “Good, see you then.” I hung up. “What was that?” He knew exactly who Jared was. “I’m relocating for a bit.” I hid my smile, knowing how he was going to react. “What? You’re moving to Chicago?” His eyes looked like they were going to pop out of his head. “I am. For at least the next six months, or until I can convince Grace to move here.” “Look, I know I told you to go for it, but I didn’t mean this.” “Smith, I won’t be talked out of this. So jump on board. Grace is who I want. This is what I need for right now.” “I’m kind of at a loss for words.” He just looked at me. “For once in your life.” I laughed. “Shai was right, man, I deserve happiness, too.” “Okay, now you sound like a chick.” “Shut the fuck up. You know what I mean. You both have been badgering me to go to her for months. With her, it’s so different. And I know how I sound.” I shrugged. A slow smile spread on his face. “I never thought I’d live to see the day when Logan McFadden would be all in.” “It will happen to you, too. When you least expect it, it will hit you like a bolt of lightning. And let me tell you, sex with her is so much better than sex with a random.” “Now you sound like Shai. She’s been pestering me about not being such a whore for a while.” He groaned and rolled his eyes. “Maybe you should listen. She’s pretty on the nose these days. Who knows, maybe it’s the extra hormones.” The limo pulled up to the McFadden building and Smith and I got out. He worked in marketing and research and development for me. “Are you going to tell me how it went with Faith?” I asked as we stepped out onto the street. “I don’t kiss and tell,” he smirked. “Since when?” “Since you’re screwing her sister.” “Nice. Always the wordsmith. Do you think I’m going to go running back to Grace with this? Besides, what makes you think she hasn’t already told her?” “Fine. It was amazing. Happy now?” It was my turn to smirk. “The DeLeo women seem to have our number, my friend.” “That they do.” He grinned. The lobby was a madhouse, people milled around waiting for meetings. “Please tell me you don’t expect me to move with you,” he asked as we walked into the elevator. “Of course not. You’re such an ass, you know that right?” “I don’t deny that.” He got off the floor below mine, leaving me alone with my phone once again. There was a text from Grace. Grace: Miss you already xoxo I smiled and typed out a quick reply before exiting the elevator. Brooke was waiting for me by the elevator with a cup of coffee and a stack of messages. “Welcome back, Mr. McFadden, hope you got everything sorted out.” “What? Oh, yeah, you could say that. Tell me, how would you feel about relocating to Chicago for six months?” Brooke was a damn good assistant, and I hoped she would say yes to coming with me. “Chicago?” “Yeah, I’m moving there for at least six months.” I walked briskly toward my office. “Can I think about it?” She looked uneasy. “Of course, I need to be there, and I would really like you to come as well.” I smiled and sat down behind my desk. Five hours later Brooke buzzed me on the intercom. “There’s a Grace DeLeo here to see you. She doesn’t have an appointment.” “Send her in.” I looked at my watch and winced, it was well past one o’clock, more like three. I got up just as Brooke opened the door. “I’m so sorry, I got caught up.” I walked briskly to her and took her in my arms, kissing her soundly. “Forgive me?” “With a welcome like that, how could I not,” she said, her cheeks flushed. Brooke made a sound to let us know she was still there. “Sorry, where are my manners. Brooke, this is my girlfriend Grace.” Grace held her hand out and Brooke looked mildly shocked as she shook it. “It’s so nice to meet you, Brooke.” Grace smiled warmly. “You as well Miss DeLeo.” She frowned slightly. “Please, call me Grace.” “Okay. I need to get back to my desk, I can hear the phone ringing off the hook.” She smiled and hurried out of the room. Grace gave me an odd look after I closed the door. “What?” “You do know she’s in love with you, right?” “Who? Brooke?” “Yes. You can’t tell me you haven’t noticed the way she looks at you?” She chewed her lower lip. “Well it’s one sided if she has any feelings for me. It’s only ever been professional with us. I asked her to come with me to Chicago, that won’t be an issue for you, will it?” She cocked her head to the side, thinking. “No, I suppose not. As long as you can tell me you have never slept with her.” “Kitten, did you not just hear what I said? It’s only ever been professional between Brooke and me. But I will say that jealousy looks good on you.” I grinned at her and went around my desk to shut down my computer. “Are you done for the day?” She followed me over. “I am now. Again, I’m so sorry it was longer than I had told you.” “Hey, it’s okay. I know the planet doesn’t run without you.” Her eyes danced with amusement. “You're not far off in that assessment, actually.” She rolled her eyes. “Come on, let’s go home so you can put your considerable skills to better use.” “I SPOKE TO MY REAL estate guy today and he has some places lined up for me to look at in a few days,” I said casually as we walked into my apartment. “Oh yeah?” She looked up at me. “Yeah, do you want to go look at them with me when we get to Chicago?” “I do, but I also have work that’s been piling up. I’ll need to go into the office for a bit. I had planned on going home with Faith tonight originally.” “But now…” I trailed off. “Now I’m staying with you to help you pack or whatever it is you need to do before we go.” “You want to help me pack?” This was a new one for me. Not since my mother had someone wanted to help me pack. “I do. I want to help you with whatever you need help with.” She smiled. “What did I do to deserve you?” I pulled her into a hug. “I’m not sure, but keep doing it.” She giggled as I squeezed her tight. “Well, let’s get to packing then.” I hustled her into my bedroom. “Just what is it that you want to ‘pack’ right now?” She made air quotes as she spoke. “Oh, there will be plenty of ‘packing’ later Kitten, for now we need to decide what I can’t live without for six months.” “I seriously can’t believe you’re actually moving to Chicago.” “I need to be where you are for the time being. It’s that simple.” I pulled her against me. “This feels right to me. Does it feel the same to you?” I hated feeling insecure, I wasn’t used to it, and I didn’t like it. “Of course, it does. You feel like home to me, Logan. When I saw you in the lobby the other day, my heart almost leapt out of my chest. I don’t want to be without you any more than you want to be without me.” Who the hell was I anymore? Gone was all the bravado and the rules I normally had. I wanted nothing more than to stay in bed with her all day. I didn’t even care about work, which was very much not like me. I should be worried, but I wasn’t. “Come on, let’s go and weed through your clothes and find what you can’t live without. Let’s start with suits shall we?” She kicked her heels off and padded into my huge walk-in closet. I followed her in and started making piles on the racks. “What about this one?” She held up one of my favorite suits with a huge grin. it was the one I had been wearing when we met. “I think yes.” I leaned over and kissed her cheek. “I think yes, too.” She beamed at me. An hour later we had piles of clothes set aside to be packed up. “Do you have boxes or anything?” “For what?” I asked. “Um, packing.” She looked at me like I was crazy. “I hire people for that, Kitten. I haven't packed a box in as long as I can remember. The only thing I will pack is enough clothing to see me through until the boxes come.” “Sometimes I forget how rich you are.” She shook her head. “Yep, that’s me, Mr. Moneybags,” I teased her. “Well, then what are we going to do with these piles of clothes until they get packed up?” She gestured to the stacks, piles, and racks. “Move them to the living room for now. I have better plans for the bed.” I grinned wickedly at her. “I seem to remember you saying something about wanting to pack me full of something.” She giggled and swayed her hips. “I think we need food before we can get to that, don’t you?” I went to the kitchen to peruse my stack of take-out menus. “Do you not have any food in the refrigerator?” She opened it up and found only milk, orange juice, and coffee creamer. “Really, Logan? This is all you have in here? How do you survive?” “I eat out.” He shrugged. “All the time?” “Yep. I don’t really cook, and I let my housekeeper go about seven months ago. So no, I never make food in this apartment.” She laughed softly and took my hand. “Come on, let’s go.” “Where are we going?” “To buy some food so I can make dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow.” She gave me an exasperated look. We walked to the grocery store a few blocks away because there was a break in the rain and Grace wanted to stretch her legs. “Do you love it here?” she asked as we walked hand in hand. New York in the fall was one of my favorite times of year. Not too cold, not too hot. “I do, but I’ll love being in Chicago just as much.” “Oh yeah, and why’s that?” She rolled her eyes, expecting a cheesy response. “Because you’ll be there.” I stopped and pulled her into my arms, stealing her breath away with a kiss. “What am I going to do with you?” She grinned up at me. “I think the question is what would you do without me?” I kissed the tip of her nose and we continued on to the store. “What do you want to eat tonight?” she asked as she grabbed a cart. “I don’t really care. I’m not picky about food.” I took the cart while she walked up and down aisles and threw things in. She sucked her lower lip into her mouth and pondered between two flavors of ice cream. “Get them both.” “We don't need both, we’ll only be here another day or so right?” “Kitten, just get them both, you obviously want them.” I took them and put them in the cart. “God, you are so bossy.” She sighed and continued with the shopping. “We’ve been over that fact before,” I said dryly. “I didn’t say that I didn’t like you being bossy.” She kissed my cheek and sauntered off down the aisle. “Has Brooke made up her mind about coming to Chicago?” she asked, and I could tell by her tone she hoped the answer was no. “Jealous, are we?” “No, not jealous. Just curious.” She gave me a bland look as though she was trying to prove the point. “No, she has not made up her mind yet. I promise you’ll be the first to know when she does.” I grinned. “Ass.” She stuck her tongue out at me. Back at home, Grace was in the kitchen chopping things and stirring pots. I wasn’t sure what she was making, but it smelled amazing. “Can I help?” I leaned against the counter. “Nope, but you can help with breakfast tomorrow if you want. This meal is all me.” “Okay, have it your way.” I left the kitchen, and went to the small office I had in the apartment. I had a mountain of work that I hadn’t gotten to when I was actually at the office. Seeing it all made me feel like I needed someone to take over for me. That thought was quickly squashed as soon as I got into it. There were three emails from the small record label I had acquired in L.A. All of them wanting to know what I thought of the artist they were considering signing. I looked over the information they had sent and fired off a quick approval. I could see the potential and knew that there was money to be made there. Next there were countless emails from my sister and a few from my mother. Both wanting to know why I wasn't returning their phone calls and text messages. I sighed and dialed my mom’s number. “Logan? What on earth have you been doing that you can’t call your mother?” she scolded. “Hello to you, too, Mother. I’ve just been busy.” “You haven’t been at work.” She shot back. “No, I haven’t.” God, I hated that she was checking in on me. It’s not like she even cared when I was growing up. “Would this have anything to do with the woman in the trench coat who accosted you in the lobby of your office building?” she said, her tone was brisk. My fingers gripped the phone in my hand. “First of all, she did not accost me. Second of all, she is none of your business. Is this why you called? If so, I need to go.” “Logan.” Her tone was icy. “Mother, have a pleasant evening. I’ll phone you next week when things settle down a bit.” “Your father spoke to Jared this morning. Were you planning on telling us you were relocating to Chicago?” “No, I wasn’t. Since when do you even care where I live?” I hated that she brought up my father, as though he was supposed to have some significance to my life. Neither of them ever cared enough to find out anything about my life unless it directly affected them. “I care because I won’t let some gold digging whore work her way into your life the way you let…” I interrupted her. “Shut up! This has nothing to do with her. You don’t know Grace, or the way we feel about each other. I will not sit here and listen to you call her a whore. She is anything but.” I slammed the phone down hard enough to crack it. Grace appeared a moment later. “Logan? Are you okay? I thought I heard shouting.” She looked concerned and a little scared. “I’m fine,” I said tightly. My temper was still up, and I didn’t want to take it out on her. “Give me a moment, okay?” I rose from my seat and kissed her lightly before going out to the balcony. Leave it to my mother to ruin a perfectly good evening. I gripped the metal railing and looked out over the city. Gradually, I relaxed. A few minutes later, I turned around to find Grace watching me from the living room, a nervous expression on her face. I opened the slider and walked in. “Are you okay?” she asked softly. “I am now.” I pulled her against me, inhaling her scent. She always smelled like flowers. “Do you want to talk about it?” She brushed her lips against mine before pulling back to look me in the eye. I could feel her anxiety. “No, I really don’t.” I pulled her in tighter. I WASN’T SURE WHAT HAD upset Logan, but I didn’t like that he wouldn't share it with me. I made up my mind that tonight I would get him to open up to me. I couldn’t stand the wall between us. I needed him to trust me. If whatever this was we were in was going to work, he had to trust me. “Dinner is almost ready. If you would like to join me in the kitchen, you can set the table.” “Your wish is my command.” He kissed my knuckles. “What are we having anyway?” “Tortellini in homemade sauce and sautéed veggies.” “Sounds heavenly.” He followed me into the kitchen. “So, tell me what that was all about?” I broached the subject again. “Grace.” His tone held a warning. “No. Sorry, but I’m not going to let this drop. If you want me to be a part of your life, you need to let me in.” I stood my ground, a hand on my hip. I was going to be strong about this, even though I felt like jelly on the inside. Confrontation was not my thing. I needed him to understand me, to get that we needed to be open with each other. He raked a hand through his hair and glared at me. I knew I was painting him into a corner, but I didn’t really care. “Look at it from my perspective, please. I’m an open book. You know all there is to know. You, on the other hand, I know almost nothing about. Every time I ask you something, you shut me down.” I let some of my frustration out. He sank onto one of the barstools on the other side of the big island. “I do want to let you in. It’s hard for me. I’m not free with myself the way you are.” “You think it’s easy for me to be free with myself? It’s not. It’s a battle with myself sometimes. But I have to trust you, I need to trust that you won’t crush me.” I forced myself to look him in the eye so he could see how serious I was. “I never want to hurt you, Kitten.” I nodded. “You need to give me something here, Logan.” “What can I do?” “Start with that phone conversation. Who were you talking to?” He sighed. “My mother.” “What made you so upset?” “She made insinuations about you that I didn’t appreciate. My mother and I have a very complicated relationship.” “I see.” I stirred the sauce in the big pot on the stove. “I don’t want her to ruin anything. She always does.” “She can't ruin things if we don't let her. Thank you for telling me.” I smiled. “It’s not going to be easy with me, Kitten, I want you to know that going in. I’m not easy, nothing about me is. You're going to have to work at this with me.” This bit of honesty was what I wanted. I needed it. “I’m willing to work at it, as long as we’re both on the same page about it.” The look in his eye changed, shifted to heat, a slow smolder. He was up and around the counter in a moment, and I felt myself being lifted onto the island. His lips grazed my collarbone. “I want to be what you deserve.” “You already are,” I whispered. His arms circled me, one hand on my thigh, the other behind my neck. “Kitten, where are your panties?” he growled as his fingers slid along the smooth skin of my upper thigh. Thank goodness for skirts. “Um, I didn’t wear any today.” I was not thinking clearly. His fingers traced little circles on my skin. “Good lord, what am I going to do with you?” He pushed my skirt higher. “I can think of a thing or two,” I panted as he closed in on the one place I wanted him to be. “What about dinner?” he whispered against my lips. “Dinner? It can wait. I think we have more pressing matters to attend to.” I gestured to the front of his pants. It was apparent that he was enjoying himself as much as I was. “Let me just turn off the burners.” I hopped off the counter and turned off all the knobs and put lids on everything. Logan was leaning against the counter when I turned back around. He had taken his tie off and unbuttoned his shirt. Delicious was the word that came to mind as my gaze raked over his muscled torso. “Like what you see?” His voice was sex itself. Smooth and seductive. I felt my knees go weak. “Very much.” I slid the shirt from his shoulders, pressing kisses to his arms as it fell to the floor. “Care to catch up?” He pointed at my blouse. “Your wish is my command.” I threw his words back at him while I untucked it from my skirt. “No, let me.” He took ahold of my hand. I nodded my acceptance and dropped my hands to my sides. He slowly inched my shirt up my stomach, his fingers touching every inch of skin he revealed. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything more beautiful,” he murmured after he had finished removing my shirt. I took his face in my hands and brought his mouth down to mine. “Let’s go to the bedroom, I think we need a bit more space.” He picked me up and hauled me over his shoulder. I squealed when he slapped me on the butt. When we got into the room, he practically threw me on the bed after he tore my skirt off. I watched through my lashes as he took his pants off. He was mouthwatering in nothing but his skin. “Come here.” I crawled back against the headboard. He covered me with his body, the weight of him, the heat of his skin, felt like heaven. He parted my legs with his knee and slowly slid in, inch by glorious inch. I shivered as his lips found mine. “Fast, baby,” I moaned. “I’m ready for it.” “Anything you say, Kitten,” he growled, setting a merciless pace. I squeezed his waist with my legs, the feeling so intense, I knew it wouldn’t be long. “I’m close,” I panted. “Already? Well, give me a moment to catch up.” His hands moved between us to cup my boobs. “Sorry,” I said between clenched teeth. “Never apologize for your pleasure.” He crushed his mouth onto mine a second before I exploded around him. He followed suit soon after. “Should we consider this make-up sex?” He laughed after he rolled to the side. “Do you think that was a fight?” I turned to look at him. “I don’t know, was it?” “No, believe me, you’ll know when we have a fight. Think of this as a reward for good behavior.” I scooted myself to the side of the bed and went in search of a shirt to put on. I found one of his t-shirts and threw it on quickly. “Where are you going?” he asked. “To salvage dinner. You should get up, too. The table isn’t going to set itself.” I heard him laugh as I walked out into the living room. I was pleased to see the food wasn't too far gone. I turned the burners back on and set about heating things up again. Logan came in a few minutes later wearing a pair of sweats. “I’m here as commanded.” “You know where everything is.” I pointed a spoon at him. “This will be ready in just a moment.” When we were seated with food piled on our plates, I decided to see if I could get him to open up more. “Tell me about your family.” I watched him to see his reaction. He looked up from his plate. “What would you like to know?” “Why aren’t you close with your mom?” “She’s difficult. Wasn't around a lot when I was growing up. Leah and I were raised by nannies and the housekeeper.” “That sounds hard.” I laid my hand on his. “It was and it wasn’t. Some years were better than others.” “What about your dad?” “He was busy running the company into the ground,” he scoffed. “My grandfather had given him a thriving company and he took it to the brink of ruin in the twenty years he had it under his control. He seemed to care more about chasing women than actually running the company.” “How old were you when you took over?” “Nineteen. I met with the board and we kicked him out.” “Wow. That’s crazy.” “It was what needed to be done. They wanted him out. Hell, he wanted out. It was killing him, the guilt and worry were taking their toll. He and I didn’t speak for five years after it happened. My mother, of course, was mortified. She fled to Paris for a few years. Until things had quieted down. She always has cared so much about what others thought.” “Your family sounds pretty screwed up.” “They are. Leah and I are lucky we had each other.” “I’d like to meet her.” I smiled. “You will. We’ll go see her after the baby comes.” He returned my smile. “What was it your mother said about me?” Hearing it made me nervous, but I needed to at the same time. His jaw tightened. “You don’t want to know.” “I really do,” I prodded, steeling myself for the words. “She called you a gold digging whore. Happy now?” He looked me in the eye and I could see the anger just under the surface. I sucked in a breath. “She doesn’t know me, how could she think that?” “It doesn’t matter what she thinks. What I think is what’s important, and I know exactly who you are, Kitten.” I decided that I had pressed my luck enough for the night and changed the subject to safer topics. After dinner, we curled up in bed and watched movies until neither of us could keep our eyes open any longer. I drifted off to sleep in his arms, which was right where I wanted to be.",

      "content": "I WOKE UP WITH GRACE wrapped around me like a vine. Anyone else and I would have kicked them out of bed, but with her it was nice. The plan for the day was for us to go into my office for a bit and sort things into piles to be packed up. I slipped out of bed and into the shower without waking her up. My conversation with my mother replayed in my head. It still got to me that she thought she had any say over what went on in my life. She was never there when I was growing up. I barely knew her now. That she thought her opinion even mattered got on my nerves. I needed to make some changes in how our relationship would play out in the future. “Logan?” Grace appeared in the doorway, her hair rumpled and a sleepy smile on her face. “Morning, Kitten.” “Is there coffee yet?” She yawned. “No, I hadn’t gotten that far yet. Sorry.” “It’s okay, I’ll pop out there and get it started.” She blew me a kiss and left in search of coffee. I found her in the kitchen, her hair in a messy bun and flour on her cheek. “What have you been doing?” “Making pancake batter,” she replied matter-of-fact. “Grab me the blueberries we got yesterday, please? Oh, and the chocolate chips.” “Chocolate chips?” “Of course. You can't have good pancakes without chocolate chips in them.” She grinned. I got the requested items and set them on the counter next to her. “Tell me, how are you at flipping pancakes?” “I’d say poor to fair.” I laughed. “I haven’t ever made them for myself.” “Good lord, I have so much to teach you, don’t I?” She kissed my cheek and positioned me in front of the stove. “Thank goodness you even had a griddle. Come to think of it, why on earth do you even have cookware if you never cook?” “You know, I honestly have no idea. I think it was one of those things that I just bought when I first moved in here. All of my apartments have fully outfitted kitchens, though I rarely use them.” She laughed again. “Okay, well in Chicago we will be using both your kitchen and mine. I’m not eating out for every meal.” “Both kitchens? You aren’t going to move in with me in Chicago?” I had assumed she would want to be with me. “No, I don’t plan on moving in with you. I’ll stay over sometimes, but we need to do this right. I’m not jumping in headfirst. We barely know each other, it would be a mistake to move too quickly.” She looked pensive. “Do you understand my reasons?” I did understand, but that didn't mean I liked them. I was moving my life for her, so she needed to be with me, in my home, in the home we chose together. I searched for the words to explain how I was feeling, but found none, so I remained silent. “Logan. Look at me,” she demanded. “You understand, right?” “Grace, Kitten, I’m moving my life to Chicago. For you. I wanted us to choose a place that would be ours, and live in it together,” I said softly. She shook her head. “I’m not moving in with you yet, Logan. I’m just not going to do it. This is all moving so fast, I can barely keep up. I know you’re used to getting your way, but you need to learn the art of compromise.” “I know how to compromise. I think you need to learn a bit about it as well.” I was angry. I stalked out of the room and into my office. “Logan!” she yelled from the kitchen. I shut the door to my office. I knew full well I was not being fair. I had never told her I expected her to live with me, but I just couldn’t stop the anger from bubbling to the surface. I didn’t like being told no. No one told me no. Ever. And here she was telling me no on a regular basis. This was not going to work for me. People did what I wanted, I couldn’t handle or tolerate anything else. It applied to all aspects of my life, including women. I needed control. The door flew open. “Who do you think you are?” Rage colored her features. “You don’t walk away in the middle of a discussion. And you don’t get to make demands of me and my time. I’m a grown woman and I run my life, not you.” She huffed out a breath. “Why don’t you want to live with me? Have you not enjoyed the past couple of days?” “It has nothing to do with enjoying being with you or not. The fact is that we don’t know each other, and I’m not stupid enough to follow along blindly with whatever you want. What happens when this ends and I’m alone with nowhere to go?” she demanded. “You think this is going to end?” That one hurt. When she said the words. It cut me. She lifted a shoulder. “I don’t know that it will. But things happen. What if, three months from now, you realize that I’m not what you want?” I saw it clear as day for the first time. Fear. She was just as afraid as I was. “You are what I want, Kitten.” I stood up and walked around my desk. “For now I am.” She shrugged, refusing to look me in the eye. “No. I don’t think you understand me. You are what I want. I have never wanted a woman in my life before. Not once. I want you in my life. You may not see that as a huge revelation, but I assure you that it is.” I rubbed my jaw in frustration with this whole argument. “I’m still not moving in with you,” she said defiantly. “Fine.” “Fine?” She arched a brow. “I’m not forcing you to live with me if it’s not what you want. But, I'm not going to stop asking you to move in, so get used to it.” That did it—a small smile flickered across her lips. “Are we done fighting now?” I asked. “I don’t know. Are you done being a colossal ass?” she shot back. “For the time being, yes.” I tipped her chin up and searched her eyes for understanding. “Do you understand how I feel for you?” “Yes,” she said softly. “Good.” I kissed her lightly and released her chin. “Let’s go eat so we can get into the office at a decent hour.” I smacked her on the butt and hustled her back into the kitchen. Thirty minutes later, we were in my car on the way into the office. Grace was quiet on the drive. “Are you still upset about earlier?” I put a hand on her knee. “No, not upset. Just thinking.” She patted my hand. “About?” “This whole crazy situation. I know that you’re used to getting your way all the time, but we’re different. I’m not an employee who has to say yes when you tell them to do something. I’m your equal, your girlfriend.” “I know that.” “Do you?” “Yes.” I sighed. “I’ll try harder okay?” She nodded. The rest of the drive was quiet, but I didn’t think she was upset with me anymore. Brooke was waiting at the elevator as usual, my messages and coffee in hand. “Mr. McFadden, your mother and sister have both called this morning. Also Mr. Janner is in your office.” She turned to Grace. “I apologize, I didn’t realize you would be here or I would have brought you coffee as well.” I noticed her tone was cooler than it should have been. Grace gave me a look at the mention of my mother, but she didn’t say anything. I was not interested in rehashing the previous conversation. “It’s not a problem, Brooke.” Grace smiled sweetly. “If you don't mind, I’d love a latte?” There she was, not taking anything from anyone. So fierce. I even kind of enjoyed when she defied me. “Of course, right away,” Brooke responded in clipped tones. “Thanks, Brooke. We’ll be in my office for the day. I’ll be leaving tomorrow for Chicago. I’d like your decision by the end of the week about coming with me.” “Very well.” She nodded and clicked down the hall. “Does she always dress like that?” Grace whispered as we walked. “Like what?” I knew exactly what she was talking about. “Come on, Logan, her clothes are painted on.” She rolled her eyes. “What did I say yesterday? It’s strictly professional with us.” I kissed her cheek. “Yeah, yeah, whatever. Come on, let’s go get to packing.” Smith was sitting at my desk on the phone when we came in. “Shai, I’ll call you later okay?” He laughed at something she said and hung up. “It’s about time you showed up.” “Please, by all means, use my phone and my desk,” I said dryly. “Well, it seems someone should be using it since you’re running off to Chicago.” He grinned. “Did you need something?” “No, just wanted to be sure I saw you before you left.” He walked around the desk. He turned his attention to Grace. “Take care of him, will you? I know sometimes he can be an ass, but he means well.” He kissed her cheek. “Shut up.” I laughed and hugged him. “I’ll be around. Plus I doubt I’ll be able to keep you away for long anyway. Not with so many new women for you to meet.” “You’re not wrong there.” He flashed a grin. “I’ll see you when I see you.” He gave a quick wave and left us alone. “Are you sad to be leaving him?” Grace asked. “Smith? I’m not really leaving him. Like I said, he’ll be around before too long.” We set about the task of dismantling my office. Brooke brought in some boxes at Grace’s request, and we packed as much as we could. “I HATE PACKING. WHY IS it that I wanted to help you again?” I sat back on my heels, covered in dust. Logan smiled. “I told you, this is why I hire people to move for me. “ “Don’t let me talk you out of it next time.” “I hate to tell you, but this is only about a quarter of what I actually need to bring with me when we go.” “Are you serious?” I stood up quickly. “Afraid so. I think we can leave the rest to be packed, what do you think?” “I think I agree with that decision.” I wiped my hands on my jeans. “Are you hungry?” He stood and stretched. “Ravenous. Let’s go grab some lunch.” Logan had called down and there was a limo waiting for us at the curb. He slid in and pulled me along with him on the soft leather seat. “What are you hungry for?” He pressed his lips to my temple and settled his arm around my shoulders. “Sandwiches and soup?” “Out of anything you could have, you want sandwiches and soup?” He laughed. “Yeah, do you have a problem with that?” I shot him a dirty look. “I wouldn’t dream of it.” He looked the picture of innocence. After giving the driver instructions, he shut the privacy glass. “Am I forgiven for before? I know I’m overbearing sometimes, I’ll try my hardest to work on that.” That surprised me. It wasn’t often that men like Logan, with the world at their fingertips, admitted to being wrong. “I’ll try to be less rigid in my expectations.” It was the least I could do. I couldn't really expect him to be everything I wanted overnight. “Thank you.” He kissed the top of my head. “We’ll figure this all out.” “Figure what out?” “Being in a relationship together.” He chuckled softly. I could feel the rumble of his laugh against my back. “You need to do that more often.” I sighed contentedly and leaned my head against him. “Do what?” “Laugh.” I yawned. All the packing had taken it out of me. I must have fallen asleep because it surprised me when Logan gently shook me awake. “We’re here.” “Sorry, didn’t mean to fall asleep.” I smiled. “It’s more than okay. I enjoyed watching you.” He kissed me lightly. Logan had taken me to his favorite deli. They had every kind of meat imaginable and a slew of yummy sounding soups. After we ordered and sat down outside, I decided to resume my questioning about Logan’s past. “I have more questions for you.” “I assumed you would.” He smiled indulgently. “When you said before that Leah’s baby wouldn’t be the first grandchild, what did you mean?” He tensed. “I’m not sure I’m ready to talk about this yet.” “Please, Logan. I just want to know you, who you really are. Trust me with this,” I pleaded. “I had a child once, a long time ago.” His voice was almost a whisper. “What happened?” I reached across to hold his hand. “The doctors called it SIDS.” His voice faltered. “I woke up one morning and went in to check on him and he was gone.” The pain in his voice slashed at me like a knife. I shouldn’t have asked this, it was too personal. “Oh my god. I’m so sorry.” I wanted to hold him in my arms. “It was a long time ago,” he said by way of dismissing me. “It doesn’t matter how long ago it was. He was still your son.” “His name was Jackson.” “How old were you when he was born?” I squeezed his hand. “I had just turned nineteen, it was right before I took over for my father.” “What about the mother? Where was she?” “Not in the picture. She didn’t want to be a mother. I wasn't at all ready to be a father, but he was mine and I loved him more than anything on this earth.” The emotion on his face was hard not to see. It was such a raw pain. How did you ever get over the death of a child? “How old was he when he died?” I asked softly. “He was almost one. He had just started talking.” He choked out the words. In that moment, I forgot that we were in public, that there were people all around us. I walked around the table and took him in my arms. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes, there was no way I could imagine the kind of pain he had felt. “I’m so sorry, Logan. And I’m sorry for making you tell me. You weren’t ready, and I shouldn’t have pushed.” I took his face in my hands and kissed him. “It’s okay. I would have told you eventually.” His voice was rough, thickened with emotion. He coughed to clear his throat. I could tell he was done talking about it. I wanted to ask more about how he had met Jackson’s mother and who she was to him, but I didn't dare ask anymore of him. He had already ripped open one scar for me, I couldn’t ask him to dig into the wound. Our food came out a few minutes later, and we lapsed into talk about me and my sisters. “Tell me more about your sisters. I want to be prepared when I meet the rest.” “You’ll like Hope a lot. She’s so grounded and solid. She really is the rock of our family. And my nephew Greyson, he’s amazing. He’s not even one, and he has us all wrapped around his little finger,” I blurted without thinking. “Oh god, I’m sorry. That was really insensitive of me.” “Kitten, it’s okay for you to love your nephew and be excited about me meeting him. What happened to Jackson was awful, but it was a long time ago, and I can be around other kids. I’m not going to break down and cry if that’s what you think.” “I don’t think that, but we had just talked about it and then I blurted that out.” I shook my head. “I’m fine, I promise. Keep telling me about Hope.” He motioned for me to continue. “She and I are the most alike. I would spend all my time at her house, but she has her own life and family.” I smiled, remembering nights laughing and watching movies. “You already know Faith. And before you ask, yes, she’s always that way.” He laughed. “I find her refreshingly funny. It’s nice to meet people who say just what they mean.” “That’s Faith to a tee.” “What about Charity, what’s she like?” he asked between bites of his sandwich. “So damn smart. She blows me away. None of us were surprised when she was accepted to Oxford. She’s the more serious of all of us. She doesn’t talk a lot, her nose is always in a book. God, I miss her already, and I just saw her a month ago,” I said wistfully. “We’ll go for a visit soon, I promise.” “You’re amazing, you know that right?” I beamed at him. The thought of seeing Charity again made me feel all giddy inside. “I do what I can.” He laughed. “Tell me about your parents? How long have they been married?” I smiled just thinking about them. “They are so in love that it’s almost sickening to see them. After almost forty years of marriage, they still seem like newlyweds. They run the family restaurant together and have for the past twenty years. It was a huge gamble when Dad decided to open it, but Mom stood behind him. I’ve always wanted that kind of love.” I said pressing a hand to my heart. “Haven’t we all?” An odd expression crossed his face. “They sound like amazing people. You’re lucky you had them growing up.” I nodded, knowing he was thinking about his own screwed-up childhood. “Sometimes the family we’re born with isn’t the family we need. Sometimes we get to choose the people we want as our family. You’ve done that with Smith.” I wanted to say he’d also done it with me, but I bit my tongue. I couldn’t voice that yet, it was too soon. It was too scary to for me to be that vulnerable. “True. Smith is one of a kind. The best family I could ask for.” The smile returned to his eyes. After lunch, we decided to go back to his apartment rather than going to the office again. Neither one of us was in much of a mood to pack anymore. I could tell just what he had in mind the whole drive back, he could barely keep his hands off me. “God, you’re beautiful, Kitten.” Logan kissed me as we rode up in the elevator. “I bet you say that to all the girls.” I giggled. “Not lately.” He grinned and pressed me flat against the wall. “I think the rest of the packing can wait until tomorrow, what do you think? We did enough today at the office, I don't really want to be doing more of it here. Especially when there are better things we could be doing.” His eyes had gone dark and my knees suddenly wouldn’t hold me up anymore. “I think we could do that. Did you have something else in mind for the rest of the evening?” I wiggled out from under him and walked out of the open elevator. “I do, in fact, have something else in mind, and it involves a lot less clothing.” He caught up with me quickly. “Hmm, less clothing you say?” I snatched his keys away and made for his door in a hurry. He was on me in an instant, his body pressing me against the door. I could feel his heat through my thin shirt. We practically fell through the door, both of us laughing. I was in no way prepared for what was waiting inside. She was standing by the huge window in the living room, and she wore nothing but a pair of black stilettos and a smile. She was gorgeous, of course. Long dark hair and startling blue eyes. Not to mention a body that looked like it was molded by the gods. I felt like I was going to throw up. “Logan, darling, I’ve been waiting for ages,” she purred “Fiona. Get dressed and get out of here.” Rage was rolling off of him in waves. “Now, Logan, is that any way to speak to your fiancée?” Fiancée? Logan had a fiancée? “Grace, can you give us a moment?” Logan looked nervous. “You know what? I really can’t. This is bullshit. You’ve had a fiancée this whole fucking time and you never said a word?” I was seeing red. “Ask him about Annabelle.” Fiona smiled viciously. “Grace..” He took a step toward me. “No, just don’t.” I started toward the door. “Good, let her go. Why don’t you come over here and greet me properly,” Fiona purred. “Wait, Grace. Please. We need to talk about this,” he pleaded. I didn’t stop, there was nothing I wanted to hear him say. He had lied to me, that was all I could think about. I couldn’t believe I had bought into his lie and believed that he really wanted a future with me. As the elevator doors closed, the tears began to fall down my cheeks.",

I don’t want to go and have all the hot guys snatched up by skanks before we even get there,” Faith complained, banging on the bathroom door. “Geez, I’ll be out in a second. Don’t get your panties in a bunch,” I yelled, trying not to smudge the eyeliner I was applying. I heard her grumble something as she walked away. Faith and I looked a lot alike; we both had long blonde hair and brown eyes, but she was about two inches taller than me and drop dead gorgeous. It used to bug me; but now I tell her she got all the height, but I got all the boobs. We went out every Friday night, mostly for fun, but I was always looking for Mr. Right. What I would do if I actually found him—I didn’t know for sure. Tonight we were headed into the city to see what kind of trouble we could find. Faith, of course, was slutting it up, dressed in a micro mini dress that barely covered her lady bits. She had a model’s frame, long and lean, and she could wear whatever she wanted. I, on the other hand, dressed a bit more conservative and made sure my skirts landed no shorter than three inches above my knee. I didn’t feel comfortable on display for all to see. I needed my cardigans and longer skirts. We hit the town running, and in no time, we were sitting in a The Violet Hour, a swanky lounge, surrounded by some serious eye candy. Faith was already off hitting on some hot guy at the other end of the bar, leaning in close as they spoke. Her hand on his bicep, a playful look in her eyes. Pure Faith. I shook my head; she was shameless when it came to getting some. I was sitting by myself, sipping some fruity, girly drink with an obscene name like “Screaming Orgasm” or something. “Can I join you?” a warm voice asked from behind me. I turned around and had to look up because the man was a lot taller than me, even on a barstool. My breath caught in my throat— he oozed confidence and sex appeal. Dressed in a navy suit, he was by far the most attractive man in the bar. I chewed my lip nervously, why would he want to sit with me when there were so many beautiful women ready to throw themselves at him? “Please do.” I smiled at him and took a big gulp of my drink before smoothing my skirt down over my knees “Scotch, neat,” he said to the bartender before turning to me. “Logan.” He took my hand in his and brushed his lips across my knuckles. “Grace.” My heart beat a little faster as he released my hand. I could still feel the tingle of where his lips had been. I was for sure out of my element here. “Are you from here?” he asked casually, his green eyes studying me. His finger tapped against the edge of his glass. “Yeah, born and raised. What about you?” “Here on business.” He didn’t elaborate further. I sighed inwardly, of course he wasn’t from here. He was too good to be true. Logan intrigued me. He was not the typical guy I normally went for. I liked surfer-looking guys; yeah, I know, Chicago was not exactly on the coast, but we all had a type. Logan was sexy as hell, though, his tan skin and dark hair perfectly styled in the Mad Men style that all the guys seemed to be wearing these days. “How long are you here for?” I hoped he’d say at least a week. “I fly out tomorrow afternoon.” He set his drink down next to mine and our hands touched. It was electric. Whatever this was that was happening between us, it needed to be explored, and now. Something about him brought out the shameless side of me, like I had no control. He was making me crazy. This wasn’t me. This was Faith. Maybe the fact that this couldn’t go anywhere was making me brave. I slipped forward a bit on my bar stool, letting my legs touch his. “Tell me something about yourself, Logan.” He shook his head. “Nothing personal, this is just about tonight.” His eyes smoldered. He clearly felt exactly what I was feeling Nothing personal. Could I do that? Go into this without knowing anything about him? I watched as he brought his drink to his lips again. How he savored the scotch. My nerves were like live wires. I had a sudden insane thought that I wanted him to savor me like he did the scotch. “Fine, I’ll go first. I like kittens more than puppies, my favorite TV show is Friends, and I love wearing heels, but my feet hate me for it. Now you go.” Logan grinned at me. “I happen to love kittens, too. Only a monster would pick puppies over kittens.” Oh, God, I was in serious trouble. “My favorite TV show is Pawn Stars. I know it’s not The Wire or some other manly show, but I like to know how much things cost.” He shrugged. I laughed and motioned for him to continue. “I’ve never tried to wear high heels, but I can imagine they would not be pleasant for your feet. I prefer wearing dress shoes to sneakers; I like to be put together and sneakers, outside of the gym, feel sloppy.” He took another sip of his drink. I watched him swallow and took a shaky breath. “I believe it’s your turn.” He was watching me, again. The look in his eyes was unnerving, like he wanted to consume me whole. “What do you want to know?” I fidgeted in my seat. “Are you single?” “I thought we weren’t getting personal?” “So, don't answer then,” he challenged, an amused twinkle in his eyes. “Yes, I’m single. Are you?” I hadn’t meant to answer, but he seemed to be able to illicit a lot of things from me I didn’t mean to do. He smirked. “Yes.” We chatted for another hour before I reached my patience limit. He apparently had, too. “Let’s get out of here.” His hand was at the small of my back, scooting me off my stool. “I need to find my sister and tell her I’m leaving.” I scanned the bar for Faith. She was still with the guy she found at the beginning of the night. She was perched on his lap, her arms wrapped around him. Logan and I walked toward her and, once we made eye contact, I nodded toward the door and held up my hand in a wave. Faith winked at me and made the ‘call me’ hand motion. Once we were outside, the reality of the situation hit me. Was I really going to sleep with a man I barely knew? That was Faith, not me. As if he read my mind, Logan spoke up. “We don't have to do anything you don’t want to do, Grace. Come with me to my hotel; we can order room service and watch a movie or something.” I hesitated. This was getting real, not just a conversation in a bar with a sexy stranger. He grabbed my hand and pressed my fingers to his lips. “Say you’ll come?” he whispered against my skin. “Why me?” I needed to know. I needed to hear that it was because he was feeling what I was feeling and not just because he was looking for an easy lay. “Why not you? You’re attractive, I’m attractive. I want you, and I can tell that you want me, too.” He stepped closer. I nodded. “I’ll come.” He grinned again and kissed my cheek. “Come on, my driver is just down here.” He held my hand on his arm and we walked together to the sleek black town car idling on the street in front of the bar. We drove to his hotel in silence, my heart racing as I sat close to Logan, my leg pressed against his. The heat of him against my thigh made my pulse race. I was lost in thought, wondering if this was the right decision—at war with myself. Almost all of me wanted to be in the car with him, but there was a teeny part that screamed for me to see that this was crazy. I hadn’t even told Faith his name, or where we were going. What if he was a serial killer and I ended up chopped into little pieces and stuffed in the mini fridge? I gave myself a mental shake, these were not the thoughts I needed to be having. “Grace? Are you coming?” He was standing outside the car, his navy slacks and white shirt looked impeccable, even after sitting in the bar and then the car. When had the car stopped? “Yeah.” I slid across the seat and took his hand, letting him help me out of the car. I didn’t notice the name of the hotel until we walked through the lobby where Waldorf Astoria was written on everything. When we got into the elevator, Logan pulled out his key card and slipped it into the slot. “You don’t have to push a floor button?” I was clearly not used to ritzy hotels. Logan shook his head, a smile on his lips. “No, no buttons.” The tone of his voice curled around my ears like silk. He was smooth, too good at this. I was out of my league. He erased the space between us and backed me against the wall of the elevator. His lips were on mine before I could think. His hands came up to fist in my hair and he pulled me closer into him. He let out a groan as my tongue licked at his lower lip. The elevator opened and we stepped apart, both breathing heavy. I gasped as we stepped into the room. This was too much. I put a hand on the wall, hoping to steady myself, but it didn’t work. “Just how rich are you?” I looked around the room in wonder. “That’s a relative term.” His eyes never left mine. Not a hint of embarrassment. This was a man who was proud of what he had accomplished. I frowned. “I think I’m going to go with very rich.” “That’s a fair assessment.” He stepped toward me. I held up a hand. “Hold up a second. I need to get my bearings, here.” I needed to catch my breath before he got me out of my dress and on my back. Not that it would be horrible for that to happen, but I wanted to slow this train down. He walked forward anyway, and kissed me softly. “I told you before, Grace, nothing happens unless you say it does. It doesn’t have to go further than kissing, although I hope it does. I can only imagine how your body looks under that dress.” He bit his lip and looked me over, hungrily. “Are you on the pill?” I nodded. “Good. I’m clean. I assume you are as well?” I nodded again, my voice had decided to leave me all alone in this line of questioning. There was that predatory look again, it did something to my stomach when he looked at me like that. “Where’s the bathroom?” I squeaked. He pointed in the general direction and I fled to safety behind a locked door. I leaned my back against it taking a few cleansing breaths. My hands shook as I turned the water on so I could splash some on my face. Holy hell, what had I gotten myself into? My last sexual encounter had been months ago, another failed relationship under my belt. One-night stands weren’t my thing. I looked at myself in the mirror, my nervousness evident by the anxious look in my eyes. “You can do this, Grace. It’s just sex,” I said aloud as I straightened my dress. I blew out a breath and went out into the lion’s den to find Logan. He was standing in the living room area of the huge penthouse. He had taken off his jacket and tie and now stood before me with a half unbuttoned shirt and bare feet. I tried my hardest not to drool, but he had the body of a god. All hard lines and rippling muscles, I just wanted to stroke him. “Are you comfortable in that?” He gestured to my tight dress and sky high heels. “Not really; but it’s not like I packed a change of clothes in this.” I held up the teeny little clutch that barely fit a cell phone and lipstick but looked so cute with my dress. “You can wear one of my shirts, if you want.” He stepped toward me. “Okay.” I couldn’t make myself say more, my mouth was suddenly as dry as the Sahara. “Come on.” He walked ahead of me into the biggest bedroom I had ever seen. There was a chandelier over the bed, a chandelier! Who has that in their hotel room? “Pick what you want from the drawers.” I expected him to walk out, but he sat on the bed and watched me. I rummaged through the drawers and found a black tank top undershirt and a pair of boxers that looked like they wouldn’t be too awful on me. “Let me help you with your dress.” He was right behind me; I could feel his breath on my neck. He slid the zipper down slowly, kissing the skin he exposed as it went down my back. I knew I should tell him to stop, but I couldn’t make myself say the words. I felt my dress hit the ground around my feet and he straightened up behind me. His fingers trailed along the column of my neck raising goosebumps as he went. “Do you want me to stop?” he whispered in my ear. I didn’t; far from it. I wanted him, all of him. “No, don’t stop.” I leaned my head back against him, my voice a hoarse whisper. He spun me around and trailed his fingers up my sides. “On the bed.” His voice was thick with need. I walked backward until the back of my knees hit the bed falling back. I watched as he unbuttoned his jeans and slipped them off. Mouthwatering, there was no other way to describe him. He was perfect; and I planned on spending a good amount of time licking every perfect inch of him. His hands were everywhere at once. He knew just where to touch me. I was putty in his experienced hands. “Tell me what you want,” he demanded. “Just you, only you.” I was desperate for him. I pulled his mouth down to mine and took what I wanted. Logan was insatiable; he took me places I had never been, made me feel things I didn't think were possible. Just when I thought I was done, he pushed for more. “Oh Kitten, we’re not even close to done.” He grinned wickedly and crushed his mouth against mine. He angled his hips in a way that hit every sensitive spot at once and I bit my lip to keep from screaming his name. I knew it at that moment, he had just ruined me for anyone else. Later, we snuggled under the covers and watched a movie. “I wish you weren’t leaving tomorrow.” I voiced the one thing I swore I wouldn’t. “I’m starting to regret my choice to be in Paris tomorrow night. If I could delay the trip, I would.” He kissed me. “Paris, huh? I’ve never been. I’ve never really been anywhere.” “I like Paris well enough; but Greece, that is one of my favorite places. The islands are breathtaking.” He stroked his hand through my hair. “Sounds like heaven.” I smiled into his chest. “It is one of the only places I've ever been where I can just be. Does that make sense?” Something in his tone gave me pause. I wouldn’t call it sad, but it was akin to it. “Sort of.” “When you have money, people tend to expect things from you. Your life isn't always your own.” His eyes took on a distant look. “Sounds kind of lonely.” I scooted closer, touching his cheek. “What makes you say that?” He looked down at me intently. “You didn’t mention any family.” “I assumed family was not a topic we would be discussing.” His lips pressed into a firm line. “Why? You know I have a sister; hell, you saw her. I have two other sisters, as well.” “Family is personal; this is just about tonight, right?” I wanted to tell him no—that it wasn't just about tonight for me, anymore. That I wanted to know him, know everything about him. “Yeah, just tonight.” It broke my heart into little pieces to say the words. He opened his mouth to say something, and I willed him to say the words I wanted to hear. They never came. I knew what this was, maybe that’s all I deserved. We watched three movies and a few infomercials; and before I knew it, the sun was starting to peek through the curtains. We had stayed up all night talking, kissing, and laughing. I stifled a yawn and lay back against him. “You should sleep,” he whispered. “No, I’m not tired.” I yawned and stretched like a cat. The last thing I wanted to do was waste the few hours we had left on sleeping. If I only got him for one night, I needed it to last. “Kitten, you can barely keep your eyes open. Sleep now, I need to jump in the shower. I’ll wake you before I leave.” He kissed me, lingering for a moment against my lips. I lay back against the pillow and listened to him start the shower in the next room. I debated on whether to sleep or join him. Joining him won out. If I was never going to see him again, I wanted as many memories as I could pack in. I let his shirt fall to the ground as I stepped into the steamy room. Logan was already lathering up, I could see him silhouetted in the steamed glass. He was facing away from me when I stepped in behind him, running my hands along the hard muscles of his back. “You should be sleeping.” I could hear the smile in his voice. “Do you want me to go?” I trailed kisses across his shoulders. “I didn’t say that.” He turned around slowly, water cascading down his chest. He took my hands and pulled me against him. Gone were the sweet kisses from before. His lips were hungry and insistent. He was going to devour me, and I was going to let him. Logan had me pressed against the tile, his hands soaping up every inch of me. “Are you ready for this, baby?” he growled. There was nothing slow or gentle this time. It was all about need. The only sounds in the room were the running water and our ragged breathing. I was wrapped in one of those white courtesy robes, curled up on the bed watching Logan get dressed. He was standing in front of me in just boxers and an undershirt, his suit laid out on the bed next to me. I couldn’t bear to watch him leave, so I got dressed quickly and stood by the door watching as he buttoned his shirt. “Don’t go, yet.” He was next to me in a second, his hand on my arm. “Make me stay then.” My eyes pleaded with him. I needed to be good enough for him. Not just another notch in his belt. I needed a shred of hope, for him to even just ask for my number. Something so I would know we would speak again at some point in the future. “Grace…don’t.” He pulled me into his arms, squeezing me tightly to him. I kissed him one last time, pulling myself from his arms and walked out of the room into the waiting elevator. The tears that had been threatening to fall streamed down my face the second the doors closed. I was stupid to let myself dream about a future with a man I had just met. He had been clear from the start, it was only the one night. I was the one who tried to change the rules. My hands shook as I texted Faith. Seeing the words on the screen drove a dagger into my already wounded heart. This has been a mistake. When the elevator opened, I prayed he would be standing in front of it begging me not to leave. Once again, I was let down. I pulled myself together long enough to hail a cab in front of the hotel; the poor driver didn’t know what to do with me. I could barely get my address out in between sobs. Faith was waiting for me at the curb. “Oh, honey.” She hugged me, letting me pour out everything I was feeling. “So, he just let you leave?” “Uh huh,” I replied glumly. By the time I had finally calmed down enough to tell her everything, we were sitting at our dining room table drinking coffee. “This is why I don’t do one-night stands. I'm not made for them.” I shook my head. “You feel too much for them. Your heart is too open. You’re looking for something that you’ll never find in a one-night stand.” She patted my hand. “Never let me do this, again.” “Was the sex good at least?” I laughed. Only Faith would ask me that in the middle of my crying fit. “Soooo good. The man knows his way around the female body. I just wish I knew his last name.",

He spun me around and trailed his fingers up my sides. “On the bed.” His voice was thick with need. I walked backward until the back of my knees hit the bed falling back. I watched as he unbuttoned his jeans and slipped them off. Mouthwatering, there was no other way to describe him. He was perfect; and I planned on spending a good amount of time licking every perfect inch of him. His hands were everywhere at once. He knew just where to touch me. I was putty in his experienced hands. “Tell me what you want,” he demanded. “Just you, only you.” I was desperate for him. I pulled his mouth down to mine and took what I wanted. Logan was insatiable; he took me places I had never been, made me feel things I didn't think were possible. Just when I thought I was done, he pushed for more. “Oh Kitten, we’re not even close to done.” He grinned wickedly and crushed his mouth against mine. He angled his hips in a way that hit every sensitive spot at once and I bit my lip to keep from screaming his name. I knew it at that moment, he had just ruined me for anyone else. Later, we snuggled under the covers and watched a movie. “I wish you weren’t leaving tomorrow.” I voiced the one thing I swore I wouldn’t. “I’m starting to regret my choice to be in Paris tomorrow night. If I could delay the trip, I would.” He kissed me. “Paris, huh? I’ve never been. I’ve never really been anywhere.” “I like Paris well enough; but Greece, that is one of my favorite places. The islands are breathtaking.” He stroked his hand through my hair. “Sounds like heaven.” I smiled into his chest. “It is one of the only places I've ever been where I can just be. Does that make sense?” Something in his tone gave me pause. I wouldn’t call it sad, but it was akin to it. “Sort of.” “When you have money, people tend to expect things from you. Your life isn't always your own.” His eyes took on a distant look. “Sounds kind of lonely.” I scooted closer, touching his cheek. “What makes you say that?” He looked down at me intently. “You didn’t mention any family.” “I assumed family was not a topic we would be discussing.” His lips pressed into a firm line. “Why? You know I have a sister; hell, you saw her. I have two other sisters, as well.” “Family is personal; this is just about tonight, right?” I wanted to tell him no—that it wasn't just about tonight for me, anymore. That I wanted to know him, know everything about him. “Yeah, just tonight.” It broke my heart into little pieces to say the words. He opened his mouth to say something, and I willed him to say the words I wanted to hear. They never came. I knew what this was, maybe that’s all I deserved. We watched three movies and a few infomercials; and before I knew it, the sun was starting to peek through the curtains. We had stayed up all night talking, kissing, and laughing. I stifled a yawn and lay back against him. “You should sleep,” he whispered. “No, I’m not tired.” I yawned and stretched like a cat. The last thing I wanted to do was waste the few hours we had left on sleeping. If I only got him for one night, I needed it to last. “Kitten, you can barely keep your eyes open. Sleep now, I need to jump in the shower. I’ll wake you before I leave.” He kissed me, lingering for a moment against my lips. I lay back against the pillow and listened to him start the shower in the next room. I debated on whether to sleep or join him. Joining him won out. If I was never going to see him again, I wanted as many memories as I could pack in. I let his shirt fall to the ground as I stepped into the steamy room. Logan was already lathering up, I could see him silhouetted in the steamed glass. He was facing away from me when I stepped in behind him, running my hands along the hard muscles of his back. “You should be sleeping.” I could hear the smile in his voice. “Do you want me to go?” I trailed kisses across his shoulders. “I didn’t say that.” He turned around slowly, water cascading down his chest. He took my hands and pulled me against him. Gone were the sweet kisses from before. His lips were hungry and insistent. He was going to devour me, and I was going to let him. Logan had me pressed against the tile, his hands soaping up every inch of me. “Are you ready for this, baby?” he growled. There was nothing slow or gentle this time. It was all about need. The only sounds in the room were the running water and our ragged breathing. I was wrapped in one of those white courtesy robes, curled up on the bed watching Logan get dressed. He was standing in front of me in just boxers and an undershirt, his suit laid out on the bed next to me. I couldn’t bear to watch him leave, so I got dressed quickly and stood by the door watching as he buttoned his shirt. “Don’t go, yet.” He was next to me in a second, his hand on my arm. “Make me stay then.” My eyes pleaded with him. I needed to be good enough for him. Not just another notch in his belt. I needed a shred of hope, for him to even just ask for my number. Something so I would know we would speak again at some point in the future. “Grace…don’t.” He pulled me into his arms, squeezing me tightly to him. I kissed him one last time, pulling myself from his arms and walked out of the room into the waiting elevator. The tears that had been threatening to fall streamed down my face the second the doors closed. I was stupid to let myself dream about a future with a man I had just met. He had been clear from the start, it was only the one night. I was the one who tried to change the rules. My hands shook as I texted Faith. Seeing the words on the screen drove a dagger into my already wounded heart. This has been a mistake. When the elevator opened, I prayed he would be standing in front of it begging me not to leave. Once again, I was let down. I pulled myself together long enough to hail a cab in front of the hotel; the poor driver didn’t know what to do with me. I could barely get my address out in between sobs. Faith was waiting for me at the curb. “Oh, honey.” She hugged me, letting me pour out everything I was feeling. “So, he just let you leave?” “Uh huh,” I replied glumly. By the time I had finally calmed down enough to tell her everything, we were sitting at our dining room table drinking coffee. “This is why I don’t do one-night stands. I'm not made for them.” I shook my head. “You feel too much for them. Your heart is too open. You’re looking for something that you’ll never find in a one-night stand.” She patted my hand. “Never let me do this, again.” “Was the sex good at least?” I laughed. Only Faith would ask me that in the middle of my crying fit. “Soooo good. The man knows his way around the female body. I just wish I knew his last name.",

      "content": "MOVING ON WAS NOT AS easy as it sounded. I tried my hardest to forget about Logan. He was burned into my memory—his touch, the way his lips felt against mine. I could still smell him on the dress I had worn that night. I hadn't been able to bring myself to wash it yet. It hung on a hanger in my closet, a lone reminder of the best night of my life The piece of my heart I would never get back. “That’s it. Get out of those sweats and stop moping. It’s been a month, Grace,” Faith reminded me, standing in the doorway to my room with her hands on her hips. “Leave me alone. I don’t care that it’s been a month, I wouldn’t care if it was a year. I’m sad, and I’ll be sad as long as I want to.” I turned away from her, putting my pillow over my face. “It was a one-night stand, not a relationship. Get over it and move on.” Her tone was gentle, but I could hear the impatience underneath it. “I know what it was; that doesn’t stop me from feeling the pain.” “You need to be showered and dressed in an hour, your date will be here to pick you up a little after that.” I shot up in bed. “What!” “Your date. I set you up with a friend of a friend. He’s cute, and nice, I think you’ll like him.” Her tone was like fake sugar, sweet with a bad aftertaste. “Call and cancel it.” I hopped out of bed in search of the phone. “No,” she refused, looking me square in the eye. “I’m not going to go, so either call and cancel or go on the date yourself.” My chin jutted out in defiance. “You’re putting me in a bad spot here.” She popped her hip against the doorjamb and studied me. “I couldn’t care less, Faith, I didn’t ask to be set up. As far as I’m concerned, you put yourself in this spot not me.” I folded my arms across my chest. She scowled at me, “Fine, I’ll cancel it, but you need to start living again.” She pointed a finger at me and stamped her foot. I knew in my heart she was right. Life couldn’t stop because of Logan. “I’m going to Hope’s, I’ll be back later.” I left the apartment. Faith was irritated, but I couldn’t stand her constant judgment. Only I could decide how to live my life. I didn’t need her to badger me about everything. Our sister, Hope, was the oldest of the DeLeo children, Faith was next, then me, and finally our younger sister Charity. Hope and I had always gotten along, she understood me better than Faith did. She was also closer to my temperament; Faith and Charity were more outgoing than we were. We all looked like different versions of the same person, blond hair, and dark eyes inherited from our mother, Love DeLeo. Faith and I lived in the heart of Chicago, smack dab in the middle of the city. We shared an apartment because neither of us could stand to live alone for longer than a month. The better choice would have been to live with Hope, but she had gotten married a few years back, and her husband frowned upon that idea. Thirty minutes after I left my place, I was knocking on Hope’s door. John, her husband, opened the door for me. He was handsome, but I never could see him as anything but a brother. Tall and broad shouldered with light blond hair and green eyes. He was a fireman in the city. “Faith at you again?” He pulled me into a hug. “Something like that. Is Hope around?” “She’s upstairs with the baby, go on up.” I followed the sounds of giggles and splashing to the bathroom just up the stairs. Hope was seated on the side of the big tub with water spots covering her clothing and hair. My adorable nephew Grayson was making a mess in the tub. “Hey.” I leaned against the counter and grinned at Grayson. At only ten months old, he had all of us wrapped up in a neat bow—we were his for life. She glanced at my pajamas and messy hair and smiled. “I take it Faith was not successful in setting you up then?” “She was not. Did everyone know about it but me?” “Well, not everyone. She didn’t tell Charity.” She smothered a smile. “Charity is in England, it wouldn’t matter even if she did know.” I picked at the label on a bottle of soda. “She’s worried about you, that’s all. We all are, honey.” I sighed. “I know you guys are. I’ve been trying to figure it all out. Logan’s gone, I know he is. I’m just confused, I don't know what I want.” “You don’t have to know that right now. You just need to stop moping around. Reengage in your life again.” “I’ll try.” “That’s better than nothing, I suppose. Now, come on over and help me wrangle this wiggly boy out of the tub.” She held out a towel for me. I scooped Grayson out of the tub and snuggled him up in the towel, hugging him against my chest. He patted at my face and made his cute baby noises. God, I loved this little boy. He made everything better. “If only everything were as easy as loving family.” I sighed and rested my chin on Grayson’s head. “Where’s the fun in that?” Hope winked at me. “Maybe I should let Faith set me up.” I chewed on my lower lip. “It couldn’t hurt. And it might be just what you need to jump start your dating life again.” She held her hands out for the baby. “Not every guy out there is like Scott.” Her tone was soft. My head snapped up at the mention of his name. “This isn’t about him.” “Isn’t it?” She gave me a hard look. “He messed you up. You haven’t really been the same Grace since it ended. Maybe this thing with Logan was good for you. It showed you that there are guys out there worth your time.” I chewed my lip and watched her walk down the hall to the nursery. Maybe she was right. I followed her into Grayson’s nursery and sat in the comfy glider chair while she got him in his feety pajamas. “Johnny!” she yelled. “Can you make Gray his bottle?” He yelled something back; I assumed he was saying yes because he came back up a few minutes later with a bottle. The look of absolute love in his eyes as he kissed my sister made my heart clench. I wanted that—someone to love like that. Hope handed him the baby, and we went down the hall to her room. “What was it about Logan that had you so wrapped up in him overnight?” She sat cross legged on her bed. “I don’t even know. Just him, his personality. Plus he was sexy as sin. Just looking at him made my knees go weak.” My cheeks felt hot. I flopped down onto my stomach next to her. “That’s how I knew with John. The first date, that was it for me. We’ll find that for you, Gracey.” She looked so hopeful, I hated to disagree with her. I had found it, but I let him get away. “What are you looking for in a man?” “Are you going to make a spreadsheet?” I laughed. Hope was uber organized, always had a spreadsheet for everything. She stuck her tongue out at me. “No, not making a spreadsheet. I just want to be sure we’re looking for the right man.” “I don’t know.” I threw my hands up in exasperation. “I want what you and John have.” I sighed. “You’ll find it honey, I know you will.” She patted my back. “I should tell Faith to reschedule the date from tonight.” I sighed. “Knowing her, she probably already did.” I spent the rest of the evening at Hope’s wrapped in a blanket of unconditional love. John would always have my back, I knew that with total certainty. And Hope was always there, no matter what. FAITH WAS WAITING UP FOR me when I walked through the door. “Feel better?” She smirked at me. “Somewhat. I assume you rescheduled for tomorrow?” “I did. He’ll pick you up at six thirty; no backing out this time. I had to think on my feet and come up with a plausible excuse for you.” “What did you tell him?” “I said you got called into work at the last minute. So start thinking up work related problems for your alibi.” I rolled my eyes and walked away toward my bedroom. “Grace, come on, you know I’m only doing this for your benefit right?” She trailed after me. “I know. It’s just going to take me some time to jump back in.” “Well, Eric will be a good warm up then. He’s super sweet, maybe a little dull, but he’s easy on the eyes.” “You’re really selling me on this guy here.” I stifled a laugh. “He’s a great rebound guy for you. There’s no future with him, but he’ll treat you right.” “I kind of feel bad for him now.” I winced at her words. “He knows you’re just coming off of a breakup.” “Is that what it was?” I snorted. “What would you call it if not a breakup?” She arched a brow. “I guess that’s what it was then.” In my own mind I had thought it more akin to being shown the door. “Just give tomorrow a chance okay? That’s all I’m asking.” She kissed my forehead and left me alone in my room. FAITH WAS RIGHT. ERIC WAS perfectly nice, but very dull. He totally believed the work excuse Faith had given him and didn’t even question me about it. “What do you do for a living, Eric?” I asked him, needing something to talk about. It was only just after we were seated and already we were tapped out. “I’m in finance. Nothing super interesting.” He smiled. “What about you? Faith never told me what it is that you do.” “I’m in PR. It can be challenging, but I really enjoy it.” “Which firm do you work for?” he asked. “My own. DeLeo PR.” I was proud of myself. All of the sleepless nights and hard work had finally paid off when I lasted past the first year. “Your own firm, you’re so young.” “I’m thirty-two, not terribly young.” This night was not off to a great start. “I just meant that it’s a great achievement to own your own business being as young as you are.” He smiled nervously. “Thank you. I’ve worked really hard to get where I am.” I took a long drink of the Cosmo in front of me. “Will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the ladies’ room.” “Of course.” He hopped to his feet to pull out my chair. I fled down the hallway to the ladies’ room and dug for my phone in my purse. Faith answered in the second ring. “Is it bad?” she asked. “So bad. He is so boring. We pretty much ran out of things to talk about before we were seated. Why did you think this was a good idea?” “I’m sorry. But at least you broke your dry spell, right? Do you want me to call you in twenty minutes and pretend to be work?” “Yes, please.” “Okay, will do. Now get back out there and try and make the best of it.” She hung up before I could respond. I sighed and headed back out to Eric. I knew that I didn’t want this—someone sweet and nice but dull. I wanted it all. Excitement and heat. I wanted Logan. “I ordered an appetizer for us, I hope you don’t mind.” He smiled anxiously. I felt bad just being on this date with him. It was obvious that he wanted it to work. I considered my options. I could wait until Faith called with my pretend emergency, or I could lay it out on the table for him. “Look, Eric, you’re a really nice guy,” I started. “Already? The really nice guy speech?” He smile faltered. “I’m not sure if Faith told you, but I’m coming off of a breakup and this just feels so soon to me.” Not to mention that he was not Logan, the man I really wanted to be sitting across from me. “Was it something I said?” He looked anxious. “No, no. Nothing you said. I’m just not ready, and I don't know when I will be ready.” “Can I call you again sometime?” He was grasping at straws. “I don’t think that would be a good idea. I don’t want to lead you on.” He looked at me, his eyes sad. “I understand. Thank you for coming.” He got up and pulled my chair out and helped me with my coat. I left the restaurant feeling terrible about myself. Eric was a perfectly nice guy who would have treated me like a princess. My problem was that I didn’t want perfectly nice. My phone buzzed in the pocket of my coat and I pulled it out to answer Faith’s call. “It’s an emergency, come quick.” She laughed into the phone. “I’m already gone.” Regret colored my words. I had known this wouldn’t work, but I had hoped it would. “Really?” “Yeah, I felt too guilty about not wanting to be there. I couldn’t do it.” I sighed. “Okay, so you’re not ready to date then?” “No, that’s not it. I’m just not looking for an Eric.” “What are you looking for?” “Someone who makes me feel something. Someone who makes me feel wild and out of control.” I sighed dramatically. “So you want the world?” Faith laughed. “No, just Logan.” I sniffled into the phone. “So you are asking for the world, then.” “I just want to feel the way he made me feel again,” I said sadly. “Come home and we’ll drink away your sorrows.” “Don’t you have a date tonight?” “I’ll cancel. I can get laid whenever, and you need me more than I need a dick.” This was what I loved about my sister, she was so brash. “Okay, I’m walking home as we speak.” “I’ll play Cocktail and whip you up something amazing,” she said cheerily. “See you in a few.” Faith was an amateur bartender. I’d been telling her for years she should open up a place. So far she had yet to listen. She was too into her modelling career to want something more. She was waiting at the door with a glass full of something lethal when I walked in. “Here, drink this. It will cure what ails you.” She clinked glasses with me and tipped the cup back until I had drained it. I coughed. “Wow, what’s in this? Lighter fluid?” “Close. Vodka, rum, and some other random stuff.” She grinned at me. “Want another?” “I know I should tell you no, but what the hell, pour me another.” That was the last thing I remembered about that night. Lots of laughter and too many drinks.",

All of the sleepless nights and hard work had finally paid off when I lasted past the first year. “Your own firm, you’re so young.” “I’m thirty-two, not terribly young.” This night was not off to a great start. “I just meant that it’s a great achievement to own your own business being as young as you are.” He smiled nervously. “Thank you. I’ve worked really hard to get where I am.” I took a long drink of the Cosmo in front of me. “Will you excuse me for a moment? I need to use the ladies’ room.” “Of course.” He hopped to his feet to pull out my chair. I fled down the hallway to the ladies’ room and dug for my phone in my purse. Faith answered in the second ring. “Is it bad?” she asked. “So bad. He is so boring. We pretty much ran out of things to talk about before we were seated. Why did you think this was a good idea?” “I’m sorry. But at least you broke your dry spell, right? Do you want me to call you in twenty minutes and pretend to be work?” “Yes, please.” “Okay, will do. Now get back out there and try and make the best of it.” She hung up before I could respond. I sighed and headed back out to Eric. I knew that I didn’t want this—someone sweet and nice but dull. I wanted it all. Excitement and heat. I wanted Logan. “I ordered an appetizer for us, I hope you don’t mind.” He smiled anxiously. I felt bad just being on this date with him. It was obvious that he wanted it to work. I considered my options. I could wait until Faith called with my pretend emergency, or I could lay it out on the table for him. “Look, Eric, you’re a really nice guy,” I started. “Already? The really nice guy speech?” He smile faltered. “I’m not sure if Faith told you, but I’m coming off of a breakup and this just feels so soon to me.” Not to mention that he was not Logan, the man I really wanted to be sitting across from me. “Was it something I said?” He looked anxious. “No, no. Nothing you said. I’m just not ready, and I don't know when I will be ready.” “Can I call you again sometime?” He was grasping at straws. “I don’t think that would be a good idea. I don’t want to lead you on.” He looked at me, his eyes sad. “I understand. Thank you for coming.” He got up and pulled my chair out and helped me with my coat. I left the restaurant feeling terrible about myself. Eric was a perfectly nice guy who would have treated me like a princess. My problem was that I didn’t want perfectly nice. My phone buzzed in the pocket of my coat and I pulled it out to answer Faith’s call. “It’s an emergency, come quick.” She laughed into the phone. “I’m already gone.” Regret colored my words. I had known this wouldn’t work, but I had hoped it would. “Really?” “Yeah, I felt too guilty about not wanting to be there. I couldn’t do it.” I sighed. “Okay, so you’re not ready to date then?” “No, that’s not it. I’m just not looking for an Eric.” “What are you looking for?” “Someone who makes me feel something. Someone who makes me feel wild and out of control.” I sighed dramatically. “So you want the world?” Faith laughed. “No, just Logan.” I sniffled into the phone. “So you are asking for the world, then.” “I just want to feel the way he made me feel again,” I said sadly. “Come home and we’ll drink away your sorrows.” “Don’t you have a date tonight?” “I’ll cancel. I can get laid whenever, and you need me more than I need a dick.” This was what I loved about my sister, she was so brash. “Okay, I’m walking home as we speak.” “I’ll play Cocktail and whip you up something amazing,” she said cheerily. “See you in a few.” Faith was an amateur bartender. I’d been telling her for years she should open up a place. So far she had yet to listen. She was too into her modelling career to want something more. She was waiting at the door with a glass full of something lethal when I walked in. “Here, drink this. It will cure what ails you.” She clinked glasses with me and tipped the cup back until I had drained it. I coughed. “Wow, what’s in this? Lighter fluid?” “Close. Vodka, rum, and some other random stuff.” She grinned at me. “Want another?” “I know I should tell you no, but what the hell, pour me another.” That was the last thing I remembered about that night. Lots of laughter and too many drinks.",

      "content": "“DID YOU HEAR WHAT I said Mr. McFadden?” My assistant Brooke waved her hand in front of my face. I blinked at her and motioned for her to repeat the question. “I asked if you were all set for your trip to L.A. Do you need me to run through your itinerary again?” She looked at me expectantly¸ her green eyes wide. There was a time when I would have considered taking her to bed. Brooke was every man’s dream—no matter what she wore, it looked like it was painted on her curvy frame. “No need, I know where I’m going and who I’m seeing. You can head out for the day if you’d like.” She frowned slightly. “Are you sure? I could order you some dinner and we can go over the Lowery file again.” “Go on home, Brooke. I’m leaving in a bit myself.” “Have a safe trip, Mr. McFadden.” She smiled and clicked out of the room in her Louboutins. I had to stop thinking about Grace. It had been a month, and I still couldn’t get her out of my head. I picked up the phone and called the one person who could snap me out of it. “Smith, it’s Logan. How would you feel about a trip to L.A. tonight? Meet me at the plane in two hours if you’re interested.” I hung up after leaving my message and finished up the work in front of me. My limo met me in front of the building and drove me straight to the airport. Smith was leaning against the hood of his car when we pulled up. We had a similar build, but his hair was black as night. We were quite a pair when we were stalking our prey. He didn’t say a word until we were in the air. “How bad is it then?” “It’s not good, I’ll tell you that. I can't get her off my mind, man. She’s all I can think about.” I raked a hand through my hair. Smith Janner and I had been friends since we were kids. He was the closest thing I had to a brother. He looked at me thoughtfully. “What’s to be done about it?” “Women, and lots of them.” A slow smile formed on his lips. “How much trouble do you think we can cause in the two days we’re there?” “I’d put my money on a lot.” I motioned for Sarah, my regular flight attendant, to bring me a scotch. “Is this going to solve anything for you? Or delay the inevitable?” “Too soon to tell.” I leaned back in my seat. Grace. What the fuck had she done to me? “Why on earth are you fighting this so much? From everything you’ve told me, she sounds pretty damn perfect.” “I don’t do perfect, and I don't do relationships. I’m not comfortable with them. They’re too familiar.” He laughed. “You and your rules.” “I like things the way they are. I have no room in my life for change.” I shook my head. “Everything has a place. Sex is just recreation for me, I don't need to be held accountable to anyone to get it.” I downed the scotch in front of me and signaled for another. “Pace yourself, it’s a long flight from here to California.” Smith nodded toward the drink Sarah had put in front of me. “The last thing I need is you being too drunk to get off the plane.” “Okay, that was one time, and it was ten years ago.” I shook my head. “I’ll never forget it, nor will I let you.” He laughed. “You’re such an ass.” “I’ll own that.” He lifted his drink in a salute. “Who are we meeting when we get there?” “The usual suspects. Shaileen was more than happy to take my call today. She promised to show us a good time while we’re in town.” I smirked. Shaileen was a woman who both Smith and I had dated at one time or another. It was never serious in any of the relationships and somehow we remained friends. We sort of looked at her as one of the guys now. A sexy as hell bro. She could drink us both under the table, and usually travelled with a pack of women just as good looking. “Sounds like we’re in for a fun couple of days then.” The flight was overnight, and we awoke just as we touched down in Los Angeles. “Mr. McFadden, Mr. Janner, enjoy your trip.” Sarah smiled as we stepped out into the morning light. I needed to stop thinking about her. It was only one night, nothing was that good. I had meetings in the city all day, but Shai had promised to be by our hotel by seven to take us out on the town. I needed the diversion. Grace. She was all I could think about these days. I wondered what she was doing, or if she was thinking of me. “I still say you should just call her.” Smith’s voice brought me out of my stupor. “Call whom?” I shot back. “The girl. The one you're running from.” “I’m not running. Even if I wanted to call her, I don’t have her number.” “Bullshit. You have a dossier on every girl you’ve fucked.” He was right, of course. I knew that Grace’s last name was DeLeo, and that she owned her own PR firm. I knew how much she had in all of her bank accounts as well. I could call her, but I wouldn’t. “I’m not going to call her.” “You are such a chickenshit.” He shook his head. “I’m not. I just prefer things the way they are. Women expect too much, and most only want me for my last name and what it can bring them.” I’d only had one serious relationship in the past, and she had proven to be very disappointing. I hadn’t made the same mistake again. “I’m letting it drop for now, but it’s not over.” Smith was a good friend, but he didn't get it. No one ever did. I still had my mom pestering me all the time about finding a nice girl to settle down with and give her grandbabies. No chance in hell. Not to mention my sister Leah was always trying to set me up with her friends. They didn’t understand me. I didn’t need the messiness of a relationship, I just needed the sex part. “Are you going to be at the hotel while I work? Or should we drop you somewhere else?” I asked, changing the subject. “The hotel is fine,” he answered as he scrolled through his phone. After dropping him off at The W, the driver took me to where I was meeting my clients. I was supposed to be buying out a failing record company, but truth be told, I didn’t care why I was here. I only cared that it was new and that I was going to get laid later in the evening. Spreadsheets were set in front of me in the glossy conference room. “As you can see Mr. McFadden, with your company’s backing we can achieve a profit within the first year of the merger,” a nervous looking brunette said, fidgeting with her glasses as she spoke. “I see your projections.” I tapped a finger to my lip. “Why my company though? Make me see why we are a good fit.” I needed to hear passion from her, to know that she was hungry for it. The woman, Casey Woodright, spent the next hour telling me all about the company and how she started it from nothing. She explained that they just needed some backing to make the leap into signing bigger named clients. If I was looking for hungry, she was ravenous. “We’ll meet at noon tomorrow to speak again,” I instructed as I stood to leave. “I expect you to show me what you’re working on.” “Does this mean you're going to sign the contract?” she asked me anxiously. “That remains to be seen, I’ll make my final decision tomorrow.” My mind was already made up, McFadden Industries would become a partner with them. I just wanted her to work a little bit more for it. Nothing worthwhile should be easy to attain. SMITH WAS RECLINING ON MY bed watching TV when I walked into the suite. “Was there something wrong with your room?” I threw my jacket on the closest chair. “No, your TV is bigger.” He grinned. “Whatever. Did you speak to Shai?” “She’ll be around in twenty or so. Did she tell you her news?” He arched a brow. “No. What news?” I narrowed my eyes. “I suppose I’ll leave it to her to tell you.” His smirk was annoying. I huffed out a breath and grabbed my phone out of my coat pocket. “Shai, it’s Logan.” “Logan, darling, what can I do for you that can’t wait twenty minutes?” I could hear the smile in her voice. “Smith alluded to some sort of news you have to share. He says he won’t share, so rather than spend the next twenty with his smug face, I’m calling you.” “I’m pregnant and engaged.” “Fuck me.” I blew out a breath. She laughed. “I’ll take that as a ‘congratulations’ and hang up now so I can concentrate on driving. See you soon.” She hung up and I dropped my phone on the chair next to me. “Pregnant.” “And engaged, don’t forget engaged.” Smith grinned at me. As long as I had known Shaileen, she was wild. She was the one girl who could party just as hard as me. The one who never wanted commitment or a ring from anyone. “What are your thoughts?” I sat down on the edge of the bed. “She seems really happy, so I’m happy for her. Not much that we can do about it anyway.” “Why the hell did she not tell me sooner?” “She probably thought you’d be pissed.” “I’m not pissed. I want her to be happy, of course. I’m just surprised.” “I was, too. Promise you’ll be nice when she gets here.” He eyed me. “I’m always nice.” “Right.” He rolled his eyes. “I’m going to go and change for dinner; I suggest you do the same.” He went through the adjoining door to his suite. Pregnant. Shai was pregnant. What was the world coming to? I changed into more casual clothes since it appeared that hitting the town was not on the table. So much for the distraction I needed. Fifteen minutes later, Shaileen breezed into my room. “Okay, tell me what you really think?” She flopped down onto my bed. She was gorgeous, of course, and her long strawberry hair was piled on her head in a messy bun. Her blue eyes held the question she had just asked. “I don’t know, Shai, I’m in shock.” “I told you a while ago I was dating someone,” she countered. “Yeah, but dating doesn’t always add up to a baby and a marriage, especially in our cases.” “I guess I just reached a place in my life where I wanted more. I’m not a kid anymore, and I don't want to be sleeping with random men for the rest of my life. Don’t you ever want more?” Grace. She was more. “I don’t know. Sometimes I do.” I went to the bar and poured myself a scotch. “Smith told me you met someone,” she said hesitantly. “He has a big mouth.” I glared in her direction. “She’s nothing, just a girl I met in Chicago, not serious. It was a night, nothing more.” I pounded the drink and grimaced as fire descended my throat “I can tell by your tone it wasn't nothing,” Shai said softly. “I don't want to talk about it.” “Maybe you need to,” she challenged. “Did Smith put you up to this?” “No, he didn’t. I’ve known you for a long time, Logan, and I want to know that you're going to be happy and taken care of.” “You make it sound like you’re dying. I don’t need to be in a relationship to be happy. I’m happy the way I am, with no attachments.” “No, you aren’t. The sooner you realize that, the better off you will be. I thought I was happy, too. It was all meaningless before I met Alex. The partying, the sex with strangers, it’s not going to make you happy, but she will.” “How do you know that? You never met her.” I crossed my arms defensively. “I can see it all over your face. She got under your skin.” She gave me a look that told me she knew I was full of shit. I sighed. “She did get to me. I can't stop thinking about her. The way her hair smelled, and the curve of her spine as she was lying next to me in bed. She’s in my head.” “Why aren’t you doing something about it then?” Shai demanded. “It’s been too long. I let her walk out and didn’t try and stop her. She doesn’t know who I am really, only my first name. It was only a night, but it was more at the same time.” “Can you find her again?” she questioned. I grinned. “I never lost her. I know where she is.” “Then why are you here with me, instead of there with her?” “Because I'm terrified to find out if what I felt was real or not,” I said softly. “Did she ask you to stay?” “No. She begged me to ask her not to leave.” Just saying the words hurt. This was not good at all. “It was real.” “How do you know? I let her leave, Shai, what if I go to her and she tells me to go to hell?” “I just know, honey. Ask yourself this—will you be able to go the rest of your life without knowing for sure if this could have been something?” “I don’t know.” I scrubbed my hands over my face. This was exactly why I didn’t do strings. “You've never been this way about someone, not even…” “Don’t say her name.” My tone was sharper than it should have been. “I’m sorry, I just can’t talk about her.” I softened. “I know honey. I was there through it all.” She patted my leg. “I just think you need to give this a chance and see where it goes. You owe it to yourself. You deserve so much more than what you allow.” She put a hand on my cheek. “I used to think that somewhere down the line, you and I would find each other again, when we were both ready.” I started to speak, but she silenced me with a finger. “That was just a young girl’s fantasy. We were never meant for each other. I love you, more than I should at times, but it’s there. Over time that love changed to something else, it morphed into something non-emotional, something more platonic. I think you’re truly remarkable, and you are worth so much more. Your money means nothing, all of it, the power, it means nothing if you don’t have someone to come home to at night.” “I love you too, Shai, and I used to wish that I could love you the way you deserved. I’m happy you found someone, and you know I’ll be Uncle Logan to your kids.” “And they will love you as much as I do.” She put a hand on her stomach. I hadn’t noticed the bump before, nor had I seen the ring on her finger. For the first time, I could see how happy she was. “Come on, let’s go find Smith and Alex.” She held a hand out for me to help her up. I arched a brow in silent question. “I told them we needed a minute.” She pulled me into a hug. “I love you.” She kissed my cheek. “I know you do. I love you, too. Now let’s go so I can meet your fiancé.” I pressed my lips to hers gently. My Shai was all grown up.",

I’m happy the way I am, with no attachments.” “No, you aren’t. The sooner you realize that, the better off you will be. I thought I was happy, too. It was all meaningless before I met Alex. The partying, the sex with strangers, it’s not going to make you happy, but she will.” “How do you know that? You never met her.” I crossed my arms defensively. “I can see it all over your face. She got under your skin.” She gave me a look that told me she knew I was full of shit. I sighed. “She did get to me. I can't stop thinking about her. The way her hair smelled, and the curve of her spine as she was lying next to me in bed. She’s in my head.” “Why aren’t you doing something about it then?” Shai demanded. “It’s been too long. I let her walk out and didn’t try and stop her. She doesn’t know who I am really, only my first name. It was only a night, but it was more at the same time.” “Can you find her again?” she questioned. I grinned. “I never lost her. I know where she is.” “Then why are you here with me, instead of there with her?” “Because I'm terrified to find out if what I felt was real or not,” I said softly. “Did she ask you to stay?” “No. She begged me to ask her not to leave.” Just saying the words hurt. This was not good at all. “It was real.” “How do you know? I let her leave, Shai, what if I go to her and she tells me to go to hell?” “I just know, honey. Ask yourself this—will you be able to go the rest of your life without knowing for sure if this could have been something?” “I don’t know.” I scrubbed my hands over my face. This was exactly why I didn’t do strings. “You've never been this way about someone, not even…” “Don’t say her name.” My tone was sharper than it should have been. “I’m sorry, I just can’t talk about her.” I softened. “I know honey. I was there through it all.” She patted my leg. “I just think you need to give this a chance and see where it goes. You owe it to yourself. You deserve so much more than what you allow.” She put a hand on my cheek. “I used to think that somewhere down the line, you and I would find each other again, when we were both ready.” I started to speak, but she silenced me with a finger. “That was just a young girl’s fantasy. We were never meant for each other. I love you, more than I should at times, but it’s there. Over time that love changed to something else, it morphed into something non-emotional, something more platonic. I think you’re truly remarkable, and you are worth so much more. Your money means nothing, all of it, the power, it means nothing if you don’t have someone to come home to at night.” “I love you too, Shai, and I used to wish that I could love you the way you deserved. I’m happy you found someone, and you know I’ll be Uncle Logan to your kids.” “And they will love you as much as I do.” She put a hand on her stomach. I hadn’t noticed the bump before, nor had I seen the ring on her finger. For the first time, I could see how happy she was. “Come on, let’s go find Smith and Alex.” She held a hand out for me to help her up. I arched a brow in silent question. “I told them we needed a minute.” She pulled me into a hug. “I love you.” She kissed my cheek. “I know you do. I love you, too. Now let’s go so I can meet your fiancé.” I pressed my lips to hers gently. My Shai was all grown up.",

      "content": "“GRACE? ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING to me?” Faith snapped her fingers in front of my face. “What? Sorry.” “I said Hope is on her way up and then we have to run if we’re going to make it to the airport in time to meet Charity’s flight.” I was so excited to see her again. She’d been away studying at Oxford for the past two years in England. She was coming home for the summer, and we were elated. “Come on, get the lead out,” Faith ordered. “I’m coming; I’ll meet you downstairs—I just need to find my shoes.” Hope talked nonstop the whole way to the airport. “Has it been a while since you’ve had adult interaction?” Faith laughed as we got out of the car. “No, why?” Hope had a quizzical expression on her face. “You literally talked the entire time.” “I did not,” she scoffed, looking offended. “You really did.” I patted her arm. “It’s okay, though, I don’t mind.” “I’m sorry. John’s been working so much lately, and I’ve been home with the baby by myself. I guess I didn’t realize how starved for attention I was.” She smiled sheepishly. “You know I’m always only a phone call away,” I whispered as we walked into the airport. “I know you are. You're busy with work, too, though.” For the first time, I noticed that my sister looked sad. Maybe domestic bliss wasn't all it was cracked up to be. “Come on, I don’t want to miss her coming down the escalator,” Faith called out from ahead of us. Turned out that us hurrying didn’t matter, Charity’s flight was delayed by two hours. “So, do we leave and come back or stay?” I asked the others. “We may as well stay. We can get magazines and food and meet back here to wait,” Hope mused. So we all split up in search of food and magazines. I was perusing the magazine rack when a familiar face jumped out at me from the cover of Forbes. My heart stopped. There he was, in full color, smiling at me under the headline “The Billionaire Bachelor”. Logan. I bought the magazine and sat in the first open seat I could find, flipping to his story and reading it through, twice. His last name was McFadden, and he was apparently the sole heir to some huge corporation that owned about a zillion other companies. I scoured each page of the story, looking at pictures of him with various women at charity events—the ballet, the opera, and all sorts of other snooty rich people events. They were all blonde and cut from the same mold; apparently he had a “type”. I for sure didn’t fit that mold. I wasn’t tall or statuesque. Seeing him was like a punch to the gut, even if it was only on paper. It reaffirmed that I was not, in fact, over him in any way. Logan McFadden. His last name, I could look for him now if I wanted to. Did I want to? Was I willing to find him and risk him rejecting me? “Hey, we’ve been looking all over for you.” Hope plopped down in the empty chair next to me, her brown eyes worried. “Sorry. I found this and sort of lost track of everything.” “What is this?” She flipped to see the cover of the periodical. “Logan,” I whispered. “What?” Her jaw dropped, and she studied his picture. Naturally, she knew about my brief encounter, but not all the details. “It’s an article about him and his life. Just seeing his face again…” I felt my composure waning. “Wow, he’s a hottie.” Hope peered at him. “I know,” I groaned. “Like, really hot. You never said he was this hot.” She looked closer. “Yeah, he’s insanely hot,” I said glumly Faith found us a few minutes later. “You have to find him; you know that, right?” Faith proclaimed. “What? Don't be crazy.” “Grace, seriously, you have been awful since that night. You need to do this, to see if there is something there.” “What am I supposed to do? Show up at his office in New York and say, ‘Hey, remember me? We had a one-night stand three months ago, and I can’t stop thinking about you?’ That would be nuts.” Just the thought of doing that made me sick to my stomach. “What if he feels the same way, though?” Hope chimed in—the voice of reason, as usual. “What if he doesn’t?” Could I do this? Could I fly across the country, chasing my destiny? The thought of him rejecting me again made my stomach twist. All thoughts of Logan were erased by the impending arrival of Charity’s flight from England. As soon as we saw her tall blond head coming down the escalator, all of us screamed her name and ran to tackle her. “It’s so good to be home.” She hugged me tightly, while we waited for Hope to bring the car around. “The UK was amazing, but there’s nothing like being home. I missed all you crazy bitches.” “That’s right, you did,” Faith chimed in. “Okay, so what’s been going on? Fill me in on everything.” “Grace is in love,” Faith said quickly. “What? Who is he? When can I meet him?” Charity talked a mile a minute. “I’m not in love.” I hid my smile behind my hands “Fine, Grace is in lust,” Faith said sarcastically. “Seriously, when can I meet him?” Charity bounced on her toes. “Never,” I grumbled. Charity looked from me to Faith for a moment. “Okay, spill it.” Once we were in the car, I filled her in on the whole situation. “Wow, I’m a little surprised since you are so not the one-night stand kind of girl. You’re a hearts-and-flowers relationship kind of girl.” “I know I am. The thing with Logan was a one-time thing; I’ll never do something like it again. I ended up worse for the wear. Enough about me, though, tell us about you and everything that’s been going on.” I squeezed her hand. My baby sister was back. “School was challenging, which was exactly what I needed. The workload was insane, like no sleep ever.” “Did you escape the library long enough to have a little bit of fun?” Hope called from the front seat. “I did.” Charity’s eyes sparkled. “Ooh, Charity met someone.” Faith grinned. “I did. His name is Jude.” She smiled sweetly. “How very British.” Faith laughed. “He is very British. And amazing and handsome,” she gushed. As much as I didn’t want to, I envied her. She had found someone who made her heart beat faster, and he felt the same way. They had something real. The next couple of days were spent all together at Hope’s house. It was one big pajama party. We laughed and caught up with each other’s lives. The DeLeo sisters were finally back together—everything was right with the world. Charity finally decided to stay with Faith and me for the night. After Hope went home and Faith went out for the night, we hunkered in to watch movies and talk. “Tell me more about your mystery man.” Charity curled her feet under her legs on the couch next to me and put a Twizzler in her mouth. “God Char, I wish you could have met him.” I sighed. “He made me feel alive for the first time in a long time.” “Then why are you not going to go and find him again?” she prodded, throwing a Twizzler at me. “He already let me leave once. I don’t know if I can live through that again.” I put a pillow over my face. “Stop being so afraid all the time. What if he feels the exact same way you do?” “I want to believe that. With all my heart I want to believe that.” My voice was thick with emotion. “Why do you think it’s not true?” “If he felt the same as me, would he have let me leave?” “Maybe. Think about this, what if he does feel the same way, but it scared him?” She gestured with a licorice stick. “Logan can have any woman in the world, Charity. Why would he want me?” “Shut up. I’m not going to listen to this nonsense anymore. Scott was a dick, we all knew it right from the start. Stop letting him ruin your life when he’s not even in it anymore.” She looked angry. This was the second time in a few days that my sisters had brought up Scott. The ex from hell. The man who broke my heart into tiny pieces. I was glad he wasn’t in my life anymore, even though the damage he inflicted was still healing. “I really think you owe it to yourself to go. You’ll always wonder about him if you don’t.” She smiled. “I’ll think about it.” That was the truth, I would most likely do nothing but think about it for the next few days. FAITH WAITED A COUPLE OF weeks before she brought up Logan again. She and I were out at lunch, prior to an afternoon of shopping. “You need to go see Logan, Grace.” She slid something across the table. I opened the envelope and saw a plane ticket to New York, leaving in two days. “Are you kidding me with this?” “Nope. Hope and I pitched in and got it. You need to do this. You will never be happy unless you explore what might be there. You know I’m right, Grace.” “I know you are right, but it’s so scary. He’s this amazingly handsome, incredibly wealthy man who could have any woman he wanted. If he had wanted me, he could have asked me to stay, or even for my number. But he didn’t. He didn’t even say goodbye—he just let me walk away.” Faith shook her head. “Don’t sell yourself short, cupcake, you're a hottie. He would be lucky to have you in his life. And haven’t you ever wondered if maybe he was scared of what he felt, too?” I chewed at my lower lip. I had wondered about it—in between being pissed off and really sad. Had he felt it, too? “Two days. That doesn’t give me any time to psych myself up for this. Are you coming with?” “Hell yes, I’m coming. Do you think I would send you to New York by yourself? I’m not, however, going to go with you to meet him. That is all you. So, the question is, are you in?” “Yes, I’m in. I think this is crazy, and I’m probably going to make a fool of myself in front of the most eligible bachelor in the United States, but let’s do it!” “I was so hoping you would say that,” she beamed at me. “You realize this is totally nuts, right?” I twisted my bracelet nervously. “It is, but you have to do it.” “I know I do.” I sighed. “Now, let’s talk fashion. What are you going to wear when you see him?” We spent a full hour going over all the details for our trip to New York. She and I would fly out on Wednesday evening, and I would go find Logan on Thursday, at some point. My stomach was officially in knots. Faith dragged me through countless stores, making me try on various slutty dresses and delicious heels that were way too high to be anything but awful to walk in. But I loved them anyway. “What do you think of these?” I walked carefully in a pair of sky high black heels. “They make your ass look amazing. You want your ass to look amazing when you see him again, don't you?” I sighed. “Yes, I really do.” In the end, I got two new dresses, a skirt and blouse, and three pairs of heels. I was going to look amazing. Even if my heart got smashed to pieces, I would at least look good when it happened. Later that night, I was over at Hope’s house sitting on the floor with Grayson while Hope made dinner. “Tell me what you’re feeling?” she called over her shoulder at me. “I’m so nervous. What if it was all in my head? He probably does that sort of thing all the time, why should I have been any different to him?” “I don’t really know the answer to that. But you owe it to yourself to find out if it was real.” “My head knows you’re totally right, but my heart is terrified to be smashed to pieces. He’s amazing, the whole damn package. Sexy, funny, and great in bed.” I sighed unhappily. “Don’t forget rich beyond all reason,” Hope chimed in. “Yeah, but I knew he was rich before,” I shot back. “Now you know exactly how rich, though. Does that change anything for you?” “Not in the way I feel for him. It just freaks me out a bit more.” I grimaced. “Why does it scare you?” She turned to look at me. “It’s just a little bit daunting. He can have anyone he wants, why would he want me?” “Stop it. I won’t hear you disparage yourself like that. You are amazing. Smart, and beautiful. The whole damn package. He would be lucky to have you.” She pointed a wooden spoon at me. “What if none of this was real?” I said softly. “If I built it into something in my head?” “What do you really think? Do you think it was nothing, or do you think it was something?” “I think it was something.” I sighed and snuggled Grayson against my cheek. “There’s your answer, then.” My sisters were totally right, there was no way I could move on with my life if I didn’t take this leap and go find him. I would always regret it if I didn’t go. “Why couldn’t things have gone differently before?” “Because honey, life isn’t always easy. Even when you get your happy ending, you still have to work for it.” A shadow crossed her expression. I set Grayson down in his playpen and went to sit on the counter. “What’s going on with you?” “What? Nothing. Why would you ask that?” “I ask because I’m not blind. You’ve been off for a couple of weeks. Tell me what’s going on.” A tear leaked down her cheek. “I don’t know what’s happening. I feel like he’s slipping away.” “John?” “Yes,” she whispered. “What’s been happening?” I put an arm around her shoulders. “He’s so distant. I can never get a hold of him anymore. He’s been working nonstop, or at least that’s where he says he is. I wish I knew what the problem was so I could fix it.” My heart broke to see her like this. She and John were always so solid, what we all aspired to have. “After Gray was born, it was hard. I’m not going to lie and tell you things have been perfect. As a new mom, I lost myself in him. It was all about the baby.” “Honey, that’s understandable. It was a lot for you to take in all at once.” “I’ve never stopped loving him, or wanting him.” “Have you told him that?” “So many times, over and over. I don't know what I would do if he left me.” “He’s not going to leave you. John loves you, and he loves Grayson. I’m sure it’s just work that has him stressed out.” I hoped to God that’s all it was. I couldn’t imagine John stepping out on her, but you never could tell with people. “I just hate feeling like this. I want to trust him, he’s never given me a reason not to. But something feels weird. This isn't him, or how we are with each other. I feel like it’s all going to fall apart.” “You need to talk to him. Be honest about how you’re feeling.” I wanted to reassure her, but at the same time I wanted to beat the shit out of my brother-in-law for making her feel insecure in their marriage. Here I was giving my sister advice, yet I didn’t want to follow it. They were right, I did owe it to myself to go see him. I needed to find out if this could really be something. “Okay, enough of me being silly. Tell me more about your trip and all the clothes Faith made you buy.” I rolled my eyes at the mention of the clothes and launched into the whole shopping story.",

Later that night, I was over at Hope’s house sitting on the floor with Grayson while Hope made dinner. “Tell me what you’re feeling?” she called over her shoulder at me. “I’m so nervous. What if it was all in my head? He probably does that sort of thing all the time, why should I have been any different to him?” “I don’t really know the answer to that. But you owe it to yourself to find out if it was real.” “My head knows you’re totally right, but my heart is terrified to be smashed to pieces. He’s amazing, the whole damn package. Sexy, funny, and great in bed.” I sighed unhappily. “Don’t forget rich beyond all reason,” Hope chimed in. “Yeah, but I knew he was rich before,” I shot back. “Now you know exactly how rich, though. Does that change anything for you?” “Not in the way I feel for him. It just freaks me out a bit more.” I grimaced. “Why does it scare you?” She turned to look at me. “It’s just a little bit daunting. He can have anyone he wants, why would he want me?” “Stop it. I won’t hear you disparage yourself like that. You are amazing. Smart, and beautiful. The whole damn package. He would be lucky to have you.” She pointed a wooden spoon at me. “What if none of this was real?” I said softly. “If I built it into something in my head?” “What do you really think? Do you think it was nothing, or do you think it was something?” “I think it was something.” I sighed and snuggled Grayson against my cheek. “There’s your answer, then.” My sisters were totally right, there was no way I could move on with my life if I didn’t take this leap and go find him. I would always regret it if I didn’t go. “Why couldn’t things have gone differently before?” “Because honey, life isn’t always easy. Even when you get your happy ending, you still have to work for it.” A shadow crossed her expression. I set Grayson down in his playpen and went to sit on the counter. “What’s going on with you?” “What? Nothing. Why would you ask that?” “I ask because I’m not blind. You’ve been off for a couple of weeks. Tell me what’s going on.” A tear leaked down her cheek. “I don’t know what’s happening. I feel like he’s slipping away.” “John?” “Yes,” she whispered. “What’s been happening?” I put an arm around her shoulders. “He’s so distant. I can never get a hold of him anymore. He’s been working nonstop, or at least that’s where he says he is. I wish I knew what the problem was so I could fix it.” My heart broke to see her like this. She and John were always so solid, what we all aspired to have. “After Gray was born, it was hard. I’m not going to lie and tell you things have been perfect. As a new mom, I lost myself in him. It was all about the baby.” “Honey, that’s understandable. It was a lot for you to take in all at once.” “I’ve never stopped loving him, or wanting him.” “Have you told him that?” “So many times, over and over. I don't know what I would do if he left me.” “He’s not going to leave you. John loves you, and he loves Grayson. I’m sure it’s just work that has him stressed out.” I hoped to God that’s all it was. I couldn’t imagine John stepping out on her, but you never could tell with people. “I just hate feeling like this. I want to trust him, he’s never given me a reason not to. But something feels weird. This isn't him, or how we are with each other. I feel like it’s all going to fall apart.” “You need to talk to him. Be honest about how you’re feeling.” I wanted to reassure her, but at the same time I wanted to beat the shit out of my brother-in-law for making her feel insecure in their marriage. Here I was giving my sister advice, yet I didn’t want to follow it. They were right, I did owe it to myself to go see him. I needed to find out if this could really be something. “Okay, enough of me being silly. Tell me more about your trip and all the clothes Faith made you buy.” I rolled my eyes at the mention of the clothes and launched into the whole shopping story.",

      "content": "I WAS PACKED AND LYING in bed with my now, very worn copy of Forbes, staring at Logan’s face on the page. Would he even remember me? I almost talked myself out of going, but something in me squashed that fear. I knew that I would never move on unless I had closure. I still remembered the feel of his lips against mine and his hands on my skin. The thought of him rejecting me, and never feeling that again, was not something I wanted to dwell on. Hope picked us up the next day to take us to the airport. “I think you’re doing the right thing.” Hope hugged me tight. “I hope I am.” I smiled weakly. The previous night I hadn’t slept a wink. “Go and find your man.” She squeezed me one last time before turning to hug Faith. “Make sure she doesn’t chicken out.” “I can promise you I won’t let that happen. There’s no way in hell that we’re flying all the way there for her to not at least talk to him.” I tended to be a nervous flyer, so Faith’s solution was to get me a bit tipsy before we boarded the flight. “Come on, let’s hit up one of the crappy bars they have here.” We wheeled along our carry-ons and headed for the nearest bar to our gate. “I don’t want to drink,” I protested when Faith slid a shot in front of me. “Yes, you do. You’ll feel better once you drink it.” She grinned and tossed hers back. I grimaced and followed suit, coughing like crazy as it burned its way down my throat. She was right, I felt a bit calmer already. An hour later, they called our flight, and I wobbled slightly as I hopped off my stool. The flight was over before I knew it, and we were in a cab on the way to our hotel. I had never been to New York—so I was your typical tourist, my face pressed to the window taking in the sights. I didn’t even care where we were staying; I had left it up to Faith. I was too nervous about finding Logan. Faith talked me into exploring the city with her once we were settled in. We were staying near Central Park, so we took a carriage ride through the park and then walked down to Times Square. We walked back up 5th Avenue, stopping to see the window displays at Sak’s, detouring to see the Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. “Is it like you imagined it would be?” she asked me. “You know, the buildings are bigger, but the area of the city is so much smaller than I imagined. I had no idea we could walk everywhere.” My head was on a swivel the entire time, I wanted to see everything. I had no idea where we were, Faith said it was the financial district, but who really knew. Tons of buildings and men in suits getting in and out of cabs and shiny black cars. Faith was laughing at something, her attention focused on a display window, when I saw him. Standing across the street with a group of men. I stilled and put a hand on Faith’s arm to get her attention. “What?” She got a look at the shocked expression on my face. “It’s Logan,” I whispered. She followed my gaze. “Shit. He looks good doesn’t he?” “Very.” For the briefest second, our eyes met across the busy street. His expression turned to one of surprise. The barest hint of a smile on his lips. “Are you going to go over there and say something?” Faith nudged me. “I…” Before I could answer, he was climbing into the waiting limo. Not even a second glance spared in my direction. “Um. What was that?” Faith asked. “He didn’t want me. I knew I was right.” My heart sank to my feet. “No. You don’t know that for sure. What if he didn’t realize it was you? There were a lot of cars between.” “He smiled at me, Faith. He knew it was me and didn’t come over here. He just left.” I had to stop myself from crying. “Give him the benefit of the doubt, honey. Go see him tomorrow and see what he says.” She put an arm around my shoulders. “Yeah, okay,” I mumbled and let her lead me through the streets. “Come on, we still have tons of stuff to see.” She put on a cheery smile and pulled me along after her. Just before midnight, after eating greasy pizza and a ton of gelato, we dragged our butts back to the Westin to get some sleep. We woke up to rain. Not exactly the omen I was looking for, although it sort of went with my mood. Seeing him yesterday had messed with my head. I started to panic. I hadn't brought anything for rain. Faith shooed me into the shower and went out in search of a sexy coat for me to wear. About an hour after I emerged from the bathroom, showered, made-up, and with my hair done, Faith returned victorious with a cute, black, knee-length belted trench coat that looked amazing with the red dress I planned on wearing. “Are you ready for this?” Faith hugged me tight. “No, but I’m going anyway. Wish me luck?” My heart hammered in my chest. “You don't need it, honey. Go and knock his socks off!” I hopped in a cab and told the driver to take me to the McFadden building in Lower Manhattan. My heart was in my throat the entire drive. This was it; I was really going to do this. The McFadden building was huge, bigger than any of the buildings surrounding it. I knew Logan was rich; but seeing this, a building with his name on it, really made it sink in. The lobby was a hive of activity, people milling around everywhere. How was I even going to get to Logan? I didn’t know what floor he was on; and even if I did, would they let me through to see him? I walked to the directory, next to the elevator banks, and looked for his name. I scanned the entire list, but I didn’t see it or an Administrative Office. Well, crap, this threw a wrench into my plans. I found a seat in the lobby and tried to figure out what my next move should be. That’s when I saw him walking through the lobby, toward the elevators, with a group of men. God, he looked sexy as hell in a suit. Just as good as I remembered. My pulse sped up. I wanted to either cry or throw up. My nerves were going to be the death of me. I gathered my courage and stood up as they walked past. Now or never. “Logan?” I called to him. My voice stronger than what I felt on the inside. He stopped and turned around, a slightly annoyed expression on his face that quickly gave way to astonishment. “Excuse me, will you?” he said to the men with him and walked toward me. Oh God, was this the wrong choice? Was he pissed that I was here? I waited for him, unable to move from the spot I was planted in. “Come with me.” He took me by the arm and led me outside and into a limo that was parked on the street in front of the building. “I shouldn’t have come. I’m sorry I bothered you.” He obviously didn’t want to be seen with me and was sending me away. My heart sank. “Damn it, Grace,” he growled getting in behind me. “I’ve thought about you every day,” he murmured, as he pulled me onto his lap and claimed my mouth with his. “Every day?” I was breathless. Giddy. “Every damn day, Grace. How the hell did you even find me?” He hugged me tight against his chest, showering me with kisses. “I saw you in Forbes.” I pulled back a little so I could see his face. “Al, take us to my loft, please.” He pressed a button on the side panel. “Right away, sir,” a voice responded. “I thought you were a mirage yesterday,” he mumbled into my hair, holding me tight. “So, you did see me?” My insides were turning to mush with his words. “Of course I saw you, Kitten, I just thought I was imagining it. I’ve been thinking about nothing but you for days. I thought I was having a mental break.” He kissed my neck. The rest of the drive was spent lost in each other, both eager to reacquaint ourselves with each other’s body. Logan whisked me out of the car as soon as it stopped and we raced through the lobby to the elevator. He must have pushed the floor button a zillion times, willing the elevator to go faster. His keys were out in his hand and he practically dragged me down the hall to the door. “Too many clothes, Grace, I need to feel your skin against mine,” he said, tearing at the buttons on his shirt. “Are you still on the pill?” I nodded, not trusting my voice. I didn’t want fast, though, I wanted to enjoy this. Being with him, again, was like drinking a cold glass of water after wandering in the desert for months. I wanted to savor it, to savor him. I untied the belt on my coat and slipped it off. Logan watched my every movement, a carnivorous look on his face. I smirked at him as I slid the tight red dress off my shoulders. Soon, I was standing in just panties, a matching bra, and heels. “Come here.” I obeyed and walked to him, the lust in his eyes making me feel brazen. “Tell me what you want, Logan,” I whispered into his ear, once he had me firmly in his arms. It was the same question he had asked me, all those months ago. Those words had resonated in my soul and played over and over in my head as I held onto his memory. “You, Grace; I need you. All of you.” His voice was thick with need. “Then, take me.” That was all the direction Logan needed, because he practically threw me on his bed. He got his pants and socks off in record time and descended on my body, pressing his lips to any part of me he could get at as he undressed me the rest of the way. “Baby, I can’t wait, it’s been too long.” He panted as he rose above me. I couldn't wait, either. I needed him. The feeling of him inside me was almost more than I could bear; he was made for me. There was nothing quick about this reunion. He moved achingly slow, each pivot of his hips was ecstasy. “Is this what you need?” His lips were at my neck, kissing and biting. “Always,” I breathed, surrendering myself to the pleasure. WE WERE LYING TOGETHER IN my bed a while later, and she asked the question I had been dreading. “Why didn’t you come back for me? Why didn’t you ask me to stay?” Her brown eyes were wide and vulnerable. I sat up and raked my hand through my hair. “I knew you were going to ask me that. I always knew where you were, Grace, just like I know your last name is DeLeo and that you have three sisters—Faith, Hope, and Charity.” I stopped and looked down at her, rubbing my hand along her arm. “My feelings for you scared me. I should have stopped you from leaving that morning. I regret that I didn’t.” Her face fell, the happiness that was there before was replaced with hurt. I could tell she was crushed, and I didn’t know how to talk my way out of this. “Logan, I’m at a loss, here.” She sat up, too. “You've known where to find me this whole time, but you never came for me?” “Baby, I needed you to find me. I needed to know that you felt it, too.” I took her in my arms, smoothing her hair as I hugged her. “We spent months apart because you were insecure?” The expression on her face tore at my heart. “Not insecure, Grace. I’m used to women falling at my feet once they know my last name. It was so refreshing to be with you and have you like the real me, not just who I am and what goes along with it. I was terrified that things would change if you discovered who I really was, that you would be different.” I dropped my head. “I understand fear; I get that, completely. I was so nervous you would turn me away or not remember me.” “How could I not remember you? Grace, you were the best part of my life—even if it was only for one night.” I kissed her softly. “So, now that you know how I really feel. What now?” Uncertainty colored her words. “What now? Now, I’m never going to let you go.” I tipped her chin up and kissed her. “How will we make this work, Logan? You live and work here; and my home is in Chicago.” “Grace, we’ll make it work, I promise. I need you.” “I’ve needed you every day of the past few months. I want to believe you and risk my heart on this, but I need something from you.” “Anything.” “I only want honesty from you, no secrets or lies. I need to protect my heart.” “I promise you I won’t lie to you. I’m all in on this, Kitten.” I wanted to take her in my arms, but she stopped me. “I’m going to hold you to that.” “You can hold anything you want against me.” I grinned, trying to lighten the mood. “Logan, be serious here.” “Okay, sorry. Keep going, what else is on your mind?” I kissed her. “How is this going to work, you’ll come see me, and I’ll come out here sometimes?” she asked. “I have a private plane honey, I can come to you as often as I like. Or send it for you to come out here. Long distance doesn’t have to be hard. Eventually, I would like you to move here with me.” “Move here?” She arched a brow. “My whole life is in Chicago. My work, my sisters.” “I know that, and I’m not asking you to give everything up, Grace.” I kissed her gently. “I’m saying in the future. You own your own business, you can move it to New York. Hell, I’ll give you a floor in the McFadden building.” “I don’t need charity from you. I’m capable of making it on my own. I’ve done well enough on my own so far.” There was a bite to her words. “I’m not offering you something I wouldn’t offer anyone else. I want you here with me, and I think you would do well. There are many different businesses that I don’t own that rent space in my buildings. Having you a few floors below me would be wonderful.” I paused and kissed her arm. “Think about it. We could have lunch together every day.” I kissed her shoulder. “And ride to work together in the mornings.” I kissed her neck. “I’m not the devil, and I’m not asking you to sell your soul to me.” I kissed her ear. “I’ll think about it.” She looked uncertain. “We’re just starting this, I don’t want to make future plans in case it doesn’t work out.” “Don’t think that it won’t. When I want something bad enough, I get it. And I want you.” I nipped at her earlobe. “Can we stop discussing business now? I think I have other things I’d rather be doing with you.”",

I want to believe you and risk my heart on this, but I need something from you.” “Anything.” “I only want honesty from you, no secrets or lies. I need to protect my heart.” “I promise you I won’t lie to you. I’m all in on this, Kitten.” I wanted to take her in my arms, but she stopped me. “I’m going to hold you to that.” “You can hold anything you want against me.” I grinned, trying to lighten the mood. “Logan, be serious here.” “Okay, sorry. Keep going, what else is on your mind?” I kissed her. “How is this going to work, you’ll come see me, and I’ll come out here sometimes?” she asked. “I have a private plane honey, I can come to you as often as I like. Or send it for you to come out here. Long distance doesn’t have to be hard. Eventually, I would like you to move here with me.” “Move here?” She arched a brow. “My whole life is in Chicago. My work, my sisters.” “I know that, and I’m not asking you to give everything up, Grace.” I kissed her gently. “I’m saying in the future. You own your own business, you can move it to New York. Hell, I’ll give you a floor in the McFadden building.” “I don’t need charity from you. I’m capable of making it on my own. I’ve done well enough on my own so far.” There was a bite to her words. “I’m not offering you something I wouldn’t offer anyone else. I want you here with me, and I think you would do well. There are many different businesses that I don’t own that rent space in my buildings. Having you a few floors below me would be wonderful.” I paused and kissed her arm. “Think about it. We could have lunch together every day.” I kissed her shoulder. “And ride to work together in the mornings.” I kissed her neck. “I’m not the devil, and I’m not asking you to sell your soul to me.” I kissed her ear. “I’ll think about it.” She looked uncertain. “We’re just starting this, I don’t want to make future plans in case it doesn’t work out.” “Don’t think that it won’t. When I want something bad enough, I get it. And I want you.” I nipped at her earlobe. “Can we stop discussing business now? I think I have other things I’d rather be doing with you.”",

      "content": "IT WAS LATE, TOO LATE for me to still be awake. But I couldn’t stop staring at the angel currently in my arms. Grace. She had found me. She had come back to me. My phone buzzed on the nightstand next to me. A quick glance showed a text from Smith. Smith: What the heck, man? You’ve been MIA all day. Where the hell are you? Me: Something came up. Smith: What exactly would that be? Or should I say whom? Me: Don’t be a dick. Smith: Stop being evasive. I’m calling you. Before I could respond the phone in my hand started ringing. Grace shot up to a sitting position rubbing her eyes. “Logan?” “Go back to bed. I have to take this call.” I kissed her softly and waited until she was lying on her side before exiting the room and heading out to the patio. “Seriously, what the hell is going on with you?” Smith’s irritated voice came through loud and clear. “She found me.” I drummed my fingers on the railing. “Who found you?” “Grace. She showed up at my office.” “Well, then.” “Exactly.” He knew how huge this was for me. “What are you doing about it?” he asked. “What I should have done before. I don’t plan on letting her get away this time. Shai was right, you were right. She’s what I need.” Laughter rolled through the line. “I never thought I would see the day when you would want to settle down with one person.” “Me neither, man. This is new territory for me.” I smiled as I said the words. “When can I meet her?” “Not for a bit, I don’t want to scare her off.” “Are you saying you think I’m scary?” Smith laughed. “No, you’re just a lot to take in. Plus I know how you are around beautiful women, and I want Grace all to myself for as long as I can have her.” “You sound happy.” “You know, I think I am.” I chuckled. This is what happy felt like. “Okay, call me sometime so I don’t think you’ve died from lack of electrolytes or something.” “You’re such a dick. Yeah, I’ll call you when I call you.” I pushed end and stood against the railing, watching the cars speed by on the street below. Grace walked out, wearing one of my shirts and a sleepy look on her face. “Everything okay?” She wrapped herself around me. “Yeah, totally good. Just a friend.” “How are you feeling about this. Now that that sexual haze has lifted.” She looked up at me, the nervous expression on her face tore me to shreds. “If you think I’ve changed my mind, you’re mistaken. Now that I have you, I’m never letting you go. We tried it apart, and it didn’t work. We were both miserable. I know I owe it to myself to see where this goes. I’m not going to say I love you, because we are very much not at that point. I will say I’m in lust with you. I can’t stop thinking about you. The smell of your hair, the taste of your lips, the little sounds you make in the heat of pleasure—I want to know where this goes. I’ve never wanted that before.” “I’m scared of all of this. But I want it all the same. I tried to tell myself that it wasn’t real, that what I felt for you was all in my head. I even went on a few dates, but no one compared to you. I agree, we do owe it to ourselves to see this through. Even if it ends horribly, we’d know we gave it an honest shot.” I tipped her lips up to mine, her vulnerability somehow made her even sexier. I had never liked that in the past, always steered clear of emotional attachment. “How long are you here for?” I wrapped my arms around her, wanting her to say forever. “A few more days. Faith is with me.” I arched a brow. “Moral support and all that.” She smiled. “I wasn’t at all sure I could have gotten on the plane without her.” “Then it seems I owe her dinner.” I kissed her again. I could never get sick of those pouty lips. “I’ll call her in the morning. I can't wait for you to meet all of my sisters. They are probably dying right now in anticipation.” She laughed. “Talked about me a lot did you?” I grinned. “Just a bit. I’m sure you talked to your friends about me, didn't you?” She pouted. “I’m more private, but yes, your name came up in a few conversations.” “As long as it came up, we’re all good. I would hate to have been the only one pining away.” She extracted herself from my arms and walked back to the sliding door, letting the button up shirt she was wearing fall to the floor as she stepped inside. “Oh no, Kitten, you were not alone in the pining department,” I said in a low growl as I stepped through the door after her. “And now? Are you still wanting me?” She bit her lower lip. “What do you think?” I slid the pajama pants off my hips and had her pressed against the wall in two seconds flat. She arched her back and ground her hips into me. I bent down and nipped at her neck, wanting to mark her, to claim her as mine. “Mine now. All mine,” I whispered in her ear. I wanted her to know it, deep in her soul. To know without a doubt that she belonged to me now. “Yes.” Her voice was breathy, barely a whisper. “All yours.” I hitched her legs up around my hips, not wanting to wait for a bed. God, she was perfect. Every part of her was made for me. Her eyes were closed, totally lost to everything but what I was currently making her feel. I could get used to this. “Logan.” She sighed and her head fell against my chest. The feeling of her tightening all around me was too much. I had to move or my legs were going to give out. I ran as quickly as I could to the bed and tossed her on her back. She giggled and threw a pillow at me. I flopped down on my side and pulled her against me, wrapping my arms around her. “I’m glad you came Grace.” I kissed her ear. “I am, too,” she whispered. “This feels like a dream. The dream I had for three months straight.” “I’m sorry,” I said lamely. I didn’t normally do apologies. The words felt foreign on my tongue. “For what?” She wiggled out of my arms and turned to face me. “For letting you leave. For not coming back for you. For all of it.” “It all worked out, right?” “Yeah, it did. But the time we could have been together was wasted because I was too stupid and too proud to come to you. I can promise I’ll never let you slip away again, Kitten.” “Promise you’ll always fight for us?” She grinned. “I promise. Now come back here, I liked you all wrapped up in my arms.” She complied and snuggled up against me, my arms wrapped around her. We spent the rest of the night talking about the future and what we wanted. As I drifted off to sleep, I couldn’t help feeling like the luckiest man on earth to have her with me. I knew I would move heaven and earth to keep her, for as long as she would have me. WHEN I FIRST OPENED MY eyes, I couldn’t tell where I was. I didn’t recognize anything in the room. Then I felt the arm around me and the warm body pressed firmly against my back and it all came flooding back. He wanted me. Logan McFadden wanted me in his life! “Morning Kitten.” I could feel the rumble of his voice through my back. “Morning.” I slid out of his embrace and stood up. “Um, bathroom?” He flipped onto his back and pointed off to the left, a grin on his face as he watched me walk away. I couldn’t stop smiling. The countless orgasms probably attributed to it, but the fact that he wanted me and didn’t turn me away was huge. I knew I needed to call Faith and let her know I was still breathing, but I didn’t want the real world to come crashing in on us yet. “You coming out, or am I coming in?” his voice called from just outside the door. “They both sound like good options.” I opened the door and let him into the huge bathroom. “I think we should shower and then go out for breakfast. How does that sound?” He kissed my neck. “Sounds good. I need to call Faith and stop by the hotel to pick some stuff up anyway. I didn’t even bring a toothbrush or a change of clothes with me.” “I have the toothbrush covered.” He opened a drawer and it was filled with unopened toothbrushes. I frowned slightly, the reality of just how many women had spent the night in this apartment came crashing in on me. “What?” He caught my look. “Nothing.” I hastily grabbed one and tore it open. “Grace, I wasn’t a monk before I met you. I had sex and a lot of it. I’m sorry if that puts you off, but it’s true and I’m not going to be ashamed of it.” A defiant look crossed his face, almost as if he were daring me to say something. “I know you weren’t, it just surprised me for a moment. It’s totally fine.” I forced a smile. “Is it?” He caught my chin in his hand before I could look away. “Don’t let this come between us. I can’t change who I was.” “I’m fine with it, Logan. I really am.” I knew he was right, he couldn’t change the past. I didn’t need to punish him for my own insecurities. “I should have been more sensitive to how you might take it, I apologize for that. Now, let’s go get showered off and I can drive you to your hotel to get changed.” The shower was anything but quick. We took our time making sure every inch of the other’s body was squeaky clean. Logan threw me a pair of sweats and a t-shirt to wear in the car. I had expected us to use the limo we had come in, but he led me to a sleek BMW sedan. “No driver today?” “No, I gave him the day off. I want you all to myself.” He held my hand to his lips and brushed a light kiss across my knuckles. “Do you always say the right thing?” “No, pretty often I say the wrong thing. You'll see.” He winked, and we took off for my hotel. Faith was sitting cross-legged on her bed watching TV when I came in. Logan had waited outside so I could go in and change and make sure Faith was decent. “So, here you are, then. No phone call?” She mock frowned. “Sorry, but I’m not sorry.” I grinned and rifled through my bag for a fresh bra and panties and something to wear. “I take it the reunion went well?” “Very. He’s so perfect, Faith. Better than I remembered.” I pressed a hand to my heart, caught up in all the girly emotions of it. “God, you are way too sugary this morning. I may get a cavity just listening to you.” She made a gagging motion. “Shut up. This is what you wanted remember. You made me come here.” I dressed in a hurry. “Where is lover boy, anyway?” “In the hall.” I cut my eyes to the door quickly and ran into the bathroom to throw some makeup on. “Do you want to meet him before we leave?” “Damn straight I do,” she called from the other room. “Do you need to get dressed before I let him in?” I eyed her sweats and piled up hair. “No, why? It’s not like it’s me who needs to impress him, is it? He’s seen me all slutted up before anyway.” I opened the door and found Logan leaning against the wall scrolling through his phone. He looked up and smiled and I swore my heart stopped beating for a moment. “Come on in.” “Hey, I’m Faith.” She held her hand out to him as I fumbled with the zipper on my suitcase. “I remember you from the night Grace and I met.” He smiled again and shook her hand. “And I do believe I owe you a thank-you meal for talking your sister into coming to find me.” She shrugged. “Sometimes she’s too stubborn for her own good. She just needed a little push. Besides, she was unbearable the past few months.” I shot her a dirty look and wheeled my suitcase to the door. “Pick you up for dinner?” She nodded, and I blew her a kiss. Logan waved and we were off again to wherever he wanted to go. As long as I was with him, I didn’t care. “I see you brought your suitcase?” he commented as we walked. “Should I not have? I just figured it would be easier for me to have all my clothes in one place.” “No, I love that you brought it. That you want to be in my house, in my bed. I never want to let you out my sight.” He leaned in and kissed me. “There you go again, saying all the right things.” I sighed and laced my fingers into his. “What are we doing today?” “I thought breakfast and then movies in bed all day until dinner with your sister. Unless you’d rather do something else?” “That sounds perfect.” It really did. I couldn't imagine a more perfect day. We got bagels and orange juice at a little deli by his apartment. He grilled me about my sisters. “So where are you in the line?” He licked a glob of cream cheese off his thumb. “Third. Hope is the oldest, then Faith, then me, and Charity is the baby.” “Do you see them a lot?” “Faith I see every day, we live together. Hope I see as often as I can, she lives in the suburbs with her husband and my nephew. Charity is in England at Oxford, so we see her about once a year.” “Oxford, huh?” “She got all the brains in the family.” I laughed. “Were you all close growing up?” He took a sip of his juice. “Very. My poor dad was constantly outnumbered in the house.” “I’m sure he loved every minute of it.” “He did.” I changed the subject to him. “Do you have any siblings?” “One sister. Leah. She lives in Paris right now.” “Paris? Do you see her a lot?” “A few times a year. She’s in charge of the European branch of the company for now.” “For now?” I arched a brow. “She’s going on maternity leave in a few months.” He smiled. “Is this the first grandchild in the family?” I blurted out. The barest shadow flickered over his face. “No, not the first.” He didn’t elaborate. “Are your parents in New York, too?” I asked with a little too much enthusiasm. I wanted to erase the weirdness from before. “Yeah, they live a few blocks from me.” He clearly did not enjoy talking about his family, I decided to let the subject drop for the time being. No need to spoil a good day. “Tell me more about you. What do you want out of life? Where do you see yourself in ten years?” “Is this a job interview?” I grinned as I swallowed a bite of bagel. “I guess it could be. The job is my girlfriend, and so far you are our only applicant.” I laughed. “I want happiness and love. A house full of laughter and children, and a man who loves me to grow old with.” “You don’t ask for a lot do you?” He watched me intently. “Only the world, and I’ll accept nothing less.” I stared right back. “How many kids are we talking here?” “I don’t know, a few. I have a thing for babies. The way they smell is heavenly.” I sighed, thinking about the way Grayson smelled after a bath. “So less than five?” he questioned. I coughed out a laugh. “Yes, way less than five. I’m thinking two or three.” “I think I could work with that.” “Does that mean I get the job?” I smiled seductively. “Oh, Kitten, I have way more questions. I think we need to take this interview back to the apartment. The next portion will require a lot less clothing.”",

Hope I see as often as I can, she lives in the suburbs with her husband and my nephew. Charity is in England at Oxford, so we see her about once a year.” “Oxford, huh?” “She got all the brains in the family.” I laughed. “Were you all close growing up?” He took a sip of his juice. “Very. My poor dad was constantly outnumbered in the house.” “I’m sure he loved every minute of it.” “He did.” I changed the subject to him. “Do you have any siblings?” “One sister. Leah. She lives in Paris right now.” “Paris? Do you see her a lot?” “A few times a year. She’s in charge of the European branch of the company for now.” “For now?” I arched a brow. “She’s going on maternity leave in a few months.” He smiled. “Is this the first grandchild in the family?” I blurted out. The barest shadow flickered over his face. “No, not the first.” He didn’t elaborate. “Are your parents in New York, too?” I asked with a little too much enthusiasm. I wanted to erase the weirdness from before. “Yeah, they live a few blocks from me.” He clearly did not enjoy talking about his family, I decided to let the subject drop for the time being. No need to spoil a good day. “Tell me more about you. What do you want out of life? Where do you see yourself in ten years?” “Is this a job interview?” I grinned as I swallowed a bite of bagel. “I guess it could be. The job is my girlfriend, and so far you are our only applicant.” I laughed. “I want happiness and love. A house full of laughter and children, and a man who loves me to grow old with.” “You don’t ask for a lot do you?” He watched me intently. “Only the world, and I’ll accept nothing less.” I stared right back. “How many kids are we talking here?” “I don’t know, a few. I have a thing for babies. The way they smell is heavenly.” I sighed, thinking about the way Grayson smelled after a bath. “So less than five?” he questioned. I coughed out a laugh. “Yes, way less than five. I’m thinking two or three.” “I think I could work with that.” “Does that mean I get the job?” I smiled seductively. “Oh, Kitten, I have way more questions. I think we need to take this interview back to the apartment. The next portion will require a lot less clothing.”",

      "content": "I OPENED MY DOOR, EXPECTING the delivery guy, but found Smith instead. I scowled and let him in. “I see you didn’t bother listening when I told you not to drop by?” “When do I ever listen? Where is she?” He looked around my apartment. “Logan?” Grace wandered out. “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know you had someone coming over.” She looked embarrassed. “He didn’t know I was coming. I’m Smith.” He held a hand out to her. She smiled faintly and walked toward him. “Grace.” She shook his hand and then came to stand next to me. “Smith is my best friend, and he apparently has a listening problem.” Her smile widened. “Oh. It’s so nice to meet you. So, you’d be the one who could tell me all he embarrassing stories about Logan then?” “You bet your ass I am.” He grinned and sat down in one of the overstuffed leather chairs in the living room. “By all means, stay a while,” I said sarcastically. “Logan, be nice,” Grace chided. “So, how long have you boys known each other.” She sat on the couch and curled her legs up under her body. “Since grade school,” Smith answered. “I guess you really do have all the juicy details then.” “And then some.” He winked at me, clearly enjoying himself. “Smith,” I warned. “Hey, I’m not here to start any trouble. I just wanted to get a look at the woman who’s finally tamed you.” He held up his hands in defeat. “Tamed you?” Grace arched a brow at me. “I’ve not been a relationship kind of man in the past. Let’s just leave it at that for now.” “I’ll take that as my cue to leave then. Grace, it was wonderful to meet you. I do hope that we can all get together before you leave.” He brushed a chaste kiss to her cheek. “We’ll be here for a couple more days. I’m sure I’ll see you again before I we go home.” Grace smiled. “We?” Smith arched a brow. “My sister Faith came with me.” “Sister, huh? And I take it she’s gorgeous like you, right?” He waggled his eyebrows. Grace laughed. “All right, Romeo, you were leaving, weren’t you?” I pushed Smith toward the door. “See you later Grace.” He blew a kiss. “I’ll just be a minute,” I said as I stepped into the hall with him. “What the hell?” I glared at him. “Sorry, I was curious about her.” He shrugged. “I don’t want to scare her away. She freaked out when she saw my toothbrush stash for overnight guests. I didn’t need you to remind her about all the sex I had before she came along.” “You were kind of a man whore.” “That’s the pot calling the kettle black right there. You are more promiscuous than me by far. Now get the hell out of here and don’t come over unless you’re invited.” I gave him a little shove to get him moving. “Logan.” “What?” I glowered at him. “She seems like the real deal, and I’m glad to see you happy for once. Now, don't screw this one up, okay?” I waited until he was on the elevator before going back in. Grace was still on the couch, looking out the window with a dazed expression on her face. “Sorry about him,” I said apologetically. “He seems great. Why didn’t you want him to meet me?” She frowned slightly. “It’s not that at all, Kitten.” I sat down next to her, pulling her against me. “I just wasn’t ready for the real world to crash in on us yet. I’m enjoying our cocoon right now.” She nodded. “I don’t want to go back to Chicago. I really don’t want to leave this apartment.” “So don't leave.” I kissed her. “You know I have to.” She gave me a reproachful look. “Do you?” I nibbled her earlobe. “Yes. I do. We talked about this last night. I’m not moving here. I have my whole life in Chicago.” “I’m not in Chicago,” I said gently. “Yeah, I could say the same to you about New York. Why don’t you move to Chicago then?” She laughed, throwing her hands up in the air. I thought for a moment. It wasn't the worst idea I’d heard. I could rent an office space for six months, see how this all played out. Business could be done anywhere, and Chicago was a big city with a decent international airport. “What are you thinking so hard about?” She tapped my nose. “Moving to Chicago. I’ll talk to my real estate guy tomorrow and see about looking for an apartment in the city, and an office to lease for a bit,” I mused. “What?” Her voice got all high pitched and squeaky. “I was kidding, trying to show you how absurd it was to ask me to move here after two nights together.” “I don’t think it’s crazy at all. In fact, I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before. Now, I won’t be able to be there all the time. Just like living here, I have to travel quite a bit. But, if you wanted, you could come along on some of the trips.” She got up from the couch and paced in front of me. “This is crazy.” Her breathing was ragged. “Stop. Sit down for a minute and tell me why you are freaked out about this.” I grabbed her arm and pulled her onto my lap. “We’ve known each other for like a second. There’s no rush, right? We don't need to relocate for the other person. I want to try dating, we can see each other when we can.” I thought for a moment. “No.” “No?” Her brows shot up. “Yep. Not going to happen. I’ve been without you for three months because I was stupid enough to let you walk away. Not happening again. I’m coming, and that’s all there is to it.” She looked like she might protest again, so I sealed my mouth on hers, stealing her words. When I finally pulled away, she looked up at me. “Are you always this bossy?” “Always. So, you better get used to it.” Part of me worried that I was coming on too strong, but I couldn’t make myself stop. When it came to Grace, I had no scruples. I would do whatever it took to keep her. “Are you really serious about this?” She chewed her fingernail absently. “I’m always serious. Answer me this, could you be happy not living in the same city? Now that we’re together, could you go back to being apart?” “No. I wasn’t happy before.” “I thought I was happy, but I was wrong. I’ve always had my rules, kept things simple. You changed all that, Kitten.” “I changed it?” She looked at me with those big brown eyes. “Of course you did. Up until you, all I wanted was no strings attached. Now, I want strings, I want the whole damn ball of string. Don’t overthink; just go with your gut.” I kissed her again. “You’re crazy, but okay. Move to Chicago.” She laughed. “It’s cute that you think I needed your permission,” I said before hauling her over my shoulder and into my bed. “I always get my way, Kitten,” I whispered before crushing my mouth down on hers. LOGAN AND I WERE ON our way to pick up Faith for dinner. He had elected to take a limo so we had more space. His hand was currently snaking its way up my skirt. “Logan,” I hissed. “What? He can't see anything up there.” He kissed my neck. “Good lord, you are like a horny teenager. We literally just had sex before we left.” “Doesn’t mean I don't want you again already.” His hand continued its exploration under my skirt. “I think you can wait until after dinner, I don’t really want Faith strolling into a car that smells like sex.” I gave him a stern look and removed his hand. “Oh fine. I’ll be a good boy. But you better reward me for my restraint later.” He tipped my lips up to his. “I promise I will.” We pulled up to the hotel Faith and I were staying at and she was waiting by the curb, looking like she just stepped off of a runway. She slid in on the other side and gave me a knowing look when she saw Logan’s hand on my thigh. “So, Logan. What the hell was up with you letting my sister be sad for three months when you could have just called her?” “Faith!” I shot her a dirty look. “No, it’s fine. I like that she’s protective. Grace and I have already discussed this, so let’s just leave it as things that are meant to be happen for a reason.” I looked up at him and was relieved to see a smile on his face. Faith could be really direct, which wasn’t always a good thing. “Be nice,” I mouthed to her. She nodded. “What have you two been up to?” “We’ve been discussing my move to Chicago.” He gave my thigh a light squeeze. “You’re moving to Chicago?” Faith’s jaw dropped. “Yes, for the time being, it’s more important for me to be with Grace than it is for me to live in New York.” “Wow, so you’re pretty serious, then?” Faith arched a brow. “As serious as we can be in this short of time,” he responded. “Okay, enough with the Spanish Inquisition.” I held up my hand when she opened her mouth to say more. “Fine.” She smiled benignly. “Where are we going for dinner?” “A little place my friend runs. You’ll love it,” Logan answered. We lapsed into sort of an awkward silence. “What did you do today?” I asked her. “Went to a bar, met a guy, the usual.” She flashed her million watt smile. “Anyone special?” “We’ll see.” My brows rose. This was not like her at all. Her normal response was no. “Tell me about him,” I prodded. “Nothing much to tell yet.” “Stop evading.” “I’m not evading. It could be a complicated situation, that’s all.” “You like him.” It wasn't a question. I knew my sister well enough to know what she wasn’t saying. “I didn’t say that.” A ghost of a smile on her lips. “You didn't not say it, either.” I grinned. “You should have invited him along tonight.” Logan jumped into the conversation. “No, I’m not inviting him along on a double date with my sister and the dude she’s screwing. Not enough alcohol in the world for that.” I shot her a dirty look, but it melted when I saw the smile on Logan’s face. “You really don’t pull any punches do you?” He shook his head. “I don’t see the point in not saying what I feel.” She shrugged. The limo stopped and Logan got out first and helped me and then Faith out onto the wet sidewalk. He took my hand and we walked up the street a bit and bypassed a mile long line as we walked into the restaurant. “I guess this place is popular?” I looked at the line and the tables crammed with people. “Yeah, Aaron has done a great job.” He kissed my palm before snaking his arm around my waist. We were led to the back of the restaurant and into the kitchen, where a table was set for us off to the side. “We’re eating in the kitchen?” Faith arched a brow. “Have you not heard of a chef’s table? It’s typically in the kitchen,” Logan responded and pulled my chair out for me, dropping a quick kiss on my shoulder. “If you ladies will excuse me for a moment, I saw someone I need to have a word with.” When we were alone Faith let out a breath. “Holy mother of God, Grace! He is so much hotter in a suit than he was this morning. Is he serious about moving?” I stifled a giggle. “He really is something in a suit.” I bit my lip thinking about what he would look like when I peeled it off of him. “Yes, he’s serious. I think he might be crazy, but at this point I want to see him as much as I can.” “With good reason.” She smiled slyly. “How’s the sex compared to the first night?” “Amazing isn’t a strong enough word. He is what I’ve been missing my whole life. I’m not even kidding.” “This makes me happy.” “What? That I’m getting good sex on the regular from now on?” “No,” she laughed. “You smiling this much. And seeing the way he looks at you. This makes me happy. I want you to be good, and you weren't before and for sure not after your night with him. You will be now.” “Tell me more about your mystery guy.” “Nope. I’m not going to think about him until at least tomorrow. Speaking of which, are you leaving with me tomorrow night?” “Probably not. I may stay an extra few days to help Logan get packed up or whatever it is he needs to do. Why are you being so evasive about this?” “I figured as much.” She grinned. “I promise I'm not being evasive. I just don't know what to make of him. He’s not what I wanted in my head. He’s as messed up as I am. He’s not a Logan, that’s for sure. He’s always gone, and he’s, I don't know, he’s fucking gorgeous. And I want him, even though I know it’s stupid to want him.” “The heart wants what it wants,” I said softly. “This has nothing to do with my heart, and everything to do with my hormones. Maybe I just need to go back there tonight and get him out of my system.” She ran a hand through her hair and blew out a breath. “Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to see him again before you leave tomorrow.” “I’ll think about it,” she said noncommittally. Logan came back in a moment later with Smith by his side. “Sorry to crash the party, mind if I join you?” He smiled broadly. “Please.” I gestured to the chair across from Faith. “What did I miss? I’m sure it was mostly about me right?” Logan sat down next to me and winked at Faith. She mouthed, “Oh my god,” when he looked away to signal the waiter. I knew just what she meant, those eyes should be illegal. “So, you’re the sister?” Smith turned his attention to Faith. An odd look crossed her face. “Yeah, and you are?” “Oh, I’m sorry, what an idiot I am,” Logan chided himself. “Faith, this is my best friend, Smith.” Smith took Faith’s hand and kissed her knuckles. “It’s a pleasure.” The two shared a look that could only be described as heated. The dinner conversation was fun, Faith and I tried to get Smith to tell us embarrassing stories about Logan. “I’m sorry, ladies, I’ve been sworn to secrecy on most things. Bros before hos, and all that. I’m sure you understand.” He grinned at Faith. No one could mistake the flirting between them. I could feel the heat from across the table. Smith offered to make sure Faith made it home okay, and the look on her face told me not to interfere. She gave me a wave and stepped into Smith’s car. On the way home, Logan pulled me onto his lap so I was straddling him. “Ever have sex in a limo?” “Nope, can’t say that I have.” I smiled down at him. “Well, you can take that off of your to-do list then.” He pulled my mouth down to his as he slid my skirt higher up my hips. I moaned against his lips as I slid down his length. I felt as though I had been starving the past three months. I knew one thing for certain, I wouldn’t be going hungry anymore. I kissed him roughly and sought my own pleasure, taking him along with me.",

Maybe I just need to go back there tonight and get him out of my system.” She ran a hand through her hair and blew out a breath. “Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to see him again before you leave tomorrow.” “I’ll think about it,” she said noncommittally. Logan came back in a moment later with Smith by his side. “Sorry to crash the party, mind if I join you?” He smiled broadly. “Please.” I gestured to the chair across from Faith. “What did I miss? I’m sure it was mostly about me right?” Logan sat down next to me and winked at Faith. She mouthed, “Oh my god,” when he looked away to signal the waiter. I knew just what she meant, those eyes should be illegal. “So, you’re the sister?” Smith turned his attention to Faith. An odd look crossed her face. “Yeah, and you are?” “Oh, I’m sorry, what an idiot I am,” Logan chided himself. “Faith, this is my best friend, Smith.” Smith took Faith’s hand and kissed her knuckles. “It’s a pleasure.” The two shared a look that could only be described as heated. The dinner conversation was fun, Faith and I tried to get Smith to tell us embarrassing stories about Logan. “I’m sorry, ladies, I’ve been sworn to secrecy on most things. Bros before hos, and all that. I’m sure you understand.” He grinned at Faith. No one could mistake the flirting between them. I could feel the heat from across the table. Smith offered to make sure Faith made it home okay, and the look on her face told me not to interfere. She gave me a wave and stepped into Smith’s car. On the way home, Logan pulled me onto his lap so I was straddling him. “Ever have sex in a limo?” “Nope, can’t say that I have.” I smiled down at him. “Well, you can take that off of your to-do list then.” He pulled my mouth down to his as he slid my skirt higher up my hips. I moaned against his lips as I slid down his length. I felt as though I had been starving the past three months. I knew one thing for certain, I wouldn’t be going hungry anymore. I kissed him roughly and sought my own pleasure, taking him along with me.",

      "content": "AS MUCH AS I WANTED to spend the whole day in bed with Grace, I had work that was screaming for attention. Plus the arrangements for Chicago needed to be made. I slid out of bed as quietly as I could, but she woke up anyway. “Where are you going?” She blinked up at me. “I have to go to the office for a few hours. Go back to sleep and I’ll be back before you know it.” I leaned down to kiss her, and she pulled me back down with her. “You know, this isn’t how getting up works, right?” I rolled her onto her back and kissed her. “Maybe I don’t want you to get up.” She wrapped her legs around my hips. This morning was going to take willpower for me to actually get out of the apartment. “Kitten, as much as I would love to stay in bed with you right now I can’t.” I kissed her neck. “See, now you’re sending mixed signals.” She ground her pelvis into me. I groaned and kissed her one more time before rolling off of her. “I need to get in the shower. If you would like to join me, we can make it a productive shower.” I grinned and held my hand out for her. I went to the sink to shave and brush my teeth. Grace joined me in brushing her teeth before she turned on the shower. It was all I could do not to slice my neck open as I watched her soap up in the mirror. She knew exactly what she was doing to me, too. My little sex Kitten. I shaved in a hurry and joined her. “Here, why don’t you let me soap you up?” Her soapy fingers slid down my stomach. Before long, I had her pressed up against the wall with her legs around my waist. I wanted all of her pleasure, it belonged to me. I pushed her further, setting a faster pace. I wanted to see her when she exploded around me, when she let go completely. “God, can we make this an everyday thing?” She panted against my shoulder. “If we did, we’d both be perpetually late for work.” I set her down and grabbed my shampoo. “I don’t think that’s too big of a deal, do you?” She grabbed her own shampoo and lathered her hair into a huge lump on top of her head. “I guess being the boss does have a few perks.” I kissed her again and rinsed my hair. After a quick soap down I was out of the shower with a towel wrapped around my waist. When I came out of my closet half dressed, Grace was laying on the bed wrapped in a towel. Something about this took me back to three months ago and I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach. “What time will you be home?” She stretched out on the bed. “Not much after one, but feel free to call and yell at me if I go too far past that.” I grinned and slipped my shirt on. “How is it that we just had sex and I already want you again? You do something ungodly to a suit Logan.” She bit her lip, a predatory look in her eyes. My unease was erased with those words, this was nothing like that day. She would be here waiting when I got home. “I’ll be home soon, try not to miss me too much.” I pressed my lips gently to hers and grabbed my phone from the nightstand. “Hurry home.” She licked her lips. “If you don’t stop that, I’ll never make it out of the house.” I kissed her again and left before she could talk me into staying. The limo was waiting when I stepped out of the elevator. I slid across the seat and started scrolling through the mountain of emails I had to answer. I was so absorbed in what I was doing I didn’t notice the door open and Smith slide into the seat across from me until we were a block away from where he got in. “Morning,” he said casually. “What, are you just in the habit of dropping in unannounced these days?” I laughed. “I figured I’d hitch a ride into the office since you were going. I saw Louis and flagged him down. I’m actually surprised to see you out of the house and fully clothed.” He grinned at me. “Work never stops, you know that. I’m going in to handle a few things and then I’m out. Speaking of which.” I dialed a number in my phone. “Jared, it’s Logan. Have you found anything for me to look at?” I listened as he rattled off everything he had found that would suit my needs. “I’ll be there in a few days, set up some viewings will you?” He spoke rapidly. “Good, see you then.” I hung up. “What was that?” He knew exactly who Jared was. “I’m relocating for a bit.” I hid my smile, knowing how he was going to react. “What? You’re moving to Chicago?” His eyes looked like they were going to pop out of his head. “I am. For at least the next six months, or until I can convince Grace to move here.” “Look, I know I told you to go for it, but I didn’t mean this.” “Smith, I won’t be talked out of this. So jump on board. Grace is who I want. This is what I need for right now.” “I’m kind of at a loss for words.” He just looked at me. “For once in your life.” I laughed. “Shai was right, man, I deserve happiness, too.” “Okay, now you sound like a chick.” “Shut the fuck up. You know what I mean. You both have been badgering me to go to her for months. With her, it’s so different. And I know how I sound.” I shrugged. A slow smile spread on his face. “I never thought I’d live to see the day when Logan McFadden would be all in.” “It will happen to you, too. When you least expect it, it will hit you like a bolt of lightning. And let me tell you, sex with her is so much better than sex with a random.” “Now you sound like Shai. She’s been pestering me about not being such a whore for a while.” He groaned and rolled his eyes. “Maybe you should listen. She’s pretty on the nose these days. Who knows, maybe it’s the extra hormones.” The limo pulled up to the McFadden building and Smith and I got out. He worked in marketing and research and development for me. “Are you going to tell me how it went with Faith?” I asked as we stepped out onto the street. “I don’t kiss and tell,” he smirked. “Since when?” “Since you’re screwing her sister.” “Nice. Always the wordsmith. Do you think I’m going to go running back to Grace with this? Besides, what makes you think she hasn’t already told her?” “Fine. It was amazing. Happy now?” It was my turn to smirk. “The DeLeo women seem to have our number, my friend.” “That they do.” He grinned. The lobby was a madhouse, people milled around waiting for meetings. “Please tell me you don’t expect me to move with you,” he asked as we walked into the elevator. “Of course not. You’re such an ass, you know that right?” “I don’t deny that.” He got off the floor below mine, leaving me alone with my phone once again. There was a text from Grace. Grace: Miss you already xoxo I smiled and typed out a quick reply before exiting the elevator. Brooke was waiting for me by the elevator with a cup of coffee and a stack of messages. “Welcome back, Mr. McFadden, hope you got everything sorted out.” “What? Oh, yeah, you could say that. Tell me, how would you feel about relocating to Chicago for six months?” Brooke was a damn good assistant, and I hoped she would say yes to coming with me. “Chicago?” “Yeah, I’m moving there for at least six months.” I walked briskly toward my office. “Can I think about it?” She looked uneasy. “Of course, I need to be there, and I would really like you to come as well.” I smiled and sat down behind my desk. Five hours later Brooke buzzed me on the intercom. “There’s a Grace DeLeo here to see you. She doesn’t have an appointment.” “Send her in.” I looked at my watch and winced, it was well past one o’clock, more like three. I got up just as Brooke opened the door. “I’m so sorry, I got caught up.” I walked briskly to her and took her in my arms, kissing her soundly. “Forgive me?” “With a welcome like that, how could I not,” she said, her cheeks flushed. Brooke made a sound to let us know she was still there. “Sorry, where are my manners. Brooke, this is my girlfriend Grace.” Grace held her hand out and Brooke looked mildly shocked as she shook it. “It’s so nice to meet you, Brooke.” Grace smiled warmly. “You as well Miss DeLeo.” She frowned slightly. “Please, call me Grace.” “Okay. I need to get back to my desk, I can hear the phone ringing off the hook.” She smiled and hurried out of the room. Grace gave me an odd look after I closed the door. “What?” “You do know she’s in love with you, right?” “Who? Brooke?” “Yes. You can’t tell me you haven’t noticed the way she looks at you?” She chewed her lower lip. “Well it’s one sided if she has any feelings for me. It’s only ever been professional with us. I asked her to come with me to Chicago, that won’t be an issue for you, will it?” She cocked her head to the side, thinking. “No, I suppose not. As long as you can tell me you have never slept with her.” “Kitten, did you not just hear what I said? It’s only ever been professional between Brooke and me. But I will say that jealousy looks good on you.” I grinned at her and went around my desk to shut down my computer. “Are you done for the day?” She followed me over. “I am now. Again, I’m so sorry it was longer than I had told you.” “Hey, it’s okay. I know the planet doesn’t run without you.” Her eyes danced with amusement. “You're not far off in that assessment, actually.” She rolled her eyes. “Come on, let’s go home so you can put your considerable skills to better use.” “I SPOKE TO MY REAL estate guy today and he has some places lined up for me to look at in a few days,” I said casually as we walked into my apartment. “Oh yeah?” She looked up at me. “Yeah, do you want to go look at them with me when we get to Chicago?” “I do, but I also have work that’s been piling up. I’ll need to go into the office for a bit. I had planned on going home with Faith tonight originally.” “But now…” I trailed off. “Now I’m staying with you to help you pack or whatever it is you need to do before we go.” “You want to help me pack?” This was a new one for me. Not since my mother had someone wanted to help me pack. “I do. I want to help you with whatever you need help with.” She smiled. “What did I do to deserve you?” I pulled her into a hug. “I’m not sure, but keep doing it.” She giggled as I squeezed her tight. “Well, let’s get to packing then.” I hustled her into my bedroom. “Just what is it that you want to ‘pack’ right now?” She made air quotes as she spoke. “Oh, there will be plenty of ‘packing’ later Kitten, for now we need to decide what I can’t live without for six months.” “I seriously can’t believe you’re actually moving to Chicago.” “I need to be where you are for the time being. It’s that simple.” I pulled her against me. “This feels right to me. Does it feel the same to you?” I hated feeling insecure, I wasn’t used to it, and I didn’t like it. “Of course, it does. You feel like home to me, Logan. When I saw you in the lobby the other day, my heart almost leapt out of my chest. I don’t want to be without you any more than you want to be without me.” Who the hell was I anymore? Gone was all the bravado and the rules I normally had. I wanted nothing more than to stay in bed with her all day. I didn’t even care about work, which was very much not like me. I should be worried, but I wasn’t. “Come on, let’s go and weed through your clothes and find what you can’t live without. Let’s start with suits shall we?” She kicked her heels off and padded into my huge walk-in closet. I followed her in and started making piles on the racks. “What about this one?” She held up one of my favorite suits with a huge grin. it was the one I had been wearing when we met. “I think yes.” I leaned over and kissed her cheek. “I think yes, too.” She beamed at me. An hour later we had piles of clothes set aside to be packed up. “Do you have boxes or anything?” “For what?” I asked. “Um, packing.” She looked at me like I was crazy. “I hire people for that, Kitten. I haven't packed a box in as long as I can remember. The only thing I will pack is enough clothing to see me through until the boxes come.” “Sometimes I forget how rich you are.” She shook her head. “Yep, that’s me, Mr. Moneybags,” I teased her. “Well, then what are we going to do with these piles of clothes until they get packed up?” She gestured to the stacks, piles, and racks. “Move them to the living room for now. I have better plans for the bed.” I grinned wickedly at her. “I seem to remember you saying something about wanting to pack me full of something.” She giggled and swayed her hips. “I think we need food before we can get to that, don’t you?” I went to the kitchen to peruse my stack of take-out menus. “Do you not have any food in the refrigerator?” She opened it up and found only milk, orange juice, and coffee creamer. “Really, Logan? This is all you have in here? How do you survive?” “I eat out.” He shrugged. “All the time?” “Yep. I don’t really cook, and I let my housekeeper go about seven months ago. So no, I never make food in this apartment.” She laughed softly and took my hand. “Come on, let’s go.” “Where are we going?” “To buy some food so I can make dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow.” She gave me an exasperated look. We walked to the grocery store a few blocks away because there was a break in the rain and Grace wanted to stretch her legs. “Do you love it here?” she asked as we walked hand in hand. New York in the fall was one of my favorite times of year. Not too cold, not too hot. “I do, but I’ll love being in Chicago just as much.” “Oh yeah, and why’s that?” She rolled her eyes, expecting a cheesy response. “Because you’ll be there.” I stopped and pulled her into my arms, stealing her breath away with a kiss. “What am I going to do with you?” She grinned up at me. “I think the question is what would you do without me?” I kissed the tip of her nose and we continued on to the store. “What do you want to eat tonight?” she asked as she grabbed a cart. “I don’t really care. I’m not picky about food.” I took the cart while she walked up and down aisles and threw things in. She sucked her lower lip into her mouth and pondered between two flavors of ice cream. “Get them both.” “We don't need both, we’ll only be here another day or so right?” “Kitten, just get them both, you obviously want them.” I took them and put them in the cart. “God, you are so bossy.” She sighed and continued with the shopping. “We’ve been over that fact before,” I said dryly. “I didn’t say that I didn’t like you being bossy.” She kissed my cheek and sauntered off down the aisle. “Has Brooke made up her mind about coming to Chicago?” she asked, and I could tell by her tone she hoped the answer was no. “Jealous, are we?” “No, not jealous. Just curious.” She gave me a bland look as though she was trying to prove the point. “No, she has not made up her mind yet. I promise you’ll be the first to know when she does.” I grinned. “Ass.” She stuck her tongue out at me. Back at home, Grace was in the kitchen chopping things and stirring pots. I wasn’t sure what she was making, but it smelled amazing. “Can I help?” I leaned against the counter. “Nope, but you can help with breakfast tomorrow if you want. This meal is all me.” “Okay, have it your way.” I left the kitchen, and went to the small office I had in the apartment. I had a mountain of work that I hadn’t gotten to when I was actually at the office. Seeing it all made me feel like I needed someone to take over for me. That thought was quickly squashed as soon as I got into it. There were three emails from the small record label I had acquired in L.A. All of them wanting to know what I thought of the artist they were considering signing. I looked over the information they had sent and fired off a quick approval. I could see the potential and knew that there was money to be made there. Next there were countless emails from my sister and a few from my mother. Both wanting to know why I wasn't returning their phone calls and text messages. I sighed and dialed my mom’s number. “Logan? What on earth have you been doing that you can’t call your mother?” she scolded. “Hello to you, too, Mother. I’ve just been busy.” “You haven’t been at work.” She shot back. “No, I haven’t.” God, I hated that she was checking in on me. It’s not like she even cared when I was growing up. “Would this have anything to do with the woman in the trench coat who accosted you in the lobby of your office building?” she said, her tone was brisk. My fingers gripped the phone in my hand. “First of all, she did not accost me. Second of all, she is none of your business. Is this why you called? If so, I need to go.” “Logan.” Her tone was icy. “Mother, have a pleasant evening. I’ll phone you next week when things settle down a bit.” “Your father spoke to Jared this morning. Were you planning on telling us you were relocating to Chicago?” “No, I wasn’t. Since when do you even care where I live?” I hated that she brought up my father, as though he was supposed to have some significance to my life. Neither of them ever cared enough to find out anything about my life unless it directly affected them. “I care because I won’t let some gold digging whore work her way into your life the way you let…” I interrupted her. “Shut up! This has nothing to do with her. You don’t know Grace, or the way we feel about each other. I will not sit here and listen to you call her a whore. She is anything but.” I slammed the phone down hard enough to crack it. Grace appeared a moment later. “Logan? Are you okay? I thought I heard shouting.” She looked concerned and a little scared. “I’m fine,” I said tightly. My temper was still up, and I didn’t want to take it out on her. “Give me a moment, okay?” I rose from my seat and kissed her lightly before going out to the balcony. Leave it to my mother to ruin a perfectly good evening. I gripped the metal railing and looked out over the city. Gradually, I relaxed. A few minutes later, I turned around to find Grace watching me from the living room, a nervous expression on her face. I opened the slider and walked in. “Are you okay?” she asked softly. “I am now.” I pulled her against me, inhaling her scent. She always smelled like flowers. “Do you want to talk about it?” She brushed her lips against mine before pulling back to look me in the eye. I could feel her anxiety. “No, I really don’t.” I pulled her in tighter. I WASN’T SURE WHAT HAD upset Logan, but I didn’t like that he wouldn't share it with me. I made up my mind that tonight I would get him to open up to me. I couldn’t stand the wall between us. I needed him to trust me. If whatever this was we were in was going to work, he had to trust me. “Dinner is almost ready. If you would like to join me in the kitchen, you can set the table.” “Your wish is my command.” He kissed my knuckles. “What are we having anyway?” “Tortellini in homemade sauce and sautéed veggies.” “Sounds heavenly.” He followed me into the kitchen. “So, tell me what that was all about?” I broached the subject again. “Grace.” His tone held a warning. “No. Sorry, but I’m not going to let this drop. If you want me to be a part of your life, you need to let me in.” I stood my ground, a hand on my hip. I was going to be strong about this, even though I felt like jelly on the inside. Confrontation was not my thing. I needed him to understand me, to get that we needed to be open with each other. He raked a hand through his hair and glared at me. I knew I was painting him into a corner, but I didn’t really care. “Look at it from my perspective, please. I’m an open book. You know all there is to know. You, on the other hand, I know almost nothing about. Every time I ask you something, you shut me down.” I let some of my frustration out. He sank onto one of the barstools on the other side of the big island. “I do want to let you in. It’s hard for me. I’m not free with myself the way you are.” “You think it’s easy for me to be free with myself? It’s not. It’s a battle with myself sometimes. But I have to trust you, I need to trust that you won’t crush me.” I forced myself to look him in the eye so he could see how serious I was. “I never want to hurt you, Kitten.” I nodded. “You need to give me something here, Logan.” “What can I do?” “Start with that phone conversation. Who were you talking to?” He sighed. “My mother.” “What made you so upset?” “She made insinuations about you that I didn’t appreciate. My mother and I have a very complicated relationship.” “I see.” I stirred the sauce in the big pot on the stove. “I don’t want her to ruin anything. She always does.” “She can't ruin things if we don't let her. Thank you for telling me.” I smiled. “It’s not going to be easy with me, Kitten, I want you to know that going in. I’m not easy, nothing about me is. You're going to have to work at this with me.” This bit of honesty was what I wanted. I needed it. “I’m willing to work at it, as long as we’re both on the same page about it.” The look in his eye changed, shifted to heat, a slow smolder. He was up and around the counter in a moment, and I felt myself being lifted onto the island. His lips grazed my collarbone. “I want to be what you deserve.” “You already are,” I whispered. His arms circled me, one hand on my thigh, the other behind my neck. “Kitten, where are your panties?” he growled as his fingers slid along the smooth skin of my upper thigh. Thank goodness for skirts. “Um, I didn’t wear any today.” I was not thinking clearly. His fingers traced little circles on my skin. “Good lord, what am I going to do with you?” He pushed my skirt higher. “I can think of a thing or two,” I panted as he closed in on the one place I wanted him to be. “What about dinner?” he whispered against my lips. “Dinner? It can wait. I think we have more pressing matters to attend to.” I gestured to the front of his pants. It was apparent that he was enjoying himself as much as I was. “Let me just turn off the burners.” I hopped off the counter and turned off all the knobs and put lids on everything. Logan was leaning against the counter when I turned back around. He had taken his tie off and unbuttoned his shirt. Delicious was the word that came to mind as my gaze raked over his muscled torso. “Like what you see?” His voice was sex itself. Smooth and seductive. I felt my knees go weak. “Very much.” I slid the shirt from his shoulders, pressing kisses to his arms as it fell to the floor. “Care to catch up?” He pointed at my blouse. “Your wish is my command.” I threw his words back at him while I untucked it from my skirt. “No, let me.” He took ahold of my hand. I nodded my acceptance and dropped my hands to my sides. He slowly inched my shirt up my stomach, his fingers touching every inch of skin he revealed. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything more beautiful,” he murmured after he had finished removing my shirt. I took his face in my hands and brought his mouth down to mine. “Let’s go to the bedroom, I think we need a bit more space.” He picked me up and hauled me over his shoulder. I squealed when he slapped me on the butt. When we got into the room, he practically threw me on the bed after he tore my skirt off. I watched through my lashes as he took his pants off. He was mouthwatering in nothing but his skin. “Come here.” I crawled back against the headboard. He covered me with his body, the weight of him, the heat of his skin, felt like heaven. He parted my legs with his knee and slowly slid in, inch by glorious inch. I shivered as his lips found mine. “Fast, baby,” I moaned. “I’m ready for it.” “Anything you say, Kitten,” he growled, setting a merciless pace. I squeezed his waist with my legs, the feeling so intense, I knew it wouldn’t be long. “I’m close,” I panted. “Already? Well, give me a moment to catch up.” His hands moved between us to cup my boobs. “Sorry,” I said between clenched teeth. “Never apologize for your pleasure.” He crushed his mouth onto mine a second before I exploded around him. He followed suit soon after. “Should we consider this make-up sex?” He laughed after he rolled to the side. “Do you think that was a fight?” I turned to look at him. “I don’t know, was it?” “No, believe me, you’ll know when we have a fight. Think of this as a reward for good behavior.” I scooted myself to the side of the bed and went in search of a shirt to put on. I found one of his t-shirts and threw it on quickly. “Where are you going?” he asked. “To salvage dinner. You should get up, too. The table isn’t going to set itself.” I heard him laugh as I walked out into the living room. I was pleased to see the food wasn't too far gone. I turned the burners back on and set about heating things up again. Logan came in a few minutes later wearing a pair of sweats. “I’m here as commanded.” “You know where everything is.” I pointed a spoon at him. “This will be ready in just a moment.” When we were seated with food piled on our plates, I decided to see if I could get him to open up more. “Tell me about your family.” I watched him to see his reaction. He looked up from his plate. “What would you like to know?” “Why aren’t you close with your mom?” “She’s difficult. Wasn't around a lot when I was growing up. Leah and I were raised by nannies and the housekeeper.” “That sounds hard.” I laid my hand on his. “It was and it wasn’t. Some years were better than others.” “What about your dad?” “He was busy running the company into the ground,” he scoffed. “My grandfather had given him a thriving company and he took it to the brink of ruin in the twenty years he had it under his control. He seemed to care more about chasing women than actually running the company.” “How old were you when you took over?” “Nineteen. I met with the board and we kicked him out.” “Wow. That’s crazy.” “It was what needed to be done. They wanted him out. Hell, he wanted out. It was killing him, the guilt and worry were taking their toll. He and I didn’t speak for five years after it happened. My mother, of course, was mortified. She fled to Paris for a few years. Until things had quieted down. She always has cared so much about what others thought.” “Your family sounds pretty screwed up.” “They are. Leah and I are lucky we had each other.” “I’d like to meet her.” I smiled. “You will. We’ll go see her after the baby comes.” He returned my smile. “What was it your mother said about me?” Hearing it made me nervous, but I needed to at the same time. His jaw tightened. “You don’t want to know.” “I really do,” I prodded, steeling myself for the words. “She called you a gold digging whore. Happy now?” He looked me in the eye and I could see the anger just under the surface. I sucked in a breath. “She doesn’t know me, how could she think that?” “It doesn’t matter what she thinks. What I think is what’s important, and I know exactly who you are, Kitten.” I decided that I had pressed my luck enough for the night and changed the subject to safer topics. After dinner, we curled up in bed and watched movies until neither of us could keep our eyes open any longer. I drifted off to sleep in his arms, which was right where I wanted to be.",

I slid out of bed as quietly as I could, but she woke up anyway. “Where are you going?” She blinked up at me. “I have to go to the office for a few hours. Go back to sleep and I’ll be back before you know it.” I leaned down to kiss her, and she pulled me back down with her. “You know, this isn’t how getting up works, right?” I rolled her onto her back and kissed her. “Maybe I don’t want you to get up.” She wrapped her legs around my hips. This morning was going to take willpower for me to actually get out of the apartment. “Kitten, as much as I would love to stay in bed with you right now I can’t.” I kissed her neck. “See, now you’re sending mixed signals.” She ground her pelvis into me. I groaned and kissed her one more time before rolling off of her. “I need to get in the shower. If you would like to join me, we can make it a productive shower.” I grinned and held my hand out for her. I went to the sink to shave and brush my teeth. Grace joined me in brushing her teeth before she turned on the shower. It was all I could do not to slice my neck open as I watched her soap up in the mirror. She knew exactly what she was doing to me, too. My little sex Kitten. I shaved in a hurry and joined her. “Here, why don’t you let me soap you up?” Her soapy fingers slid down my stomach. Before long, I had her pressed up against the wall with her legs around my waist. I wanted all of her pleasure, it belonged to me. I pushed her further, setting a faster pace. I wanted to see her when she exploded around me, when she let go completely. “God, can we make this an everyday thing?” She panted against my shoulder. “If we did, we’d both be perpetually late for work.” I set her down and grabbed my shampoo. “I don’t think that’s too big of a deal, do you?” She grabbed her own shampoo and lathered her hair into a huge lump on top of her head. “I guess being the boss does have a few perks.” I kissed her again and rinsed my hair. After a quick soap down I was out of the shower with a towel wrapped around my waist. When I came out of my closet half dressed, Grace was laying on the bed wrapped in a towel. Something about this took me back to three months ago and I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach. “What time will you be home?” She stretched out on the bed. “Not much after one, but feel free to call and yell at me if I go too far past that.” I grinned and slipped my shirt on. “How is it that we just had sex and I already want you again? You do something ungodly to a suit Logan.” She bit her lip, a predatory look in her eyes. My unease was erased with those words, this was nothing like that day. She would be here waiting when I got home. “I’ll be home soon, try not to miss me too much.” I pressed my lips gently to hers and grabbed my phone from the nightstand. “Hurry home.” She licked her lips. “If you don’t stop that, I’ll never make it out of the house.” I kissed her again and left before she could talk me into staying. The limo was waiting when I stepped out of the elevator. I slid across the seat and started scrolling through the mountain of emails I had to answer. I was so absorbed in what I was doing I didn’t notice the door open and Smith slide into the seat across from me until we were a block away from where he got in. “Morning,” he said casually. “What, are you just in the habit of dropping in unannounced these days?” I laughed. “I figured I’d hitch a ride into the office since you were going. I saw Louis and flagged him down. I’m actually surprised to see you out of the house and fully clothed.” He grinned at me. “Work never stops, you know that. I’m going in to handle a few things and then I’m out. Speaking of which.” I dialed a number in my phone. “Jared, it’s Logan. Have you found anything for me to look at?” I listened as he rattled off everything he had found that would suit my needs. “I’ll be there in a few days, set up some viewings will you?” He spoke rapidly. “Good, see you then.” I hung up. “What was that?” He knew exactly who Jared was. “I’m relocating for a bit.” I hid my smile, knowing how he was going to react. “What? You’re moving to Chicago?” His eyes looked like they were going to pop out of his head. “I am. For at least the next six months, or until I can convince Grace to move here.” “Look, I know I told you to go for it, but I didn’t mean this.” “Smith, I won’t be talked out of this. So jump on board. Grace is who I want. This is what I need for right now.” “I’m kind of at a loss for words.” He just looked at me. “For once in your life.” I laughed. “Shai was right, man, I deserve happiness, too.” “Okay, now you sound like a chick.” “Shut the fuck up. You know what I mean. You both have been badgering me to go to her for months. With her, it’s so different. And I know how I sound.” I shrugged. A slow smile spread on his face. “I never thought I’d live to see the day when Logan McFadden would be all in.” “It will happen to you, too. When you least expect it, it will hit you like a bolt of lightning. And let me tell you, sex with her is so much better than sex with a random.” “Now you sound like Shai. She’s been pestering me about not being such a whore for a while.” He groaned and rolled his eyes. “Maybe you should listen. She’s pretty on the nose these days. Who knows, maybe it’s the extra hormones.” The limo pulled up to the McFadden building and Smith and I got out. He worked in marketing and research and development for me. “Are you going to tell me how it went with Faith?” I asked as we stepped out onto the street. “I don’t kiss and tell,” he smirked. “Since when?” “Since you’re screwing her sister.” “Nice. Always the wordsmith. Do you think I’m going to go running back to Grace with this? Besides, what makes you think she hasn’t already told her?” “Fine. It was amazing. Happy now?” It was my turn to smirk. “The DeLeo women seem to have our number, my friend.” “That they do.” He grinned. The lobby was a madhouse, people milled around waiting for meetings. “Please tell me you don’t expect me to move with you,” he asked as we walked into the elevator. “Of course not. You’re such an ass, you know that right?” “I don’t deny that.” He got off the floor below mine, leaving me alone with my phone once again. There was a text from Grace. Grace: Miss you already xoxo I smiled and typed out a quick reply before exiting the elevator. Brooke was waiting for me by the elevator with a cup of coffee and a stack of messages. “Welcome back, Mr. McFadden, hope you got everything sorted out.” “What? Oh, yeah, you could say that. Tell me, how would you feel about relocating to Chicago for six months?” Brooke was a damn good assistant, and I hoped she would say yes to coming with me. “Chicago?” “Yeah, I’m moving there for at least six months.” I walked briskly toward my office. “Can I think about it?” She looked uneasy. “Of course, I need to be there, and I would really like you to come as well.” I smiled and sat down behind my desk. Five hours later Brooke buzzed me on the intercom. “There’s a Grace DeLeo here to see you. She doesn’t have an appointment.” “Send her in.” I looked at my watch and winced, it was well past one o’clock, more like three. I got up just as Brooke opened the door. “I’m so sorry, I got caught up.” I walked briskly to her and took her in my arms, kissing her soundly. “Forgive me?” “With a welcome like that, how could I not,” she said, her cheeks flushed. Brooke made a sound to let us know she was still there. “Sorry, where are my manners. Brooke, this is my girlfriend Grace.” Grace held her hand out and Brooke looked mildly shocked as she shook it. “It’s so nice to meet you, Brooke.” Grace smiled warmly. “You as well Miss DeLeo.” She frowned slightly. “Please, call me Grace.” “Okay. I need to get back to my desk, I can hear the phone ringing off the hook.” She smiled and hurried out of the room. Grace gave me an odd look after I closed the door. “What?” “You do know she’s in love with you, right?” “Who? Brooke?” “Yes. You can’t tell me you haven’t noticed the way she looks at you?” She chewed her lower lip. “Well it’s one sided if she has any feelings for me. It’s only ever been professional with us. I asked her to come with me to Chicago, that won’t be an issue for you, will it?” She cocked her head to the side, thinking. “No, I suppose not. As long as you can tell me you have never slept with her.” “Kitten, did you not just hear what I said? It’s only ever been professional between Brooke and me. But I will say that jealousy looks good on you.” I grinned at her and went around my desk to shut down my computer. “Are you done for the day?” She followed me over. “I am now. Again, I’m so sorry it was longer than I had told you.” “Hey, it’s okay. I know the planet doesn’t run without you.” Her eyes danced with amusement. “You're not far off in that assessment, actually.” She rolled her eyes. “Come on, let’s go home so you can put your considerable skills to better use.” “I SPOKE TO MY REAL estate guy today and he has some places lined up for me to look at in a few days,” I said casually as we walked into my apartment. “Oh yeah?” She looked up at me. “Yeah, do you want to go look at them with me when we get to Chicago?” “I do, but I also have work that’s been piling up. I’ll need to go into the office for a bit. I had planned on going home with Faith tonight originally.” “But now…” I trailed off. “Now I’m staying with you to help you pack or whatever it is you need to do before we go.” “You want to help me pack?” This was a new one for me. Not since my mother had someone wanted to help me pack. “I do. I want to help you with whatever you need help with.” She smiled. “What did I do to deserve you?” I pulled her into a hug. “I’m not sure, but keep doing it.” She giggled as I squeezed her tight. “Well, let’s get to packing then.” I hustled her into my bedroom. “Just what is it that you want to ‘pack’ right now?” She made air quotes as she spoke. “Oh, there will be plenty of ‘packing’ later Kitten, for now we need to decide what I can’t live without for six months.” “I seriously can’t believe you’re actually moving to Chicago.” “I need to be where you are for the time being. It’s that simple.” I pulled her against me. “This feels right to me. Does it feel the same to you?” I hated feeling insecure, I wasn’t used to it, and I didn’t like it. “Of course, it does. You feel like home to me, Logan. When I saw you in the lobby the other day, my heart almost leapt out of my chest. I don’t want to be without you any more than you want to be without me.” Who the hell was I anymore? Gone was all the bravado and the rules I normally had. I wanted nothing more than to stay in bed with her all day. I didn’t even care about work, which was very much not like me. I should be worried, but I wasn’t. “Come on, let’s go and weed through your clothes and find what you can’t live without. Let’s start with suits shall we?” She kicked her heels off and padded into my huge walk-in closet. I followed her in and started making piles on the racks. “What about this one?” She held up one of my favorite suits with a huge grin. it was the one I had been wearing when we met. “I think yes.” I leaned over and kissed her cheek. “I think yes, too.” She beamed at me. An hour later we had piles of clothes set aside to be packed up. “Do you have boxes or anything?” “For what?” I asked. “Um, packing.” She looked at me like I was crazy. “I hire people for that, Kitten. I haven't packed a box in as long as I can remember. The only thing I will pack is enough clothing to see me through until the boxes come.” “Sometimes I forget how rich you are.” She shook her head. “Yep, that’s me, Mr. Moneybags,” I teased her. “Well, then what are we going to do with these piles of clothes until they get packed up?” She gestured to the stacks, piles, and racks. “Move them to the living room for now. I have better plans for the bed.” I grinned wickedly at her. “I seem to remember you saying something about wanting to pack me full of something.” She giggled and swayed her hips. “I think we need food before we can get to that, don’t you?” I went to the kitchen to peruse my stack of take-out menus. “Do you not have any food in the refrigerator?” She opened it up and found only milk, orange juice, and coffee creamer. “Really, Logan? This is all you have in here? How do you survive?” “I eat out.” He shrugged. “All the time?” “Yep. I don’t really cook, and I let my housekeeper go about seven months ago. So no, I never make food in this apartment.” She laughed softly and took my hand. “Come on, let’s go.” “Where are we going?” “To buy some food so I can make dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow.” She gave me an exasperated look. We walked to the grocery store a few blocks away because there was a break in the rain and Grace wanted to stretch her legs. “Do you love it here?” she asked as we walked hand in hand. New York in the fall was one of my favorite times of year. Not too cold, not too hot. “I do, but I’ll love being in Chicago just as much.” “Oh yeah, and why’s that?” She rolled her eyes, expecting a cheesy response. “Because you’ll be there.” I stopped and pulled her into my arms, stealing her breath away with a kiss. “What am I going to do with you?” She grinned up at me. “I think the question is what would you do without me?” I kissed the tip of her nose and we continued on to the store. “What do you want to eat tonight?” she asked as she grabbed a cart. “I don’t really care. I’m not picky about food.” I took the cart while she walked up and down aisles and threw things in. She sucked her lower lip into her mouth and pondered between two flavors of ice cream. “Get them both.” “We don't need both, we’ll only be here another day or so right?” “Kitten, just get them both, you obviously want them.” I took them and put them in the cart. “God, you are so bossy.” She sighed and continued with the shopping. “We’ve been over that fact before,” I said dryly. “I didn’t say that I didn’t like you being bossy.” She kissed my cheek and sauntered off down the aisle. “Has Brooke made up her mind about coming to Chicago?” she asked, and I could tell by her tone she hoped the answer was no. “Jealous, are we?” “No, not jealous. Just curious.” She gave me a bland look as though she was trying to prove the point. “No, she has not made up her mind yet. I promise you’ll be the first to know when she does.” I grinned. “Ass.” She stuck her tongue out at me. Back at home, Grace was in the kitchen chopping things and stirring pots. I wasn’t sure what she was making, but it smelled amazing. “Can I help?” I leaned against the counter. “Nope, but you can help with breakfast tomorrow if you want. This meal is all me.” “Okay, have it your way.” I left the kitchen, and went to the small office I had in the apartment. I had a mountain of work that I hadn’t gotten to when I was actually at the office. Seeing it all made me feel like I needed someone to take over for me. That thought was quickly squashed as soon as I got into it. There were three emails from the small record label I had acquired in L.A. All of them wanting to know what I thought of the artist they were considering signing. I looked over the information they had sent and fired off a quick approval. I could see the potential and knew that there was money to be made there. Next there were countless emails from my sister and a few from my mother. Both wanting to know why I wasn't returning their phone calls and text messages. I sighed and dialed my mom’s number. “Logan? What on earth have you been doing that you can’t call your mother?” she scolded. “Hello to you, too, Mother. I’ve just been busy.” “You haven’t been at work.” She shot back. “No, I haven’t.” God, I hated that she was checking in on me. It’s not like she even cared when I was growing up. “Would this have anything to do with the woman in the trench coat who accosted you in the lobby of your office building?” she said, her tone was brisk. My fingers gripped the phone in my hand. “First of all, she did not accost me. Second of all, she is none of your business. Is this why you called? If so, I need to go.” “Logan.” Her tone was icy. “Mother, have a pleasant evening. I’ll phone you next week when things settle down a bit.” “Your father spoke to Jared this morning. Were you planning on telling us you were relocating to Chicago?” “No, I wasn’t. Since when do you even care where I live?” I hated that she brought up my father, as though he was supposed to have some significance to my life. Neither of them ever cared enough to find out anything about my life unless it directly affected them. “I care because I won’t let some gold digging whore work her way into your life the way you let…” I interrupted her. “Shut up! This has nothing to do with her. You don’t know Grace, or the way we feel about each other. I will not sit here and listen to you call her a whore. She is anything but.” I slammed the phone down hard enough to crack it. Grace appeared a moment later. “Logan? Are you okay? I thought I heard shouting.” She looked concerned and a little scared. “I’m fine,” I said tightly. My temper was still up, and I didn’t want to take it out on her. “Give me a moment, okay?” I rose from my seat and kissed her lightly before going out to the balcony. Leave it to my mother to ruin a perfectly good evening. I gripped the metal railing and looked out over the city. Gradually, I relaxed. A few minutes later, I turned around to find Grace watching me from the living room, a nervous expression on her face. I opened the slider and walked in. “Are you okay?” she asked softly. “I am now.” I pulled her against me, inhaling her scent. She always smelled like flowers. “Do you want to talk about it?” She brushed her lips against mine before pulling back to look me in the eye. I could feel her anxiety. “No, I really don’t.” I pulled her in tighter. I WASN’T SURE WHAT HAD upset Logan, but I didn’t like that he wouldn't share it with me. I made up my mind that tonight I would get him to open up to me. I couldn’t stand the wall between us. I needed him to trust me. If whatever this was we were in was going to work, he had to trust me. “Dinner is almost ready. If you would like to join me in the kitchen, you can set the table.” “Your wish is my command.” He kissed my knuckles. “What are we having anyway?” “Tortellini in homemade sauce and sautéed veggies.” “Sounds heavenly.” He followed me into the kitchen. “So, tell me what that was all about?” I broached the subject again. “Grace.” His tone held a warning. “No. Sorry, but I’m not going to let this drop. If you want me to be a part of your life, you need to let me in.” I stood my ground, a hand on my hip. I was going to be strong about this, even though I felt like jelly on the inside. Confrontation was not my thing. I needed him to understand me, to get that we needed to be open with each other. He raked a hand through his hair and glared at me. I knew I was painting him into a corner, but I didn’t really care. “Look at it from my perspective, please. I’m an open book. You know all there is to know. You, on the other hand, I know almost nothing about. Every time I ask you something, you shut me down.” I let some of my frustration out. He sank onto one of the barstools on the other side of the big island. “I do want to let you in. It’s hard for me. I’m not free with myself the way you are.” “You think it’s easy for me to be free with myself? It’s not. It’s a battle with myself sometimes. But I have to trust you, I need to trust that you won’t crush me.” I forced myself to look him in the eye so he could see how serious I was. “I never want to hurt you, Kitten.” I nodded. “You need to give me something here, Logan.” “What can I do?” “Start with that phone conversation. Who were you talking to?” He sighed. “My mother.” “What made you so upset?” “She made insinuations about you that I didn’t appreciate. My mother and I have a very complicated relationship.” “I see.” I stirred the sauce in the big pot on the stove. “I don’t want her to ruin anything. She always does.” “She can't ruin things if we don't let her. Thank you for telling me.” I smiled. “It’s not going to be easy with me, Kitten, I want you to know that going in. I’m not easy, nothing about me is. You're going to have to work at this with me.” This bit of honesty was what I wanted. I needed it. “I’m willing to work at it, as long as we’re both on the same page about it.” The look in his eye changed, shifted to heat, a slow smolder. He was up and around the counter in a moment, and I felt myself being lifted onto the island. His lips grazed my collarbone. “I want to be what you deserve.” “You already are,” I whispered. His arms circled me, one hand on my thigh, the other behind my neck. “Kitten, where are your panties?” he growled as his fingers slid along the smooth skin of my upper thigh. Thank goodness for skirts. “Um, I didn’t wear any today.” I was not thinking clearly. His fingers traced little circles on my skin. “Good lord, what am I going to do with you?” He pushed my skirt higher. “I can think of a thing or two,” I panted as he closed in on the one place I wanted him to be. “What about dinner?” he whispered against my lips. “Dinner? It can wait. I think we have more pressing matters to attend to.” I gestured to the front of his pants. It was apparent that he was enjoying himself as much as I was. “Let me just turn off the burners.” I hopped off the counter and turned off all the knobs and put lids on everything. Logan was leaning against the counter when I turned back around. He had taken his tie off and unbuttoned his shirt. Delicious was the word that came to mind as my gaze raked over his muscled torso. “Like what you see?” His voice was sex itself. Smooth and seductive. I felt my knees go weak. “Very much.” I slid the shirt from his shoulders, pressing kisses to his arms as it fell to the floor. “Care to catch up?” He pointed at my blouse. “Your wish is my command.” I threw his words back at him while I untucked it from my skirt. “No, let me.” He took ahold of my hand. I nodded my acceptance and dropped my hands to my sides. He slowly inched my shirt up my stomach, his fingers touching every inch of skin he revealed. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything more beautiful,” he murmured after he had finished removing my shirt. I took his face in my hands and brought his mouth down to mine. “Let’s go to the bedroom, I think we need a bit more space.” He picked me up and hauled me over his shoulder. I squealed when he slapped me on the butt. When we got into the room, he practically threw me on the bed after he tore my skirt off. I watched through my lashes as he took his pants off. He was mouthwatering in nothing but his skin. “Come here.” I crawled back against the headboard. He covered me with his body, the weight of him, the heat of his skin, felt like heaven. He parted my legs with his knee and slowly slid in, inch by glorious inch. I shivered as his lips found mine. “Fast, baby,” I moaned. “I’m ready for it.” “Anything you say, Kitten,” he growled, setting a merciless pace. I squeezed his waist with my legs, the feeling so intense, I knew it wouldn’t be long. “I’m close,” I panted. “Already? Well, give me a moment to catch up.” His hands moved between us to cup my boobs. “Sorry,” I said between clenched teeth. “Never apologize for your pleasure.” He crushed his mouth onto mine a second before I exploded around him. He followed suit soon after. “Should we consider this make-up sex?” He laughed after he rolled to the side. “Do you think that was a fight?” I turned to look at him. “I don’t know, was it?” “No, believe me, you’ll know when we have a fight. Think of this as a reward for good behavior.” I scooted myself to the side of the bed and went in search of a shirt to put on. I found one of his t-shirts and threw it on quickly. “Where are you going?” he asked. “To salvage dinner. You should get up, too. The table isn’t going to set itself.” I heard him laugh as I walked out into the living room. I was pleased to see the food wasn't too far gone. I turned the burners back on and set about heating things up again. Logan came in a few minutes later wearing a pair of sweats. “I’m here as commanded.” “You know where everything is.” I pointed a spoon at him. “This will be ready in just a moment.” When we were seated with food piled on our plates, I decided to see if I could get him to open up more. “Tell me about your family.” I watched him to see his reaction. He looked up from his plate. “What would you like to know?” “Why aren’t you close with your mom?” “She’s difficult. Wasn't around a lot when I was growing up. Leah and I were raised by nannies and the housekeeper.” “That sounds hard.” I laid my hand on his. “It was and it wasn’t. Some years were better than others.” “What about your dad?” “He was busy running the company into the ground,” he scoffed. “My grandfather had given him a thriving company and he took it to the brink of ruin in the twenty years he had it under his control. He seemed to care more about chasing women than actually running the company.” “How old were you when you took over?” “Nineteen. I met with the board and we kicked him out.” “Wow. That’s crazy.” “It was what needed to be done. They wanted him out. Hell, he wanted out. It was killing him, the guilt and worry were taking their toll. He and I didn’t speak for five years after it happened. My mother, of course, was mortified. She fled to Paris for a few years. Until things had quieted down. She always has cared so much about what others thought.” “Your family sounds pretty screwed up.” “They are. Leah and I are lucky we had each other.” “I’d like to meet her.” I smiled. “You will. We’ll go see her after the baby comes.” He returned my smile. “What was it your mother said about me?” Hearing it made me nervous, but I needed to at the same time. His jaw tightened. “You don’t want to know.” “I really do,” I prodded, steeling myself for the words. “She called you a gold digging whore. Happy now?” He looked me in the eye and I could see the anger just under the surface. I sucked in a breath. “She doesn’t know me, how could she think that?” “It doesn’t matter what she thinks. What I think is what’s important, and I know exactly who you are, Kitten.” I decided that I had pressed my luck enough for the night and changed the subject to safer topics. After dinner, we curled up in bed and watched movies until neither of us could keep our eyes open any longer. I drifted off to sleep in his arms, which was right where I wanted to be.",

      "content": "AS MUCH AS I WANTED to spend the whole day in bed with Grace, I had work that was screaming for attention. Plus the arrangements for Chicago needed to be made. I slid out of bed as quietly as I could, but she woke up anyway. “Where are you going?” She blinked up at me. “I have to go to the office for a few hours. Go back to sleep and I’ll be back before you know it.” I leaned down to kiss her, and she pulled me back down with her. “You know, this isn’t how getting up works, right?” I rolled her onto her back and kissed her. “Maybe I don’t want you to get up.” She wrapped her legs around my hips. This morning was going to take willpower for me to actually get out of the apartment. “Kitten, as much as I would love to stay in bed with you right now I can’t.” I kissed her neck. “See, now you’re sending mixed signals.” She ground her pelvis into me. I groaned and kissed her one more time before rolling off of her. “I need to get in the shower. If you would like to join me, we can make it a productive shower.” I grinned and held my hand out for her. I went to the sink to shave and brush my teeth. Grace joined me in brushing her teeth before she turned on the shower. It was all I could do not to slice my neck open as I watched her soap up in the mirror. She knew exactly what she was doing to me, too. My little sex Kitten. I shaved in a hurry and joined her. “Here, why don’t you let me soap you up?” Her soapy fingers slid down my stomach. Before long, I had her pressed up against the wall with her legs around my waist. I wanted all of her pleasure, it belonged to me. I pushed her further, setting a faster pace. I wanted to see her when she exploded around me, when she let go completely. “God, can we make this an everyday thing?” She panted against my shoulder. “If we did, we’d both be perpetually late for work.” I set her down and grabbed my shampoo. “I don’t think that’s too big of a deal, do you?” She grabbed her own shampoo and lathered her hair into a huge lump on top of her head. “I guess being the boss does have a few perks.” I kissed her again and rinsed my hair. After a quick soap down I was out of the shower with a towel wrapped around my waist. When I came out of my closet half dressed, Grace was laying on the bed wrapped in a towel. Something about this took me back to three months ago and I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach. “What time will you be home?” She stretched out on the bed. “Not much after one, but feel free to call and yell at me if I go too far past that.” I grinned and slipped my shirt on. “How is it that we just had sex and I already want you again? You do something ungodly to a suit Logan.” She bit her lip, a predatory look in her eyes. My unease was erased with those words, this was nothing like that day. She would be here waiting when I got home. “I’ll be home soon, try not to miss me too much.” I pressed my lips gently to hers and grabbed my phone from the nightstand. “Hurry home.” She licked her lips. “If you don’t stop that, I’ll never make it out of the house.” I kissed her again and left before she could talk me into staying. The limo was waiting when I stepped out of the elevator. I slid across the seat and started scrolling through the mountain of emails I had to answer. I was so absorbed in what I was doing I didn’t notice the door open and Smith slide into the seat across from me until we were a block away from where he got in. “Morning,” he said casually. “What, are you just in the habit of dropping in unannounced these days?” I laughed. “I figured I’d hitch a ride into the office since you were going. I saw Louis and flagged him down. I’m actually surprised to see you out of the house and fully clothed.” He grinned at me. “Work never stops, you know that. I’m going in to handle a few things and then I’m out. Speaking of which.” I dialed a number in my phone. “Jared, it’s Logan. Have you found anything for me to look at?” I listened as he rattled off everything he had found that would suit my needs. “I’ll be there in a few days, set up some viewings will you?” He spoke rapidly. “Good, see you then.” I hung up. “What was that?” He knew exactly who Jared was. “I’m relocating for a bit.” I hid my smile, knowing how he was going to react. “What? You’re moving to Chicago?” His eyes looked like they were going to pop out of his head. “I am. For at least the next six months, or until I can convince Grace to move here.” “Look, I know I told you to go for it, but I didn’t mean this.” “Smith, I won’t be talked out of this. So jump on board. Grace is who I want. This is what I need for right now.” “I’m kind of at a loss for words.” He just looked at me. “For once in your life.” I laughed. “Shai was right, man, I deserve happiness, too.” “Okay, now you sound like a chick.” “Shut the fuck up. You know what I mean. You both have been badgering me to go to her for months. With her, it’s so different. And I know how I sound.” I shrugged. A slow smile spread on his face. “I never thought I’d live to see the day when Logan McFadden would be all in.” “It will happen to you, too. When you least expect it, it will hit you like a bolt of lightning. And let me tell you, sex with her is so much better than sex with a random.” “Now you sound like Shai. She’s been pestering me about not being such a whore for a while.” He groaned and rolled his eyes. “Maybe you should listen. She’s pretty on the nose these days. Who knows, maybe it’s the extra hormones.” The limo pulled up to the McFadden building and Smith and I got out. He worked in marketing and research and development for me. “Are you going to tell me how it went with Faith?” I asked as we stepped out onto the street. “I don’t kiss and tell,” he smirked. “Since when?” “Since you’re screwing her sister.” “Nice. Always the wordsmith. Do you think I’m going to go running back to Grace with this? Besides, what makes you think she hasn’t already told her?” “Fine. It was amazing. Happy now?” It was my turn to smirk. “The DeLeo women seem to have our number, my friend.” “That they do.” He grinned. The lobby was a madhouse, people milled around waiting for meetings. “Please tell me you don’t expect me to move with you,” he asked as we walked into the elevator. “Of course not. You’re such an ass, you know that right?” “I don’t deny that.” He got off the floor below mine, leaving me alone with my phone once again. There was a text from Grace. Grace: Miss you already xoxo I smiled and typed out a quick reply before exiting the elevator. Brooke was waiting for me by the elevator with a cup of coffee and a stack of messages. “Welcome back, Mr. McFadden, hope you got everything sorted out.” “What? Oh, yeah, you could say that. Tell me, how would you feel about relocating to Chicago for six months?” Brooke was a damn good assistant, and I hoped she would say yes to coming with me. “Chicago?” “Yeah, I’m moving there for at least six months.” I walked briskly toward my office. “Can I think about it?” She looked uneasy. “Of course, I need to be there, and I would really like you to come as well.” I smiled and sat down behind my desk. Five hours later Brooke buzzed me on the intercom. “There’s a Grace DeLeo here to see you. She doesn’t have an appointment.” “Send her in.” I looked at my watch and winced, it was well past one o’clock, more like three. I got up just as Brooke opened the door. “I’m so sorry, I got caught up.” I walked briskly to her and took her in my arms, kissing her soundly. “Forgive me?” “With a welcome like that, how could I not,” she said, her cheeks flushed. Brooke made a sound to let us know she was still there. “Sorry, where are my manners. Brooke, this is my girlfriend Grace.” Grace held her hand out and Brooke looked mildly shocked as she shook it. “It’s so nice to meet you, Brooke.” Grace smiled warmly. “You as well Miss DeLeo.” She frowned slightly. “Please, call me Grace.” “Okay. I need to get back to my desk, I can hear the phone ringing off the hook.” She smiled and hurried out of the room. Grace gave me an odd look after I closed the door. “What?” “You do know she’s in love with you, right?” “Who? Brooke?” “Yes. You can’t tell me you haven’t noticed the way she looks at you?” She chewed her lower lip. “Well it’s one sided if she has any feelings for me. It’s only ever been professional with us. I asked her to come with me to Chicago, that won’t be an issue for you, will it?” She cocked her head to the side, thinking. “No, I suppose not. As long as you can tell me you have never slept with her.” “Kitten, did you not just hear what I said? It’s only ever been professional between Brooke and me. But I will say that jealousy looks good on you.” I grinned at her and went around my desk to shut down my computer. “Are you done for the day?” She followed me over. “I am now. Again, I’m so sorry it was longer than I had told you.” “Hey, it’s okay. I know the planet doesn’t run without you.” Her eyes danced with amusement. “You're not far off in that assessment, actually.” She rolled her eyes. “Come on, let’s go home so you can put your considerable skills to better use.” “I SPOKE TO MY REAL estate guy today and he has some places lined up for me to look at in a few days,” I said casually as we walked into my apartment. “Oh yeah?” She looked up at me. “Yeah, do you want to go look at them with me when we get to Chicago?” “I do, but I also have work that’s been piling up. I’ll need to go into the office for a bit. I had planned on going home with Faith tonight originally.” “But now…” I trailed off. “Now I’m staying with you to help you pack or whatever it is you need to do before we go.” “You want to help me pack?” This was a new one for me. Not since my mother had someone wanted to help me pack. “I do. I want to help you with whatever you need help with.” She smiled. “What did I do to deserve you?” I pulled her into a hug. “I’m not sure, but keep doing it.” She giggled as I squeezed her tight. “Well, let’s get to packing then.” I hustled her into my bedroom. “Just what is it that you want to ‘pack’ right now?” She made air quotes as she spoke. “Oh, there will be plenty of ‘packing’ later Kitten, for now we need to decide what I can’t live without for six months.” “I seriously can’t believe you’re actually moving to Chicago.” “I need to be where you are for the time being. It’s that simple.” I pulled her against me. “This feels right to me. Does it feel the same to you?” I hated feeling insecure, I wasn’t used to it, and I didn’t like it. “Of course, it does. You feel like home to me, Logan. When I saw you in the lobby the other day, my heart almost leapt out of my chest. I don’t want to be without you any more than you want to be without me.” Who the hell was I anymore? Gone was all the bravado and the rules I normally had. I wanted nothing more than to stay in bed with her all day. I didn’t even care about work, which was very much not like me. I should be worried, but I wasn’t. “Come on, let’s go and weed through your clothes and find what you can’t live without. Let’s start with suits shall we?” She kicked her heels off and padded into my huge walk-in closet. I followed her in and started making piles on the racks. “What about this one?” She held up one of my favorite suits with a huge grin. it was the one I had been wearing when we met. “I think yes.” I leaned over and kissed her cheek. “I think yes, too.” She beamed at me. An hour later we had piles of clothes set aside to be packed up. “Do you have boxes or anything?” “For what?” I asked. “Um, packing.” She looked at me like I was crazy. “I hire people for that, Kitten. I haven't packed a box in as long as I can remember. The only thing I will pack is enough clothing to see me through until the boxes come.” “Sometimes I forget how rich you are.” She shook her head. “Yep, that’s me, Mr. Moneybags,” I teased her. “Well, then what are we going to do with these piles of clothes until they get packed up?” She gestured to the stacks, piles, and racks. “Move them to the living room for now. I have better plans for the bed.” I grinned wickedly at her. “I seem to remember you saying something about wanting to pack me full of something.” She giggled and swayed her hips. “I think we need food before we can get to that, don’t you?” I went to the kitchen to peruse my stack of take-out menus. “Do you not have any food in the refrigerator?” She opened it up and found only milk, orange juice, and coffee creamer. “Really, Logan? This is all you have in here? How do you survive?” “I eat out.” He shrugged. “All the time?” “Yep. I don’t really cook, and I let my housekeeper go about seven months ago. So no, I never make food in this apartment.” She laughed softly and took my hand. “Come on, let’s go.” “Where are we going?” “To buy some food so I can make dinner tonight and breakfast tomorrow.” She gave me an exasperated look. We walked to the grocery store a few blocks away because there was a break in the rain and Grace wanted to stretch her legs. “Do you love it here?” she asked as we walked hand in hand. New York in the fall was one of my favorite times of year. Not too cold, not too hot. “I do, but I’ll love being in Chicago just as much.” “Oh yeah, and why’s that?” She rolled her eyes, expecting a cheesy response. “Because you’ll be there.” I stopped and pulled her into my arms, stealing her breath away with a kiss. “What am I going to do with you?” She grinned up at me. “I think the question is what would you do without me?” I kissed the tip of her nose and we continued on to the store. “What do you want to eat tonight?” she asked as she grabbed a cart. “I don’t really care. I’m not picky about food.” I took the cart while she walked up and down aisles and threw things in. She sucked her lower lip into her mouth and pondered between two flavors of ice cream. “Get them both.” “We don't need both, we’ll only be here another day or so right?” “Kitten, just get them both, you obviously want them.” I took them and put them in the cart. “God, you are so bossy.” She sighed and continued with the shopping. “We’ve been over that fact before,” I said dryly. “I didn’t say that I didn’t like you being bossy.” She kissed my cheek and sauntered off down the aisle. “Has Brooke made up her mind about coming to Chicago?” she asked, and I could tell by her tone she hoped the answer was no. “Jealous, are we?” “No, not jealous. Just curious.” She gave me a bland look as though she was trying to prove the point. “No, she has not made up her mind yet. I promise you’ll be the first to know when she does.” I grinned. “Ass.” She stuck her tongue out at me. Back at home, Grace was in the kitchen chopping things and stirring pots. I wasn’t sure what she was making, but it smelled amazing. “Can I help?” I leaned against the counter. “Nope, but you can help with breakfast tomorrow if you want. This meal is all me.” “Okay, have it your way.” I left the kitchen, and went to the small office I had in the apartment. I had a mountain of work that I hadn’t gotten to when I was actually at the office. Seeing it all made me feel like I needed someone to take over for me. That thought was quickly squashed as soon as I got into it. There were three emails from the small record label I had acquired in L.A. All of them wanting to know what I thought of the artist they were considering signing. I looked over the information they had sent and fired off a quick approval. I could see the potential and knew that there was money to be made there. Next there were countless emails from my sister and a few from my mother. Both wanting to know why I wasn't returning their phone calls and text messages. I sighed and dialed my mom’s number. “Logan? What on earth have you been doing that you can’t call your mother?” she scolded. “Hello to you, too, Mother. I’ve just been busy.” “You haven’t been at work.” She shot back. “No, I haven’t.” God, I hated that she was checking in on me. It’s not like she even cared when I was growing up. “Would this have anything to do with the woman in the trench coat who accosted you in the lobby of your office building?” she said, her tone was brisk. My fingers gripped the phone in my hand. “First of all, she did not accost me. Second of all, she is none of your business. Is this why you called? If so, I need to go.” “Logan.” Her tone was icy. “Mother, have a pleasant evening. I’ll phone you next week when things settle down a bit.” “Your father spoke to Jared this morning. Were you planning on telling us you were relocating to Chicago?” “No, I wasn’t. Since when do you even care where I live?” I hated that she brought up my father, as though he was supposed to have some significance to my life. Neither of them ever cared enough to find out anything about my life unless it directly affected them. “I care because I won’t let some gold digging whore work her way into your life the way you let…” I interrupted her. “Shut up! This has nothing to do with her. You don’t know Grace, or the way we feel about each other. I will not sit here and listen to you call her a whore. She is anything but.” I slammed the phone down hard enough to crack it. Grace appeared a moment later. “Logan? Are you okay? I thought I heard shouting.” She looked concerned and a little scared. “I’m fine,” I said tightly. My temper was still up, and I didn’t want to take it out on her. “Give me a moment, okay?” I rose from my seat and kissed her lightly before going out to the balcony. Leave it to my mother to ruin a perfectly good evening. I gripped the metal railing and looked out over the city. Gradually, I relaxed. A few minutes later, I turned around to find Grace watching me from the living room, a nervous expression on her face. I opened the slider and walked in. “Are you okay?” she asked softly. “I am now.” I pulled her against me, inhaling her scent. She always smelled like flowers. “Do you want to talk about it?” She brushed her lips against mine before pulling back to look me in the eye. I could feel her anxiety. “No, I really don’t.” I pulled her in tighter. I WASN’T SURE WHAT HAD upset Logan, but I didn’t like that he wouldn't share it with me. I made up my mind that tonight I would get him to open up to me. I couldn’t stand the wall between us. I needed him to trust me. If whatever this was we were in was going to work, he had to trust me. “Dinner is almost ready. If you would like to join me in the kitchen, you can set the table.” “Your wish is my command.” He kissed my knuckles. “What are we having anyway?” “Tortellini in homemade sauce and sautéed veggies.” “Sounds heavenly.” He followed me into the kitchen. “So, tell me what that was all about?” I broached the subject again. “Grace.” His tone held a warning. “No. Sorry, but I’m not going to let this drop. If you want me to be a part of your life, you need to let me in.” I stood my ground, a hand on my hip. I was going to be strong about this, even though I felt like jelly on the inside. Confrontation was not my thing. I needed him to understand me, to get that we needed to be open with each other. He raked a hand through his hair and glared at me. I knew I was painting him into a corner, but I didn’t really care. “Look at it from my perspective, please. I’m an open book. You know all there is to know. You, on the other hand, I know almost nothing about. Every time I ask you something, you shut me down.” I let some of my frustration out. He sank onto one of the barstools on the other side of the big island. “I do want to let you in. It’s hard for me. I’m not free with myself the way you are.” “You think it’s easy for me to be free with myself? It’s not. It’s a battle with myself sometimes. But I have to trust you, I need to trust that you won’t crush me.” I forced myself to look him in the eye so he could see how serious I was. “I never want to hurt you, Kitten.” I nodded. “You need to give me something here, Logan.” “What can I do?” “Start with that phone conversation. Who were you talking to?” He sighed. “My mother.” “What made you so upset?” “She made insinuations about you that I didn’t appreciate. My mother and I have a very complicated relationship.” “I see.” I stirred the sauce in the big pot on the stove. “I don’t want her to ruin anything. She always does.” “She can't ruin things if we don't let her. Thank you for telling me.” I smiled. “It’s not going to be easy with me, Kitten, I want you to know that going in. I’m not easy, nothing about me is. You're going to have to work at this with me.” This bit of honesty was what I wanted. I needed it. “I’m willing to work at it, as long as we’re both on the same page about it.” The look in his eye changed, shifted to heat, a slow smolder. He was up and around the counter in a moment, and I felt myself being lifted onto the island. His lips grazed my collarbone. “I want to be what you deserve.” “You already are,” I whispered. His arms circled me, one hand on my thigh, the other behind my neck. “Kitten, where are your panties?” he growled as his fingers slid along the smooth skin of my upper thigh. Thank goodness for skirts. “Um, I didn’t wear any today.” I was not thinking clearly. His fingers traced little circles on my skin. “Good lord, what am I going to do with you?” He pushed my skirt higher. “I can think of a thing or two,” I panted as he closed in on the one place I wanted him to be. “What about dinner?” he whispered against my lips. “Dinner? It can wait. I think we have more pressing matters to attend to.” I gestured to the front of his pants. It was apparent that he was enjoying himself as much as I was. “Let me just turn off the burners.” I hopped off the counter and turned off all the knobs and put lids on everything. Logan was leaning against the counter when I turned back around. He had taken his tie off and unbuttoned his shirt. Delicious was the word that came to mind as my gaze raked over his muscled torso. “Like what you see?” His voice was sex itself. Smooth and seductive. I felt my knees go weak. “Very much.” I slid the shirt from his shoulders, pressing kisses to his arms as it fell to the floor. “Care to catch up?” He pointed at my blouse. “Your wish is my command.” I threw his words back at him while I untucked it from my skirt. “No, let me.” He took ahold of my hand. I nodded my acceptance and dropped my hands to my sides. He slowly inched my shirt up my stomach, his fingers touching every inch of skin he revealed. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything more beautiful,” he murmured after he had finished removing my shirt. I took his face in my hands and brought his mouth down to mine. “Let’s go to the bedroom, I think we need a bit more space.” He picked me up and hauled me over his shoulder. I squealed when he slapped me on the butt. When we got into the room, he practically threw me on the bed after he tore my skirt off. I watched through my lashes as he took his pants off. He was mouthwatering in nothing but his skin. “Come here.” I crawled back against the headboard. He covered me with his body, the weight of him, the heat of his skin, felt like heaven. He parted my legs with his knee and slowly slid in, inch by glorious inch. I shivered as his lips found mine. “Fast, baby,” I moaned. “I’m ready for it.” “Anything you say, Kitten,” he growled, setting a merciless pace. I squeezed his waist with my legs, the feeling so intense, I knew it wouldn’t be long. “I’m close,” I panted. “Already? Well, give me a moment to catch up.” His hands moved between us to cup my boobs. “Sorry,” I said between clenched teeth. “Never apologize for your pleasure.” He crushed his mouth onto mine a second before I exploded around him. He followed suit soon after. “Should we consider this make-up sex?” He laughed after he rolled to the side. “Do you think that was a fight?” I turned to look at him. “I don’t know, was it?” “No, believe me, you’ll know when we have a fight. Think of this as a reward for good behavior.” I scooted myself to the side of the bed and went in search of a shirt to put on. I found one of his t-shirts and threw it on quickly. “Where are you going?” he asked. “To salvage dinner. You should get up, too. The table isn’t going to set itself.” I heard him laugh as I walked out into the living room. I was pleased to see the food wasn't too far gone. I turned the burners back on and set about heating things up again. Logan came in a few minutes later wearing a pair of sweats. “I’m here as commanded.” “You know where everything is.” I pointed a spoon at him. “This will be ready in just a moment.” When we were seated with food piled on our plates, I decided to see if I could get him to open up more. “Tell me about your family.” I watched him to see his reaction. He looked up from his plate. “What would you like to know?” “Why aren’t you close with your mom?” “She’s difficult. Wasn't around a lot when I was growing up. Leah and I were raised by nannies and the housekeeper.” “That sounds hard.” I laid my hand on his. “It was and it wasn’t. Some years were better than others.” “What about your dad?” “He was busy running the company into the ground,” he scoffed. “My grandfather had given him a thriving company and he took it to the brink of ruin in the twenty years he had it under his control. He seemed to care more about chasing women than actually running the company.” “How old were you when you took over?” “Nineteen. I met with the board and we kicked him out.” “Wow. That’s crazy.” “It was what needed to be done. They wanted him out. Hell, he wanted out. It was killing him, the guilt and worry were taking their toll. He and I didn’t speak for five years after it happened. My mother, of course, was mortified. She fled to Paris for a few years. Until things had quieted down. She always has cared so much about what others thought.” “Your family sounds pretty screwed up.” “They are. Leah and I are lucky we had each other.” “I’d like to meet her.” I smiled. “You will. We’ll go see her after the baby comes.” He returned my smile. “What was it your mother said about me?” Hearing it made me nervous, but I needed to at the same time. His jaw tightened. “You don’t want to know.” “I really do,” I prodded, steeling myself for the words. “She called you a gold digging whore. Happy now?” He looked me in the eye and I could see the anger just under the surface. I sucked in a breath. “She doesn’t know me, how could she think that?” “It doesn’t matter what she thinks. What I think is what’s important, and I know exactly who you are, Kitten.” I decided that I had pressed my luck enough for the night and changed the subject to safer topics. After dinner, we curled up in bed and watched movies until neither of us could keep our eyes open any longer. I drifted off to sleep in his arms, which was right where I wanted to be.",

      "content": "I WOKE UP WITH GRACE wrapped around me like a vine. Anyone else and I would have kicked them out of bed, but with her it was nice. The plan for the day was for us to go into my office for a bit and sort things into piles to be packed up. I slipped out of bed and into the shower without waking her up. My conversation with my mother replayed in my head. It still got to me that she thought she had any say over what went on in my life. She was never there when I was growing up. I barely knew her now. That she thought her opinion even mattered got on my nerves. I needed to make some changes in how our relationship would play out in the future. “Logan?” Grace appeared in the doorway, her hair rumpled and a sleepy smile on her face. “Morning, Kitten.” “Is there coffee yet?” She yawned. “No, I hadn’t gotten that far yet. Sorry.” “It’s okay, I’ll pop out there and get it started.” She blew me a kiss and left in search of coffee. I found her in the kitchen, her hair in a messy bun and flour on her cheek. “What have you been doing?” “Making pancake batter,” she replied matter-of-fact. “Grab me the blueberries we got yesterday, please? Oh, and the chocolate chips.” “Chocolate chips?” “Of course. You can't have good pancakes without chocolate chips in them.” She grinned. I got the requested items and set them on the counter next to her. “Tell me, how are you at flipping pancakes?” “I’d say poor to fair.” I laughed. “I haven’t ever made them for myself.” “Good lord, I have so much to teach you, don’t I?” She kissed my cheek and positioned me in front of the stove. “Thank goodness you even had a griddle. Come to think of it, why on earth do you even have cookware if you never cook?” “You know, I honestly have no idea. I think it was one of those things that I just bought when I first moved in here. All of my apartments have fully outfitted kitchens, though I rarely use them.” She laughed again. “Okay, well in Chicago we will be using both your kitchen and mine. I’m not eating out for every meal.” “Both kitchens? You aren’t going to move in with me in Chicago?” I had assumed she would want to be with me. “No, I don’t plan on moving in with you. I’ll stay over sometimes, but we need to do this right. I’m not jumping in headfirst. We barely know each other, it would be a mistake to move too quickly.” She looked pensive. “Do you understand my reasons?” I did understand, but that didn't mean I liked them. I was moving my life for her, so she needed to be with me, in my home, in the home we chose together. I searched for the words to explain how I was feeling, but found none, so I remained silent. “Logan. Look at me,” she demanded. “You understand, right?” “Grace, Kitten, I’m moving my life to Chicago. For you. I wanted us to choose a place that would be ours, and live in it together,” I said softly. She shook her head. “I’m not moving in with you yet, Logan. I’m just not going to do it. This is all moving so fast, I can barely keep up. I know you’re used to getting your way, but you need to learn the art of compromise.” “I know how to compromise. I think you need to learn a bit about it as well.” I was angry. I stalked out of the room and into my office. “Logan!” she yelled from the kitchen. I shut the door to my office. I knew full well I was not being fair. I had never told her I expected her to live with me, but I just couldn’t stop the anger from bubbling to the surface. I didn’t like being told no. No one told me no. Ever. And here she was telling me no on a regular basis. This was not going to work for me. People did what I wanted, I couldn’t handle or tolerate anything else. It applied to all aspects of my life, including women. I needed control. The door flew open. “Who do you think you are?” Rage colored her features. “You don’t walk away in the middle of a discussion. And you don’t get to make demands of me and my time. I’m a grown woman and I run my life, not you.” She huffed out a breath. “Why don’t you want to live with me? Have you not enjoyed the past couple of days?” “It has nothing to do with enjoying being with you or not. The fact is that we don’t know each other, and I’m not stupid enough to follow along blindly with whatever you want. What happens when this ends and I’m alone with nowhere to go?” she demanded. “You think this is going to end?” That one hurt. When she said the words. It cut me. She lifted a shoulder. “I don’t know that it will. But things happen. What if, three months from now, you realize that I’m not what you want?” I saw it clear as day for the first time. Fear. She was just as afraid as I was. “You are what I want, Kitten.” I stood up and walked around my desk. “For now I am.” She shrugged, refusing to look me in the eye. “No. I don’t think you understand me. You are what I want. I have never wanted a woman in my life before. Not once. I want you in my life. You may not see that as a huge revelation, but I assure you that it is.” I rubbed my jaw in frustration with this whole argument. “I’m still not moving in with you,” she said defiantly. “Fine.” “Fine?” She arched a brow. “I’m not forcing you to live with me if it’s not what you want. But, I'm not going to stop asking you to move in, so get used to it.” That did it—a small smile flickered across her lips. “Are we done fighting now?” I asked. “I don’t know. Are you done being a colossal ass?” she shot back. “For the time being, yes.” I tipped her chin up and searched her eyes for understanding. “Do you understand how I feel for you?” “Yes,” she said softly. “Good.” I kissed her lightly and released her chin. “Let’s go eat so we can get into the office at a decent hour.” I smacked her on the butt and hustled her back into the kitchen. Thirty minutes later, we were in my car on the way into the office. Grace was quiet on the drive. “Are you still upset about earlier?” I put a hand on her knee. “No, not upset. Just thinking.” She patted my hand. “About?” “This whole crazy situation. I know that you’re used to getting your way all the time, but we’re different. I’m not an employee who has to say yes when you tell them to do something. I’m your equal, your girlfriend.” “I know that.” “Do you?” “Yes.” I sighed. “I’ll try harder okay?” She nodded. The rest of the drive was quiet, but I didn’t think she was upset with me anymore. Brooke was waiting at the elevator as usual, my messages and coffee in hand. “Mr. McFadden, your mother and sister have both called this morning. Also Mr. Janner is in your office.” She turned to Grace. “I apologize, I didn’t realize you would be here or I would have brought you coffee as well.” I noticed her tone was cooler than it should have been. Grace gave me a look at the mention of my mother, but she didn’t say anything. I was not interested in rehashing the previous conversation. “It’s not a problem, Brooke.” Grace smiled sweetly. “If you don't mind, I’d love a latte?” There she was, not taking anything from anyone. So fierce. I even kind of enjoyed when she defied me. “Of course, right away,” Brooke responded in clipped tones. “Thanks, Brooke. We’ll be in my office for the day. I’ll be leaving tomorrow for Chicago. I’d like your decision by the end of the week about coming with me.” “Very well.” She nodded and clicked down the hall. “Does she always dress like that?” Grace whispered as we walked. “Like what?” I knew exactly what she was talking about. “Come on, Logan, her clothes are painted on.” She rolled her eyes. “What did I say yesterday? It’s strictly professional with us.” I kissed her cheek. “Yeah, yeah, whatever. Come on, let’s go get to packing.” Smith was sitting at my desk on the phone when we came in. “Shai, I’ll call you later okay?” He laughed at something she said and hung up. “It’s about time you showed up.” “Please, by all means, use my phone and my desk,” I said dryly. “Well, it seems someone should be using it since you’re running off to Chicago.” He grinned. “Did you need something?” “No, just wanted to be sure I saw you before you left.” He walked around the desk. He turned his attention to Grace. “Take care of him, will you? I know sometimes he can be an ass, but he means well.” He kissed her cheek. “Shut up.” I laughed and hugged him. “I’ll be around. Plus I doubt I’ll be able to keep you away for long anyway. Not with so many new women for you to meet.” “You’re not wrong there.” He flashed a grin. “I’ll see you when I see you.” He gave a quick wave and left us alone. “Are you sad to be leaving him?” Grace asked. “Smith? I’m not really leaving him. Like I said, he’ll be around before too long.” We set about the task of dismantling my office. Brooke brought in some boxes at Grace’s request, and we packed as much as we could. “I HATE PACKING. WHY IS it that I wanted to help you again?” I sat back on my heels, covered in dust. Logan smiled. “I told you, this is why I hire people to move for me. “ “Don’t let me talk you out of it next time.” “I hate to tell you, but this is only about a quarter of what I actually need to bring with me when we go.” “Are you serious?” I stood up quickly. “Afraid so. I think we can leave the rest to be packed, what do you think?” “I think I agree with that decision.” I wiped my hands on my jeans. “Are you hungry?” He stood and stretched. “Ravenous. Let’s go grab some lunch.” Logan had called down and there was a limo waiting for us at the curb. He slid in and pulled me along with him on the soft leather seat. “What are you hungry for?” He pressed his lips to my temple and settled his arm around my shoulders. “Sandwiches and soup?” “Out of anything you could have, you want sandwiches and soup?” He laughed. “Yeah, do you have a problem with that?” I shot him a dirty look. “I wouldn’t dream of it.” He looked the picture of innocence. After giving the driver instructions, he shut the privacy glass. “Am I forgiven for before? I know I’m overbearing sometimes, I’ll try my hardest to work on that.” That surprised me. It wasn’t often that men like Logan, with the world at their fingertips, admitted to being wrong. “I’ll try to be less rigid in my expectations.” It was the least I could do. I couldn't really expect him to be everything I wanted overnight. “Thank you.” He kissed the top of my head. “We’ll figure this all out.” “Figure what out?” “Being in a relationship together.” He chuckled softly. I could feel the rumble of his laugh against my back. “You need to do that more often.” I sighed contentedly and leaned my head against him. “Do what?” “Laugh.” I yawned. All the packing had taken it out of me. I must have fallen asleep because it surprised me when Logan gently shook me awake. “We’re here.” “Sorry, didn’t mean to fall asleep.” I smiled. “It’s more than okay. I enjoyed watching you.” He kissed me lightly. Logan had taken me to his favorite deli. They had every kind of meat imaginable and a slew of yummy sounding soups. After we ordered and sat down outside, I decided to resume my questioning about Logan’s past. “I have more questions for you.” “I assumed you would.” He smiled indulgently. “When you said before that Leah’s baby wouldn’t be the first grandchild, what did you mean?” He tensed. “I’m not sure I’m ready to talk about this yet.” “Please, Logan. I just want to know you, who you really are. Trust me with this,” I pleaded. “I had a child once, a long time ago.” His voice was almost a whisper. “What happened?” I reached across to hold his hand. “The doctors called it SIDS.” His voice faltered. “I woke up one morning and went in to check on him and he was gone.” The pain in his voice slashed at me like a knife. I shouldn’t have asked this, it was too personal. “Oh my god. I’m so sorry.” I wanted to hold him in my arms. “It was a long time ago,” he said by way of dismissing me. “It doesn’t matter how long ago it was. He was still your son.” “His name was Jackson.” “How old were you when he was born?” I squeezed his hand. “I had just turned nineteen, it was right before I took over for my father.” “What about the mother? Where was she?” “Not in the picture. She didn’t want to be a mother. I wasn't at all ready to be a father, but he was mine and I loved him more than anything on this earth.” The emotion on his face was hard not to see. It was such a raw pain. How did you ever get over the death of a child? “How old was he when he died?” I asked softly. “He was almost one. He had just started talking.” He choked out the words. In that moment, I forgot that we were in public, that there were people all around us. I walked around the table and took him in my arms. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes, there was no way I could imagine the kind of pain he had felt. “I’m so sorry, Logan. And I’m sorry for making you tell me. You weren’t ready, and I shouldn’t have pushed.” I took his face in my hands and kissed him. “It’s okay. I would have told you eventually.” His voice was rough, thickened with emotion. He coughed to clear his throat. I could tell he was done talking about it. I wanted to ask more about how he had met Jackson’s mother and who she was to him, but I didn't dare ask anymore of him. He had already ripped open one scar for me, I couldn’t ask him to dig into the wound. Our food came out a few minutes later, and we lapsed into talk about me and my sisters. “Tell me more about your sisters. I want to be prepared when I meet the rest.” “You’ll like Hope a lot. She’s so grounded and solid. She really is the rock of our family. And my nephew Greyson, he’s amazing. He’s not even one, and he has us all wrapped around his little finger,” I blurted without thinking. “Oh god, I’m sorry. That was really insensitive of me.” “Kitten, it’s okay for you to love your nephew and be excited about me meeting him. What happened to Jackson was awful, but it was a long time ago, and I can be around other kids. I’m not going to break down and cry if that’s what you think.” “I don’t think that, but we had just talked about it and then I blurted that out.” I shook my head. “I’m fine, I promise. Keep telling me about Hope.” He motioned for me to continue. “She and I are the most alike. I would spend all my time at her house, but she has her own life and family.” I smiled, remembering nights laughing and watching movies. “You already know Faith. And before you ask, yes, she’s always that way.” He laughed. “I find her refreshingly funny. It’s nice to meet people who say just what they mean.” “That’s Faith to a tee.” “What about Charity, what’s she like?” he asked between bites of his sandwich. “So damn smart. She blows me away. None of us were surprised when she was accepted to Oxford. She’s the more serious of all of us. She doesn’t talk a lot, her nose is always in a book. God, I miss her already, and I just saw her a month ago,” I said wistfully. “We’ll go for a visit soon, I promise.” “You’re amazing, you know that right?” I beamed at him. The thought of seeing Charity again made me feel all giddy inside. “I do what I can.” He laughed. “Tell me about your parents? How long have they been married?” I smiled just thinking about them. “They are so in love that it’s almost sickening to see them. After almost forty years of marriage, they still seem like newlyweds. They run the family restaurant together and have for the past twenty years. It was a huge gamble when Dad decided to open it, but Mom stood behind him. I’ve always wanted that kind of love.” I said pressing a hand to my heart. “Haven’t we all?” An odd expression crossed his face. “They sound like amazing people. You’re lucky you had them growing up.” I nodded, knowing he was thinking about his own screwed-up childhood. “Sometimes the family we’re born with isn’t the family we need. Sometimes we get to choose the people we want as our family. You’ve done that with Smith.” I wanted to say he’d also done it with me, but I bit my tongue. I couldn’t voice that yet, it was too soon. It was too scary to for me to be that vulnerable. “True. Smith is one of a kind. The best family I could ask for.” The smile returned to his eyes. After lunch, we decided to go back to his apartment rather than going to the office again. Neither one of us was in much of a mood to pack anymore. I could tell just what he had in mind the whole drive back, he could barely keep his hands off me. “God, you’re beautiful, Kitten.” Logan kissed me as we rode up in the elevator. “I bet you say that to all the girls.” I giggled. “Not lately.” He grinned and pressed me flat against the wall. “I think the rest of the packing can wait until tomorrow, what do you think? We did enough today at the office, I don't really want to be doing more of it here. Especially when there are better things we could be doing.” His eyes had gone dark and my knees suddenly wouldn’t hold me up anymore. “I think we could do that. Did you have something else in mind for the rest of the evening?” I wiggled out from under him and walked out of the open elevator. “I do, in fact, have something else in mind, and it involves a lot less clothing.” He caught up with me quickly. “Hmm, less clothing you say?” I snatched his keys away and made for his door in a hurry. He was on me in an instant, his body pressing me against the door. I could feel his heat through my thin shirt. We practically fell through the door, both of us laughing. I was in no way prepared for what was waiting inside. She was standing by the huge window in the living room, and she wore nothing but a pair of black stilettos and a smile. She was gorgeous, of course. Long dark hair and startling blue eyes. Not to mention a body that looked like it was molded by the gods. I felt like I was going to throw up. “Logan, darling, I’ve been waiting for ages,” she purred “Fiona. Get dressed and get out of here.” Rage was rolling off of him in waves. “Now, Logan, is that any way to speak to your fiancée?” Fiancée? Logan had a fiancée? “Grace, can you give us a moment?” Logan looked nervous. “You know what? I really can’t. This is bullshit. You’ve had a fiancée this whole fucking time and you never said a word?” I was seeing red. “Ask him about Annabelle.” Fiona smiled viciously. “Grace..” He took a step toward me. “No, just don’t.” I started toward the door. “Good, let her go. Why don’t you come over here and greet me properly,” Fiona purred. “Wait, Grace. Please. We need to talk about this,” he pleaded. I didn’t stop, there was nothing I wanted to hear him say. He had lied to me, that was all I could think about. I couldn’t believe I had bought into his lie and believed that he really wanted a future with me. As the elevator doors closed, the tears began to fall down my cheeks.",

      "content": "I WOKE UP WITH GRACE wrapped around me like a vine. Anyone else and I would have kicked them out of bed, but with her it was nice. The plan for the day was for us to go into my office for a bit and sort things into piles to be packed up. I slipped out of bed and into the shower without waking her up. My conversation with my mother replayed in my head. It still got to me that she thought she had any say over what went on in my life. She was never there when I was growing up. I barely knew her now. That she thought her opinion even mattered got on my nerves. I needed to make some changes in how our relationship would play out in the future. “Logan?” Grace appeared in the doorway, her hair rumpled and a sleepy smile on her face. “Morning, Kitten.” “Is there coffee yet?” She yawned. “No, I hadn’t gotten that far yet. Sorry.” “It’s okay, I’ll pop out there and get it started.” She blew me a kiss and left in search of coffee. I found her in the kitchen, her hair in a messy bun and flour on her cheek. “What have you been doing?” “Making pancake batter,” she replied matter-of-fact. “Grab me the blueberries we got yesterday, please? Oh, and the chocolate chips.” “Chocolate chips?” “Of course. You can't have good pancakes without chocolate chips in them.” She grinned. I got the requested items and set them on the counter next to her. “Tell me, how are you at flipping pancakes?” “I’d say poor to fair.” I laughed. “I haven’t ever made them for myself.” “Good lord, I have so much to teach you, don’t I?” She kissed my cheek and positioned me in front of the stove. “Thank goodness you even had a griddle. Come to think of it, why on earth do you even have cookware if you never cook?” “You know, I honestly have no idea. I think it was one of those things that I just bought when I first moved in here. All of my apartments have fully outfitted kitchens, though I rarely use them.” She laughed again. “Okay, well in Chicago we will be using both your kitchen and mine. I’m not eating out for every meal.” “Both kitchens? You aren’t going to move in with me in Chicago?” I had assumed she would want to be with me. “No, I don’t plan on moving in with you. I’ll stay over sometimes, but we need to do this right. I’m not jumping in headfirst. We barely know each other, it would be a mistake to move too quickly.” She looked pensive. “Do you understand my reasons?” I did understand, but that didn't mean I liked them. I was moving my life for her, so she needed to be with me, in my home, in the home we chose together. I searched for the words to explain how I was feeling, but found none, so I remained silent. “Logan. Look at me,” she demanded. “You understand, right?” “Grace, Kitten, I’m moving my life to Chicago. For you. I wanted us to choose a place that would be ours, and live in it together,” I said softly. She shook her head. “I’m not moving in with you yet, Logan. I’m just not going to do it. This is all moving so fast, I can barely keep up. I know you’re used to getting your way, but you need to learn the art of compromise.” “I know how to compromise. I think you need to learn a bit about it as well.” I was angry. I stalked out of the room and into my office. “Logan!” she yelled from the kitchen. I shut the door to my office. I knew full well I was not being fair. I had never told her I expected her to live with me, but I just couldn’t stop the anger from bubbling to the surface. I didn’t like being told no. No one told me no. Ever. And here she was telling me no on a regular basis. This was not going to work for me. People did what I wanted, I couldn’t handle or tolerate anything else. It applied to all aspects of my life, including women. I needed control. The door flew open. “Who do you think you are?” Rage colored her features. “You don’t walk away in the middle of a discussion. And you don’t get to make demands of me and my time. I’m a grown woman and I run my life, not you.” She huffed out a breath. “Why don’t you want to live with me? Have you not enjoyed the past couple of days?” “It has nothing to do with enjoying being with you or not. The fact is that we don’t know each other, and I’m not stupid enough to follow along blindly with whatever you want. What happens when this ends and I’m alone with nowhere to go?” she demanded. “You think this is going to end?” That one hurt. When she said the words. It cut me. She lifted a shoulder. “I don’t know that it will. But things happen. What if, three months from now, you realize that I’m not what you want?” I saw it clear as day for the first time. Fear. She was just as afraid as I was. “You are what I want, Kitten.” I stood up and walked around my desk. “For now I am.” She shrugged, refusing to look me in the eye. “No. I don’t think you understand me. You are what I want. I have never wanted a woman in my life before. Not once. I want you in my life. You may not see that as a huge revelation, but I assure you that it is.” I rubbed my jaw in frustration with this whole argument. “I’m still not moving in with you,” she said defiantly. “Fine.” “Fine?” She arched a brow. “I’m not forcing you to live with me if it’s not what you want. But, I'm not going to stop asking you to move in, so get used to it.” That did it—a small smile flickered across her lips. “Are we done fighting now?” I asked. “I don’t know. Are you done being a colossal ass?” she shot back. “For the time being, yes.” I tipped her chin up and searched her eyes for understanding. “Do you understand how I feel for you?” “Yes,” she said softly. “Good.” I kissed her lightly and released her chin. “Let’s go eat so we can get into the office at a decent hour.” I smacked her on the butt and hustled her back into the kitchen. Thirty minutes later, we were in my car on the way into the office. Grace was quiet on the drive. “Are you still upset about earlier?” I put a hand on her knee. “No, not upset. Just thinking.” She patted my hand. “About?” “This whole crazy situation. I know that you’re used to getting your way all the time, but we’re different. I’m not an employee who has to say yes when you tell them to do something. I’m your equal, your girlfriend.” “I know that.” “Do you?” “Yes.” I sighed. “I’ll try harder okay?” She nodded.

He was on me in an instant, his body pressing me against the door. I could feel his heat through my thin shirt. We practically fell through the door, both of us laughing. I was in no way prepared for what was waiting inside. She was standing by the huge window in the living room, and she wore nothing but a pair of black stilettos and a smile. She was gorgeous, of course. Long dark hair and startling blue eyes. Not to mention a body that looked like it was molded by the gods. I felt like I was going to throw up. “Logan, darling, I’ve been waiting for ages,” she purred “Fiona. Get dressed and get out of here.” Rage was rolling off of him in waves. “Now, Logan, is that any way to speak to your fiancée?” Fiancée? Logan had a fiancée? “Grace, can you give us a moment?” Logan looked nervous. “You know what? I really can’t. This is bullshit. You’ve had a fiancée this whole fucking time and you never said a word?” I was seeing red. “Ask him about Annabelle.” Fiona smiled viciously. “Grace..” He took a step toward me. “No, just don’t.” I started toward the door. “Good, let her go. Why don’t you come over here and greet me properly,” Fiona purred. “Wait, Grace. Please. We need to talk about this,” he pleaded. I didn’t stop, there was nothing I wanted to hear him say. He had lied to me, that was all I could think about. I couldn’t believe I had bought into his lie and believed that he really wanted a future with me. As the elevator doors closed, the tears began to fall down my cheeks.",
