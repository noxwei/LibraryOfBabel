      "content": "Prologue Jessie I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. Chapter 1 Colette “But it’s not fair,” Lilly insisted, her face a little flushed from trying to make her point. “How am I supposed to find a husband, if I can’t even go out on one date?” “Well,” Papa said, letting his voice drag a little as if he was giving the whole thing a lot of thought, “there’s what’s fair and there’s what’s right. I’m choosing to raise you girls with what’s right.” Lilly was not to be so easily defeated. “Tons of girls get married right out of high school and you won’t even let me go out on a date. Dorothy Smiley is engaged and she’s Lettie’s age,” she pointed out. “She’s only sixteen.” Mama and Papa were quiet for a moment, both frowning to themselves. Papa’s eyes shifted toward his wife. Mama cleared her throat. “Those are special circumstances,” she said, looking at the table instead of her daughter. “I don’t think Dorothy Smiley is a good example of how I want to raise my children.” I could tell by the way Mama folded her hands that she wasn’t going to speak any more about that topic, although I wasn’t sure why. Dorothy was a local girl who was always very popular with the boys. I think she’d been dating since she was fourteen. Whenever I saw her about town, she was always laughing and chatting with a bunch of boys clustered around her. They were drawn to her like bees to a flower. “But I’m graduating in just a few months. Don’t you think that most girls should have gone out on at least one date before they graduate from high school?” Papa gave her a stern look. “I’m never thought of my daughters as ‘most girls’ and I doubt I ever will.” “But Walter Bennett is really nice,” Lilly said, persisting in her cause. “He’s stopped by Zucker’s a bunch of times now and he’s always been perfectly polite.” My sister worked a few afternoons a week at the local five and dime. I knew that her prospective beau had come in several times under the excuse of needing one thing or another. He never spent much money, but he sure did take his time about shopping for whatever he needed. “How a boy behaves when he’s out in public and how he behaves when he’s alone with a girl can be two very different things,” Mama insisted. “But…” Lilly drew breath to continue her argument. Papa’s hand came down flat on the table. He didn’t bang it down like when he was angry about a client trying not to pay his bill, but I could tell his temper was starting to rise. “In my day, no nice girl would be seen out with a boy, unless she had a proper chaperone,” Mama said, trying to head-off Papa’s growing annoyance. A thought occurred to her. “Maybe that’s the solution?” “A chaperone?” Lilly all but wailed. “Mother, no one has a chaperone these days.” “Well I’m not letting this young pup come a courting without one,” Papa growled. I had to fight not to smile. No one said, “come a courting” anymore, as far as I knew. “No dear, that’s not what I meant,” Mama said, putting a gentle hand on her husband’s forearm. “I meant that my real objection to Lilly going out with this Walter fellow is that I don’t want her to be on her own with a boy she only knows from the five and dime.” Then Mama directed her gaze across the table toward me. “Maybe if Lettie was to accompany them. And they didn’t go anywhere in a car. They could always walk down to the diner for a soda.” Oh, great. Now I was being dragged into the mix. The last thing I wanted was to be a third wheel on my sister’s first official date with a boy. Lilly immediately turned to look at me, hope glowing in her eyes. “That could work,” she said, all too eagerly. “I’m sorry, but I think I’d feel very awkward,” I told them. I could just imagine sitting at the counter, reading a book and feeling like the whole town was pitying me as the poor, dateless sister of Lillian Gibson. “It wouldn’t be awkward,” Lilly insisted. “We’d include you in everything, I promise.” I knew my sister had every intention of making me feel comfortable and included on this hypothetical date, but I’d seen her flirting with Walter across the counter top. When he was around, she didn’t have eyes for anyone else. I even knew that Mr. Zucker had scolded her more than once for taking too long with only one customer while other people were waiting. “Well, what if it were to be a double date?” Mama suggested. “No,” Papa said, flatly. “Lilly is only sixteen.” “She’ll be seventeen soon enough,” Mama reminded him. “And we can’t keep our girls locked in the house forever. Even if we tried, the young men would eventually start crawling up the drainpipes to flirt with them.” I began to get nervous that both my parents were warming to the idea. “I’m afraid I don’t know anyone who would want to come along,” I hurriedly told them all. I didn’t have any particular boy who was a friend and it would be too embarrassing to ask a boy from school. I put my hand to my cheek, blushing at the mere thought of it. “Oh, I’m sure Walter has lots of nice friends,” Lilly said, practically bouncing in her chair. “I know there are tons of boys who would be happy to come along.” Then she added as an afterthought, “We could always do something to fix your hair,” My hands immediately flew to my hair. Had it already struggled out of its bun? My hair was a raucous gathering of curls and it never behaved the way I intended. “I meant we could tame it with hair tonic or something,” Lilly quickly added. I could tell she hadn’t meant to be unkind. “I…” I stammered. I knew Lilly desperately wanted to go on her date, and I hated to disappoint her, but the thought of being fixed up with a boy who had no desire to be out with me in the first place made me cringe. “I’m sorry, but I really don’t want to go,” I said, pushing my chair away from the dining room table. “And I have some homework to do before going to bed,” I told them before hurrying away, grateful that the dishes had already been cleared. I knew that if I sat there any longer then Lilly would persuade me into going. And that was the very last thing I wanted to do. I hurried upstairs, but not before I caught more of my father’s conversation. “I think your mother has a very good point,” he said to his eldest daughter. “No matter how much I dislike it, you girls are growing up. So you can go on your date…” “Oh Papa,” Lilly exclaimed, clapping her hands with excitement. “Wait, let me finish,” father said in his sternest voice. “You can only go if your sister accompanies you.” “Oh,” Lilly said, sounding more than a little forlorn. I hurried up the stairs before I could hear any more. It’s not that I didn’t want to see my sister happy. There was actually nothing I wouldn’t do for her. But I was pretty sure that she’d be able to convince our mother and father that she would be just as safe with one of her friends on a double date as she would with me. I probably should have been excited about the prospect of a double date, but I wasn’t. I liked boys well enough, I just didn’t happen to have a crush on any particular boy. Truth be told, I probably spent too much time reading Austen and the Brontes. I daydreamed of a love much bigger and more passionate that anything I imagined a local boy could provide. I closed the door to the room I shared with Lilly and then went over to perch on the cream colored dressing chair that I kept by the window. The window faced the backyard and I liked to pull open the curtains and sit there, gazing over the open fields behind our property. There had been quite a bit of construction in our little town of Tiburon, Ohio before the market crashed. But when the stocks all dropped, so did the building trade. At least it kept our home from being crowded by too many neighbors. Many of my free hours were spent looking out that window and thinking of my future. Where would I be in ten years? Would I still be in Tiburon, happily married and raising a family? Or did the world have more in store for me? The way the tree branches in our backyard swayed and waved let me know that the evening had turned quite breezy. The warm weather would find us eventually, but it wouldn’t be for another few weeks at the least. I heard Lilly coming up the stairs. She wasn’t exactly stomping her feet, — that’s something Papa would never allow — but I could tell she was unhappy. She said nothing as she came into our room. As a matter of fact, she took great pains to close the door very quietly. I turned toward her as she came in, but she wouldn’t look at me. “I’m sorry,” I said as she began brushing her hair in front of the vanity table that we shared. “I’m sure Mama and Papa would let you go on a double date with Betty Schaffer. Or maybe cousin Irene.” Our cousin was older and had been on lots of dates, so that felt like a safe bet. Lilly stopped her brushing and looked at me through the mirror’s reflection. “I already asked and Papa said no. He’s convinced that the only girl who will truly look out for my well being is you.” I had to wonder why our father was being so cautious. Neither of us girls had ever done anything to cause him any concern. We were conscientious at school and we did as we were told when home. Lilly even had a part time job and I one set up for over the summer. But I guess it was hard for him to accept that we were turning from girls into young women. At least that’s what Mama usually said. Walking across the room, I pulled my flannel nightgown off the hook on the back of the door. It was an evening to wear wool socks to bed. I thought I might get in a bit of reading before turning out the light. I still had some math problems to solve and a chapter of American history to go over, but I figured I could do that in the morning before school. “Won’t you please agree to come on a double date with me?” Lilly asked rather abruptly as I was climbing into bed with a book tucked under my arm. “You can borrow any of my things that you want. Anytime, without even asking. And I promise that Walter will fix you up with one of his really handsome friends. And I’ll help fix your hair and I’ll do the dishes all by myself for a month, you won’t even have to help me.” She was promising so much, I couldn’t help but giggle. It was obvious that she wanted this date with Walter more than she cared about me borrowing her tortoise shell combs or snagging her only pair of silk stockings. “Oh, alright,” I finally said, completely capitulating. “If it means that much to you.” “Really?” Lilly leapt to her feet. “You’ll really go?” “Yes, I’ll really go,” I told her, no matter how much I didn’t want to. “Oh, Colette,” Lilly exclaimed, rushing over to my bed and throwing her arms around me. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she said, kissing my cheek. “You’re the best sister ever.” In a burst of joy she did a twirl while crossing the room to snatch her nightgown off the hook. “I can’t wait to tell Walter.” Chapter 2 Jessie “You can’t be serious,” Daniel exclaimed, rising abruptly from his chair and nearly tipping it over in the process. “Ship the whole damn thing to America? Really, Grandfather, I think you’ve gone a bit mad.” “I assure you, my sanity is as sound as it’s ever been,” our grandfather growled, glaring across the table at my older brother. “And I am quite serious. I’ve made up my mind.” Doing his best to suppress his outrage, my brother dropped back into his chair and tried to compose himself. “Don’t you think the mortals might notice if a medieval castle suddenly sprang up in the middle of Manhattan? It might lead to a few questions, you know.” “That’s why we’re not moving to Manhattan,” our grandfather informed the family in general. My mother, Daniel, my younger sister Emily, and I were all sitting with him around our dining room table. “We’re staying out of New York altogether,” Grandfather announced. “You have to be joking.” Daniel was incredulous. “Are we moving to the wild to live with the savages? I guess we’d better remember to ship the moat. We’re going to need it.” “There’s more to America than just New York and the great plains,” our mother said in a calm voice that I knew she hoped was soothing. I suspected she had anticipated her father’s announcement to leave Budapest, so it didn’t come as much of a shock. “I’ve read that spots in the Midwest of America are quite developed now and can be remarkably lovely.” Daniel flashed Mother a look. “You don’t always have to take his side.” It wasn’t Mother’s habit to take her father’s side, but she did know how to pick her battles. This was one she probably knew she would lose, so she didn’t intend to fight. That or she had something else in mind and she was waiting to see how things played out. “But there isn’t even any society in America.” Daniel was not giving up so easily. “At least not our kind of society.” “There are more of our kind in America than you realize,” Grandfather informed him. “And there are more moving there every day. With Hitler grabbing for power, I think a great many of our kind will be leaving Europe in the next year or two.” “Oh.” Daniel appeared mollified. “You didn’t say we were going to be moving to an undead enclave. If we have our friends around us, then that will be different.” “I will not make our family a target by moving to an undead enclave,” Grandfather said flatly. “In fact, we’re moving to where no mortal would ever think to look for vampires.” “You can’t be serious!” Daniel said again, even though our grandfather was not a man who tended to make jokes. Laying both hands flat on the table, Grandfather looked Daniel square in the eye. “You are welcome to stay here,” he said. “But let me be clear about one thing. If you choose to stay, you will be cut off from the family without a cent.” His threat did the trick. There was no way in the world Daniel would be willing to give up his share of the Vanderlind fortune. That wasn’t in his nature. There was nothing he loved more than wealth and the power it brought. I knew this without a doubt. Daniel had been married once, not so many years ago, but when he was still mortal. His wife, Anna, had been a lovely girl who seemed to sincerely love him, for whatever reason. But she accidentally discovered our grandfather’s dark secret; the disease which he had methodically spread to his own children, accidentally killing one of his daughters in the process. Anna had wanted to flee the castle with her husband. She was convinced it was better to live a life of poverty than to make a deal with the devil. But Daniel had other ideas. He’d only been persuaded to marry her in order to procreate while he was still a mortal. Grandfather put great stock in not letting the Vanderlind line dwindle. But instead of escaping from evil with his wife, Daniel dragged Anna before our grandfather. I was barely sixteen, but I was convinced Grandfather would kill my sister-in-law. I went to confront him and did my best to save Anna, only to receive his disdain. “You’ve always been soft on mortals,” Grandfather told me, obviously disgusted by my compassion. “I happen to be a mortal,” I informed him, with all the bravery and ignorance that a sixteen year old boy could muster. “For the moment,” he informed me. “But your time will come, so enjoy your foolish mortal emotions while you can.” I knew that transforming into the undead could easily twist a human from a being filled with compassion to a creature filled with hate. I sincerely hoped that fate would not befall me when my time came to be transformed. Grandfather became a creature of the night at the age of twenty-four and he decided it was the ideal age for any vampire. So when each of his children turned twenty-four, he turned them, whether they wanted to be vampires or not. And he intended to do the same for his grandchildren; an event that Daniel looked forward to with great anticipation, but one that I dreaded. Grandfather arranged for all of his children to marry into wealth in order to expand our already sizeable family fortune, but the spouses of his offspring were not considered worthy enough to be transformed into the undead. My uncle’s wife and my own father had both mysteriously disappeared soon after my mother and uncle were made. The spouse of my aunt who had died during transformation also disappeared under mysterious circumstances, but he took his luggage and quite a bit of my aunt’s jewelry with him. After Daniel betrayed his wife, Grandfather decided to temporarily spare Anna’s life, although she essentially became a prisoner in the castle. She was to bare Daniel a few children before Grandfather would decide it was time for her demise. But Anna denied her husband any offspring by hanging herself from a chandelier a few months after her discovery of our family’s dark secret. Daniel was furious, but I admired her for her convictions. My brother never took another wife. When his maker’s day came, he was still childless. This greatly displeased Grandfather, but he turned Daniel anyway, deciding it would be up to Emily and me to keep the Vanderlind line alive. “Will our Uncle be moving with us?” my little sister screwed up the courage to ask as we all sat around the dining table, glaring at one another. She was madly devoted to our cousin Dorian, with that unique fervor of little girls. “Your Uncle will finish up business here before coming over. That should only take a year or two,” was Grandfather’s reply. But that didn’t exactly provide an answer to Emily’s real question. “What about Dorian?” I asked, deciding to help her out. “Will he be making the voyage with us or will he stay here and cross with his father?” Grandfather made a small, guttural sound in the back of his throat. “I haven’t decided yet on the safest place to keep your cousin.” Cousin Dorian was only a little older than I was, but he already had a keen eye for the ladies. It was all Grandfather could do to keep him from causing a scandal. “I still say this is all nonsense,” Daniel grumbled. “This is a big decision and I think it should be open to family discussion.” “You can think whatever you want,” Grandfather informed him. “But I’ve already purchased the land in America and the workmen will be arriving tomorrow to start dismantling the castle. I’ve already instructed Mrs. Denkler to oversee the servants while they pack up the household.” “Where are we going?” Mother asked. “Where is it in America that we are all moving to?” Grandfather leaned back in his chair, folded his hands, and smiled with some satisfaction. He was handsome, in a brutish short of way, and he appeared no older than his daughter, who appeared no older than her eldest son. “A nice little town in Ohio,” he assured us. “Right on the shore of the Tiburon River.” Chapter 3 Colette “They’re using only workers they’re bringing over from Europe,” my father grumbled from behind his newspaper as I sat down to breakfast the next morning. “I can’t believe that not one man from Tiburon is going to earn an honest day’s pay for that monstrosity they’re building on the edge of town.” “I’m not sure that warrants calling it a monstrosity,” mother said, trying her best to coax him back into a good mood as she served eggs and toast. “I hear that it’s an entire castle they’re moving from Hungary stone by stone. That sounds very exciting to me. I’ve always wanted to see a castle.” “I wonder why they’re moving here.” I couldn’t help but say aloud. “Europe is getting to be a real mess,” my father informed me. “That Hitler fellow is starting to cause all sorts of problems. I wouldn’t be surprised if that had something to do with it.” I was sure my father was right, but that wasn’t exactly what I meant. My question had more to do with why a wealthy family living in a cosmopolitan city like Budapest would then decide to move to the outskirts of a small town in the middle of Ohio. It wasn’t the first place I would choose to live if I had enough money to ship an entire castle all the way over from Europe. Lilly came hurrying into the breakfast room and slipped into her seat. Papa glanced at his watch. “Cutting it a bit close, aren’t you?” he asked. “I had trouble sleeping last night so it was hard to get up this morning,” she told him. That may have been true. I’d slept like a stone, so I couldn’t say for sure. But I also knew that Lilly had spent extra time in front of the mirror this morning, making sure her hair was perfect. She was going straight to her job at Zucker’s after school and I was sure she had plans for Walter to meet her there. “You’re not coming down with anything, I hope,” Mama said, reaching across the table to lay a hand on Lilly’s cheek. “You’re not warm, but you look a little flushed.” “I’m just excited,” Lilly told her. “Lettie’s agreed to go, so I’m going to have my first date with Walter.” Papa gave me surprised look. “Is that true, Colette?” “Yes,” I admitted. “Lilly talked me into it.” “Oh,” Papa said with a frown. I got the feeling he had been counting on me not giving in and so his plan of keeping his daughters from dating had backfired. “That’s very nice of you,” Mama told me, not glancing in her husband’s direction. “But we are expecting both of you to behave very responsibly on this date and not let it go to your heads.” “We won’t, Mama,” Lilly quickly assured her. As far as I knew, the date was just to be Walter and a friend escorting us to the diner for a soda and then home again. I couldn’t see how drinking a soda while sitting at the counter of Top’s Diner could go to anyone’s head. Lilly had to hurry through breakfast or we were going to be late. Tiburon didn’t have anything as fancy as a school bus, so Lilly and I had to walk to the high school when the weather was fine. Papa would give us a lift if it was too cold or wet to walk, but it had to be awfully cold or very, very wet for that to be deemed necessary. As we headed toward school, Lilly was practically dancing on air. She linked her arm through mine and skipped along. “Lettie, have I told you how much I love you?” she asked. “You’re the best sister ever.” I had to laugh. “Would you be saying that if I hadn’t agreed to chaperone your date?” My sister pretended to think it over. “Well, I would still love you, I suppose, but you’d probably lose the title of best sister.” By the time Lilly came home from her job that evening and we’d all sat down for supper, things were practically settled with Walter. “He’s going to ask his friend Lev Wilson,” she told the family as we ate. “And if Lev is free, we’re going out on Friday night.” I felt my stomach drop a little. It was already Wednesday. I didn’t think my first date with a boy would be thrust upon me so quickly. “Lev Wilson,” Papa repeated, mulling the name over. “Didn’t he used to be on the football team for Tiburon High?” “Yes, I think he was the quarterback or something a few years ago,” Lilly told him. “Walter said that he was offered a scholarship to Notre Dame, but that his father had a heart attack the summer before he was going to start so he couldn’t go.” “I remember hearing something about that,” Papa said as he cut his meat. “Sounds like he’s a boy with good values; not abandoning his family like that.” “I’m sure all of Walter’s friends are very nice,” Lilly was quick to assure him. I wondered if that was because things weren’t confirmed with Lev and Lilly didn’t want to jeopardize the date, if I should have to be escorted by another boy. “The boat for the castle is arriving early tomorrow morning,” Papa said, abruptly changing the topic. He probably didn’t want to linger over thoughts of his daughters actually going out on a double date. “I just found out Bill Galler out of Akron is going to oversee the day laborers that were hired to help out.” “We should all drive over early and take a look,” Mama suggested. “And then we could drop the girls at school.” Papa rubbed his chin. “I would like to see what they’re up to,” he mused. “Bill says the pay is pretty good. Men are driving in from as far as Columbus.” “Good,” Mama said, a small smirk playing across her lips that her husband was now interested in seeing the monstrosity. “It’s settled then.” Our father had a professional interest in the assembling of the castle. He ran a small construction company and had built several of the larger houses and a few of the businesses around town. When the market crashed, his business shrunk down to building garages and assembling houses that people had order from the Sears & Roebuck catalog. But he’d built our lovely home himself, and the property was paid for, so we were better off than most, although we did have to keep our day-to-day living lean. There were butterflies in my belly as I climbed into bed that evening and they weren’t about the fast approaching double date. I was excited about the castle. It just sounded so romantic; I couldn’t help but wonder who would live there. Did they have any children? And if yes, would those children attend Tiburon High? It seemed incongruous for someone who lived in a real European castle to simply go to the local high school. I was pretty sure if there were any children living at the castle, they would probably have tutors or attend boarding school. When it was time to get up extra early the next morning, I did not want to leave my bed. Not because I wasn’t excited about my day, but because I was having the most wonderful dream and I didn’t want to let it go. There was a boy who was tall and handsome with dark hair and pale skin. He had me wrapped in his arms and he was trying to say something to me, something wonderful. But then there was Lilly, shaking my arm. “It’s time to get up,” she told me. “If you want to miss seeing the boats bringing in the stones for the castle, then go right on sleeping.” I scrambled out of bed and hurried to get ready. But as I dressed for the day, I tried to cling to the fragments that I could remember from my dream. It was just too wonderful not to savor. But it quickly faded, as dreams usually do, and I was left with just a vague yearning for a boy who I would probably never meet. The Tiburon River ran to the south of the town and the castle was to be reassembled on its northern bank. It was officially a river, but not a very mighty one. There was no way for a cargo ship massive enough to make a transatlantic voyage to sail down the waterway. So the stones of the castle were offloaded from the ship somewhere out east and loaded onto railcars. At some point they were then loaded onto shallow-bottomed barges that usually traversed the Ohio River and wended their way to the Tiburon River. And eventually the pieces and parts of the castle reached Tiburon. Papa drove the car down a dirt road. Eventually the road petered out so we had to walk about a quarter of a mile after that to get to the river. The barges had already arrived and were lined up along the bank ten deep. Working the barges were dozens of men, covered in grime, with dark, ruddy faces and fierce bright eyes shouting to each other in a language that was unrecognizable to me. Local men swarmed the landing where the stones were being offloaded. A couple of large platforms with winches had been erected on the land to transfer the large stones, some of which were as small as a child’s Radio Flyer red wagon. Other stones were as large as large as a Model T. The stones were a uniform dark gray in color and each was tagged with a number in bright red paint. I assumed that was so the workers would know how to put the castle back together again. A massive foundation had already been dug into the ground about thirty yards from where the barges were being unloaded. Men were standing in a long line, passing stones about the size of a pound of flour hand-over-hand into the foundation like firemen passing buckets to quench a fire. My father’s friend, Bill Galler, was standing near the edge of the foundation, so Papa strode over to speak to him. Mama, Lilly and I followed in his wake. We knew nothing about the workings of a construction site beyond to stay out of the way. That was a lesson our father had made clear since we were very little girls. “How’s it going, Bill?” Papa asks, shaking the other man’s hand with a firm grip. “Seems like half of Columbus must have come up here today. Where’s everybody sleeping.?” “There’s a small tent city on the other side of the woods,” Bill told him. “A couple of tents for Americans and then another one for the foreigners.” “Why didn’t they hire more local men from here in Tiburon, if you don’t mind me asking?” Papa inquired, not sounding pleased, but not sounding angry either. “Don’t know,” Mr. Galler said, taking off his hat and wiping his brow, even though it was a chilly morning. “I was as surprised as anyone when I got the call offering me the job.” After thinking it over he said, “It might be my name. Galler is Hungarian, you know. My family came over about fifty years ago. We don’t think much about the connection anymore, but that might be it. Or maybe I just got lucky.” Clapping my father on the shoulder, he said, “Either way, I’m sure it wasn’t an intentional snub on you. Or anyone in Tiburon,” he added. “Sure looks like you have your work cut out for you,” Papa said, surveying the line of men moving the smaller stones. “What’s going on with this foundation?” “It’s a dungeon, if you can believe it,” Mr. Galler told him, causing Lilly and I to exchange quick looks. “It’s a real honest-to-goodness medieval castle and those things usually came with a dungeon back in the day. At least that’s my understanding.” “I hope they don’t intend to use it as one now,” Papa said, taking a few steps closer to the massive hole and peering around. “Not that I know of,” Mr. Galler told him. “There’s not a lot of communication on this end, but my understanding is that it’s to be used for storage.” He put his hat back on his head. “That or as guests bedrooms.” When my father gave him a questioning look, he cracked into a smile. His comment made Papa chuckle. “Well, I suppose if they’re trying to keep things historically accurate then they have to put in the dungeon.” He rubbed his chin. “As a matter of fact, I may have a use for it.” When Mr. Galler gave him a curious look, he added, “A couple of young fellows are taking out my daughters on Friday night.” “Well I don’t blame them boys,” Mr. Galler said, shooting us a smile over his shoulder and tipping his hat to our mother. “Your girls have turned out quite pretty. I’m sure there are many young men here about who would like to have that honor.” “Speaking of our girls, I believe we’d better get going,” Mama said, interjecting herself into the conversation. “We don't want them to be late for school.” Papa looked reluctant to leave the bustle of the worksite. “Would you mind taking them over there on your own, Lillian?” he asked. My older sister had been name after our mother. “I’d sure like to stick around awhile.” He looked at Mr. Galler. “If you don’t mind, Bill.” “Be happy to have you,” Mr. Galler said. “I’ve never worked on anything this big before. I guess this is the closest I’ll ever get to erecting a skyscraper in New York City.” “Fine with me,” Mama said, trying to keep the glee from her voice. She loved any reason to drive the car when our father wasn’t around. And, with things being so slow for his work, Papa was around more often than not. “Should I swing back to pick you up before lunch?” Papa cast a questioning eye in Mr. Galler’s direction. “My wife came down with me to stay a few weeks,” was the man’s reply. “She always packs my pail with enough food for three men.” “How about I just swing by before I get super started?” Mama asked, smiling at the two men. Papa was downplaying it all, but it was obvious he was as excited about the construction of the castle as some men get about a new car. “That’ll be fine, Lillian,” Papa said. “Come along, girls,” Mama said, putting an arm around Lilly and the other around me. “We’d better hurry or you’ll be tardy.” We turned to start heading back to the car. I really would have rather stayed and watched the men work, than sit staring at the blackboard while Mr. Wilmore droned on about the quadratic formula, but I knew I would never be allowed to stay. Still, as we left, I felt a great longing to know more about the castle and its future inhabitance. “Please, Mr. Galler,” I said, quickly ducking back around. “What is the name of the family who is going to live here?” Mr. Galler smiled. He seemed like a very genial man. “Vanderlind, I believe,” he told me. As far as I know, the family’s name is Vanderlind.” “Vanderlind,” I said to myself as I turned to catch up with my mother and sister. The name had a dashing quality to it, like a character written by Sir Walter Scott. I couldn’t help but glance back over my shoulder again to catch another glimpse of the massive stones being moved ashore for the construction of the Vanderlind Castle. Chapter 4 Jessie “I want you to glean as much information as you can about this move from your grandfather,” Mother said in a low voice as she pretended to straighten my tie. “Don’t make it obvious, but listen whenever you can.” It was the night after Grandfather had dropped his bombshell about the move. One of the other vampire families was throwing a ball and we had dressed accordingly. “What kind of information?” I asked her, also keeping my voice low. My tie was already perfect; the adjustment of it was just a pretense. My mother gave just the hint of a shrug. “Anything.” she said. “Where is it? That would be good for a start. I can’t even find Tiburon, Ohio on a map. And who is in charge of the construction? Any details about the town or the voyage would be helpful. Just tell me anything you hear.” “I think Mrs. Denkler will probably know more about that than anyone,” I told her. Mrs. Denkler was the castle house keeper and seemed to know more about our family than was normally healthy for a mortal. Grandfather trusted her implicitly, which was saying a lot. He’d even offered to turn her a few times, but she’d refused. “If you’d only made me the offer when I was still young and beautiful,” she would always tell him, “then I would have jumped at the chance.” There seemed to be a steady supply of mortals in Europe who were willing to work for the undead — I didn’t know if that was because they were hoping to become undead themselves or because vampires usually paid a little better — but Mrs. Denkler showed a devotion to our family that was above and beyond ordinary mortal loyalty. “You know that Denkie has always been my father’s agent,” Mother said, ruining the shape of the tie just so she would have to wrap it again. I nodded. She was right. “I’ll keep my ears open,” I assured her. “And…” Mother hesitated for a moment. “No words about this to your brother or Emily. Let’s just keep this conversation between us.” “Understood,” I said with a nod. “Now you look extra handsome,” Mother said in a brighter voice, stepping back to admire her handy work. “I can only imagine how well you’ll look once you’ve been turned. There won’t be a girl in the New World who can resist your charms.” I always felt awkward when anyone made a joke about me chasing after girls. I was old enough to find the opposite sex very appealing, but I wasn’t exactly “girl crazy”. Or at least that was how my cousin Dorian was frequently described. What I truly wanted — and wasn’t willing to ever admit aloud — was someone to love and cherish with every fiber of my heart. And to know in my soul that the girl felt the same way about me. But, given the circumstances of my family, I doubted I would ever have the opportunity to fall in love. Unless I could find a way to escape my grandfather’s clutches and elude the family curse. I was only seventeen, so at least I still had a few years to try. As we planned our transatlantic voyage, Mother was adamant that Mrs. Denkler book everyone separate cabins, using different names for each member of the family. Grandfather was reluctant. “That would be like saying we’re ashamed to be Vanderlinds,” he insisted. I assumed that Grandfather was only being stubborn because using separate cabins was someone else’s idea. “But just think, Father,” our mother implored him. “If one of us was to be accidentally discovered, the whole family could be wiped out.” Shaking her head and frowning, she added, “No. The more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that we must take separate cabins. I wouldn’t even be opposed to separate ships.” But on this point, Grandfather was firm. He could see the sense in the family having separate cabins and traveling under assumed names — travel documents were easy enough to have forged — but he would not hear of separate ships. Eventually Mother had to concede. I said nothing to anyone, but I had the strong suspicion that all our mother really wanted was the separate cabins. She brought up the separate ships so that her father would have something to rail against and feel satisfied. It was finally settled that Emily and I, being the only two family members who still remained mortal, would travel together under the Vanderlind name. The rest of the family would travel under different assumed names. We would not associate with each other except by the most casual of meetings. My uncle and cousin would follow later, once all the business of the Vanderlind estate was settled. Arranging for the boat was actually the easiest things to organize when compared to the numerous tasks necessary for our move to America. It was all well and good for my grandfather to announce that we were leaving for America, but orchestrating the move was a monumental task. First we Vandlerinds had to decide on the necessities we needed for the next several months. Our essentials were packed and transported to a large estate that Grandfather had rented. Then the servants had to pack their own possessions and join us. After that the entire contents of the castle was packed and stored in a warehouse. That made room for several architects, carpenters and electricians to come in and take apart the rooms that had been modernized with wood floors, also removing the doors, woodwork and light fixtures. After that the stone masons came in, numbering every single stone that comprised the castle so it could be disassembled. The top stones of the castle were sent to a warehouse while the bottom stones of the structure were loaded onto numerous freight trains. They crossed several countries before being loaded onto a massive cargo ship that headed out across the Adriatic and on its way to America. It was unsettling to see the hole where the castle had sat for the last couple of centuries, like viewing the gap left after a tooth has been ripped from the mouth of a giant. But there was hardly time to reflect upon our departure due to an absurd number of bon voyage parties that were thrown in our honor. There were parties in the country with horseback riding and polo. There were parties in the city on rooftops that could only be accessed by the air. All mortals had to be carried up by the undead. There was even an elaborate banquet in the catacombs under Buda Castle followed by dancing. Each of our undead hosts did his or her best to outshine the previous party. I began to feel that the parties had started to spiral out of control in terms of ostentation. The entire experience of having our friends wish us farewell was rather exhausting. Especially for a mortal like me, because the parties usually ran until just before dawn. As one of the guests of honor, it would have been considered the height of bad manners for me not to stay until the bitter end. The months of constant bacchanal probably explained why, when an outbreak of scarlet fever ravaged through the streets of Budapest, I was quick to be overpowered by the malady. Chapter 5 Colette It turned out that Lev Wilson was available Friday night and the double date was arranged. Lilly was behind the moon. My feelings were more reserved. I just couldn’t imagine what I would have to talk about with a young man of twenty who worked doing… I couldn’t even remember what he did for a living. That’s how little I was interested in the date. “You don’t actually have to say that much,” Lilly told me as we were getting ready and I expressed my concerns. “All you really have to do is smile, be pleasant and listen when he talks. You can do that much, can’t you?” “I’m sure I can,” I assured her, but the very idea of just smiling and nodding at a young man made me dread the date even more. I knew there were plenty of girls at school who would laugh their heads off whenever a boy said anything even remotely funny, but I couldn’t bring myself to be so mindless. Why should I pretend a boy is interesting or charming or intelligent when he’s not? It seemed to me that just gave the male half of the species a false sense of superiority. Of course this wasn’t something I could say to most girls or they would stare at me like I’d lost my mind. “Questioning a boy’s intelligence is no way to land a husband,” a friend’s older sister once told me when a few of us had been invited to their house for a sleep-over and I had brought up my thoughts on the subject. The only person I could really share my feelings about wanting more out of life than to be a wife and mother was my friend Lois. She was top in our class. She even had her father petition the school so that she could enroll in some of the advanced science and early engineering classes that girls were usually discouraged from taking. She’d already been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and they barely accepted any women. We’d talked about me moving with her to Cambridge and getting an apartment together when she started college. I was sure I could probably find work as a secretary somewhere. My typing skills were quite good. But Lois was also madly in love with a fellow student, Laurence, who was nearly as smart as her. I had a feeling they would get married after graduation and start their collegiate careers as husband and wife. Lilly spent almost as much time taming my hair for our double date than she did fixing her own. Most women tried to get a wave into their hair while I was constantly battling my waves for fear they would upset a ship or two. “You’re just so very pretty,” Lilly said, once she was finished styling my hair and was gazing over my shoulder at our reflections in our dressing table mirror. “I think I’m half afraid to introduce you to Walter. He might like you best.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her, knowing that she was teasing. “I’m sure your beau won’t even notice me.” Lilly broke into a smile. “I hope you’re right.” I decided to wear my favorite green dress with the little white flowers on it. The cotton fabric was too light for the chilly evenings we were still experiencing, but I’d outgrown my heavier plum-colored dress and didn’t have much else to wear. Lilly was dressed quite smartly and I felt I should at least try to match her appearance. It would look odd if she was in a dress and I was just wearing a wool skirt and sweater. At the last minute, Lilly misplaced one of her favorite gloves and you would have thought she’s lost a diamond ring, the way she savaged our room looking for it. I finally discovered that it was still in the pocket of her coat. She’d overlooked it in her haste. Walter and Lev arrived promptly at six thirty, their skin well scrubbed and their hair filled with so much oil that I knew mother was afraid to ask them to sit down for fear they’d leave two matching stains on back of the couch. Many women tatted doilies for their couches just to protect them from such a menace. My sister was telling the truth when she said Lev was handsome. He had a strong chin and a defined brow. He looked just like a fictional football hero, which was what he had actually been only a few years earlier. I had no interest in sports, but I could see he was a very muscular young man and I thought I remembered seeing him around town, usually followed by a swarm of giggling girls. In a way, that made me feel better. If Lev had the attention of a lot of females, then there was no fear of him becoming interested in me as a potential sweetheart. I was sure he was probably perfectly nice, but a sporty-type of beau didn’t interest me in the least. I did notice that a few of the knuckles on Lev’s hands had plasters on them. He kept his hands clasped discretely behind his back most of the time. I scanned my memory again for what kind of work he did, but came up with nothing. Whatever it was, a few abrasions would probably teach him to remember his work gloves. March had come in like a lion and stayed that way. I could tell Lilly was reluctant to bundle up and run the risk of wrinkling her immaculately ironed dress, but she did it without voicing a complaint under the watchful eye of our mother. I layered a sweater over my green dress before adding my coat. I saw no reason to come down with a cold just because my sister had a crush. Finally we were out the door and heading toward town. The Gibson house wasn’t exactly in the country, but we were definitely on the outskirts of town so we had a bit of a walk ahead of us. That didn’t matter; Lilly and I were used to the exercise. Lilly and Walter took the lead, walking side-by-side and rather close together. Lev kept his pace even with mine and began talking, so I did my part to try to listen. His conversation seemed to focus mostly on football, which made listening more of a challenge. I had no idea why anyone would be so interested in a bunch of grown men running up and down a field chasing after a ball. It’s seemed oddly childish to me, as if Lev still enjoyed playing with blocks or flying paper airplanes. But he didn’t ask me any questions, so it was easy enough to pretend to be interested. All I had to do was nod every few sentences and to smile whenever he paused to look in my direction. But I did find it remarkably rude that Lev had not taken the trouble to ask me one question about myself. I knew I was just a girl in high school, so chances were good I didn’t have too much to say that a man of twenty would find interesting, but good manners seemed to dictate that he at least try to ask me about myself. Seated at the counter at Top’s, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Everyone but me, of course. Lilly and Walter were laughing and chatting and generally making themselves cozy. Lev stopped yammering at one point and took a long pull on his soda. I could easily imagine that his throat was dry. I felt it was probably my turn to say something, but I really hadn’t been paying enough attention to keep our current thread of conversation going. So I decided I might as well bring up something I found interesting for a change. “Who are some of your favorite authors?” I was bold enough to inquire. “Authors?” Lev all but sputtered on his drink. “Yes,” I said, not sure why my question was being treated as so shocking; I hadn’t ask him the brand of briefs he preferred. “Who do you like to read?” “I don’t,” he told me, wrinkling his nose in disgust, as if I’d just asked him what dress he liked to wear. “I read the paper and maybe an owner’s manual now and then, but I never read for pleasure.” He pulled another face. “Why would I?” That was it. I wanted to go home. Lev may have been handsome and well-built, but reading was one of my favorite things in the whole world and I could never be interested in a boy who not only did not read, but ridiculed me for taking enjoyment in it. I immediately gave up all attempts at trying to pay attention to the words coming out of Lev’s mouth and started covertly watching the clock behind the counter. We had to be home by nine, so that meant leaving Top’s by eight-forty at the latest. The end of my first official date with a boy couldn’t come soon enough. Chapter 6 Jessie “Stick out your tongue, young man,” the doctor instructed and I did as I was told. “Yes, it’s as I expected,” the doctor said after taking several moments to examine my mouth and throat. “It’s definitely scarlet fever. Quite a bad case, I’m afraid.” “How soon will he be able to travel?” my grandfather asked. After months of packing, shipping and attending farewell parties, we were to leave Budapest in five days and I didn’t even feel like I could get out of bed. My head ached fiercely and my throat was so sore I could barely even swallow a little broth. There was a red rash covering most of my body. It itched something fierce, but I was usually too tired to scratch. The doctor gave Grandfather an astonished look. “I’m not sure you understand the current health of this young man,” he said in a low, yet serious voice. “He will not be able to do anything but rest for at least a month.” Then, glancing at my mother, he added, “I do not wish to alarm you, but there is a chance that he might not recover if he isn’t treated with great care.” “What are you on about?” Grandfather thundered. “Of course he’ll recover. Don’t be absurd. I’m just trying to decide if we can still set sail for America at the end of the week.” I was sure there was more to the conversation, but I was too tired to listen. I felt both clammy and chilled. My throat was on fire, yet I couldn’t manage to swallow much water whenever it was brought to my lips, even though I was parched. I must have slipped into the throws of the fever for some time because the next thing I remember I could hear Mother and Grandfather talking as they stood to one side of my bed. I held very still and just listened, keeping my eyes closed. I knew if I gave any indication I was awake, my mother would turn all of her attentions to me and I wanted to hear what they had to say. “I don’t understand why you can’t just set sail with Daniel,” my mother was saying. I could tell from the tone of her voice that she was trying to keep her emotions under control. “When Jessie regains his strength, the three of us will join you.” “I suppose you intend to keep Emily here with you?” Grandfather snarled. “Of course,” Mother said, as if any other option was simply absurd. “She’s still a little girl. She needs to be with her mother. I’m not sending her off with the likes of you and Daniel. Young girls need kindness, not to be toyed with like a cat toys with a mouse.” “I would not toy with my grandchild,” Grandfather exclaimed, his voice starting to sound like thunder. “I didn’t mean you,” Mother informed him. “Now I love all of my children equally,” she said, “but I think I also understand the nature of each of my children. I’m afraid that Daniel would not be able to resist tormenting a mortal child, even if she is his own sister.” This silenced Grandfather for a moment. He knew Mother was right. But he also probably suspected she had ulterior motives. My mother did not want her children to be members of the undead. “I don’t see why we don’t just turn him now and save ourselves the trouble,” Grandfather said, his voice conveying that my illness was causing him to feel put upon. “No!” Mother said, rather sharply. “He’s only seventeen. He’s too young to be turned.” “He’s not that young,” Grandfather insisted. “He’s almost a man.” “Being almost a man and being a man are two very different things,” Mother insisted. “You wouldn’t want to leave him stuck on the edge of manhood for eternity.” “I suppose not,” Grandfather muttered, pulling on his bottom lip. My fever must have started to rise again because after that I didn’t remember much else beyond the doctor’s concerned face hovering over my bed. He looked very grave and I remember thinking that he was about to tell Mother I was going to die. I should have been so lucky. Later that night, I remember hearing a noise and opened my eyes to see my grandfather looming over my bed. “What is it, Grandfather?” I asked in a hushed voice, not wanting to make too much noise, my head ached so badly. “The doctor has his doubts that you will survive,” Grandfather said, his voice cold and emotionless. “And we’ve already booked our tickets for America.” My eyelids felt heavy, but I tried to peer through the dark. Was Grandfather actually angry that my illness was ruining his plans? “I’m sorry,” I said. It didn’t really make sense to me to apologize, but I had no idea what he wanted from me and I couldn’t think of anything else to say. “I will not have your weakness prevent this move,” he informed me. “Your mother has offered to stay behind with Emily to nurse you, but we both know that means I would never see any of you again.” I said nothing. I was too weak to put up a fight. It was clear that he had made up his mind and nothing I could do would stop him. “So I am to be seventeen forever?” Grandfather bent over me, pushing my head to one side. “You’re going to be a Vanderlind forever.” Then I felt a hot sting on my neck like two hornets had synchronized their attack. Grandfather had his mouth pressed against my flesh and I knew he was feeding from me, draining me of all my blood at a rapid rate. I wanted to fight him, but the fever had left me as weak as a kitten. I could barely raise my hands in protest. And when I did try to defend myself, he immediately pinned me to the bed. As I lay there, I could feel the blood draining from my body. First my feet went numb. It was like standing outside too long in the snow. Then I could no longer feel my hands. Shortly after that I could feel my heart struggling to beat in my chest. I must have cried out as I struggled to cling to my last moments of life because suddenly my mother burst through the door. “Father! What are you doing?” she shrieked. Then she raced across the room and wrenched him away from my shuddering form. “He was going to die anyway,” Grandfather insisted. “I’m just facing the inevitable.” “But he’s just a boy.” Mother was weeping with rage and grief. “You should at least give him the chance to become a man.” “It’s too late now,” Grandfather informed her. “I’ve drunk too much. He’s going to die now, either way. The only question you have to answer is whether I bring him back.” “No!” Mother dropped to her knees, clutching my hand. “Oh, my darling Jessie. I should have known. I should have known he would try to do this to you,” she said between sobs. I opened my mouth to try to speak. I wanted to tell her to just let me die. My body was already feeling much warmer. I felt like I was floating in a lake on a sunny day. The pain of my illness had been washed away. I was ready to face the afterlife. Chapter 7 Colette “I’m sorry, Lilly, but I honestly don’t want to go.” “What are you talking about?” my sister exclaimed. We were in the backyard the next morning, clearing out the weeds that had survived the winter, and turning over the soil in Mama’s vegetable patch. “Lev said he had a wonderful time. He wants to see you again.” “I just don’t think we have very much in common,” I told her as I tugged at a dead thistle, its little stingers piercing my worn work gloves in a few spots. “Men and women never have much in common,” she told me. “You shouldn’t let that bother you.” “He doesn’t even like to read,” I grunted, still battling the plant. “Not at all.” “You put too much stock in reading,” Lilly said. “I think you’ll find most men don’t care for it.” “Papa likes to read,” I pointed out. The thistle finally gave up the fight and I tumbled a little to one side as it released its grip on the soil. “He reads all the time.” “Yes, but Papa is an educated man,” Lilly pointed out. “I think I would prefer an educated man,” was my response. “Yes, but it’s not Lev’s fault he’s not educated. He was going to go to college,” my sister insisted. I really couldn’t imagine Lev in a collegiate atmosphere. He just didn’t appear that bright. I wondered if this was something I should mention to Lilly. “Please, Lettie,” Lilly pleaded. “You know Walter and I can’t go out again unless you go with us. And I really, really like him.” “I’d be happy to meet another one of Walter’s friends,” I told her. “You said he knew a lot of nice boys.” Lilly let her shoulders slump. “But what about Lev? Don’t you think that would hurt his feelings?” “Lilly,” I couldn’t help but say, “we went out on one date for a soda. It’s not as if we were going steady or anything. Besides, I doubt Lev is desperate for female attention. I’m sure there are a lot of girls who would be happy to listen to him talk about football.” Lilly widened her eyes a little, believing she had figured something out. “Is that why you don’t want to see him again? Because he talked too much about football?” “It’s not the only reason,” I told her. “Then what is?” Sighing, I pulled at a few more shriveled weeds. “He never asked me about myself,” I said, feeling a little foolish for no reason. “Not one thing.” “Oh, is that all?” Lilly said, dusting some soil from her gloved hands. “You don’t understand,” I told her. “If there had been just a photograph of me there in my place, it would have been the same to Lev. And when he finally stopped speaking for a moment, and I asked him a question, he ridiculed me.” Standing up, I brushed some dried grass from my legs. “I’m sorry,” I told her, picking up my hoe. “I don’t want to prevent you from seeing your beau, but I will not go out on another date with Lev Wilson.” “But…” Lilly started to protest. “I don’t see why I have to be miserable, just so you can be happy,” I told her chopping vigorously at the soil with the hoe. “Just explain to Walter that Lev and I didn’t hit it off and have him fix me up with another boy. Or none at all, for all I care. I’ll just bring a book on your next date and be a third wheel.” “No, that’s alright,” Lilly hastened to say. “I’ll just tell Walter you need someone who is a little more intellectual. He should understand that.” That afternoon was the first time I rode my bike out to the castle. It hadn’t been my intention. My original destination was the library to hunt for a new book to read, but somehow I found the wheels of my bike rolling toward the shores of the Tiburon River. And the next thing I knew, I was admiring the progress that had been made on reconstructing the castle. I knew better than to get too close to the work in progress. I didn’t want to be in the way. But even from a distance, I could see the walls of the castle starting to rise. The dungeon must have already been finished and the stones for the ground floor in place. I had somehow thought they would build the exterior walls first and then fill in the middle, but they appeared to be building everything up, layer by layer. All of the stones from the barges had been off-loaded onto the shore. The boats themselves had disappeared; probably they were headed back down to the Ohio River. There was still a massive pile of rocks on the shore, but I had heard a second round of barges would arrive with more stones once the first pile had been cleared. It was amazing the amount of progress the stone masons had done in only a few days. But the sheer number of people reconstructing the castle probably made the whole thing go quicker than expected. There didn’t seem to be very many windows to the castle. None at all, as far as I could tell. I thought about the drawings and photographs of castles I’d seen in books. There never were any windows. That made sense, especially if a castle’s primary purpose was to defend its inhabitants against a siege. There was no sign of the Vanderlind family. It seemed unlikely that they would arrive before the castle was completely finished. Wealthy people probably hated being inconvenienced even more than us regular folks. I knew it was foolish, but I couldn’t wait for the Vanderlinds’ arrival. I didn’t think the family would actually socialize with people from Tiburon, but it would be exciting to see a few of them as they drove through town, or maybe catch a glimpse of them as they entered the policemen’s ball, or stopped by to pay a call on the mayor. I imagined it would be like catching a glimpse of royalty. I had read how the English who owned grand houses would have a day each month when their homes were open to the public. That way regular folks could come in and admire the art and finery. I sincerely hoped that the Vanderlinds would adhere to that sort of tradition, so that I would have a chance to see inside the castle. It was something I wanted very much and I just knew there had to be a way. That night I dreamt of the Vanderlind Castle. Or at least I had a dream about a castle and decided it was how the castle being built on the other side of town should look. In my dream there was a fine family with a mother and father, an aging dowager, and several children of varying ages. My dark haired boy was the middle child. He was there, playing croquet on the lawn with his brothers and sisters. I wasn’t sure why I was there. Things were vague, as they sometimes are in dreams. But as the dark haired boy was lining up a shot, he looked up and smiled at me, his dark eyes twinkling in the sunlight. When I woke up the next morning, I took several minutes to luxuriate in my bed. I knew the memories of my dark haired boy would slip away soon enough, so I wanted to savor them while I could. It probably wasn’t healthy to pine for a boy who was only a product of my imagination, but for a few moments I decided to just indulge in my secret fantasies. My sister’s desire to spend time with Walter would brook no opposition. When, after a few days of constant pressure, pleading, and offered bribes yielded no results, Lilly realized that Walter really would have to wrangle another of his friends. I hoped for one with a smaller head, but with a bit more going on upstairs. And that’s exactly what Walter did. He must have combed through every boy he’d ever met to fix me up with a very studious fellow named Herschel Tuft. He was a grade above me at school and he had won the Tiburon High School mathematics prize three years running. It turned out that Walter and Herschel were second or third cousins — I wasn’t exactly sure of their family connection — but it sounded reassuring enough for Papa to agree to the date. This time it was more than just a soda at Top’s. We were actually going to walk into town to see a movie. I loved movies so I felt this date wasn’t going to be as much of an imposition on me. I recognized Herschel from school, of course, as soon as he walked in our front door. I distinctly remembered him accepting his math award the previous year. There was a peculiar angle to the way he held his head when he was nervous and it had stuck in my brain. Herschel was a pale boy, tall and slender with sandy blond hair that was straight as a pin. He didn’t have his hair loaded up with any kind of hair tonic, which I knew met with our mother’s approval. I’d never previously spoken to Herschel, or had any classes with him, but I immediately felt more comfortable being around him than I had Lev. At least he was closer to me in age. In contrast to Lev, Herschel said as little as possible while the four of us walked into town. I didn’t mind the silence. In fact, I preferred it to stories about football games. But I did think we should have a little conversation so I tried with, “What do you intend to do after graduation?” Herschel gave me a started look, as if I was a pet cat that had suddenly started speaking one day. “College,” he eventually answered. I nodded, waiting for more than a one word reply. When I realized nothing else was coming, I tried, “What do you think you’ll study?” “Mathematics,” he told me, this time without as much hesitation. I figured that was about as much as I was going to get out of him, so I let things go at that. There was a bit of problem when we were buying our tickets. Herschel headed up to the gal at the ticket window and purchased a single ticket. I guess that was his way of letting me know he had no interest in me romantically. Fortunately, the feeling was mutual. Unfortunately, it did lead to some awkwardness. I got in line with every intention of buying my own ticket, but then Walter insisted on treating me. I tried to argue with him, but he insisted. It was somehow more humiliating having my sister’s beau purchase my ticket than it would have been if I’d bought my own. Fortunately the film we saw was rather entertaining and I found myself laughing off the whole situation. Herschel, on the other hand, did not appear to enjoy the show. He did not laugh once during the entire movie and frequently looked quite bored. On the walk home, I took the lead, trailing Herschel in my wake. I’d actually enjoyed myself more than on my date with Lev. But I didn’t want to prolong Herschel’s agony, so that speeded my steps. Lilly and Walter were walking at a leisurely pace, of course. They obviously did not want their date to end. When I got to our front porch, I took a seat on the step. The weather was warming up a little, but the flagstones still chilled my bottom. I couldn’t exactly go inside without my sister, and Papa hadn’t put the porch swing back up since taking it down in the fall, so there was no other place to wait. Herschel eventually wandered up and sat beside me. He said nothing, so I said nothing. I did steal a glance at my watch. If my sister and her beau did not step lively, then we would be late getting home and that would be the end of Walter Bennett. “I apologize for not purchasing your ticket,” Herschel eventually said, breaking the silence. “I must save every penny I have for college next fall, And Walter said this wouldn’t really be a date, so I saw no reason to incur the expenditure.” “That’s alright,” I told him. “I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy the picture.” “I enjoyed it,” Herschel told me. “Really?” I was surprised. “I don’t think I heard you laugh once during the whole film.” Herschel chewed over this observation. “I don’t…” he began and then he thought it over some more. “I don’t believe guffawing loudly in a public place is an accurate assessment of enjoyment.” Guffawing? I thought to myself. Herschel was certainly more intellectual than Lev, but he wasn’t exactly a pleasant person to be around. Fortunately for me, Lilly and Walter came into view at that exact moment, walking arm-in-arm. It was a relief because I knew Papa would scold both of us if we were late, and I really didn’t want to spend any more time speaking with Herschel Tuft. Chapter 8 Jessie I woke to a hunger that I never imagined was possible. The urge to feed was overwhelming. It literally crippled any other thought that entered my head. I could smell odors that would have never registered in my mortal nose. I knew the chambermaid had been in the room recently to change my linen. My mother must have sent her away immediately because the smell of her was very faint, but my urge to rip out the girl’s throat and feast on her red juices was overwhelming. Fortunately, Mother was right there with a large jug of blood. “It’s alright, my darling. Everything is going to be alright,” she said, handing me cup after cup of the red nectar until I just grabbed the entire jug and gulped it down. It was the most delicious thing I had ever tasted. It was ambrosia in my mouth. I could feel the blood coursing through my body, making every part of me tingle with satisfaction. There was only a small part of my brain that wondered how the liquid I was drinking had been acquired. Did some poor soul sacrifice his life for the precious elixir? I was ashamed to admit it, but a large portion of me didn’t care. All I wanted was more. After the jug was gone, I was a little better. I felt saner. I still had horrible pangs of hunger, but not the kind of pangs that drove a person to do depraved things. I took notice of my hands. The red rash from my illness was gone and my skin looked extraordinarily pale. A small scar that I had been at the base of my thumb for as long as I could remember had vanished. “Are you better now?” Mother asked, clasping my hands and pulling them to her cheek. “Do you feel under control?” I looked at her, but suddenly I couldn’t speak. There was bile filling my throat. I felt like beetles and slugs were trying to crawl out of my mouth. I hated everyone and everything. I wanted to set the world on fire. I wanted to cause pain. I wanted to see mortals quaking with terror so that I could delight in their agony. “Jessie?” My mother stared at me, her eyes wide with fear. I’d always loved Mother dearly and I didn’t want to frighten her. I didn’t want to cause her any more pain than she’d already suffered with a monster for a father. And it was that conviction that centered me. The plague that I was tempted to let spill from my lips abated. I felt my old self again. “Yes,” I finally managed to say.”Yes, I think I’m…” I could not even think of the words to describe how I was feeling. “Calm,” was what I ended up saying. “I’m so sorry.” Mother burst into tears. “I should have known my father would try something like this. I should have guarded the door.” She hung her head and released a deep sob. “I should have taken you all away years ago.” “I think we both know Grandfather would have never allowed that to happen,” I said, sitting up a little in my bed and stuffing a pillow behind my head and shoulders. “He would have pursued us to the ends of the earth.” Grandfather was a very controlling man. He did not like the idea of anyone disobeying him, especially his own flesh-and-blood. His word was law. “That’s true,” Mother said with a large sniff, her eyes glistening. She always looked beautiful, even when she cried. That was one of the things I remembered about her, even before she was turned. Her beauty had been enhanced by becoming a member of the undead, but it wasn’t created by it. “But still…” she said. “I should have tried. I should have thought of something.” I put my arms around her. “Please don’t cry.” She suddenly straightened up, pulling away from me and looking into my eyes. “You haven’t changed. Have you?” she exclaim. “I thought for a moment there…” She brushed at her tears. “But it’s not true. Is it? You’re still my wonderful boy.” Running my hand through my hair a couple of times, I thought things over. I didn’t feel any different. Not really. Not deep inside. There had been a moment where I’d felt like I could have let the world tumble into the darkest pit of human misery, but that moment had passed. Yes, my sense of smell was better than a bloodhounds and I could see clearly without there being a light in the room. Yes, I craved human blood. I could already feel I would need more of the red nectar before much longer. But no, I did not feel innately different. I no longer felt hate in my heart. That moment was gone. I had no desire to kill or torture mortals. If anything, I felt sad for the life I would never live. I mourned for the girl I would never marry and the children I would never cradle in my arms. “I think I’m the same,” I finally told my mother. “I don’t feel any cruelty in here,” I said, tapping on my chest. “Thank God,” Mother said, wrapping me in her arms. “Thank God.” I held her for a few minutes and let her cry in my arms. Then she pulled away from me and dried her eyes. “Now I only have Emily left.” My poor little sister. She was a dear girl. The weight of continuing the family line would fall upon her shoulders. “We must find a way to protect her,” I said. “We must get her away somehow.” Mother thought about it for quite some time before saying, “No, there is no way to take her away from my father.” She turned to look me in the eye, her face quite solemn. “If Emily is to be saved from the curse of eternal life, then it is Grandfather who must be removed from us.” Chapter 9 Colette “You didn’t like Herschel either?” my sister exclaimed as I walked my bike along side of her. “You’re impossible.” It was Sunday and I had ridden out to the castle after church to see how things were progressing. I had expected the building site to be quiet, but there was still at least fifty men working, positioning stones and moving lumber into the castle. The second battalion of barges had already arrived and been offloaded. I understood there was to be a third and fourth round of boats on the way, the final of which would contain the castle furniture and family possessions. I stood at the edge of the worksite, not wanting to be in the way, but still wanting a glimpse of what was happening. Most of the men who had been hired to help with the offloading of the larger stones had completed their work and been sent on their way. Of the men who remained, most must have been from Hungary. None of the conversations I overheard were in English. The exterior of the castle was looking close to complete, as far as my untrained eye could tell. The structure was much more massive than I had ever imagined. I guessed maybe it was six or eight stories tall. I couldn’t exactly estimate by windows because there weren’t any and I didn’t know how high the ceilings were on each level. The exterior was entirely composed of the large gray stones that we’d seen being unloaded that first day. The castle wasn’t exactly an inviting structure, but historically speaking, I suppose it wasn’t meant to be. I still found the whole idea of a family moving their ancestral home across an ocean and rebuilding it in our small Ohio town incredibly romantic and I longed to know more about the people who were going to live there. Several of the workers were standing in a cluster close at hand and I noticed that some of the men were glancing in my direction. They were rough-looking and dirty from their labors, but they weren’t regarding me in a way that felt menacing. Still, I thought it was a good idea to be on my way. As I was turning my bicycle around, I heard someone call out, “You there.” I didn’t stop. There was no possible reason someone at the worksite would be addressing me. “Hello! Young lady,” the man called out again. This time I knew he had to be addressing me because there were no other females around. “Yes?” I asked, while mounting my bicycle and rolling a few feet down the dirt road. I saw no reason to be within grabbing distance, even if my behavior came off as a little rude. A young man stepped forward. He was covered with grime, but had piercing blue eyes that looked intelligent. “You are from this town?” he asked, waving a hand in the direction of Tiburon. “You live nearby?” He had an accent, but I could understand him easily enough. “Yes,” I said, rather hesitantly, unsure why he was asking. “I have seen you here before. You are curious about the castle.” He said it as a statement, rather than a question. “I’ve never seen a real castle before,” I told him. I wasn’t sure what answer he was expecting. “It is fine that you look now,” the young man told me, “but when the family is here, you must never come to this place. You must stay away.” At first I thought he was trying to tease me in some foreign way that I didn’t understand. But his face was so grave; I quickly realized that wasn’t the case. “Why?” I asked. What need could there be for anyone to avoid the castle, beyond annoying the occupants? “The family, they are…” he said a foreign word that I did not understand. “They are?” I repeated. The young man turned to the group of workers he had been chatting with before approaching me. They were all observing our conversation rather closely. My new friend asked them something in whatever language they were all speaking. I assumed it was Hungarian. The men shook their heads. A few called out more words that I could not understand. Turning back to me, the young man tried again. “They are a cursed family,” he said. “They are…” and then he tried pantomiming out the word he could not translate into English. He began bearing his teeth, which were straight, but yellow. Then he made the action of biting down. “You understand?” he asked. After that he slapped his lean belly a few times. “They must feed.” “Oh,” I said, doing my best to suppress a laugh. Was he really trying to warn me that the Vanderlind family was gluttons? But he was looking at me with such a serious face. Maybe he meant that vicious dogs guarded the castle and they would bite any trespassers. Yes, that made more sense. He probably thought I might try to sneak onto the castle grounds and would get a bad mauling for my curiosity. “Thank you for telling me,” I said, trying to match his grave manner. “I will be careful. I promise.” A look of relief spread across the young man’s face. “I am glad you understand,” he told me. “You will tell other people? They will not come here?” “Yes, I’ll do that,” I assured him, even though I had no intention of doing so. It didn’t seem appropriate for me to wander the streets of Tiburon warning people of the new family’s angry dogs before they’d even set foot in America. Besides, I was quite sure the local police would make the family post a sign or something, if they had animals that were dangerous. I pondered the young man’s’ warning as I rode my bike home. That’s when I ran across Lilly, walking along the road, so I stopped to walk with her. She immediately brought up my date with Herschel, of course. “You didn’t like Lev because he talked too much and now you say you don’t like Herschel because he didn’t talk at all. Seriously, Lettie. I can’t figure you out.” “That’s not exactly true,” I said in my defense. “I didn’t like Lev because…” What could I say? I didn’t like him because he was so very full of himself that there didn’t seem to be any room left for him to care about anyone else. He just didn’t seem like a kind person to me. But I couldn’t exactly say that because he was a good friend of Walter’s. “Because I just didn’t feel we had a connection,” I said, although it sounded like a poor excuse, even to my own ears. “He thought you had a connection,” my sister observed. “Yes, but don’t both people have to mutually feel the connection for there to actually be one?” I asked. “If he felt anything, it was probably just hormones.” “Lettie,” Lilly exclaimed, and then she covered her face with her hands and laughed with embarrassment. “Don’t let Mama and Papa hear you talking like that. They’ll never let you out of the house again.” Chapter 10 Jessie It was not ideal for a fledgling vampire to be shunted onto an ocean liner only a few days after being turned. But Grandfather was a man of little compassion for other people’s suffering. Besides, the ship on which we’d booked our passage had all the requirements for a family of vampires to make a successful voyage. The boat didn’t launch until the evening, so if we waited to board until the last minute, then we could go under the cover of darkness. The ship also docked in New York in the late afternoon. We would all have to find excuses for lingering in our cabins, but that obstacle wasn’t insurmountable. Most stewards would be happy to let an ailing passenger spend a few more hours in his bunk if the right amount of currency was exchanged. We had to make sure that we all had a safe place to spend the daylight hours. Coffins could not be accommodated. — Even a steward on the make would grow suspicious after seeing a coffin in several different cabins. — But overly large steamer trunks were not out of the question. Grandfather had one made for each of the family who was a member of the undead. Steamer trunks were usually put in storage and not left in first class cabins, but it wasn’t such an oddity that it would be remarked upon with any interest. My mother suggested that each trunk be made by a separate craftsman, so they would all have a distinctive look and not be thought of as purchased together. She was adamant about everyone keeping a separate identity and my grandfather eventually saw the wisdom of this plan, even if he was unwilling to compliment her for such forethought. In the last decade, crossing the Atlantic had gone from a thirty day ordeal to just a four day voyage. It was a boon for vampires looking to travel to America because it meant no more trying to bring live animals aboard the ship or surviving on rats. Jars of blood, properly sealed, were easily palatable for up to a week, if kept out of the sun. Our grandfather had always fed traditionally, preferring the blood of beautiful young boys or virile young men. He had enough money and Budapest had enough members of the underclass, that these poor souls could be acquired and disposed of without too much trouble. Every once in awhile, a mother would raise a ruckus, searching for her missing child. But the Vanderlind wealth shielded Grandfather from any real concern about prosecution. There were rumors about our family, but there would always be rumors about us no matter where we lived. After my mother was turned, she couldn’t stomach the idea of causing another human pain to satisfy her own appetite. She said she’d rather starve than to harm an innocent mortal. So she came up with a plan to keep our family in good supply of the sustenance we needed while actually helping the mortals of the human race. Mother invented another son, Arthur. Poor Arthur was a sickly boy, suffering from a rare blood disease. His malady meant he was in need of multiple blood transfusions each day. Mortals interested in selling their blood were provided with a meal and a generous payment. Soon the castle had more blood than was needed. Other like-minded vampire families began contributing funds so that they too could feed without causing harm. It wasn’t too long before clinics were set up in four neighborhoods of Budapest so that blood could be collected without a direct connection to the Vanderlind family. Many vampires agreed that the voluntary collection of blood was the humane thing to do, but it did little to ease a vampire’s natural instinct to hunt. As I struggled to control my appetite and adjust to the new life that had been thrust upon me, there was another worry that plagued my mind. It was too late for a change in our cabin arrangements. My sister and I would have cabins that were adjoined by a stateroom. Before I had been transformed, that seemed an ideal pairing. I could keep an eye on her and shield her from any shipboard Romeos or unscrupulous travelers who were toying with the idea of relieving a first class young girl of her purse. But as a vampire, the whole situation made me uneasy. I was too new to the world of the undead to trust myself alone with any mortal. I loved my sister dearly and would have rather walked out into the blazing sun of high noon than harm her, but that didn’t mean my predatory instincts wouldn’t take over in a moment of weakness. Fortunately, my mother thought of a solution to ease my mind. Mrs. Denkler was crossing on the same ship as us, only her cabin was in third class. Our housekeeper would pose as Emily’s governess and simply stay in the cabin with her. Denkie had nerves of steel and I was convinced she could face down a vampire much more powerful than the likes of me. It felt good to know that my sister would be protected from the evil that lurked in her own home. That would make the crossing less of an ordeal. We travelled by private train cars to the port city of Drubrovnik on the Adriatic Sea, where the ship that would take us to America was anchored. Our boarding was planned with precision. We family members climbed in our custom steamer trunks while it was only late afternoon and then we were driven to the docks in separate vehicles. That way we could start boarding the boat, one-by-one, immediately after sunset. My sister and Mrs. Denkler came in the car with me. At first I felt claustrophobic in my substitute coffin. Although the trunk was quite large, I felt cramped and had to tuck my legs to fit inside. For several seconds I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Then I remembered that I didn’t have to breathe and I was just being foolish. “Mama is getting out of her trunk now,” Emily said, tapping on my trunk. She had a pair of opera glasses with her so she could watch the activities of the other family members while remaining inconspicuous. “They’re driving toward the ship now, so I think it’s okay for you to get out,” she said a few minutes later. All of the trunks had been ingeniously designed so that they could be locked and unlocked from the inside. The visible lock on the outside was really just a decoy to deceive any curious maids or light fingered crewmen. That way there was no chance of someone thrusting open the lid at an inappropriate hour and getting the surprise of his life as a vampire burst into flames and quickly shriveled into a pile of ash. That would have definitely been a story a man could tell his grandchildren from the insane asylum. I jiggled the lock, was unable to open it, and felt a flash of frustration. Then I realized I had my eyes closed, which was silly because as a member of the undead, I could see perfectly in the dark. With my eyes open, I easily popped the lock and flipped open the lid. Slipping out of the trunk, I crawled into the back seat next to my sister. She gave me a smile, then reached over and straightened my tie. Even though it was no longer necessary for me to breath, I still took a few moments to gulp in some of the night air. Mortal habits were hard to break. And it was always good to give the impression of breathing. It was smart for a vampire to try to appear as alive as possible. “Grandfather’s going now,” Emily said, glancing at me and then returning to her opera glasses. Under normal circumstances, Grandfather would have insisted upon going first. But like most bullies, he was a coward at heart. He wanted to make sure that no one tried to stop my mother before he put himself at risk. I wasn’t sure why anyone would stop Mother. She was simply a beautiful young woman travelling first class to the New World. “Are you sad about leaving Hungary?” Emily asked as we watched the others move closer and closer to the ship. There had been so many parties in the last few months, and then I had been gravely ill, and then I was abruptly transformed into the undead. With all that going on, I’d hardly had time to reflect on our moving. If I took a moment to think about it, then yes, there was some sadness at leaving the country we had always called home. I had school friends whom I was to be parted from forever. But I would have been parted from them anyway after being turned immortal. And yet there was another emotion brimming in my chest. It was much more powerful than my sadness, but I concealed it from everyone. In truth, I felt oddly compelled to go to America. My feelings were hard to describe, but I almost felt like my real life was waiting for me there. I didn’t exactly know how to explain it, but part of me was looking forward to the move with eager anticipation. “Jessie?” Emily prompted me and I realized I had not spoken in several seconds. Her face looked both sad and hopeful. I knew it must have been hard on her to have me turned so young. Neither of us had wanted to follow the family tradition that Grandfather was hell-bent to inflict upon us. We’d sometimes spoken of running away once we were both a little older. Those childhood plans were now gone. If Emily was to run, it would have to be on her own. I could no longer go with her. I forced a smile to my lips and said, “I think it’s going to be a grand adventure.” “You know what I think?” she asked, almost shyly. “What’s that, my little love?” I asked, slipping my arm around her and giving her a squeeze. She was not yet thirteen, so she still sometimes let me cuddle and squeeze her. “I think it’s going to be like Dorothy.” “Dorothy?” I asked, giving her a puzzled look. “From The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” she explained. It was her favorite book from when she was very little. “Don’t you remember? Dorothy’s whole house is swept up by a cyclone and crashes down in a place that’s filled with magic.” Her eyes were shining with the romance of it. “Why do you talk such nonsense?” Mrs. Denkler felt the need to interject. She’d been sitting in the front seat next to the driver, glowering at us the whole time. “The castle wasn’t swept up in a cyclone. It was dismantled and moved by hundreds of workmen and at great expense. And America is not a land filled with magic. Far from it. The east coast is supposed to be quite civilized, but the whole middle of the country is filled with savages and Irishmen.” “Don’t listen to Denkie,” I said, giving Emily another squeeze and shooting our housekeeper a warning look over my sister’s shoulder. “She’s still pouting that we’re not moving to the North Pole.” “The North Pole?” Emily gave her temporary governess a surprised look. “Yes, I heard her talking to Grandfather about it. She’s always wanted to move to the North Pole so that she can look for Father Christmas.” “She never said such a thing,” Emily said with a giggle. “You’re making that up.” “I might be,” I said, frowning a bit while nodding my head. “But I think you’re right about Dorothy. Maybe our house will land in a magical place.” Chapter 30 Jessie Emily peeked through her opera glasses again, directing them at the docks. “Daniel’s in line to go through customs,” she said. “And there are a couple of people behind him.” We had our chauffeur pull down to the dock so we could unload and prepare to board the ship. By the time we got all of our baggage out of the car, Daniel was already through the line. First class passengers were treated as above reproach. Beyond glancing at our tickets, no one stopped us as we made our way onto the ship. It was that easy, but only because of our Grandfather’s fortune. And our mother’s forethought. A steward showed us to our cabins. We each had sleeping quarters, and then there was a small stateroom that was set between our cabins. It was actually very charming with wood paneling and brass framed portholes. And the rooms were not nearly as cramped as I’d anticipated. That was another benefit to traveling first class. It afforded a person a lot more breathing room. There was a tap at the door while we were all settling in for our four day journey. “Bonjour,” a young woman in a maid’s uniform said as she let herself into our shared accommodations. “Oh,” she exclaimed, as if she hadn’t expected anyone to be in the rooms. “You must forgive me,” she said, her cheeks turning quite red. “I had expected that everyone would be on deck for the launch of the boat. I am just here to turn down your beds for the night.” Seeing the young woman’s blush reflex made my stomach contract with hunger. She was a beautiful, petite thing with bobbed hair and painted lips. I forced my mind to think of my luggage, which contained a dozen bottles of blood, all neatly tucked between ample padding. “You want I should come back later?” she asked. I placed her accent as French, but probably not from Paris. I glanced over at Emily, who shook her head just the tiniest bit. I was grateful to her. I think she understood that I was struggling with my newly acquired dietary restrictions and she didn’t want temptation to stumble in my path in the form of a shapely servant. “We won’t need bed service during our voyage,” I told the maid. “Is there anything I can get you?” she asked, looking from me to my sister and then back again. “Some water? Or ice, perhaps?” “Just solitude, I think,” I told her. We really didn’t need one of those forward maids who was always barging in to see if anything was needed. “We’ve both had a bout of scarlet fever so we’re looking for an uneventful voyage with plenty of peace and quiet.” “You poor things,” she clucked. “Then I shall bring you some broth to strengthen your blood.” The maid was remarkably persistent and she kept peeking at me, shyly, in a way that let me know that she was probably new to her job and desperate to make a good impression. “No thank you. We are in need of nothing.” I assured her. “And besides, if we do happen to have some urgent need, then there’s always my sister’s governess to take care of us both.” “Very good,” said the maid, glancing briefly in Mrs. Denkler’s direction. “Then I shall leave you to have a pleasant journey.” Once the maid had gone, Emily walked over to me and took my hand. “Are you feeling well enough to go up on deck? I would love to be there when we launch.” She gave me a hesitant smile. “And maybe toss some of those paper streamers into the air.” I knew Emily was worried about me mingling with the mortal crowd up on deck. She was such a little doll to be so concerned for me. She had always been quite the considerate child. And I didn’t want to deny her the enjoyment of our grand departure. “Just give me a moment in my cabin and we can head right up,” I told her. “Now that you mention it, I think I’d like to toss some paper streamers myself.” In my cabin, I opened the small trunk that held most of the food I would use on our voyage. There were twelve quart bottles to last me four days. It seemed like an excessive amount, but I had the keen hunger common to most fledglings and there was also always the risk of bad weather while we were at sea. We didn’t want a delay of a day or two leading to disaster. I kept another two small pint bottles in a valise in case of emergencies, but I hoped I wouldn’t need them. Unsealing the wax around one of the quart bottles, I pulled the cork and took a long pull. “Oh...” I couldn’t help but sigh and close my eyes, savoring the moment. It tasted so good. “Hurry up,” Emily called, rapping on my cabin door. “The boat’s about to leave.” “Coming!” I called, setting the bottle down and searching for the cork. I thought I’d put it on the table, but it was nowhere to be found. “Go ahead with Mrs. Denkler,” I called out as I searched. “I’ll catch up with you.” “She doesn’t want to go,” my sister informed me. “She says she has too much unpacking to do.” Where was that blasted cork? I hated to leave the bottle just sitting open. “Jessie,” my little sister called. “We’ve got to go now or we’ll miss everything.” “I’ll be right there,” I told her, setting the bottle down on the sink of the small bathroom that was part of my cabin. As I was striding toward the door, the trunk holding my food supply caught my eye. I’d told the maid we didn’t need anything, so we weren’t expecting anyone in the rooms, but just to be on the safe side, I snapped the trunk closed and locked it. Better safe than sorry. I didn’t want to end up eyeing every mortal passenger on the ship like they were sides of beef. Our departure was actually quite enjoyable. There was the excitement in the air that always seems to accompany the start of a journey. People cheered and waved to their loved ones standing on the shore. There were paper streamers, just like in the movies, and Emily had a delightful time letting them tumble from her fingers and trail over the side of the ship. I was doing well. Even though the ship’s deck was crowded, I felt I had control over my hunger. I caught a glimpse of my mother and grandfather out of the corner of my eye, standing separately and observing the festivities. Daniel was nowhere to be found, but he never was one to mingle with mortals, even when he was a mortal. There was a shift in the crowd as some noisy young men roughly surged through it. I could smell the beer on their breath, which explained their heightened jocularity. People were being jostled and a few of them even stumbled. I instinctively put my arm around my little sister to protect her from the high spirited youths. Emily looked up at me and smiled. “You’re a little old for her, aren’t ya?” one of the young men asked. He couldn’t have been older than nineteen or twenty. His face was a ruddy pink from alcohol. I gave the fellow a sharp look, but decided the best course of action was to ignore him. Emily, being on the verge of young womanhood, felt embarrassed by his comment. “He’s my brother,” she told him. The young man smiled. “Does that mean you’re free?” he said, his mouth spreading into a lascivious grin. “This is my lucky day.” “She is a child,” I told him. “And your comments are not appreciated.” “I think she’s old enough to make up her own mind.” The man reached out to touch Emily’s cheek. “Aren’t you, pretty girl?” Before I even thought of what I was doing, my hand shot out and I’d grabbed the young man firmly by the wrist. I wasn’t used to my undead strength and I held him quite tightly. There was a surprised look in his eyes, backed by a little pain. But the surprise quickly turned to alcohol-fueled fury. He took a swing at me, but I blocked his blow as easily as if he’d been moving through water. Then he went to call out for some help from his friends, but I gave him a sharp shake, glared into his eyes, and said, “I wouldn’t if I were you.” “Let’s go look at the moon on the other side of the ship,” Emily said, placing her small hand on my arm. “Come on, Lucas. I think we should go.” I was confused for a moment as to why Emily had referred to me as Lucas. But then I realized that she didn’t want the young man to know my real name. Emily had obviously inherited my mother’s good head, along with her beauty. Knowing it was the smart thing to do; I released the young man and allowed my sister to lead me away, her arm looped through mine. Having her next to me was more helpful than she could have ever realized. All I wanted to do was go back to the young man and tear out his throat. “I think we should go back to our cabin,” Emily said in a subdued voice, once we were away from the crowd. “That’s probably a good idea,” I told her, my teeth clenched together. As soon as we’d crossed the threshold to the stateroom, I rushed to my cabin to have another few gulps of blood. I felt like I could barely contain myself and I knew I desperately needed to calm down. But when I checked the sink in my tiny bathroom, the quart bottle had been emptied, rinsed and set out on the counter. I stared at the empty bottle for several seconds. Who would do such a thing? “Mrs. Denkler,” I called rushing back to our shared room. I had seen her sitting on a small couch as we’d entered our quarters. When she looked up from her needlework I asked, “Who has been in the cabin since we left?” “Just the maid,” she said, completely unconcerned. “Why?” “Did she go into my room?” I asked, ignoring her question. “She took some towels in there,” was her reply. “Did she take something? Is anything missing?” “How long was she in my room?” I persisted. “Just a few moments, I think,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I don’t know for sure because I was changing when she let herself in. All I did was peek out the door and she told me that you had requested more towels.” “I didn’t request towels,” I said in a stern voice. Mrs. Denkler went back to her needlework. “I guess she must have confused our cabin with somebody else’s.” Chapter 11 Colette As the spring weather began to warm the ground, I found an excuse to visit the construction site every couple of days. The castle was magically growing before my eyes. The exterior of the building was complete. As the stonemasons departed for parts unknown, electricians, carpenters and gardeners arrived. It was rumored that a whole crew of Italian craftsmen had been brought in just lay down the parquet floors. This meant that there was less activity outside the castle, but I could hear hammering inside the building, and men calling out to each other in various languages. “Why do you always want to go look at that dreary old fortress?” Lilly asked me one afternoon as I was heading off on my bicycle for another visit. “I think it’s going to end up looking surprisingly ugly. And just so drab. Don’t you?” “Oh, no,” I told her. “I think it’s romantic. I mean, just imagine, a couple of hundred years ago knights in armor would have ridden right up to the castle door. Ladies in Waiting would have woven tapestries to cover the walls.” I wondered if any of the original furniture from the castle had survived and if the Vanderlind family still owned any of it. Now that was something I would have loved to see. “So that’s why you like it? For the history lesson.” Lilly smiled and shook her head. “You’re a funny kind of girl.” I didn’t correct my sister, but she hadn’t exactly gotten it right. I did love history, but that wasn’t why I was so captivated by the castle. It was more about the feeling I had in my chest whenever I was near the building; a kind of tickling or buzzing that I couldn’t explain. There was something magical about the castle that I felt deep in my soul, but I didn’t know how to put into words. And maybe part of me didn’t want to put into words. There are some things a girl wants to keep to herself, thoughts not even to be shared with a dearly loved sister. My father also found himself drawn to the castle, but his interest was for professional reasons. He was the best builder in town, but he’d never been offered once day’s work at the castle. That hurt his pride, but it didn’t prevent him from being curious about the construction. Whenever he had a little free time, we would ride out in our car together to see the progress that had been made. Lilly and Mama rarely went, but I was always happy to accompany him. My father was a cordial man and people were usually happy to speak with him. If he found a worker who understood English, he could usually strike up a conversation. I was always eager to listen in. I felt almost a mania to glean as many details as I could about the castle. One afternoon my father discovered that the men who were putting in the rose garden were all from Great Britain. “You’re not from Hungary?” he asked, somewhat surprised. “Wasn’t the garden part of the original house? I thought the family had the shrubs and topiary shipped over as well.” “No. You’ve been misinformed,” a man with thin legs and a round belly told him while leaning on the end of his shovel. I got the impression he wanted a break from his labor. “This place never had a proper English rose garden. But I guess the lady of the house always wanted one.” “And what better way to get a proper English garden than to have one planted by proper Englishmen,” my father said with a smile. “That’s right.” The man smiled in return, exposing a large set of yellow teeth. “The lads and I thought it might be a bit of an adventure. Plus the money was right. We brought the rose bushes with us and everything. Most of them fared the voyage without complaint.” Then he added in an aside, “The roses, not the lads. We had a bit of rough weather.” “It must be nice to be able to order the creation of an entire formal garden on a whim,” my father observed, half to himself. “Yes, there must be more money than Midas behind those walls,” the gardener agreed, eyeing the castle. “Imagine wanting to move to this tiny town in the middle of nowhere.” Then he realized we were more than likely inhabitants of Tiburon, so he quickly added, “Not that the town doesn’t have its charms.” His face went rather pink. “But you always think of rich people as living in London, or Paris. New York, even. Not a small town in the middle of Iowa.” “Ohio,” my father said, correcting him, but keeping his voice genial. “I supposed they want a bit of privacy,” the man said, taking off a heavy work glove and scratching beneath his nose. “I hear that they pretty much like to keep to themselves.” “I guess they won’t be attending any town hall meetings,” Papa joked. “But I suppose the very rich don’t like to dirty their hands.” “Not like me and the lads,” the gardener said, slipping on his glove again as if he’d just remembered he had work to do. “Still, it’d be nice to get a peek inside, when the old gal is done,” he said, eyeing the castle once more. “I don’t suppose they’ll be holding tours.” “If they do, I’ll be the first in line,” my father assured him. “Is the family going to be arriving soon?” I asked. The castle was pretty much devoid of windows, so it was impossible to get a sense of the comings and goings of anyone inside. “Not that I know of, Miss,” he told me, his face rather serious. “Although, from what I’ve heard from some of the I-talian fellows, the family isn’t very nice. In fact, there were one or two stories that could stand a grown man’s hair on end, if anyone was to believe them.” Papa cleared his throat. “I’m not sure it’s right to start rumors about a family before they’ve even driven into town,” he said with a note a censure. The man shrugged. “It’s hard to have a big house like this, and all the money that goes with it, and not at least stir up a few rumors.” Turning his attention back to me, he leaned forward a little and gave me a stern look. “I hope you aren’t expecting a prince charming to go along with the castle as a matched set.” I immediately felt my face go red and I placed a hand to my cheek. My father stepped slightly in front of me, as if to shield me from the gardener’s impertinence. “My daughter enjoys studying history,” he informed the man. “I think she’s just hoping for some more facts about the castle’s past.” The man nodded, his expression growing sober. “Just as long as she remembers that sometimes where there’s smoke, there’s fire.” His eyes became thoughtful. “Or blood, as the I-talians tell it.” I was grateful for my father’s protection, and I did enjoy history, but I still felt the humiliation of being thought of as some silly school girl longing for a prince to move into the neighborhood and notice her. I probably felt doubly embarrassed because maybe the man’s assessment of me hinted at the truth. I couldn’t help but wonder about the stories being spread by the Italian workers. And what expression did they have in Italy about blood? I glanced around, wondering when the Italians took their coffee break and if there was any way I could speaking with one of them. When we returned home that evening, Lilly was sitting on the front steps waiting for us. “Hello Papa,” she said, springing up to give our father a kiss as he climbed the stairs. “Hello, Lettie,” she said, giving me a squeeze, her face all smiles. “What’s going on?” I asked, returning her smile with a suspicious glance. She usually wasn’t quite that much of a welcoming committee. “Oh, it’s nothing,” she said, but she could hardly suppress her smile. “It’s just that Lev Wilson bought a new car. From the White Motor Company. He and Walter just drove it all the way down from Cleveland.” I had to admit, I was impressed that Lev could afford a car. Especially a new one. It made me wonder where he got his money. “How can he afford that?” I had to ask. “From his work, of course,” Lilly said, giving me a small frown. “Oh,” I said with a nod. It was too embarrassing to admit that I had no idea what Lev did for a living. I was sure he had told me, I just hadn’t bothered to listen. “Did he buy it on credit or something?” I asked. He was still a young man and didn’t have a college education, so I doubted he made that much money. Lilly frowned again and shrugged as she trailed me into the house. “That really isn’t something I could ask.” “And just why, exactly, are you bringing all this up?” our father asked as he shrugged out of his jacket. “Well…” Lilly paused for a moment as she gathered her nerve. “Lev and Walter invited Lettie and me to go for a drive after dinner tomorrow,” she blurted. “Just to see the new car, of course.” Papa frowned. “Haven’t you been seeing an awful lot of Walter?” “Not really,” Lilly insisted. “Not an awful lot. In fact, not very much at all.” Mama had walked into the room while we were talking. “Another date with Walter,” she exclaimed. “I hope you two aren’t getting too serious.” “Well, I like him very much, if that’s what you mean,” Lilly said. And then her face flushed a little, “But just so you know, Walter has always been a gentleman.” “I’m glad to hear it,” Mama said, taking our father’s coat and folding it over her arm. “That’s just how a young man should behave.” “That’s how any man should behave,” Papa felt the need to add. “So can we go?” Lilly asked, her eyes shining with excitement. “Just a short drive.” Glancing over at me, she added, “Maybe out to see the castle. I know Colette likes that kind of stuff.” “Your sister was just at the castle with me,” Papa informed her. “Oh, but I’m sure she wouldn't mind going again tomorrow.” She looked eagerly in my direction. “Would you, Lettie?” I had no desire to see Lev Wilson again, but I was already itching to get back to the castle. “I guess I wouldn’t mind,” I said. “As long as it’s just for an hour.” I thought I could put up with anyone’s company for an hour. Lilly bounced up and down and then gave me a hug. “I hope you realize that your mother and I haven’t given our approval yet,” Papa said, his voice stern. Lilly stopped bouncing. “Oh, please,” she said, sounding as if she was Cinderella about to be denied admission to the ball. “I promise it will only be for a half an hour. Maybe an hour at the most.” Our mother and father exchanged looks. “I’m not sure I approve of you riding around in cars with boys,” Mama said. “But if Walter is the gentleman that you claim, then I suppose it’s alright by me, if it’s alright with your father.” Lilly clasped her hands together and turned to look at Papa. “It’s fine, as long as your sister’s with you,” Papa said. “But I want those boys to come inside so I can look them both in the eye again. Most young men remember to mind their p’s and q’s when they know that a father is keeping a close eye on his daughters.” “Well of course they’ll come in,” Lilly said. “Walter would insist on that, anyway.” Lilly hurried off to call her beau and I started setting the table for dinner. I was reluctant to see Lev again, but I could probably just block out his words while gazing at the castle. Plus I desperately wanted to speak to one of the Italian carpenters about the Vanderlinds. What were the hair-raising stories about the new family moving into town? Chapter 12 Jessie Mrs. Denkler went with Emily to the dining room for dinner, but I ordered a meal to be delivered to my room. I intended to try to show up for a few meals with the general public, if only to please my sister and to give the appearance of being mortal, but I was too riled up from my encounter on deck to attempt a meal that night. I ordered a steak, extra rare, along with roasted potatoes, greens and a bottle of wine. I didn’t go overboard on the wine. I knew I had to order a good vintage to keep up appearances, but I saw no reason to spend a lot of money, when all I was going to do was pour it down the drain. I did think for a moment to offer the bottle to Mrs. Denkler, but then changed my mind. She was in charge of my little sister, after all. I didn’t want to give her an excuse to get tipsy. After Emily and her temporary governess had returned from their meal and gone to bed, I sat up reading. I was still unused to my new hours of existence. I didn’t know how to give up my days and find ways to fill my nights. As the hour dragged on past midnight and most of the ship’s passengers had gone to bed, I went up on deck to have a look around. The night was mild and the skies were very clear. The Milky Way was on full display and I took a moment to marvel at the beauty of the heavens. “Are you having trouble sleeping too?” I heard a familiar voice ask me. I looked up to see that my mother had also decided upon a late-night stroll. “Oh…” I stammered for a moment before I realized that we weren’t supposed to know each other. “Yes,” I managed. “I know many people find the gentle rocking of a boat sleep-inducing, but it has the opposite effect on me.” Mother gave a gentle laugh. “I suffer from the same malady, I’m afraid.” Then she turned her head slightly, just enough to let me know that she had heard something or sensed someone else on deck. Taking a moment to focus, I had to agree with her. I could definitely smell the hormonal-laced musk of an adolescent male close at hand. “Did you enjoy the ship’s departure?” I asked, just for something to say so it wouldn’t look awkward with us both just standing there. “I found it quite exhilarating,” she told me with a gentle smile. “Begging your pardon,” a voice said. We both turned to see a young cabin boy who had stepped out of the shadows. His hair was a crown of golden ringlets and his eyes were wide and a brilliant shade of blue. By any standard, he was remarkably beautiful, even though his eyes were crusted slightly with sleep. “Would either of you fine people be needing anything?” I saw my mother suppress a smirk. The boy had obviously been asleep somewhere in a dark corner and was concerned that he might have been discovered shirking his duties. “I am perfectly comfortable,” my mother told him. “Thank you for asking.” Turning to me, she added, “Anything for you, Mr.…?” She let her words hang in the air, seeing that ostensibly we had not been introduced. “Vanderlind,” I told her, suppressing a smile of my own. “Jessie Vanderlind.” My mother provided her false names and we exchanged how-do-you-dos. Then mother turned to the cabin boy and said, “And what is your name, young man?” The cabin boy looked startled for a moment and then said, “I am Christian Franzen, Ma’am. How do you do?” “How do you do?” Mother replied. Christian Franzen stood there for a moment, feeling awkward and unsure of what to do next. “It was nice meeting both of you,” he told us, “but I suppose I’d better be getting back to work.” After he’d hurried off, my mother remarked in a low voice, “What a beautiful young man. His features are quite striking. Did you see the color of his eyes?” “There was no missing them,” I had to admit. The boy’s beauty was hard to ignore. “Blue,” Mother said, a bit wistfully. “A clear blue, like the sky on a perfect day.” Then in a voice that was hardly audible she whispered, “I do hope your grandfather doesn’t catch a glimpse of him. That could only lead to trouble.” “It is a rather lovely night,” I said, making a show of looking at the stars in the sky. There was the gentle sound of footsteps approaching and I meant to give my mother warning in case she hadn’t heard them. “I should probably return to my cabin now or my husband will wonder where I’ve got off to,” Mother said. “It’s was very nice speaking with you. I hope you have a good night.” As she turned and left, an elderly couple approached, walking slowly, arm-in-arm. Part of me wondered why they were up at such an hour. And another part of me mourned that I would never have the chance to grow old with someone that I loved. The little French maid continued to be persistent in her quest to be of service to Mrs. Denkler, my sister and me. Emily reported that she had knocked on our door twice the next day. She even had the temerity to ask if she could check with me directly to see if I needed anything, even though Denkie had told her I was resting. Resting was not an accurate description of what I was doing in my oversized trunk. I couldn’t lie down completely straight and that made it a challenge to get comfortable. I tried not to thrash around too much because I didn’t know if there happened to be anyone lurking in my cabin. I didn’t want a maid or cabin boy to wonder about the rustling in Mr. Vanderlind’s enormous trunk. Emily tried reading to me to pass the time for both of us. After the initial excitement, she found life aboard ship too sedentary. I could have just as easily taken a book into the trunk with me, but it hadn’t occurred to me when I’d climbed in for the day. Turning my mind off was the problem. We vampires didn’t exactly sleep; we went into a state of repose that was supposed to be similar to deep meditation. At least that was what I had been told. So far I hadn’t been able to find any type of repose, sleep, meditation or otherwise. Eventually my sister became restless. “Would you mind if I went up on deck?” she asked, her voice apologetic. “Just for a little while. There’s shuffleboard up there and…” Her voice faded. I could tell she was trying to decide if she was being selfish. “Emily, don’t worry about me,” I told her. “I’ll be fine. You go and enjoy yourself. It’s what I want you to do. And take old Denkie with you. She could use some fresh air.” Emily giggled. She loved when I referred to Mrs. Denkler in this way. “I won’t be long,” she assured me and I could hear her getting to her feet. “Take as long as you like,” I insisted. “It’s not like I’ll be up and about until nightfall.” After Emily and Mrs. Denkler went out, I tried to turn my thoughts off and just focus on nothing. But my life had gone through so many changes in the last week that it made it almost an impossible thing to do. Even so, after an extended period of frustration, I eventually found myself starting slip into the void. That was until I heard somebody in my room. I was immediately jerked into consciousness by the slight creak of hinges being opened. Who was out there? I couldn’t begin to imagine. It wasn’t Emily or Mrs. Denkler. Of that I was convinced. Neither one of them had any cause to sneak into my cabin. Perhaps one them was looking for something and trying not to disturb me. I gave that idea some thought. But then I heard the light clinking of bottles and I was filled with rage. The only bottles I had in my room were my food supply. Why was someone rifling through my trunk? Was it the same person who had dumped the first bottle? Was he back to finish the job? I felt an impotent rage. I wanted to burst from my trunk and confront the scoundrel, but that was a bad idea for numerous reasons. There was nothing I could do but sit there, not making a sound, and hope the person was not doing what I suspected he might be doing. The bottles eventually stopped rattling, but then a more alarming sound reached my ears. It was someone trying to open the very trunk that contained me. He was fiddling with the lock. I froze, afraid even the slightest movement might give me away. The thief struggled with the lock for several minutes. Then there was the sound of a door opening and closing. I could hear the voices of Mrs. Denkler and my sister. The person standing outside my sleeping trunk instantly grew very quiet. And then I could hear him walking lightly across the room. I made a vow that if whoever was out there tried to hurt Emily or Denkie in any way, I would burst from my makeshift coffin and dispatch the thief to the great beyond. I thought I could probably cause their demise before the sun burnt me to cinders. Even with this resolve, I understood that even the smallest bit of sunlight was excruciatingly painful to a member of the undead. But it was a horror I would have to face in order to protect my family. Emily and Mrs. Denkler must have gone into their cabin for a moment because their voices grew more muffled, but they didn’t sound agitated in any way. I strained my ears in my custom-made prison for any sound that might indicate a struggle. All I heard was soft footsteps crossing the floor and the sound of a door being quietly pulled open and then shut again. With the click of the latch, I felt myself relax slightly. Whoever had been snooping meant my family no harm. The person was probably just a petty thief looking for easily concealable items. Several hours later, I felt the ease that comes over all vampires with the setting of the sun. While I waited a few minutes for the last rays of the day to dwindle, I listened for sounds of anyone being in the cabin that shouldn’t have been there. And then, feeling reasonably sure I had taken all necessary precautions, I popped the interior locks on my trunk and opened the lid. No one was in my cabin. That gave me some relief. I peeked out the door to glimpse Denkie and my sister reading books in our shared living space. They both looked perfectly fine. Then I turned to see what was missing from my room. A watch and chain, a pair of gold nail scissors, and a pearl lapel pin had all disappeared off of my bureau. These were annoying losses, but nothing to cause me great regret. I had shipped anything of real value when the contents of the castle were sent over. Taking a fortifying breath, I turned my attentions to my true concern; the trunk holding my food for the next few days. The lid was closed and I was reluctant to open it. But whatever had happened, I had to face it. Flipping open the lid, I surveyed the eleven bottles that had been so carefully packed. They were all empty. Someone had snuck into my cabin and drained every single one. Chapter 13 Colette “Good evening, Mr. Gibson,” Walter Bennett said. I could tell he was using his very best manners. “Mrs. Gibson.” There was a big smile on his face and he couldn’t stop from looking in Lilly’s direction. It struck me for the first time that my sister and Walter might be in love. It was more than likely what older people referred to as “young love” but that probably didn’t keep it from feeling any less real to them. “Good evening, Sir,” Lev said, shaking Papa’s hand. He was obviously part of the good-manner’s club. “Mrs. Gibson,” he said with a nod to our mother. “Good evening, boys,” Mama said. “That’s quite a bruise you’ve got there,” Papa said, referencing a purple discoloration and a small plaster high on Lev’s left cheek. Lev’s hand self-consciously flew up to gingerly touch his injury. “Nothing much,” he said rather quickly. “I was roughhousing with some friends and there was a little accident.” “Was anyone else hurt?” our mother asked, immediately concerned. “Oh. No, it was nothing like that,” Lev assured her. “A couple of us were wrestling where we shouldn’t have been and my face got banged on the corner of a table.” He touched his cheek again and then forced his hand back down to his side. “It looks a lot worse than it is.” The four of us piled into Lev’s new car. It was shiny black and showroom new. Lilly and Walter claimed the back seat, so that left me to sit up front with Lev. “What do you think of her?” Lev asked as he started the car up. “Isn’t she a beauty?” I was a little surprised that Lev had bothered to ask me a question. But seeing that he was really fishing for a compliment, it wasn’t too much of a shock. The sun was just starting to set, so there was still a lot of daylight left. I couldn’t help but notice as Lev gripped the wheel that his right hand was purpled and slightly swollen. “Did that happen while you were roughhousing, too?” I asked, nodding toward his hand. Lev glanced at his bruises and then shot me a rueful grin. “You could say something like that.” I wasn’t sure what to make of his comment, but I didn’t feel the urge to dig for details. If Lev had gotten into a fight with one of his friends, then that had nothing to do with me. And if afterward, they had decided to patch things up and just call it roughhousing, then that was their business, not mine. All I was obligated to do was be polite and go see the castle. Lev drove his car with surprising caution, keeping under the speed limit and being considerate of other motorists. He even showed remarkable patience when a farmer pulled his tractor out onto the road ahead of us and we had to inch along for several minutes until the man turned off the main road and onto a dirt one. I began to wonder if I’d misjudged Lev. Maybe he was just nervous during our first date. Male animals in the jungle were known to show off colorful plumage or magnificent manes to attract a mate. Maybe Lev’s constant bragging was just his ill-judged attempted to impress me. I decided I should at least try to give him another chance. When we reached the dirt road turnoff that led to the castle, Lev used additional caution, moving the car forward at a pace that was even slower than the tractor that had blocked our way. “Don’t want to scratch her,” Lev told me. “Her paint’s barely dry.” “Gee!” Lilly exclaimed when the castle finally came into view. “It’s just so massive.” I turned in my seat to look at her. It occurred to me that my sister probably hadn’t seen the castle much since the first day when the family had headed down to watch the barges come in. Or, if she’d gone with Papa, she’d been too busy daydreaming about Walter to notice any progress the workers had made. She wrinkled her nose. “It’s not very pretty, though.” “Most castles weren’t built to be beautiful,” Lev told her. “They were built to withstand a siege.” And then he added, “There are some pretty castles in Bavaria, though. My uncle travelled there when I was a kid and he sent me a lot of postcards. Really magical stuff. Straight out of the fairytales.” Thinking it over for a few seconds, he added, “I’d like to travel there one day.” My opinion of Lev was growing by leaps and bounds. But then he had to go and ruin it all by saying, “I’m descended from royal blood, of course.” No one in the car made a response to his comment. It just sounded like such a ridiculous exaggeration that I thought it would be better to ignore it. “If I showed my face in Europe, they’d probably try to clap a crown on my head,” Lev told us, just to make matters worse. “Is that what they did to your uncle?” Walter asked, causing my sister to giggle. “Well, he was invited to visit many of the royal houses,” Lev snapped, unwilling to just let it go. “Royalty recognizes royalty, even if it’s a distant connection.” I had promised myself to just sit there and bide my time through the date, but it was just too much. I really couldn’t let Lev keep bragging like he was next in line for the throne of England. “So what’s your lineage?” I asked him. “What?” Lev gave me a sharp look. “What is your heritage?” I wanted to know. “Which royal families are you descended from and how did you end up here, in America?” “That’s right, Lev,” Walter jeered. “Tell us your family tree.” The sunlight was almost gone, but I could see Lev growing pink under the collar. “I’ll have to ask my grandfather,” he said in a clenched voice. “He’s the family historian.” “Let’s get out and walk around a little before the sun goes completely down,” I suggested, in part to end the conversation and in part because I wanted to see if any of the Italian workmen were still lingering around the castle. “Sure,” Walter agreed. “Lev, why don’t you knock on the door? Introduce yourself. Let them know who you are.” “Alright, cut out the smart talk,” Lev growled, flashing his friend a menacing look. The smile quickly faded from Walter’s face. “Yeah. Sorry,” he said. “I was just joshing you.”",

      "content": "We walked for a little while in silence, skirting around the unfinished areas that were still mostly mud. The rose garden was nearing completion, with neat, short hedges making squares and rectangles around each bush. “Our father was speaking with one of the gardeners yesterday,” I said to whoever cared to listen. “Both the plants and the gardeners were shipped over from England.” “I thought this pile of bricks was supposed to be Hungarian or something,” Walter said, trying to revive the jovial mood. “It is. But just not the garden,” I said, glancing over my shoulder at him. That’s when I realized that Walter and my sister had their arms around each other. In an instant I knew that suggesting we all get out of the car was a mistake. Walter and Lilly were just looking for an excuse to find a cozy, dark corner where they could canoodle. Besides going against everything Lilly had told our folks, it would leave me alone with Lev. And who knew where his ideas might lead? I didn’t want to inadvertently put Lev in a situation where he thought kissing me was a good idea. I had to get out of there, and fast. Lev Wilson was not going to be my first kiss, if I had anything to say about it. “Oh, we’d better get going,” I said after pretending to check the time. “Don’t want to be late.” “You don’t need to hurry off that quickly, do you?” Lev said, trying to catch my hand. He must have also been aware of Walter and my sister’s intentions. “We do if we don’t want to get grounded,” I insisted, eluding him by taking a few quick steps. “Our father won’t tolerate any kind of nonsense,” I said, hoping he would catch my double meaning. “Come on, Lettie,” Lilly said, her voice carrying a bit of a whine. “We can stay a few more minutes.” “No, we can’t,” I said, allowing my own voice to carry the firmness of my convictions. I had been foolish to agree to an evening drive to an isolated area, even if my sister was with me. “We need to start heading back to the car,” I told her. “Now.” I loved my sister dearly, but enough was enough. “She’s probably right,” I could hear Walter say as I started walking rather briskly. “It’s time to go. I wouldn’t want your father to dislike me.” Then I heard Lev give a scoffing laugh. Chapter 14 Jessie I couldn’t stop staring at the empty bottles of blood. Who would do such a thing? I couldn’t conceive of what would have motivated a thief to such mischief. Whoever had done it must have known that I was a member of the undead. What other possible reason would they have to break into my cabin and dispose of my only food supply? Getting to New York would be a tremendous test of my self-control and I wasn’t sure if I was up to the challenge. The word “test” made me think of my grandfather. This was just the kind of thing he would set up in order to help me “build character”. He felt that Daniel and I were too soft; that our mother coddled us. He also felt that I was ungrateful for my undead transformation. I looked upon being turned into a vampire as a hardship, but he viewed it as the greatest gift he could bestow on another human. After giving it a bit of thought, I decided that disposing of the blood was probably Grandfather’s way of punishing me for my ingratitude. I quickly became convinced that he had hired someone to break into my cabin and get rid of my food. He probably told the criminal to rob me as well, as a measly cover story. Or maybe that was just something the thief thought up on his own, since he was already in my cabin and pawing through my things. Grandfather apparently did not warn the thief not to open the oversized trunk. Or, knowing my grandfather, he had instructed his minion to search the trunk for some nonexistent item. That would serve the dual purpose of forcing me to take a mortal life and probably save Grandfather the couple of coins he’d promised in payment. Thankfully that last part of the plan was foiled. Hurriedly, I checked my valise and was relieved to find that the two pints I had stashed in there had not been disturbed. That was a small blessing. I was already feeling edgy from not having eaten and I needed to slake my appetite before I attempted to send word to my mother about what had happened. I knew she had packed enough blood so that sharing wouldn’t cause her any hardship. Emily tapped at my door and then let herself in. “We’re going up to dinner soon, if you’d like to join us,” she told me. And then stopped short, catching sight of all the empty bottles. “What happened?” “I don’t know,” I told her. “Someone broke into my room while I was resting and this is what they did.” “But who would do such a thing?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She had walked into my cabin behind my sister. If I had been speaking to my mother, I would have voiced my suspicions. But Denkie was loyal to our family’s patriarch and I knew any words that passed from my lips would go straight to my grandfather’s ears. “I have no idea,” I said. “Someone who didn’t understand that they were putting everyone on this ship in mortal danger, I suppose.” Mrs. Denkler’s mouth twitched. “It will be a test of your fortitude,” she told me. “Would you like me to check the ship’s passenger list to see who is likely to be traveling alone?” Emily gave our housekeeper a startled look. “That won’t be necessary,” I assured her. “I’ll have to think things over, but I might just ask you to get a message to my mother.” I looked between the two of them. “For the moment, let’s just keep this incident to ourselves.” Frowning, Mrs. Denkler said, “Of course.” Was the Vanderlind housekeeper aware of my grandfather’s plan? It seemed very unlikely. I knew Grandfather confided in her about many things, but he was too wily to share this type of plans with a mortal. I took a few, careful pulls of blood from one of the pint bottles. It allowed me to focus on solving my predicament rather than thinking about my hunger or allowing my anger to take control of me. I didn’t want to upset my mother unnecessarily. I knew she would come to the same conclusion I had about the disposed of blood. And she already had an adversarial relationship with her father as it was. None of the passengers would benefit from witnessing two vampires battling on the deck of the ship. Plus, my grandfather was much more powerful. If he truly lost control of his temper, then he might actually stake my mother in the heat of battle. No, the best thing I could do for the health of my family was not mention the loss of my food supply. Vampires could go for days without eating, as long as they were careful. I just had to keep myself away from mortals and ration the blood I had left. It would be necessary for me to not leave my cabin for the rest of the trip, day or night. That would keep me away from temptation and the rest of the ship’s passengers safe from me. At first things went smoothly, I had several good books to keep me occupied. When my sister and Mrs. Denkler came back from dinner, I explained that I definitely did not wish for either of them to communicate my troubles to anyone else in the family. Emily was upset by my decision, but Denkie said, “That’s probably for the best.” Things became more of a struggle once the two of them went to bed. My cabin began to feel claustrophobic, so I moved into our shared room, just for a change of scenery. Even with this transition, I felt almost an irresistible urge to go up on deck. But I knew people were still out and about, plus my hunger was increasing. The last time I had a sip from the open pint, I realized that half the contents was already gone. I knew I had to be more conservative when I fed or I would end up having to tell Mrs. Denkler to chain me in my trunk for the remainder of the voyage. As the hour drew close to midnight, I heard someone tapping at the door. Out of habit, my first impulse was to answer it. But then I remembered the state I was in and immediately withdrew into my cabin. Before I knew what was happening, the little French maid who had been such a charming nuisance the previous evening was letting herself into my room. “Hello?” she said, her cheeks aglow. “You called for more towels?” “No, I didn’t call for towels,” I told her in a tight voice. “And I think it advisable that you leave. Right now.” “Do you really want me to go?” she asked, tucking her chin and looking up at me with large blue eyes that had been rimmed in charcoal. “Yes,” I told her firmly. “That’s why I said it.” “But what about your towels?” she asked, stepping further into my cabin. “I never asked for any damn towels,” I insisted, inching past her and heading for the door. I could smell every fragrance of her body in such a confined space and it was making me drool. “But Monsieur,” she said, reluctantly following me as I led her into the main cabin. “I brought them especially for you.” She stepped very close to me and tilted her head back to look up into my eyes. I wanted to show her to the door, but I couldn’t. She was so young and beautiful, and she smelled so good. Her eyes were wide and innocent, but no one was that naive. She obviously wanted me to kiss her. But kissing wasn’t what I had in mind. At least not a mortal kiss. It would have been so easy just to bend her head to the side and expose the tender flesh of her neck. I felt my stomach give a painful growl at the mere thought of it. “Is there nothing else you want from me, Monsieur?” she asked, blinking her wide blue eyes very slowly. “Nothing at all that I can do for you?” “No,” I told her, and my voice came out like a creaking door. “I’m fine. I appreciate your…” I couldn’t even think of what to say. I cleared my throat. “I appreciate your concern for my comfort, but I think I would… I mean, I think you should just leave. Now. Please,” I gulped. “You do not like me?” she said with a hint of a pout. “No, that’s not it at all,” I assured her. “It’s just…” I was clinging to my humanity by the skin of my teeth. “Maybe you would like to get to know me a little bit better?” she suggested. Her voice turned sultry and her French accent faded away. “That is something that could be arranged.” She glanced down at her bosom and then looked back up at me. “No…” I began to say. And then the French maid did something to seal her fate. She reached forward and placed one of her hands on my chest. “Why not?” That’s when I grabbed her. I couldn’t control myself. A small part of my brain was shouting at her, “No! Get out of here! Run for your very life.” But it was too late for that. The evil that was brewing inside of me took over. I had meant to be so strong, but I was lost. Rather than struggling, the maid melted into my arms. “Oh, Monsieur,” she said with a sigh, her accent suddenly returning. “I do not think I can resist you. I have never done anything like this before. But if I give way to you, I trust that you will take care of me. Yes?” But I wasn’t thinking about anything that warranted her trusting me. In fact, I was thinking the exact opposite. Every fiber of my being wanted to drain her and toss the husk of her body over the side of the ship, never to be heard from again. “I’ll take care of you,” I whispered, pulling some tendrils of her hair to one side and fully exposing her neck. That’s when the cabin door burst open. Several burly men charged into the cabin. One of them looked me directly in the face and shouted, “Vampire!” Chapter 15 Colette “I’m mad at you,” Lilly said, thrusting her chin into the air and turning away from me. I already knew she was mad at me. It was obvious from the way she had been storming around our room all evening, picking up books, slamming them down again, and sighing quite dramatically. It wasn’t behavior she could exhibit in front of our mother and father at dinner, but just the two of us in the room we shared was a different story. “Yes, I know that,” I told her. That caught her up for a moment. “Well don’t you want to know why?” “I think I probably already know,” I said, although mostly to myself. “It’s because of the way you’re treating Lev,” she said without really hearing me. “No it’s not,” was my reply. We’d gone driving with the boys the evening before and I was still irritated. If anything, I was the one who should have been mad at her. “It’s because you wanted to stay and canoodle in the moonlight with Walter and I wanted to go home.” I sat down at the dressing table we shared, picked up a brush and started trying to tame my hair. “Well…” she stammered, “that too, but I also think you’re also being very rude to Lev.” “No I’m not,” I said quietly. “He really likes you,” she insisted. “No he doesn’t,” I told her, giving up on the brush and combing my hair with my fingers. “He doesn’t know me. I think he’s just interested in me because I’m a challenge. If I was all gah-gah for him, I’m sure he’d suddenly find that he likes a different girl.” “That’s still no reason to be rude to him,” Lilly grumbled. “It’s no reason to kiss him either,” I told her. “I could see where things were going and I didn’t want any part of it. You know, you don’t always have to do what a boy wants you to,” I told her. She shrugged. “I know. But Lev is so handsome,” she said, sinking onto her bed. “Don’t you think he’s very good looking?” “I’m sure if I saw his picture in a magazine, I might think that,” I told her. “But he’s not very nice and I really think he’s a bit of a bully.” I remembered the menacing look he had given Lilly’s date after just a slight ribbing. “I’m surprised Walter would want to be his friend.” “They’ve know each other forever,” Lilly said. “Walter thinks of him more like a brother.” “How do you think he got that bruise on his cheek?” I asked. It was a question that had been tugging at the back of my mind. Frowning, Lilly said, “Didn’t he say he was roughhousing with some friends and banged into a table?” “Sure, but that must have been some very rough roughhousing. His knuckles were all bruised and his hands were swollen.” “Really?” Lilly said, absentmindedly. “I hadn’t noticed.” “I bet.” My sister only had eyes for Walter. When he was around, a falling star could land at her feet and she probably wouldn’t even notice. “So I think you should go out with him again, just to make it up to him,” Lilly blurted rather quickly. “What?” She’d caught me off guard with that one. “You know, so he doesn’t think you dislike him or anything.” “But I do dislike him,” I told her. “As a matter of fact, I dislike him very much. I’d be perfectly happy if I never see him again.” Lilly got up to stand behind me so that we were both reflected in the mirror. “Isn’t that was Elizabeth says about Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice right before she falls in love with him?” “Lev Wilson is no Mr. Darcy,” I informed her. To me that was abundantly clear. “But you’re Elizabeth,” she said, gathering my hair in her hands. “You’re definitely the beauty of the family. That’s why Lev likes you so much, I guess.” “Jane was the beauty of the family,” I corrected her. “Elizabeth was the one who made the pert remarks.” That made Lilly smile. “So the analogy still holds,” she said with a laugh. I turned in my chair to look at her directly. “But seriously, Lilly, I really do not enjoy Lev Wilson’s company. I’m sorry if it makes things more challenging for Walter and you, but I will never agree to go on another date with his majesty again.” Lilly flopped back on her bed. “Do you really think he’s related to royalty?” she asked. This made me laugh. “Sure, in the same way that we’re all related to Adam and Eve.” “Oh.” Lilly frowned. “I really don’t think he’d lie about something like that. Do you?” I wanted to say that I though Lev Wilson would say it was day when it was pitch black outside, but instead I replied, “I think that Lev is maybe prone to exaggerations.” Gross exaggerations, to be more exact, but I didn’t say that part out loud. “I still don’t know why you don’t like him.” Lilly went back to her bed to have another moment to sulk. “Lilly, I’m afraid I just don’t.” I got up from my chair and walked over to her. “Please respect my feelings and stopped trying to fix us up. You’ll only make everyone miserable.” “Okay,” she finally relented. “How about another date with Herschel?” When I gave her a flat look, she quickly added, “Or maybe Walter could introduce you to another one of his friends.” I sighed. “Lilly, the next time you want to go out with Walter, I’ll go as your chaperone and just read a book. But please stop trying to fix me up with one of his friends.” Shaking her head, Lilly said, “You’re a funny kind of girl. You’re so pretty you could date any boy in town, but instead you spend all of your time with your nose in a book.” I couldn’t help but shrug. “I guess that’s just who I am. And probably who I’ll always be.” Chapter 16 Jessie The French maid let out a shriek and I thrust her from my arms as more men came barreling into the room. They were brandishing makeshift wooden stakes that they’d procured by breaking the legs off of tables and chairs. I was trapped with nowhere to run. There was only one door and that was filled by a dozen armed men. Even if I took out of few of the angry mob, there was no way I was getting out of there without a stake through my heart. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. My life as a member of the undead would be even briefer than my life as a mortal. “What are you doing here?” the maid screeched. “Get out! Get out!” I made the decision that I would not fight them. I would allow them to kill me without a struggle. There would be no blood on my hands as I went to meet the world’s maker. “Grab a stake or anything you have made out of wood,” one of the young men shouted at me. I recognized him immediately as the ruddy faced youth who had been impertinent to my sister. “There’s a vampire aboard the ship,” he said. “He’s lured one of the crew to his cabin and is feeding off the poor soul right now.” I just stood there, frozen to the spot, trying to take it all in. “A vampire?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes!” the man shouted. “They exist. And there’s one aboard this ship. Arm yourself and hurry up. I doubt the creature will go down without a fight.” “I…” I stammered. “I’m with you.” “Good,” the young man told me. “We need every able bodied man we can find. And we don’t have a minute to lose.” Then, turning to the rest of the mob, he shouted, “Let’s go!” The crowd turned as a unit and surged away from the door. I stumbled after them, absentmindedly grabbing a corkscrew on my way out the door. It wasn’t made out of wood. I’m not even sure why I grabbed it beyond the fact that the ruddy faced young man had instructed me to grab a weapon. “What’s going on?” Emily asked. The noise from the mob had woken her and she looked sleep-tousled, her eyes wide with fright. “Everything is fine,” I assured her, even though it was obviously a lie. One of our family had been discovered and was about to face a horrible death. But there was no reason to drag poor Emily into it. I didn’t want her to see one of us getting staked. Especially if the hapless individual happened to be our mother. “Just stay in your cabin,” I told her. “Lock the door.” As I hurried behind the mob, I called over my shoulder. “And keep the maid with you!” There was no reason for any young woman to get caught up in a bloodthirsty crowd, even a female of questionable virtue. “I’ll be fine. You can’t keep me locked in here,” the maid insisted, all remnants of her French accent giving way to something that sounded more like she hailed from Yorkshire. “Do as I say!” I shouted as I ran down the hall, on the heels of the angry mob. Which one of my family had been discovered? And would there be any way for me to save them without putting everyone’s life in danger? As we charged passed door after door of the first class cabins, I saw the face of my brother Daniel peeking out. At least I knew he wasn’t going to be the one to face the business end of a stake. That narrowed things down to either my grandfather or my mother; fifty-fifty odds for both of them. I knew I would fight to death for my mother. I couldn’t say what I would do for her father, especially if my suspicions were true about him hiring someone to dispose of my blood. My grandfather was a difficult man to love. In fact, if I was being honest, I hated him. But he was my maker and that tied me to him for eternity. The angry mob stopped outside a state room door. I had no idea if the room belonged to my mother. They banged on the door, but there was no response. Individuals yelled for a ship’s steward to open the door, but the mob was too impatient to wait. A couple of brawny young men began putting their shoulders to the door. It was well made and held out against the assault for several moments, before eventually bursting open. I had expected the crowd to surge forward, but instead they pulled back. An audible gasp was heard from most of the men who could see through the door. Everyone was so transfixed, either looking through the door or trying to look through the door, that I took a little risk and levitated several inches into the air to see over the crowd. I covered for this trick by pretending I was boosting myself up on the handle of the door across the way, but it would have been an almost impossible test of strength for a mortal. From my elevated position, I was able to see over the heads of the crowd. There was my grandfather, in the corner of the room, hunkered down like a rabid dog that had been cornered by the local sheriff. Blood dripped from the corners of his mouth, his fangs on full display. And there, slumped on the floor, was the half naked body of a boy. I recognized him immediately. It was Christian Franzen, the beautiful cabin boy who had spoken with Mother and me on the deck of the ship the previous evening. Blood was oozing from his neck and he looked very pale. He was making a faint mewing sound, like a hungry kitten. I could tell from the boy’s deathly white complexion and the deep wounds on his neck that Grandfather had intended to drain him dry. The mob had arrived just in time. “You animal,” someone shouted from the crowd. Grandfather jerked his head up. His eyes looked heavy, like those of a drunkard deep in his cups. “You peons,” he snarled, doing his best to pull himself up to his full height. “There’s nothing you can do to me. You cannot touch me.” “Get him!” several people shouted at once and the crowd surged forward. If it had been just a few men, Grandfather could have fought them, and probably won, even in his inebriated state. But the mob was too much for him. They began beating him with their makeshift stakes, the splinters from the broken table and chair legs piercing his flesh. He began to shriek in agony, but that only fueled the crowd. Quickly, I shoved my way through the masses to the limp body of Christian Franzen. People were so outraged by the assault on him, that they were willing to trample him in order to punish his molester. I pulled the cabin boy to the far corner of the room. There was the heavy scent of gin on his breath, which explained why Grandfather was acting so sluggish. The boy’s head lolled, his eyes were glassy, but he was able to focus on me for a brief moment. “Vampire,” he whispered and then he lost consciousness. The mob had seized Grandfather and was dragging him out of the cabin, all the while beating him and making him howl. I needed to save him. But Mr. Franzen was about to expire in my arms. Discretely, I punctured my fingertip with one of my fang. Once there was a bit of blood dripping from it, I stuck my finger in the cabin boy’s mouth. It only took a few moments for his eyelids to start fluttering. A few seconds after that and his eyes began to focus. He looked at me and let out a shriek, which I quickly stifled, clamping a hand over his mouth. “You’re safe,” I told him as he struggled against me, his body still weak from blood loss. “There is no reason to fear.” I forced a few more drops of blood into his mouth and his pallor began to improve. “You were attacked,” I told him. “But your assailant has been captured so there’s nothing more he can do to harm you.” The crowd had cleared the room by that point and I knew I had to follow them as quickly as possible to try to save my grandfather. “You must rest here,” I told him, gently lowering him to the rug. “Be still. No more harm will come to you.” I stood up. “I’ll send the ship’s physician just as soon as I can.” The cabin boy made an attempt to say something. He reached a trembling hand toward me and tried to force words to come out of his mouth. But I had already wasted too much time. I felt I couldn’t spare another moment. I pulled away from him. “Just stay there,” I shouted over my shoulder as I rushed out the door. The corridor was empty, but I followed the sound of angry voices to the deck of the ship. There was the mob, pummeling and kicking at a prostrate figure on the deck, which I knew to be the heartless creature who was my grandfather. What was I to do for him? Was there anything I could say that would stop the crazed mob from tearing him to pieces? I had to try something. He was my maker. “Wait!” I shouted, rushing forward and thrusting myself between the mob and my grandfather. “Stop!” I held my hands up to keep them back. “Why should we?” one of the men asked, his eye appearing crazed with bloodlust. “He’s a human,” I pointed out. “Doesn’t he at least deserve a trial?” “He’s not a human,” the man told me. “He’s a creature of the night. He gave up his right to a trial when he sold his soul to the devil.” Another man began to view me with suspicion. “Why are you so eager to defend him?” he asked, poking me on the chest with a brawny finger. “What’s this creature to you?” “Nothing,” I insisted. “I’m just studying the law.” “The law is only for humans,” a woman’s voice called from the back of the throng. “I wouldn’t give that creature the same consideration I’d give a dog.” Most people in the crowd seemed to heartily agree with her. I felt a hand close tightly around my ankle. Looking down, I made eye contact with my grandfather. “Save me,” he said in words so soft that no mortal ears could have heard them. “I am your maker. You owe me your immortal soul. You must save me.” “How?” I asked, mostly with my eyes. “I am your maker,” he whispered again. “You must save me, even if it means sacrificing yourself.” I knew at that moment that I truly hated my grandfather. I hated him to the very core of my being. But he was also my maker. I had to obey him. I felt obliged to try to preserve his life. Turning back to the crowd, I looked at all their mortal faces. I was just a fledgling vampire, but I knew that I had the ability to compel mortals to do my bidding. I didn’t have much experience using my influence over anyone and it seemed an insurmountable challenge to sway a rabid mob. But I felt Grandfather’s grip around my ankle. I could hear him whispering, “Save me. You must save me.” I had no choice. I had to either compel the crowd to leave him alone or fight them. “Please, listen to me,” I said, raising my hands in the air again to gather their attention. “No,” a woman shouted from the crowd. “Shove the boy out of the way and dispatch the beast.” And then the mob closed in, poking at me with their makeshift stakes to get me out of the way. Each scratch of the wood was like someone had set my skin on fire. I wanted to shriek in pain, but I knew if anyone took notice of the agony a few slivers were causing me, then I would be in the same position as my grandfather. “Come here, boy,” I heard a woman’s gruff voice command me. I was about to protest, but the lady got a firm hold of me and began dragging me away from Grandfather. “There’s no need for you to be caught up in this nonsense.” The woman was elderly and her voice was ragged, but she had a grip on me as strong as a vice. In a softer voice, she added, “We’re almost clear of him.” I did a double take and realized that the elderly woman was my mother in disguise. “What are you doing?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “Saving what’s left of my family,” she said in a low voice. “But Grandfather…” I stammered. “You’re death isn’t going to save him,” she said. I don’t know where Grandfather got the strength, but he’d climbed to his feet and started fighting the crowd. It seemed like some of the frenzy had left the mob. Instead of being swept up with outrage and moving with one mind and one will, they were all standing back, waiting for someone else to take the lead. If he’d played things right, maybe Grandfather could have gained control of the mob. Or at least temporarily escaped the crowd and hidden somewhere on the ship while regaining his strength. Then he could have waited until we were closer to New York and escaped by air, flying the rest of the way. But Grandfather was angry and used to being obeyed by mortals. He grabbed one of the men that was taunting him, lifted him into the air, and then flung him over the side of the ship. “Who wants to die next?” Grandfather shouted, glaring at the crowd. The people moved in a giant mass, slashing and stabbing at Grandfather with their stakes. They had him pinned against the rail. “We have to do something,” I said, pulling against my mother’s tight embrace. “No,” Mother said, shoving me back. “He’ll be gone in another moment. I think we’ve already done enough. We’re better off saving that poor soul who went over the side.” Then she released me and ran for a life preserver. I knew she was right, but I still felt compelled by my maker. Grandfather had commanded me to save him. I had to do something to save the evil fiend. I had to try. Almost against my will, I found myself taking a few steps toward the crowd. “Jessie!” Mother shouted, jolting my out of my trance. “Help me with the man overboard.” “Yes,” I said to her. “Yes, you’re right.” I hurried to the railing, took the life preserver from her and flung it to the man bobbing up and down in the waves. I could see him just as easily as if it had been high noon. The preserver had a rope attached to it. Only a few moments later and we were hauling the man back onto the deck of the ship. Grandfather was losing his battle. The best thing he could have done was take flight, but he was in such a weakened condition from all the stake wounds, that was no longer a possibility. Still, he wouldn’t give up the battle. He lunged for another man, but received a stake to the hand for his efforts. Jerking back in pain, he found himself pinned against the railing. Another moment of struggle and he was pushed over the side. My impulse was to catch him as he fell. I didn’t have much experience flying, but I knew the basics. Mother held me back, gripping my shirt with both her hands. “Let him go, Jessie,” she told me. “But…” I struggled against her grasp. “Jessie,” she said. “Look at me.” After I wrench my gaze away from where Grandfather had plunged in the water, she said, “I didn’t go through all this trouble to arrange your grandfather’s discovery, just to have you put yourself at risk to save him.” I stared at her, too stunned to think for several seconds. “You?” I couldn’t help but ask. And then I added, “Why?” Mother released me and then did her best to straighten out the wrinkles in my shirt. “That son-of-a-bitch already killed my sons,” she said. “I wasn’t going to let him get my daughter.” I let this new information sink into my brain. My mother had set the whole thing up. She’d found the perfect cabin boy and probably even gotten him drunk in the hopes that his blood would intoxicate her father, slowing his reflexes. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything to the rest of the family,” Mother said, scanning the people on the deck for any family members who might have come to see what all the noise was about. “Of course,” I assured her. “But…” My thoughts were all a jumble. Grandfather was Mother’s maker, too. How had she acted against him? It seemed impossible. “How did you do it?” I was finally able to ask. “How could you betray your maker? Even if he was a man like Grandfather?” “It wasn’t easy,” she told me, running her hands over her clothes to smooth nonexistent wrinkles in her dress. “But there’s one thing most makers don’t seem to understand.” “What?” I couldn’t help but ask. She turned to head back to her cabin, but then paused to look at me over her shoulder. “A mother’s love is stronger than any obligation she might feel toward her maker.” Chapter 17 Colette “You’re losing weight,” Mama observed, running an appraising eye over my figure. “Do you think?” I brushed my hands over my hips. I’d never been heavy, but I was rather curvy, which I knew Papa disliked. I’d overheard him talking with Mama once and he’d said flat out that I was too young to have such a womanly figure. “It must be all that bicycling you’ve been doing. It’s great exercise,” Mama said, turning back to the dishes. “I swear you must have ridden across half the state in the last month.” “Probably,” I agreed with her, picking up a clean plate and starting to dry it with a towel. What my mother didn’t know was that, even though I had been riding my bicycle a lot lately, it was always to the same place. It felt almost as if I had a magnet inside my belly that was always pulling me toward the castle. “It looks good on you,” Mama said as she drained the sink and started to wipe down the counter. “I think it’s healthy. You should keep it up.” She wouldn’t have thought it was healthy if she’d known about my visit to the castle that afternoon. I’d ridden my bike over there after school. I wanted to speak with the Italian workers before they finished the floors and were sent back to Italy. After the rose garden was finished, the English workers disappeared like they had evaporated into the air. There was only one caretaker left to make sure the roses stayed beautiful. He looked about a million years old and lived in a tiny house that was tucked out of sight of the castle. The problem was that the Italians were always working inside the castle and I wasn’t bold enough to stroll inside the building just to ask impertinent questions. Still, that afternoon, luck was on my side. As the wheels of my bicycle rolled to a halt just outside the castle, I noticed a young man with an immense crop of shiny black hair leaning against a tree. He was smoking a cigarette and had his eyes closed as he tilted his face toward the sun. The heavy layer of sawdust covering him from head to toe led me to believe that he might be one of the Italian workers. I was trying to think of a possible reason to strike up a conversation with him, when he said, “I am glad for this day. I have missed the sunshine.” He’d kept his eyes closed when speaking so I wasn’t quite sure he was addressing me, but there was nobody else around. “It another few months it will be quite warm,” I answered him, still staying astride my bicycle. “Yes, but by then I will be gone.” He opened his eyes to look at me and I was surprised to realize that they were green when I had been expecting brown. “You are from Italy?” I asked. I was feeling rather shy to be standing there by myself, speaking to a young man I didn’t know, but I forced myself to be bold. “Si,” he said, closing his eyes again like a cat enjoying a nap in a sunbeam. He tilted his head back to rest it against the tree. “You are one of the men laying the floors in the castle?” “Si,” he said again. Climbing off my bike, I put down the kickstand. Taking a deep breath, I blurted, “Have you ever met the family who will live here?” My question caused the young man to lift his head and look directly at me. After staring at me for several seconds, he said, “No,” rather curtly. “I have never met the people who will live here. But I hear of them and it is never good things.” “What have you heard about them?” I asked, fully realizing that I sounded like the town gossip. The young man shifted his weight from one foot to the other. My question had made him uncomfortable. “It is stories that are not nice to hear,” he said. “They are not for the young girl like you.” I felt the sting of disappointment. What was the age where people stopped saying things like, “You’re too young to hear things like that,” or, “I’ll tell you when you’re older,”? This young man couldn’t have been much older than me and he knew the stories. I started getting back on my bicycle. There didn’t seem much point in haranguing him if he was reluctant to talk. But my leaving somehow loosened his tongue. “I will tell you this thing,” he said. “I would not like for such a family to move to my town.” “Why not?” I ask, not bothering to climb off my bike. His face darkened and I couldn’t tell if he was getting angry or just struggling for the right words. “They are not like the people,” he said. “They make the bite.” “Oh.” I was beginning to understand him. “You mean their dogs?” “No.” He shook his head adamantly. “They are not the mannaro.” “Pardon?” I said, bending my ear toward him. His English was good, but I didn’t quite catch the last word. “They’re not the what?” “Mannaro,” he said again, more slowly. “I do not know this word in English, but that is not the family.” He looked at the space between us for a couple of seconds, his lips moving slightly as he tried to work something out in his head. “They are not the lupo.” Then his eyes widened a little. “They are not the wolf, but they bite. They bite very badly. You must stay away.” The Vanderlinds apparently had some kind of weird pets that were especially vicious, was all I could conclude. Some type of dog or wolf or something. Maybe these animals had a habit of escaping their kennels and attacking the locals. That was the only thing I could guess. But would the family really ship such beasts across an ocean? Especially after they’d already made such trouble? I was just about to mention this possibility to the young man, when another worker, middle aged and also covered in sawdust, came out of the castle. He immediately yelled at my new friend in a foreign language. I assumed it was Italian. The young man said something in reply, also in a heated voice. He gestured at me several times. The only word I understood between them was the name Vanderlind. The older man swung around to glare at me and then a string of words came out of his mouth very rapidly. I had no idea what he was saying. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I don’t speak Italian.” This apparently made the man even more furious. He took a deep breath and then said, “You go out of here! You leave this! You do not come here!” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I was just asking about the Vanderlind family. I didn’t mean to keep anyone from their work.” That was the only thing I could think of that would make him so red in the face. “Go!” the man shouted. “You go now!” He waved his hands at me as if trying to chase me off. “You not come back here.” “I really didn’t mean to get anyone in trouble.” I gave the young man an apologetic look. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “He wants that you should go,” said the young man. “He wants that you leave because there is danger.” “You no come back here!” the older man roared. He picked up a pebble from the ground and threw it in my general direction. “Ora!Ora!” he shouted, reaching for another pebble. I had a feeling that this time he wouldn’t miss. Turning my bike fully around, I started pedaling hard and didn’t stop until I was safe in the garage back at my house. The whole things was very strange, and frightening, and a little humiliating somehow. I didn’t appreciate being chased off like a sheep that had strayed into the wrong pasture. The man didn’t have to throw stones at me. There was still some time before dinner, so I went to my room to think. Why were all the workmen warning me about the Vanderlinds? There must have been some terrible incident back in Hungary. Something to do with some type of vicious dogs. Maybe the dogs had killed a person. Maybe even a few people. Was that why the Vanderlinds had decided to move away? To escape the shame of their pets having killed or maimed some people. That seemed rather strange, but it was the only thing I could thinking of, given what I had been told. I decided that it was probably best for me to stay away from the caste, at least until the floors were finished and the Italian carpenters were gone. I was drawn to the castle, but that didn’t mean I had to be foolish. If there really were rabid dogs that were going to be housed on the estate, then I would have to fight my nature and avoid the place as much as possible. I didn’t mind a well behaved dog that was happy just to sit on a porch or fetch a stick, but I was not overly comfortable with dogs that liked to jump and bark. A vicious dog would probably be able to sense my fear and target me for its next attack. I was sad that I wouldn’t be able to ride over to the castle anymore, but I wasn’t a stupid girl. Those men were warning me for a reason. Just then Lilly came into the room and immediately flung herself on her bed. “What’s wrong?” I asked her. “They’re letting me go from Zucker’s,” she said, tearfully. “Why?” I exclaimed, coming over to sit next to her on the bed. “What happened?” “Oh… Mrs. Zucker’s cousin in moving to Tiburon,” Lilly said, wiping her eyes and giving a loud sniff. “She’s going to start working there, so they won’t have any space left for me,” she explained. “And there’s not a job for you, either,” Lilly said. “Mr. Zucker asked me to tell you.” “Oh, no.” I let my shoulders slump. The Zuckers had told me that I could work at their store over the summer. I was hoping to start at the end of the month, when school let out. Lilly and I had planned to work there as much as we could to bring in extra money for Mama and Papa. And Lilly had thought she might keep working there for a few years, at least until she got married or found another job. “Now I’m never going to get to see Walter,” Lilly said, morosely as she flopped onto her stomach. “Have you told Mama and Papa?” I asked. “No,” Lilly told me, her voice slightly muffled by her pillow. “Well don’t say anything yet,” I told her. “Let’s try to find some other work first so they don’t have to worry.” The other evening, Lilly had overheard Mama and Papa talking about paying the bills. Things were getting very tight. Papa was worried that if he didn’t find more work then we might have to sell the house and move in with his brother. All of us loved our house. Papa had crafted it with his own two hands and it really was a thing of beauty. Lilly and I were determined to contribute whatever we could to keep us in our home. “Alright,” Lilly agreed. The jobs at Zucker’s had sounded too good to be true. There were plenty of people out of work and willing to do just about anything to earn a couple of dollars. “I’m sure we could maybe get something on one of the farms.” “There’s got to something,” I agreed with her, but we both knew it was going to be a challenge. “It’s just a shame they didn’t hire Papa to work building the castle,” I said. Lilly gave a small laugh, even though there were still tears in her eyes. “You’re just saying that because then you would get to look inside.” “Well, that too.” I couldn’t help but join her in giggling a little. “But I mean, it would have been nice for him to have the work.” Sighing, Lilly murmured, “I guess it’s too bad our last name doesn’t sound Hungarian.” Chapter 18 Jessie The person who took Grandfather’s death the hardest was Mrs. Denkler. I told her when I returned to the cabin, after checking that someone was attending to the cabin boy’s injuries. I hoped to everything holy and unholy that Grandfather had not left any clues behind connecting him to the Vanderlind family. I knew his cabin would be thoroughly searched. “No, no, no,” Mrs. Denkler wailed once I’d told her of her employer’s demise. She immediately began tearing at her hair with grief. I wrapped my arms around her and held her firmly to stop her from doing further injury to herself. “He’s gone,” was all I could tell her. “I tried to save him, but it was impossible. The crowd wouldn’t stop until they were sure he was dead.” Emily was standing behind Mrs. Denkler. I could see her over the shoulder of the grieving housekeeper. Tears were pouring down her face. She looked at me, her entire body trembling. “You mean,” she gasped. “You mean that I won’t have too…” she couldn’t finish her words. “You mean I’ll never…” I nodded, and tried to summon a smile. “That’s right,” I told her. “You’re going to live to be an old lady.” Our mother had seen to that. Emily covered her face with her hands and ran to her cabin, slamming the door behind her. I was glad for her. I knew she had dreaded becoming a member of the undead. But her actions did leave me with an inconsolable Mrs. Denkler in my arms. “What will become of me now?” the housekeeper wailed. “What will become of me?” “Everything will be just fine,” I said, half carrying her across the room to lie her down on the couch. “You’ll come with us to America. You’ll be the Vanderlind housekeeper. Nothing has changed,” I assured her. I rang to have some liquor brought to the cabin and ordered it to be brought on the double. The steward arrived with a bottle of bourbon and a bottle of soda. He wanted to come in and set the drinks up for me on the bar, but I refused to let him enter the cabin. Instead, I asked him to just pass everything over the threshold. Mrs. Denkler was so distraught, I didn’t know what she might let slip with a stranger in the room. At first the steward seemed a little offended, but I was able to smooth things over with a rueful smile and a generous tip. “Here, Denkie, drink this,” I instructed, handing her a brimming glass. “It’ll calm you,” I assured her. I had expected our housekeeper to just sip daintily at the straight bourbon I had handed her, but she downed half the glass in just one gulp. Her body shivered and pitched a little as the liquor ran through her, but it did interrupt her wailing. After that she sat there for several minutes, just staring at the wall opposite her, not moving or making a sound. I wasn’t sure what I could do for her or what I could offer her to make her feel better. My mother had suspected Denkie would take the news hard. She had taken it upon herself to somehow get the news to Daniel, if he didn’t already know. My brother had been eager to become a member of the undead and he had more respect for our grandfather than the rest of us. Still, as long as the Vanderlind name was untarnished and our fortune was still intact, I doubted Daniel would mind too horribly much. Without warning, Mrs. Denkler rose to her feet. “If you’ll excuse me,” she said in a quiet voice. “I think I need to lie down for a few minutes. “Please,” I said, hurrying over to her in case she should be unsteady. But that was not the case. She crossed the room to the cabin she shared with my sister without a tremble, her head high and her eyes hard. “I think you should just turn in for the night,” I told her, seeing her to her door. Her eyes shifted in my direction, but I could tell she wasn’t really looking at me. Her movements gave the impression that she was more automaton than human. “Thank you,” she said. “You’ve always been a kind boy.” When Mrs. Denkler had turned the lock inside the cabin, I hurried to my private quarters and dug into my valise. I drained the remaining contents of the first pint in one large gulp and had downed half of the second bottle before I really knew what I was really doing. It took great self-restraint for me to cork the remaining blood and tuck it away. I had to force myself out of the room; the urge to finish the pint was so strong. After the light went out in Emily and Mrs. Denkler’s cabin, I felt truly alone with only my thoughts to keep me company. Sinking onto the couch, I cupped my head in my hands. Grandfather’s demise was too horrible to think about. If I closed my eyes, I could still see the image of him going over the side. He hadn’t cried out as he fell; no wail of fear, no words of farewell. He must have been too weak to fly. I had to wonder if he suspected any of his family of treachery. Did he know my mother had set him up to be discovered? And was Grandfather truly gone? That was another thought that would keep me awake in my coffin. He was in a weakened state and had been slashed at by many shards of wood, but had he actually been staked? Was he still of this world, just floating in the ocean somewhere? We were in the middle of the Atlantic. There wasn’t even the smallest bit of land for a thousand miles, but that didn’t mean that Grandfather wasn’t still alive. Had he somehow kept pace with the ship and was, even now, climbing aboard, hell-bent on revenge? That thought compelled me to my feet. I found myself on deck a moment later without jacket nor any memory if I had locked the state room door. I began hurrying down flights of stairs to the lower decks. Surely there would be wet footprints if he’d managed to save himself. I scanned the polished floorboards and hung over the railing, trying to glimpse if there was a figure bobbing in the ocean. At the stern of the ship, I caught sight of a shadowy figure, leaning against the rail. He was the same size as my grandfather and had the same demeanor. I stutter-stepped with surprise, but a moment later I understood that the figure was my brother. “He’s not here,” Daniel said, his voice a low growl. “I’ve been looking since I got word, but there’s not a sign of him.” “So he’s really gone, then?” I had to wonder. “He’s out there.” We both took a moment to examine the vastness of the ocean. “He was a foolish old bugger,” Daniel felt the need to observe. “Feasting on a cabin boy… I should have thought Grandfather had better self control.” I shrugged. “Maybe the temptation was too great.” Daniel laughed. “I suppose we should be grateful Mother insisted we travel under false names,” he observed, using a voice that was loud enough to draw attention. I jerked my head slightly to let him know he should be silent. It was stupid of him to assume that we were the only beings out and about, even though it was the middle of the night. “Don’t be such a prig,” my brother muttered. “There’s no one around to hear us.” I could see that Daniel had inherited the arrogance that had been our grandfather’s undoing. But it would do me no good to point that out. Daniel seemed satisfied that Grandfather had not made it back onto the ship and I had no reason to doubt him. “Have a good night,” I told my brother as I turned to stroll away. It never even occurred to me to ask him to share some of his blood. I would let the last misdeed of our Grandfather go unknown to the rest of the family. He’d done enough evil things in his life. I didn’t need to add one final black-mark against him. When I opened the door to our quarters again, the first thing I saw was Mrs. Denkler’s hard eyes glittering in the darkness. I could see her clear as day, but there was something about the darkness that may her eyes glow in a different way. “Oh,” I said, rather surprised. “I thought you’d gone to bed.” “No,” she told me. “I just needed to rest for a minute.” I wasn’t sure what to say. “I hope you’re not unwell.” “No, I am well,” she insisted. “The loss of your grandfather was quite a shock, but I’m sure the family feels it more than I do.” I nodded, unwilling to commit words to the topic. “I greatly appreciate your understanding when I…” Mrs. Denkler waved a thin hand through the air. “When I became upset. I was very fond of your grandfather.” “Yes, of course,” was all I could think to say. “And I appreciate your assurance that your family stills values my services,” she said. I tried to smile. “I don’t think we could run the castle without you.” “Do you mind if I turn on a light?” she asked. “It makes things easier for me.” “Yes, of course,” I said. “Don’t get up. Let me do it for you.” I quickly found the switch. “I have something for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, holding out a small cup covered with a cloth. I asked, “What is it?” but my nose had already told me. It’s was blood. “Where did you get it?” I exclaimed. Then I noticed that her left arm was bandaged at the wrist. “Denkie, you didn’t!” “Of course I did,” she said, still offering me the cup of nectar. “I know you’re trying to be brave and not say anything to your family, but it’s going to be hard for you to make it another two full days without feeding. Better to have some of my blood, given voluntarily, than to have you lose control and…” Her voice cracked a little. “And get caught the way your grandfather was.” “I couldn’t,” I told her, although my eyes were glued to the cup in her hand. “Of course you can,” she said, sounding a little cross. “And besides, what do you think will happen if you slip up and the passengers discover another vampire aboard this ship?” She was right. If I did make a mistake, then she and Emily would also be held responsible. And it wouldn’t stop there. They crew would probably search the boat, cabin by cabin, until my mother and brother were also discovered. If I lost control, then my whole family would more than likely be killed. I took the blood, noticing how, when I reached for it, my hand trembled. It seemed somehow obscene to drink Mrs. Denkler’s blood in front of her, so I hurried to my private cabin before gulping down the red nectar. It was still warm from when she’d drained it from her arm. After the cup was empty, I was lost in a confusing swirl of ecstasy and revulsion. Mrs. Denkler had been our housekeeper my entire life. I had never thought of her in any sort of intimate terms beyond her being an older woman who felt at liberty to scold me if I acted up. But drinking her blood, even if it was from a cup, was somehow so intimate. It made me feel uneasy, like I had accidentally stumbled across her in her bath. Once I fought passed all the confusing sensations, I felt much better. I was in control of my appetite again. I could face being with mortals and not break out into a sweat, visualizing them with their necks’ laid bare. I felt an extreme amount of gratitude toward Mrs. Denkler. She was more than just a good housekeeper and a loyal servant. She really was part of the Vanderlind family. I wouldn’t forget the gift she had given me. Chapter 19 Colette I stayed away from the castle for as long as I could. Not going there had me so distracted that it was a challenge to concentrate on my school work or even carry on a simple conversation. Our final exams for the year were quickly approaching and I wondered how I would ever get through them with my thoughts always straying to the massive gray structure on the other side of town. I couldn’t help but daydream about who would be living there and how they would spend their days. I wondered if they had any children, and if yes, how old were they? I knew it was silly to believe that anyone so wealthy would send their offspring to Tiburon High, but I wasted hours daydreaming about it. I didn’t dare include myself in the world I was creating in my mind. I knew that there were thousands of novels where a young man from a wealthy family falls in love with the lowly shop girl, but I knew better than to believe something so magical would ever happen to someone like me. Still, I found the longer I stayed away from the castle, the more it consumed me. After two weeks, I decided I would have to visit the site again or my grades would start to suffer. That afternoon, I set out on my bicycle immediately after school. I hoped that the Italian workers had finished their tasks by then and were on a boat back to Italy. I didn’t relish the idea of having more stones thrown at me while men scolded me in a language I did not understand. As I coasted my bike down the recently paved road, I was stunned to see how complete the castle appeared. If I didn’t know differently, I would have assumed that the Vanderlind Castle had been standing on the shores of the Tiburon since the crusades. Then I caught sight of more barges on the river. The family’s furniture and personal effects had arrived. Giant crates were being used to unloaded the cargo onto the shore. Men wielding claw hammers and pry bars were opening large crates and carefully removing the contents. Everything had been packed in straw, so there were a dozen women efficiently wiping down each item. Then the contents were being moved into the castle by dozens of men. From a distance it looked like a line of ants hefting away the remnants of a picnic. The entire process was being orchestrated by an older woman wearing a long gray dress with a high collar. Her dark gray hair was pulled back in an elaborate coil and her hands never stopped moving as she gave orders to each man as he entered the building. I was amazed that she could look at a lamp or a dressing table and know exactly where it belonged. She wasn’t even consulting a clip board. She apparently had the entire contents of the castle memorized. I stood there for several minutes, just watching the progress and admiring the beautiful furnishings of the Vanderlinds’ home. It was probably the only opportunity I would have to see anything so fine, outside of a museum, so I was doing my best to soak it all in. The workmen unloaded a very large crate that contained several smaller crates. They were all shaped the same, like long, squat rectangles. When one of the workmen started to apply his pry bar to the contents, the older woman in gray rushed over. I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she directed the workmen to carrying those specific crates into the house unopened. I couldn’t figure out what their contents could be. They weren’t the right shape or weight to be safes. And even if they were strongboxes of some type, filled with valuables, it wasn’t likely the workmen would have been able to crack them open with all the other people swarming around. I stared after the peculiar crates with keen interest. When I turned my eyes back to the general crowd of workers, I noticed that the lady in charge of the unpacking was looking directly at me. She had sharp eyes and wore a frown on her lips. I felt immediately embarrassed for being caught gawking. I was being frightfully rude. After all, how would I feel if we moved houses and the new neighbors turned up on the sidewalk to look over all our furnishing? I began to turn my bike around. It seemed like my days of gazing at the castle were over. Once the Vanderlinds moved in, I couldn’t exactly show up and stare at their house, no matter how much I felt drawn to it. If I did, the family would probably call the sheriff on me. As I placed a foot on the pedal and began to push down, I heard a voice call out, “Wait there, young lady.” Turning my head, I saw the woman in charge, marching straight toward me. She did not look pleased. “I’m sorry,” I blurted, unconsciously rolling the bike a little with my foot to keep some distance between us. “I just liked coming by to watch while they were building the castle. I won’t come by anymore,” I assured her. “Do you live in this town?” the woman asked, stopping several yards away from me and waving a hand through the air toward the general direction of Tiburon. “Yes,” I told her, rather hesitantly. “I live in Tiburon.” I wondered if she even knew our town’s name. Something told me she hadn’t bothered to commit it to memory. “Do you like it here?” she asked. From her appearance and her association with the Hungarian castle, I had expected her to speak with a foreign accent, but besides sounding a little formal, she had none. “Um... “It wasn’t a question I had given any great consideration. “Yes. I do like it here,” I said, inching my bike a bit further down the recently paved road. I wasn’t comfortable under the woman’s intense gaze. “And the castle interests you?” she asked, continuing in her questioning. “Yes,” I admitted. “I think it’s fascinating. But, you don’t have to worry. I won’t come by anymore, now that the family is about to arrive. I promise.” I put a hand to my cheek, my face feeling hot under her scrutiny. A tight smile curled the corners of the woman’s mouth. “Would you like to work in the castle?” she asked. “Pardon?” Now she had really caught my attention. “I asked if you would like to work at the castle,” she said, the smile quickly fading and an edge of impatience creeping into her voice. After thinking about it a moment, I said, “Yes, I would like to work at the castle. But I’m not sure what I’m qualified to do.” The woman looked me over from head to toe. “You are very much the kind of young lady I would like to have working at Vanderlind Castle.” “Thank you,” I told her. “And as it happens, I am looking for work as soon as school lets out for the summer. But I’m not sure of what kind of workers you are hoping to find.” “You could work as a housemaid,” she said, “I would have to train you, of course. But I’m sure you’ve cleaned house for your mother, or perhaps an elderly neighbor who was ill. Of course, at the castle we have very exacting standards.” I nodded, my stomach doing a flip. Did this dour-looking woman really mean to offer me a job at the castle that I’d been obsessing over for months? Did she really mean I would get to go inside and look at all the pretty things as I dusted and scrubbed them? I couldn’t imagine any kind of work that I would like better. Trying not to squirm with excitement, I said, “Of course.” “My name is Mrs. Denkler,” the lady told me. “I’m the housekeeper for the castle and I do all the staff hiring.” “How do you do?” I said in reply. “I am Colette Gibson. It’s very nice to meet you.” Mrs. Denkler tilted her head to one side and looked me over some more. “Do you know any other young ladies like you, who might be looking for work as a housemaid?” “My sister is also looking for a job,” I told her, sounding way too eager. “She was just let go from Zucker’s.” I immediately wished I hadn’t mentioned the general store, so I hastily added, “But that was because Mrs. Zucker’s cousin is taking the job. Not because Lilly isn’t a good worker.” The castle’s housekeeper raised her eyebrows slightly. “Your sister?” she asked. “Does she look anything like you?” “Oh, yes,” I told her. “People can always tell we’re sisters. Although she has nicer hair,” I felt the need to say for no good reason, self consciously sliding a hand over my own unruly locks. “Your hair is lovely,” Mrs. Denkler said. The sun was starting to set and it made her eyes glitter. “You remind me of the Empress Elisabeth, poor child.” For a moment, I thought she pitied me for my wild mane, but then she added, “She was stabbed to death by an anarchist, you know.” “Oh,” I exclaimed, but then I could think of nothing else to say. I didn’t know who she meant and I wasn’t quite sure what an anarchist was. “Come by tomorrow,” Mrs. Denkler told me. “You may knock at the door around to the right, closest to the river. Tell whoever lets you in that you have an appointment to see me.” “It will have to be after school,” I told her. “We haven’t been let out for the summer yet.” “That’s fine,” Mrs. Denkler said, turning to return to her duties. “Just come by as early as you can. And be sure to bring your sister.” I practically flew home, I was so excited. After I walked in the door and gave Mama a kiss, she told me that Lilly was in our room. I took the stairs two at a time. I wanted to tell the news to my sister first before we surprised Mama and Papa. “Lettie!” Lilly exclaimed, leaping up from her bed as soon as I entered the room. “I have wonderful news.” “You do?” I asked, momentarily thrown off. I was so caught up in my own news it was hard to change gears. “Well, I have news first, and you’re never going to believe it.” “Let me tell first,” Lilly said. “I’ve been waiting for hours for you to get home.” She was bubbling with excitement and so was I. I gripped her hands and we both started to giggle. “Okay, you first,” I told her, “but tell it quick because I’m about to burst.” “We’ve been invited to a dance in Mansfield,” she blurted. “And there’s going to be a swing band and everything.” “Oh.” I wasn’t exactly sure what she meant by “we’ve” been invited. She was grinning from ear to ear. I didn’t want pour cold water on her excitement, so I hedged for more information by saying, “Walter invited you?” “No, not exactly,” she said, looking a little sly. “It’s Lev who can get the tickets. But he’s allowed to have four, so he thought it would be fun for the four of us to go.” “You mean you’re going on a double date with Lev and another girl,” I insisted. Lilly’s face fell. “Don’t you want to hear a swing band?” “Sure,” I said with a shrug. “But I can do that on the radio.” “I mean don’t you want to see and hear a swing band? Lev is a great dancer,” she assured me. “Right.” I shook my head a little. “I suppose he told you that himself.” “Come on, Lettie,” she said. “You know Mama and Papa won’t let me go unless you’re with me. Please?” My sister’s face was aglow with excitement, probably at the thought of Walter holding her in his arms under the guise of dancing. But the thought of Lev Wilson having his arms around me made me cringe. I didn’t care if he was a good dancer; there was just something about him that made me want to run a mile in the opposite direction. “You have to let me know now,” Lilly insisted, “because Lev needs to know if he should take the tickets.” It sounded like an evening to dread. “When is it?” I asked. “Next month,” she told me, beaming with anticipation. “Doesn’t that leave plenty of time for Lev to find a date with another girl?” I asked. “I mean, aren’t there dozens of young women lining up just hoping he’ll give them the time of day?” My sister put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “Do you really expect me to be excited by your good news when you act this way?” “But my news is actually good news,” I insisted. Chapter 20 Jessie “Stop being such a prig,” Daniel said. “This will be our last glimpse of culture before we’re lost in the jungles of Borneo.” I looked at the line of girls, all in various stages of undress with their negligees showing. “I’m not sure I’d refer to a brothel in New York as culture,” I told him in a low voice, so that the girls couldn’t hear. I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. “At least it’s a Manhattan brothel,” was my brother’s reply. “Just imagine the state of the girls in small town Ohio.” He gave an affected shudder. “I don’t know what Grandfather was thinking. If he was still around, I’d probably try to stake him myself.” We’d arrived in New York with no more trouble. Mrs. Denkler was sent on ahead to oversee the preparations of the house while the family stayed in New York for a few extra weeks. One evening Daniel asked me to head out to see the sights. I hadn’t realized that by “sights” my brother had meant the seedy underbelly of the city. In his defense, vice was often the only mortal activities that went on in the middle of the night. “Just choose one, for pity sake,” Daniel snarled. “You don’t have to feed off of her if you don’t want to.” I didn’t want to feed off of any of the girls. Or, more truthfully, I desperately wanted to suck the life out of every single one of them, but openly admitting that urge was appalling to me. As expected, New York was infested with vampires. The Vanderlind name carried some weight in undead circles, so we were welcomed to the city with open arms. Everyone was appalled to hear of the fate of our patriarch. There was even some discussion of setting up a search party, or taking revenge on the mortals who had thrown him overboard. But mother insisted that she had seen him with a stake in his chest as he fell over the side. “Otherwise he would have simply flown away,” she pointed out. And to those vampires hot for revenge, she settled them by saying, “I knew my father best and he wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to put his immortality at risk to avenge his own foolishness. He knew the risk he was taking when he let that young man into his cabin.” There was ample blood available for us to consume, which brought me great relief. I had barely been clinging to the threads of sanity when a porter finally summoned up the nerve to tell me that I must vacate my cabin and leave the ship. Mrs. Denkler’s generosity had enabled me to save most of the second pint of blood I had concealed in my valise. Before disembarking the ship, I downed the entire bottle so that I would have enough fortitude to make it through customs. When we were offered refreshment at the house where we were to stay, I didn’t ask how the blood had been obtained. I just gulped it down, feeling grateful that I hadn’t done anyone an injury during the crossing. And that I hadn’t ended up alongside Grandfather at the bottom of the Atlantic. “You’re stalling,” Daniel said, jolting me out of my reverie. “If I’d known you were going to be such a prude, I would have come by myself and left you to rot with Mother’s stuffy friends.” It was true, our host and hostess were not the most modern of people. But they had been members of the undead for over two hundred years, so I found it excusable that they hadn’t exactly stayed current with the times. Spending another evening listening to stories about the death of Casanova was quickly losing its appeal. But I would have preferred that to a whore house. I’d never lain with a woman, even though I was as eager as the next seventeen years old fellow. Somehow the thought of a prostitute threw cold water on my desire. They all looked so world weary, even though some of the young women couldn’t have been much older than me. There was a dullness in their eyes that spoke of a numbing of the soul. As a mortal, I had dreamed that my first time would be with my wife, whoever she might be. But I had also dreamed that I would be allowed to marry for love and not to increase the family fortune. Or extend our bloodline. “Oh, for crying out loud,” Daniel grumbled. Striding over to the group of young women who were putting their wares on display, he plucked a girl out of the line. “Here,” he said, grabbing her by the arm. “She looks about your speed,” he said, shoving her in my direction. The girl took a few stumbling steps and then fell into my arms. She looked up at me with large, luminous blue eyes and said, “I’m sorry. Pardon me.” I helped her to her feet, unable to avoid noticing that she was quite lovely, like a pale flower in the moonlight. “It’s not a problem,” I assured her. “Are you alright?” “Yes,” she said, in a half whisper, blinking rapidly. “And I am happy to go with you. I’m happy to do whatever you ask. But you’ll have to be patient with me, sir, because…” She turned her head away from me to conceal her embarrassment and shame. “This is my first time,” she said in a voice that carried a small tremble. My first impulse was to protect her. I wanted to take her in my arms and fly away from there to someplace safe and clean. But then she leaned into me, as if a little unsure on her feet, placing a hand on my chest. I could smell the men on her. And not just from a night of customers, but days and days of sweaty sailors and straying husbands climbing on top of her and partaking of the service she provided. The main room of the bordello was illuminated by only one lamp and that light was covered with a red scarf. It was intended to look like part of the atmosphere, but I suspected it was mostly to make the girls appear a little younger and a little less worn than they would in the daylight. “I’m ready,” the girl told me, tentatively taking my hand. “As long as you promise to be gentle.” Using my night vision, I could see that she wasn’t actually a young girl at all. She wore her hair in a girlish style and she had a petite figure, but I would have placed her age closer to twenty-seven than seventeen. Sensing my hesitation, the young woman tugged on my arm again. “Don’t be bashful,” she told me. “We can experience this new adventure together.” “No, that’s okay,” I told her, gently disengaging my arm. “I wouldn’t want to turn anyone from a fresh flower to a soiled dove. Although I appreciate your willingness.” “You don’t want to share your first time with me?” she asked, somewhat surprised. Her innocence routine had obviously not been questioned too many times before. “No thank you,” I told her and then pressed a half-dollar into her palm. “I think you should probably leave this place while you still have your health.” “Oh, if only I could,” she said, allowing tears to fill her eyes. “But I have nowhere else to go. And no one to be kind to me.” “I’m sorry to hear of your troubles,” I told her, pressing another half dollar into her palm, “but I am not the right man for you.” I sensed she was about to continue to give me her damsel in distress routine, so I fixed her with my eyes and said, “Trust me when I tell you that I am not a person whom you would want to know more intimately. Now please leave me alone.” She stared at me for several seconds, not moving or even blinking, before saying, “I understand. And wish you an enjoyable evening.” Then she turned and quickly hurried out of the room. Daniel made a sound of disgust. “I don’t have all night to dawdle while you act fussy,” he told me. Grabbing a voluptuous red head by the wrist, he began towing her down the hall. “Wait for me, once you’re finished,” he called over his shoulder. “I might go back for seconds.” “I’m sorry about Crystal,” the Madame said, stepping forward. The older lady had her hair piled high on her head and she had painted a red circle on each cheek as a substitute for any kind of blush reflex. “She’s new to our establishment and maybe a little too untested for your liking. But I’m sure we have plenty of girls who can please you,” she said, indicating the females like a butcher displaying a case full of meat. Glancing down the line of women and girls, I spied one female who had withdrawn into the corner, furthest away from the lamp. She was older than the others and standing at a peculiar angle that spoke of suppressed pain. I could tell just from looking at her that she was unwell. She’d done her best to cover her malady with plenty of rouge and powder, but I could detect her sallow skin underneath. Noticing my glance, the Madame perked up. “Has someone caught your eye?” she asked. “Yes,” I told her. “I’d be happy to get to know the young woman in the corner a little better.” The Madame frowned. “Are you sure?” she asked, arching an eyebrow in my direction. “Bernadette has been unwell lately, so maybe you might be happier with a different girl.” “No,” I told her with a polite smile. “Bernadette will suit me just fine.” The older woman shrugged. “You know your own mind, young man,” she said, then snapped her fingers at the female in the corner. “Bernadette,” she called. “Somebody give her a shove.” Another girl goosed her and Bernadette’s eyes fluttered. “Bernadette, you have a customer.” “Oh,” the woman said. “Oh, good. And such a handsome man to take an interest in me.” I could tell by the way she moved across the room that she was in immense pain, but she tried to carry it off as if she wasn’t. Bernadette did her best not to hobble as she led me down a dark passageway to the rooms where the girls plied their trade. Someone, presumably the Madame, had been burning incense to cover the stench of unwashed sheets and human misery. I had to wonder, if this was a high-class whorehouse, what were the low-class whorehouses like? The thought made me shudder. Mistaking my actions for trembling, Bernadette squeezed my arm. “Don’t worry, sweetie,” she said. “I’m not going to judge you. You can be as quick as you like.” Chapter 21 Colette Our mother picked us up from school the next afternoon and drove us out to the castle. “It doesn’t seem right for you girls to arrive on bicycles,” she said, “when applying for work in such a fancy home.” Lilly and I did our best to clean up in the back of the car while Mama drove. I was so nervous I was practically shaking. We were going to go inside the castle. Sure, it was only the servants’ entrance, but still, we would be inside. I should have been tired because I kept waking up all night with crazy, and wonderful, and frightening dreams, but I was too excited to feel tired. In fact, all day at school I was practically bouncing off the walls. As we drove up to the castle, I was surprised to see a gate was being erected around the building. I guess that was probably to keep the family’s vicious dogs from running wild. I hadn’t said anything to my family about the dogs. I didn’t want to risk that my parents would refuse to let us work at the castle, just because of some unruly pets. The Vanderlind family must have recently moved in because there was already a guard in purple livery attending the area where I assumed they would eventually erect the gate. “Yes?” he asked. He had a heavy accent that I couldn’t identify, so the word came out more like, “Ves?” My mother stared at him for a moment, not sure what to say and then eventually found her tongue. “My daughters were asked to come by today to apply for positions as maids,” she said. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was feeling a little intimidated. “Mrs. Denkler,” I called from the back seat. “We were invited here by a Mrs. Denkler.” The guard’s face registered immediate recognition of the name. “Drive through,” he told Mama in a somber voice. “Go to the right. Knock on the door for deliveries.” Once Mama had parked the car, Lilly and I climbed out and straightened our skirts. “Just remember to be polite,” Mama instructed us. “And be honest about your work experience. I’m sure they would appreciate honesty above anything else.” We both assured her that we would. As we approached the door with the deliveries sign posted on it, Lilly suddenly turned around and took a few quick steps back toward the car. “Mama, aren’t you going in with us?” Her voice had gone up an octave and she suddenly sounded about ten years old. “No,” our mother said, shaking her head a little. “You’re both old enough to apply for a job without me standing over you like a mother hen.” But then she looked at Lilly’s anxious face and added. “It’ll be okay, Lilly. I’m sure everything is going to be fine.” “Why did I let you talk me into this?” Lilly said in a low voice as we both stood in front of the door. “Aren’t you excited?” I asked, confused by her behavior. I was practically jumping up and down. “No,” she said, emphasizing the word by shaking her head rather adamantly. “I was a little excited, when we told Mama and Papa, but I don’t know…” she said, her words trailing off. “It’s just… I just have this horrible feeling of dread. Like we’re going to go into this ugly old building and never come out again.” “Oh, come on, Lilly.” I silently thanked my lucky stars that I hadn’t mention the dogs or I would have never gotten her out of the car. “Mama’s waiting for us right outside the door. I think she’d call the police if we didn’t show up after a couple of hours.” “I know,” Lilly said. “But…” “But what?” I asked, extending my hand to ring the bell. “Wait,” she said, grabbing my arm. “I’m sorry, Colette, but I really don’t want to do this.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her. “Of course we’re going to do this. We need the work. And I hear the castle pay is better than we could get anywhere else. I’m sure it’s much better than what you were getting at Zucker’s.” “I know, but…” I had never known my sister to be a shrinking violet, but there was a tremble in her voice. For whatever reason, she was extremely reluctant to go inside. “Come on, Lilly,” I said, putting my arms around her and giving her a squeeze. “I’m sure it’ll be fine. And if it’s weird, or creepy, or scary at all, we’ll turn right around and leave. I promise.” Lilly didn’t say anything. It was almost as if her feet where frozen to the ground. “Tell you what,” I said, desperate to get her moving. “If you do this for me, then I’ll agree to go to the dance with Lev next month.” My promise caught her attention. “Really?” she said, shifting her eyes in my direction. “Promise?” “Yes,” I assured her. “If you go inside with me and apply for the job, I promise I will chaperone you and Walter under the guise of being Lev’s date.” Some color came back to Lilly’s cheeks. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll go inside. But I don’t promise I’ll take the job.” I reached over and rang the bell. A few moments later the door was opened by a young woman with a friendly face and fair hair that was pulled back into a bun. She was wearing a black dress and a frilly white apron. “Yes?” she asked with a smile. “Hello,” I said. “Mrs. Denkler is expecting us.” “Oh.” She smiled some more. “Are you here about the housemaid positions?” “Yes?” I returned her smile and nodded my head several times. She opened the door wider. “Come on in,” she told us. “I’m Millie. I just started working here, so if you have any questions, don’t ask me,” she said with a laugh. I felt a shiver run through me as I stepped over the threshold and into the castle. I don’t know why, we were simply entering a dark hallway which led to a mudroom, but something about just being inside the building, filled me with a tingling anticipation. As we followed the young maid through the mudroom and down another hall. I tried to keep a little ahead of Lilly, in case we were set upon by a pack of unruly dogs. But we were not assaulted. We simply entered a modest room that contained a small couch, a desk and a few chairs. “Wait here,” the young woman told us. “I’ll go and find Mrs. Denkler.” Neither of us felt comfortable enough to sit down. So we stood there, feeling awkward. “She seems nice,” Lilly eventually said, probably only to break the silence. “Very,” I said, just to say something in reply. “Sorry about being so silly outside. I just felt such a wave of dread. It was like nothing I’d ever experienced before,” my sister told me. “It’s okay.” I reached over and squeezed her arm. “Maybe your lunch didn’t agree with you.” This made her giggle, which made me giggle. We tried to suppress our mirth, but then we’d look at each other and start snickering again. I knew it wouldn’t be a good idea for us to titter our way through a job interview, but I was just so nervous that I couldn’t help myself. Just then the door opened and Mrs. Denkler entered the room. We both stopped giggling immediately. In my excitement to see the inside of the castle, I’d forgotten how intimidating the housekeep actually was. “I was expecting you earlier,” was the first thing Mrs. Denkler said. “We were at school,” I told her. “But classes end after next week.” “And will both of you be returning to school in the fall?” she wanted to know. “My sister, Lillian, is graduating,” I said, gesturing to her by way of introduction, “but I have one year left.” “I suppose if you had a job that paid you well enough, you wouldn’t feel the need to return,” Mrs. Denkler said. It was more of a statement than a question, so I said nothing, even though I had every intention of returning to school in the fall for my senior year. The housekeeper looked me over from head to toe. “It’s so very important when running a great house like the Vanderlind household to hire the right kind of staff,” she said. “Some housekeepers advise to only hire plain girls. Especially when the family has sons to consider.” I couldn’t tell if she was trying to insult me or pay me a compliment. “And yet still I am tempted,” she said, putting a finger to her lips and staring at me intently. “I can’t help but noticed the resemblance” she murmured, half to herself. “It’s quite striking. Especially the hair.” She made a gesture as if she was about to reach over and touch my head, but then she thought better of it and retracted her hand. Lilly glanced over at me and I tried not to return her look. I so very desperately wanted to see the entire interior of the castle and working there seemed like the very best way to accomplish that dream. “I wonder if anyone will notice but me,” Mrs. Denkler said, biting the side of her lower lip and then immediately releasing it. “If the master was still alive, I am sure he would see it in an instant. But we were of that age.” She looked very sad for a moment and I thought I saw tears brimming in hers eyes. But then she cleared her throat and said, “I doubt anyone else will notice.” And then she asked me, “I don’t suppose you have any Hungarian blood?” I wanted the job so desperately that I almost blurted, “Yes, we have,” but then I remembered how our mother had instructed us to be honest, so instead I said, “Not that I know of.” “It’s a pity,” Mrs. Denkler said with another sniff. “That would have at least explained it.” I still had no idea what she was talking about so I just smiled and gave her a nod. And then the housekeeper thought of something. She looked deeply into my eyes. “Do you ever have dreams that are not your own?” she asked. “Do you have glimpsed memories that don’t seem to belong to you?” “Uh… No,” I replied, truthfully. Her line of questioning was starting to make me feel unsettled. Turning her sharp eyes on my sister, the housekeeper said, “Your name is Lillian Gibson, I presume. The resemblance is not as strong in you.” “I’m Lilly Gibson,” my sister managed to say. “How do you do?” “I’m Mrs. Denkler,” was the housekeeper’s response. “You will be issued two uniforms and four aprons each. You are expected to take care of your own uniforms and your appearance should always be flawless,” she informed us. “Now, if you don’t have any questions, “I’ll summon Millicent to show you your duties.” My stomach did a flip. “You mean you’re hiring us?” I stammered. “You can start the Monday after your school ends next week,” the housekeeper said. “But don’t you want to ask us any questions?” Lilly wanted to know. “About our past work experience or… anything?” That’s what we had been expecting, at least. “I’m sure your duties will not be too much for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, her lips drawn into a tight, flat line. “If they are, you’ll be discharged without a reference.” She pulled a small watch on a chain out of her dress pocket and glanced at it. “I really don’t have time for any more questions. Wait here and Millicent will look after you,” she said, before abruptly turning to leave the room. “Will any of our duties involve caring for the dogs?” I asked, before Mrs. Denkler had a chance to disappear. I desperately wanted the job, but I wasn’t a fool. All of the workers had been so adamant about some type of dangerous animal. I couldn’t expose my sister and myself to the risk of being mauled. The housekeeper gave me a sharp look over her shoulder. “What dogs?” she asked. “I hope you are not the kind of girl who is always asking ridiculous questions.” And then she left before I could assure her that I wasn’t. Lilly and I stared at the door for several seconds after she left and then turned to exchange looks. “I guess we’re hired,” my sister said, appearing as mystified as I felt. “I guess.” It seemed a very odd way to hire someone. “Do you think Millicent is the same Millie that answered the door?” Lilly shrugged. “We’re about to find out.” A few moments later and Millie rushed into the room. “Congratulations,” she exclaimed. “I knew Mrs. Denkler was going to hire you, just as soon as I saw you. I just knew it.” “Thank you,” we said in unison. “Oh, I’m so happy.” She really was beaming. “It will be so nice to have other servants around here who can actually speak English.” Chapter 22 Jessie The room itself was small, but not miniscule. There was a fringed shawl hanging over the window and another across the bed in an attempt to make the place look a little less down-at-the-heels. Another red scarf festooned the globe shade of a lamp which sat on the bedside table. The lamp was electric, but had obviously been converted from oil at some point in the last few decades. Bernadette took the shawl from the bed and draped it over the back of a chair with great care. I could tell at a glance that it had been hand embroidered. Then she eased herself onto the bed. “Is there anything you’d like in particular?” she asked, patting the open spot next to her on the mattress. “Any fantasy you have for your first time?” “Actually,” I said, taking a seat on the room’s only chair, but being careful not to disturb the shawl, “I won’t be joining you. Although I greatly appreciate the offer.” “Oh.” A look crossed Bernadette’s face that I couldn’t interpret. It was either surprise or relief. Possibly both. “Do you like to watch?” she asked, leaning back on the bed slightly and letting one of her hands drift over to her thigh. “Is that what you want?” “Actually, what I really wanted was someone to talk with while I wait for my brother,” I told her. “But please don’t be concerned; I’ll pay you for your time.” “Oh,” she said, sitting up a little. “You’re one of those.” “One of what?” I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral, although feeling slightly offended. “You want my life story, I suppose,” she said, her eyes growing a little angry. “You want to know how I managed to become such a downtrodden whore.” “Not particularly,” I told her. “We don’t have to talk at all, if you don’t want to. We could always play cards for awhile, if you have a pack.” Bernadette gave me half a smile and turned her head to view me out of the corner of her eye. “Cards?” she said. “You want to play cards? That’s a new one.” “We don’t have to play cards,” I told her. “But you said you’d rather not talk and I was trying to think of a way to fill the time.” “You’re too good looking to be in a place like this,” she told me. “I’m sure plenty of girls would give you a tumble for free.” “My brother wanted to come here,” I informed her. “If I’d known what he had in mind, I don’t think I would have joined him. “You a funny fellow?” she asked. “You prefer roughhousing with the boys. Is that it?” “No, I prefer girls,” I assured her, taking in her meaning. “But…” I was about to say too much, then decided I would anyway. “But I’d like to wait for someone special.” This made her smile. And this time it was a full, genuine smile. “You’re a romantic,” she said. “I thought all of your kind had died out defeating the Kaiser.” I smiled back at her, a genuine smile of my own. “I guess there are a few of us left.” Bernadette tried to sit up on the bed in order to speak with me more easily, but something must have twinged in her back because she grimaced and then quickly tried to cover it with another smile. “What’s wrong with your back?” I asked her. “Nothing,” she insisted, sitting up a little taller. I lowered my chin and gave her a steady look, so she shrugged. “Okay, there was this fellow who came in a couple of weeks ago. He got a little rough and now I can’t walk straight.” “Have you seen a doctor?” I asked, rising from the chair and walking over to her. “There’s only one kind of doctor that comes to a whore house,” she told me. “And bad backs aren’t his specialty.” “Would you like to stop working here?” I asked. “I mean, if you could.” She gazed up at me, but still managed to keep her eyelids heavy. “You’re going to save me?” she said, and then suppressed a laugh. “That’s Crystal’s racket, not mine. She’s been saved by not-so-virtuous men a dozen times since she started working here. Although she’s getting a little old for that scam now.” “I can’t save you,” I told her, in all honesty. “I could possibly provide you with the means, but you’d have to save yourself.” She thought this over for a minute. “I wonder…’ she said, half dreamily. But then her eyes cleared. “Nah,” she told me. “It’s a nice thought, but I’m too busted and worn out at this point to even try.” Then, with a sigh, she added, “But you’re a sweet boy for offering.” “I could at least try to fix your back,” I offered. “If you’ll let me.” Bernadette looked me over. “You’re too young to be a doctor. And don’t tell me you’ve got a magic willie.” I couldn’t help but laugh at her crassness. “No, it’s not magic,” I told her. “At least I don’t think it is.” This earned me a laugh in return. “But my grandfather was a scientist of sorts and he made a kind of tincture that I think might help you.” “Tincture?” she repeated. I could tell she was beginning to grow suspicious. “What kind of tincture?” “It’s for pain,” I told her. “And it’ll help you relax so that all your bones and joints can settle back into place.” I was standing quite close to her at this point and suddenly Bernadette looked alarmed. “Thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I need any kind of tincture,” she told me. “In fact, I don’t think I’m your kind of girl at all. You’d probably like Sally. She’s real pretty and I’m sure she’d drink whatever tincture you had in mind.” She tried to get to her feet. \"Why don’t I call for Bruno? He can get her for you.” “Sit down, Bernadette,” I commanded, looking her straight in the eyes. “There’s no need for you to be frightened,” I told her, gazing at her intently. “I’m not going to hurt you.” She smiled with relief, her body instantly relaxing. “That’s good. You frightened me there for a moment. You never know what some men are about.” “Close your eyes and open your mouth,” I instructed her. “Oh. This game,” she said. “I guess there are no true gentlemen left.” But she did as I instructed. Quickly I bared a fang and pierced the tip of my finger. Once a few drops of blood had formed, I placed them on her tongue. “Swallow that.” “What is it?” she asked, even as she was swallowing. A few seconds later she opened her eyes. “How do you feel?” I asked. Bernadette shifted from side to side, and then turned her head right and left a few times. There was a popping sound and then a few, quieter crunching noises. “Oh,” she exclaimed. “Something just shifted.” She placed a hand on the back of her neck. “Something’s different. I can feel it.” I stepped back, allowing her room to stand up. She moved cautiously at first and then with greater freedom. “I haven’t felt this good in years,” she said, giving me an amazed look. “What’s that stuff your grandfather made? He was a genius. You could sell that stuff and make a mint.” “Grandfather had his moments,” I assured her. “But I’m afraid his formula died with him. And that was the last of my supply. There isn’t anymore.” “Oh.” Bernadette looked at me with disbelief. “And you wasted the last of it on me?” “I didn’t waste it,” I assured her. “I shared it with a friend.” She moved around a bit more, testing her back for any residual pain. “That stuff is amazing,” she said. “I thought I was on my way to the grave, but now I feel like I might actually want to live.” “Do you want to live here?” I asked. “Not particularly,” she said with a shrug. “But what’s a working girl to do?” “You could get a little shop and live out of the back,” I suggested. “Maybe you embroider shawls. Maybe you raise chickens and sell the eggs. I bet there are a lot of things you can do.” Bernadette thought it over. “I guess I could give it a try,” she said. “The girls always want me to sew them some fancy flowers and things. And I’ve got a little money saved. Not much, but maybe I could rent a place and get some supplies.” I reached into my pocket and pulled out my billfold. Pulling out several bills, I folded them in half and handed them to her. “Hide this somewhere,” I told her. “Don’t let anyone know I gave it to you or I’m sure someone will try to take it away.” Bernadette gaped at the money for a moment and then concealed it in her clothing. “So you really are trying to save me.” “No,” I shook my head. “I told you before, I can’t save you. I can give you a bit of money to help you get started, but you have to save yourself.” Then I looked deeply into her eyes and held her gaze. “I believe in you, Bernadette.” “I’m glad,” she said, giving me a shy smile. “I think I’m starting to believe in me, too.” Sitting in the lobby again, the Madame came over to see if I was satisfied with Bernadette’s services. “Very satisfied,” I told her. “She’s quite a remarkable person.” The Madame sniffed. “She’s as good as any other whore, I reckon,” I engaged the woman with my eyes. “Bernadette might consider leaving here soon,” I told her. “If she decides to leave, then you will not impede her in any fashion. As a matter of fact, you’ll do whatever is within your power to help her. As you would with any of your girls.” “Of course,” the madam assured me. “I would do that for any of my girls.” I sat waiting for another three-quarters of an hour before Daniel reappeared. He looked smug, like the cat that had just swallowed a dozen canaries, and there was the faint smell of blood about him. Sitting down heavily next to me, he turned to look in my direction and said with a lascivious smile, “Now that was a bit of fun.” I shrugged, not sure what kind of reply he would expect from me. “Have you really never been to a bordello before?” he asked, tilting his head a little to get a better look at me. “No,” I said, in all honesty. I’d never even thought about going to a bordello. “You mean Grandfather never took you to one? Not even when you were mortal?” He seemed very surprised. When it was obvious my answer was still no, Daniel added, “That surprises me. He took me to my first whore house when I was sixteen.” I shrugged again. “Grandfather always did like you more than me,” I pointed out. “True,” Daniel said, and then he closed his eyes, emitting a contented sigh. After a quiet moment, he said, “Do you think Mother had anything to do with it?” “To do with what?” I asked. “Grandfather’s cabin boy.” “To do… how?” I asked, keeping my voice steady, even though inside I felt alarmed. I did not know how Daniel would react if he knew our mother had set up our maker to be discovered and tossed into the ocean. “To do with tempting him with a beautiful cabin boy and then arranging it so he was caught in the act.” I frowned and brought my eyebrows together. “Why would you think that?” “Because when we disembarked, Mother went through customs first,” he said. “And while I was waiting in line, I could see her talking to a wily looking fellow in a checkered suit. So naturally I was curious to know who he was.” I kept my face completely neutral while he spoke, as if listening to any ordinary story. Daniel went on with, “So as I was standing by myself, waiting for you and Emily, I saw that same fellow approach one of the ship’s stewards, and he was obviously looking for someone. A few minutes later, the steward brings forth a cabin boy. The same cabin boy that Grandfather was caught feasting upon.” “What did the man want?” I asked, trying not to sound too curious, but as someone who was simply interested in the story. “He told the boy that some long lost relative of his had died, leaving him a bit of money,” Daniel said with a frown. “You’re kidding,” I exclaimed. “Well… good for him. I’m glad something good happened to him after what he went through.” Daniel frowned some more. “But don’t you think that’s just a bit too much of a coincidence?” he asked. “I mean, he gets bitten on the neck by Grandfather and then magically inherits some money. The whole thing smells of Mother, to me.” “You’re probably right,” I told him. “She’s always had a soft heart. There’s a chance she felt sorry for the boy and set the whole thing up. I can ask her, if you like.” “Don’t worry about it,” Daniel said with a sniff. “Maybe she did and maybe she didn’t. My bet is she had a hand in it, but as long as she only gave him a few thousand, I guess it doesn’t really matter to me.” “Are you ready to go?” I asked, making motions like I was ready to get out of my chair. “Are you really ready to be off this early?” Daniel had to wonder. “I thought you’d probably be up for a second round and here you are, eager to go.” I was eager to go. I wanted to leave in a rather desperate way. And I didn’t just mean the brothel. I wanted out of New York as well. It wasn’t that I was tired of the sights, sounds and smells of a new city, but I wanted to be on my way to Tiburon, Ohio. I had been thinking about it pretty much incessantly since we’d arrived in America, when I could stop thinking about my belly. It wasn’t even homesickness for the castle, as far as I could tell. Something was calling me to that small Ohio town and I couldn’t wait to get there. Chapter 23 Colette “I’m so proud of you girls,” Papa exclaimed, gathering us both in a big bear hug. “Or should I call you young ladies now that you both have jobs and uniforms and everything?” And then he hugged us again. I loved the pipe-tobacco smell of him, although Mama only permitted him to smoke on the porch. “You should see the ballroom,” Lilly said to him. She’d been brimming with excitement, ever since Millie gave us a tour of the castle’s ground floor. “There are cherubs and goddesses painted everywhere, even on the ceiling. I’ve never seen anything so fancy.” Papa nodded, listening intently and beaming at us. “Now that’s something I wish I could see.” “They might have a family day,” Lilly told him, squeezing his hand and then swinging it back and forth. “So that the families of all the local staff can see where they work. At least that’s what Millie said.” Our father chuckled. That was the third time Lilly had mentioned the other maid since we’d told him the news of our new employment. “Sounds like Millie is your new best friend.” “You should see the library,” Lilly went on. “It’s a huge room with all this gold trim. And books stacked as high as the sky. I think the Vanderlinds probably have more books than the Tiburon Library and I’m not exaggerating. Lettie was over the moon.” “They might let you borrow some,” our father said, stroking my hair. “I’ve heard that the great houses of Europe frequently encourage their staff to borrow books from their libraries, if they have any interest.” Our tour of the castle had been so wonderful, it was almost dizzying. Every room was grander than the last. And we’d only toured the ground floor. “Downstairs maids are never allowed upstairs,” Millie informed us. “Mrs. Denkler is very strict about it.” “Are any of the upstairs maids allowed downstairs?” Lilly asked, half jokingly. “They can come down for meals and stuff,” was the reply. “But they all came over from Hungary and don’t really speak any English, so it’s not all that fun when they do.” “Maybe we can learn to speak some Hungarian,” I suggested. “I actually know a few words,” Millie told us. “My grandfather emigrated from there. That’s how I got this job. He walked over to the castle, knocked on the door, and introduced himself.” “What words do you know?” Lilly asked. Millie’s cheeks turned a little red. “Actually, most of the words I know aren’t appropriate for polite company,” she said in a low voice, and then giggled. “I guess by the time you get to the third generation, that’s all anyone remembers.” Lilly and Millie got on like a house on fire, but I was too busy thinking to pay attention to most of the chatter. Mrs. Denkler was such a peculiar lady and the way she looked at me made me uncomfortable. “Papa, who was Empress Elisabeth?” I asked when Lilly paused for breath. “I’m not sure.” Our father frowned a little and then smiled. “That seems a question out of the blue.” “It’s the reason we got the jobs,” Lilly told him. “The housekeeper thinks that Lettie looks like some royal lady who was stabbed by an anarchist.” “Oh.” Papa’s eyebrows rose high on his forehead. And then he laughed. “Well.. that is one of the more peculiar reasons I’ve ever heard for someone being offered a job.” Lilly bounced up and down, clapping her hands. “I can’t wait to tell Walter,” she exclaimed before dashing out of the room. “You don’t seem as excited as your sister,” Papa said, turning his full attention to me. “I’m excited,” I assured him. “Just in a different way.” If I was being honest, Mrs. Denkler’s comments about how I looked like an Empress who had been stabbed to death unsettled me a little. I’d never found the whole idea of reincarnation very appealing. I was me. I never liked the idea of being anyone but me. Or that I could possibly be just a recycled version of someone who had lived before my time. Chapter 24 Jessie Tiburon was a small town in the middle of Ohio, just like any other small town in America, I had to imagine. But there was something about it that felt so right to me. There was an indefinable magic that hung in the air like pollen on a spring day. Ever since I’d been transformed into a vampire, I found it hard to breathe. — Not that I actually needed to breathe anymore, but I felt a figurative tightness in my chest. — But as we arrived in Tiburon, in a motorcade of black sedans, I felt that tightness begin to dissipate. To my mind, becoming a member of the undead meant the end of my life. But being in Tiburon somehow made me feel like I had the chance to live again. I couldn’t have an ordinary life, but I started to feel that maybe I could somehow find happiness. Or maybe it was just the absence of Grandfather that lifted my spirits. He’d been a black cloud hovering over the family for my entire life. I hated to be the kind of ugly person who was made happier by another person’s demise, but Grandfather was an incredibly difficult man to be around. Plus the knowledge that my beloved sister would not face the same curse of immortality as the rest of us put joy in my heart. When my grandfather was a young man, the Vanderlind Castle was in the country. As he grew into a young man, Budapest also grew, expanding to the point that the castle was on the outskirts of town. By the time I was born, the city had swallowed up the open fields that had always surrounded the castle. Our home had become part of the metropolis. Even though Budapest was a city with many architectural beauties, the castle always looked out of place there. It wasn’t meant to be crowded on all sides by the bustle of urban living. That’s why, when I first caught sight of the castle as we made our midnight arrival in Tiburon, it really resonated with me. The castle appeared at home; more so than it ever had in Budapest. It felt like the structure was meant to be there, majestically standing on the shores of the Tiburon River. It felt like home. “My God,” Daniel exclaimed as we exited the cars. “Grandfather must have really been losing his marbles if he thought putting the castle here was a good idea. I’m surprised he didn’t relocate us to a swamp.” “Stop being such a sourpuss, Daniel,” our mother gently chided him. “You might find that you grow to appreciate country living.” My brother made a little snorting sound through his nose. “I know I’m immortal, but I doubt I’ll ever live that long.” Mrs. Denkler was there to greet us bearing three glasses of refreshment on a tray. I don’t know how she managed to arrange for the blood already. I hoped it wasn’t through anything unsavory. But the Vanderlind housekeeper was as fastidious as she was well-mannered. I somehow doubted that she would do anything illegal. “The house is almost completely ready,” she informed us, once we exchanged the most minimal of greetings. “Except for the chandeliers in the great hall. There have been some challenges there and I’m afraid they have yet to be hung.” “That’s quite alright, Mrs. Denkler,” our mother told her. “I have the foreman’s promise that they’ll be in place by tomorrow afternoon,” the housekeeper insisted. “That’s fine,” Mother said, trying to reassure her. “We’re just excited to be home.” Mrs. Denkler stepped out of the way so that she could gesture toward the front door. “Welcome back to your home.” It was so strange to wander the rooms of the castle, seeing each thing exactly in its place, as it had been back in Budapest. Mrs. Denkler must have had a photographic memory to been so exact. I only found the smallest of indiscretions as far as replicating the exact setup of our home. A few shirts that I liked to keep in a drawer had been hung up in the closet, and my cufflinks and shirt studs were in the wrong box. But that was all I could find. It was remarkable. Was Mrs. Denkler really that familiar with the intimacies of my room? That surprised me. Or maybe she was just incredibly intuitive. As dawn broke over Tiburon, I lay down on my bed, hoping to lose myself to a few hours of oblivion,— I had not yet accustomed myself to sleeping in a coffin — but rest did not come to me. I felt a great anticipation deep in my belly and the sensation prevented me from being able to lie quietly. I rolled around on the bed for a few hours, even attempting the first chapter of several books, before getting up and dressing. One of the benefits of the castle was its noticeable lack of windows. A member of the undead could climb from his coffin at midnight or at high noon and still have no fear of shriveling in the sun. I could hear a bit of commotion coming from downstairs, so I wandered down to see what was causing the hubbub. It was a dozen workmen in the great hall trying to suspend one of the enormous chandeliers that some relative had seen fit to purchase for the castle. Each chandelier was bedecked with over a thousand leaded crystals, which made the fixtures enormously heavy. The men had assembled scaffolding and a pulley system to hoist the chandelier up, inch-by-inch, to the vaulted ceiling. I didn’t envy them their task, but it was a marvel to watch. Many members of the castle’s staff were standing around the edges of the room in order to take in the spectacle. I strolled across the polished stone floor with my eyes glued to the dangling crystals of the chandelier. They were all singing as they swayed and clinked together. Their music caused me a pang of sadness. I would never again see the scores of rainbows created by the prisms when they were caught in direct sunlight. I heard a small gasp. It was like a whisper being carried by the wind. I turned my eyes to see a beautiful young woman with tresses of dark hair spilling around her shoulder. And then my world fell away. I could see nothing and no one but her. It was as if my world had been blank and this girl appeared to fill it. She was dressed in black with a white apron. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew her clothing was significant, but somehow that didn’t matter. Somehow, deep inside of me, I knew we were meant to be together. And she was looking at me too. Her eyes were glued to me and she wore the most astonished expression on her face. She opened her mouth and I thought she might speak to me, but then she looked up and started to scream. I had been so captivated by the beautiful creature standing before me that I didn’t realize the workmen had somehow lost control of the massive chandelier. It was crashing toward the ground, heading for the very spot on which I stood. If it hadn’t been for my lightning fast undead reflexes and my incredible ability to heal, I would have been squashed like a bug under a barman’s boot. Even still, I was knocked to the ground. The young woman came running toward me. “Somebody call a doctor!” Pointing toward one of the footmen, she commanded, “Call a doctor this instant,” as if she was the mistress of the castle. Kneeling down, she took my hand. The mere touch of her skin made me feel like my heart had started beating again. “Don’t move,” she said, in a voice that was so lovely it made me shiver. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” I told her, unable to tear my eyes away from her face. “You’re not fine,” she insisted. “You just had a massive chandelier nearly crush you. You’re lucky to still be alive.” “Very lucky,” I whispered, looking deep into her eyes of emerald green. “Because it allowed me to meet you.” She laid her hand to her cheek and shook her head a little. “Oh, how can you flirt at a time like this? I think you must be in shock.” She scanned my body with an assessing eye. “I hope you don’t have any internal injuries.” “I’m fine,” I insisted, trying to untangle myself from the giant arms of the chandelier. “Perhaps a twisted ankle, but that’s all.” My ankle felt fine, but I thought it would be too peculiar if I suffered no injuries at all. “I don’t think you should try to get up,” she told me, pressing her hands gently against my chest to try to coax me back onto the floor. “The doctor will be here soon, I’m sure.” I lay back for a moment, toying with the idea of allowing her to tend to me for a little while longer. But I knew that plan was ungentlemanly, so I decided it was better to get to my feet. “I promise you I am not injured,” I told her. “But perhaps you could be good enough to assist me to a chair.” “Yes, of course,” she said. As she said, put an arm around me to help me to my feet, I felt a moment of sheer happiness. “What is your name?” I asked as she helped me to a small loveseat. Once I was seated, she tried to pull away, but I held onto her hands so that she was forced to take the seat next to me. “Colette Gibson,” she told me. “But most people call me Lettie.” “Colette Gibson,” I said, tasting the words in my mouth. “It’s a great pleasure to meet you, Miss Colette Gibson,” I told her. “I’m Jessie Vanderlind.” “Vander…” The girl gulped. “It’s very nice to meet you, Mr. Jessie Vanderlind.” Then she added, “But I’m horribly concerned that you’re injured. Are you sure you’re not feeling any discomfort?” she asked, her lovely brow furrowing slightly. “I feel wonderful,” I assured her. “If I wanted to, I’m sure I could fly.” Chapter 25 Colette The week before school let out was excruciatingly long for me. I wasn’t even sure how I got through my final exams. In between studying, I looked up the Empress Elisabeth in an encyclopedia at the school library. It took a little research, but I finally managed to find a photograph of the Empress of Austria, who was also the Queen of Hungary. It was a snapshot of her on her coronation day, back in 1867. She was a beautiful young woman with a curvy figure. Her neck and hands were dripping with pearls and other extravagant jewelry. Her hair appeared to be dark brown in color and she had an abundant amount of it. But beyond the hair, I wasn’t sure how much the Empress and I shared in appearance. She was very beautiful, but she also looked a little forlorn as she gazed into the lens of the camera. Her eyes appeared plaintiff and solemn. It wasn’t how I imagined a person would look after just having a crown of diamonds and pearls placed on her head. I thought I might be a little happier about it. But then the encyclopedia went on to explain that she didn’t have a very happy life. And it turned out that the anarchist stabbed her simply because he had missed the opportunity to stab a Duke who claimed to be an heir to the French throne. He vowed to stab the next royal he encountered. Elisabeth was that unfortunately soul. Even staring at her photograph, I felt no connection to her. At least not in the way that Mrs. Denkler had implied. If anything, I felt a little sorry for her, as much as a cat can feel sorry for a king. No, I was positive there was no connection beyond that. I had to conclude that the whole concept of reincarnation was simply hogwash. Finally, after what felt like an excruciatingly long week, it was Lily and my first day as housemaids at the castle. We’d each been issued two black dressed as our uniforms. Mama had pinned and tucked them until they fit us perfectly. Lilly spent an extensive amount of time trying to tame my wild hair. The Empress probably was able to afford a personal hairstylist because her excessively long and quite curly hair had looked perfect for her coronation day. Mine just ended up barely staying piled on my head with a few dozen hairpins. Both Papa and Mama drove us out to the castle to drop us off for our first day at the castle. Papa brought along his camera and stopped the car on the long driveway, just outside the gate. “I want you to know I’m very proud of you girls,” he said as he positioned us so that he could make a photo with the castle in the background. “I’m sure this Mrs. Denkler has hired many a young woman to work at the castle in her day. And with the way the economy is, I’m sure there was more than one woman with experience who applied for the position.” Lilly and I stood still, and very close to each other, so he could make the photograph. “She must have seen something in the two of you,” Papa went on. “She must have sensed that you are proper young ladies and that you will do the Vanderlind Castle justice.” He cleared his throat. “And I hope you remember…’ “Okay, I think that’s enough, dear,” Mama said, touching him gently on the arm. “We don’t want the girls to be late. Especially on their first day.” Millie answered the door again when I rang the bell. “You don’t have to ring, sillies,” she said. “You work here now. You can just let yourselves in.” “I guess I just assumed the door would be locked,” I explained, fussing with my hair. Several of the bobby pins were already trying to make their escape. I think their plan was made easier by the excessive amount of hair lotion Lilly had applied. That made it simple for them to slide free. Millie frowned at the door and then looked back at us. “It hasn’t been locked since I started working here.” First thing we did was report to Mrs. Denkler. We found her in the hallway, just outside the kitchen. She looked us both over while fishing her watch from her pocket. Once she was satisfied that we were on time, she snapped the cover closed on the watch and said, “A housemaid’s hair should always be neat and tidy.” “I’m sorry,” I blurted, knowing her comment was aimed at me. “I seem to have put too much lotion in my hair and now it’s decided to rebel. I promise I’ll get it to behave better tomorrow.” Mrs. Denkler eyed my hair one more time before saying, “There are several things you need to know about the Vanderlind family.” She started walking and snapped her fingers at us to let us know we needed to keep pace. “The family keeps late hours,” she said. “They all suffer, to varying degrees, from a rare condition that makes them very vulnerable to the sun.” She glanced back at both of us to make sure that we were being attentive. “Because of this malady, they usually adjust their schedules to sleep most of the day and only get up when the sun is low in the sky or has already set.” That explained why we were told to arrive for work at ten o’clock. It had seemed a late hour to begin the work day. “You may be asked to work later in the evening on some occasions. This is to accommodate the family and we expect you to adjust your personal schedule accordingly.” Lilly and I exchanged glances. Millie mentioned nothing about odd work hours when she showed us around. I had to wonder what Mama and Papa would think. We’d planned on riding our bicycles to work in good weather, but I was sure they wouldn’t let us ride home alone after dark. “There is illness in the family,” Mrs. Denkler went on. “One of the sons, Arthur, suffers from hemophilia. It’s a rare blood disease and he needs blood transfusions several times a day.” “Isn’t that the same disease that the last czar’s little boy suffered from?” I asked. “The son from the Russian royal family who were assassinated during the revolution.” Mrs. Denkler spent a few moments assessing me with her stern eyes. “Yes, I know perfectly well of whom you are speaking and I believe it is similar,” she finally said. “Not much is known about the disease.” She continued walking. “As I was saying, Arthur suffers from hemophilia. Therefore the family is in constant need of blood to keep him alive. We have set up a small clinic in the back of the castle,” she informed us. “You can tell your friends and family, that if any of them care to donate a pint of blood, they will receive two dollars, a sandwich and some apple juice or coffee for their troubles.” Lilly and I exchanged another look. Two dollars was a full day’s pay for many people. We would both be earning just over three dollars for a full day’s work at the castle and those were considered excellent wages for untrained labor. “I’m sure we know a lot of people who would be happy to help out,” Lilly said, speaking up. “Unless...” She stammered a little. “I mean, is it very painful? Donating blood?” “Not in the least,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “And even if it was, with two dollars in your pocket, I should think most people would be willing to put up with a little pain.” We both nodded, not wanting to annoy her. “Arthur Vanderlind is not to be disturbed under any circumstances,” Mrs. Denkler said, eyeing us both. “Even entering his room is cause for immediate dismissal.” We crossed a large room where several men were hammering together a large piece of scaffolding. “Don’t bother the family at any time, but especially when they are resting. You are never to go upstairs unless directly ordered to do so by me. And you are never to address any member of the Vanderlind family, unless they address you first. Do I make myself clear?” Mrs. Denkler glared at us again. “Yes,” we both said in timid voices. The lady had to be close to seventy, but she was still very formidable. I wouldn’t have crossed her for ten silver dollars. “Besides, it’s not part of your duties to be in the bedrooms,” she said, leading us down a large hallway. “Your work is solely downstairs.” She opened a door and ushered us in. “Oh,” I said with a gasp of excitement. We were back in the library. The wonderful smell of books filled my nostrils. “You’ll get started in here,” she said, producing two feather dusters, seemingly out of nowhere. “Start at one end and work your way to the other. And don’t forget the top shelves, because I’ll check.” She turned to leave, but then paused. “I almost forgot,” she said. “It’s against the rules of the castle for the staff to wear any kind of personal adornment. That means no rings, no bracelets, no pedants, no jewelry of any kind. If I catch you wearing so much as a christening pendant, it’s grounds for immediate dismissal.” I had a silver and crystal pendant that I always wore. It was only about the size of a nickel and not very flashy in any way, but it was the prettiest thing I owned and I loved it. “So you mean something like this...” I began, indicating the pendant. “Is completely unacceptable,” the housekeeper told me. “If I see it around your neck tomorrow, you’ll be fired on the spot.” Then she left the room without another word. We both stood, gazing at the enormous room. It held more books than even a voracious reader could go through in a lifetime. “You must be in heaven,” Lilly murmured. “How are we are going to dust all of these?” I murmured back. Lilly smoothed her apron. “I guess we’ll start in one corner and work our way around,” she said. “It will probably only take seven or eight years.” “Yes,” I agreed with her, “but then the first books will be dusty again.” We both giggled. Then Lilly squared her shoulders and said, “Alright, I guess we’re housemaids now. Let’s get started.” We decided to make a game of it, with Lilly working along one wall and me working along another. They had those rolling ladders like in the Tiburon library, so it was easier to reach the books on the highest shelves. Lilly was much faster at dusting than I was because I wasted a lot of time browsing. I couldn’t help myself; there were so many intriguing titles luring me away from my task. My hair was in open revolt, expelling bobby pins whenever it saw the opportunity. I tried to collect them when they fell, hoping I’d have a chance to pin my tresses back up when we were given a break for lunch. I knew having my hair hanging down would not please Mrs. Denkler, but there was nothing I could do about it for the time being. After we’d been working for a couple of hours, the door to the library opened and Millie came in. “There you are,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere, but this castle is just so big that I kept getting lost.” “What is it?” Lilly asked, climbing down from her ladder. “Are we needed somewhere else? We’re not even half way through in here.” “No, it’s just that they’re hanging the chandeliers in the great hall and I thought you might like to see it,” the other maid told her. This news perked me right up and I descended my ladder immediately. “That’s definitely something I would like to see.” Lilly wasn’t so sure. “Are we allowed to stop working?” she asked. “I’d hate to get in trouble for shirking our duties on the very first day.” “Oh, the Vanderlinds won’t mind,” Millie insisted. “They’re all asleep, anyway. And I’m sure Mrs. Denkler won’t have a problem with it. She’s in there herself.” “Well…” Lilly thought it over. “Oh, come on,” Millie urged. “You have to see how massive these chandeliers are. They’re like the size of a car, with a million prisms hanging off of each one. They’re amazing.” The temptation was too much, so the three of us hurried back to the great hall. I could not believe the amount of scaffolding the men had built in order to raise the chandeliers. Taking into consideration the amount of ropes and pulleys they were using, I wouldn’t have been surprised if someone told me the giant fixtures weighed a thousand pounds each. I guess that was one of the benefits of living in a building constructed out of stone, you could hang heavy things off the ceiling. Millie was right about the chandeliers being magnificent. Even without sunshine lighting up the room, the prisms still practically glowed on their own. They made a delicate music bumping into each other as they swayed back and forth, each suspended from its own small hook. They were so beautiful; I couldn’t imagine owning just one of the little jewels, let alone having an enormous chandelier festooned with them. It looked like the entire staff of the castle was there, mesmerized while watching the first chandelier slowly inching higher and higher toward the vaulted ceiling. That’s why everyone was caught by surprise when one of the Vanderlinds appeared from above stairs and walked to the center of the room, craning his neck so he could take in the show. There was something about the back of the young man’s head that drew my attention. He was tall and well-formed with dark hair that was ruffled on top, as if he’d just gotten up after tossing and turning in bed for a few hours. He was dressed in a crisp white shirt and gray flannel pants that were obviously tailor made to fit him perfectly. One of the workmen hit a snag in the rope he was using to help hoist the chandelier. He called out a few words in a language that I didn’t understand. Some of the men stopped pulling on their ropes and others began pulling rather frantically. The chandelier began to sway harder and it tilted to the side. “Oh,” I exclaimed. I didn’t know what they were going to do to straighten it out. And I didn’t know how they were going to clean the chandeliers once they attached them to the vaulted ceiling. I glanced back down again and got the surprise of my life. The young man was looking directly at me. Suddenly I found it hard to breathe. His face was just so beautiful, with stormy gray eyes, pale skin and full lips. I felt like he wasn’t just looking at me, but that he was seeing into my very soul. Thousands of little shivers ran up my spine as I finally put a face to the young man who had been haunting my dreams. When I realized this, my mouth popped open. I wanted to speak to him. I wanted to just be with him, to stand by his side. It was like he was the only man in the world and I was the only woman. My fixation with the castle suddenly all made sense. I somehow knew that he would live there. It felt like his heart had called me to him and I was powerless to resist. In another instant I was screaming. The chandelier had somehow broken free from the ropes and pulleys. It was crashing toward the ground. And the young man who had just stolen my heart was standing underneath it. My piercing shriek startled him. He looked up and was only able to throw his arms over his head before the massive chandelier crushed him. Chapter 30 Colette People just stood there. It was as if everyone was waiting for someone else to do something. I had a moment of that myself. I kept thinking, I’m just a maid and this is my first day. Surely someone else will come to his aid. Someone in charge will take command of the crisis. But everyone was acting like they were frozen to the ground. And I couldn’t bear the thought of the poor young man suffering. So I hurried forward, shouting as I ran, “Call a doctor. Somebody call a doctor.” Dropping to my knees, I reached out to clutch his hand. Merely touching him sent a charge through me like I had grabbed a live wire. I’d finally met the man of my dreams and he was probably hemorrhaging internally. The thought made me want to shriek and burst into tears. But I had to be brave for him. If he was going to die, then I had to be there to comfort him during his last moments on earth. He’d stolen my heart and we’d never even have the chance to say hello. “Don’t move,” I said, trying to keep a tremor out of my voice. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” he told me, sitting up. “You can’t be fine,” I insisted. “You just have a giant chandelier drop on your head.” This made him smile. “No, I really am fine,” he assured me. “I think maybe I just wrenched my ankle.” And shockingly, he was fine. I kept expecting him to collapse from internal bleeding, but somehow he’d only twisted his ankle. It was a miracle. My heart sang with joy. I helped him to a loveseat and we both sat there, holding each other’s hand. He introduced himself as Jessie Vanderlind. It was a name I knew I would be whispering in my dreams for the rest of my life. “Mr. Vanderlind,” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed, hurrying over. “I do hope you’re alright.” “Fine,” he said, only glancing briefly in her direction before returning his gaze to me. “Better than fine, in fact.” His eyes were shimmering gray clouds before a sudden spring shower. “I’m so glad to hear that,” the housekeeper said. “It’s quite the relief. I’m afraid in all the commotion, our new housemaid has forgotten her place.” “Her place?” Jessie mused, frowning at where I was sitting, as if he couldn’t quite make out the words Mrs. Denkler was saying to him. “She’s perfectly fine, I should think.” And then he asked me, “Are you comfortable? You’ve had quite a shock. Would you maybe like a glass of water?” I couldn’t believe he was asking about my well being. Of course I was alright. Besides the shock of almost seeing a man crushed to death by a thousand pounds of leaded crystal. And the fact that, in the few seconds between when I’d had first laid eyes on Jessie Vanderlind and when the chandelier had knocked him to the ground, I had fallen in love with him. “Get up, girl,” Mrs. Denkler snapped, grabbing me by the arm and hauling me to my feet. “You should be working, not lounging on a couch, harassing Mr. Vanderlind.” “She wasn’t harassing me,” Jessie insisted. “In fact, I was very much enjoying her company.” Mrs. Denkler pursed her lips together, giving me a fierce look. “Miss Gibson, I think it’s time you got back to work.” She raised her head and looked around the room. “Everyone who wants to keep their job should get back to work immediately.” People started hurrying out of the room. “Come with me, young lady,” the housekeeper snarled, still holding my arm in a vice-like grip. I was marched back to the library, where Lilly was already ensconced, furiously dusting, pretending that she’d been there the entire time. Mrs. Denkler released me, practically thrusting me from her side. “I knew it was a mistake to hire such a pretty girl,” she said. “It always is.” “Please don’t fire me, Mrs. Denkler,” I said. It would have been so humiliating. I didn’t know how I would face my parents. “I promise I won’t goof off ever again. I’m a good worker, I swear.” “I’m not so much worried about your work ethic as I’m worried about you making eyes at the Vanderlind boys. I know they’re rich and handsome, but trust me when I say that boys like that aren’t for the likes of you.” I looked down, feeling like I might burst into tears. She was right. I was being an idiot. Someone like Jessie Vanderlind would never even consider someone like me. He lived in a castle and I worked at the castle. Even when we were in the same room, we were still a million worlds apart. “I know,” I told her, unable to raise my voice much louder than a whisper. “I’m not going to let you go,” Mrs. Denkler said, after giving it some serious thought. “You remind me too much of…” She shook her head. “Well, that is neither here nor there. But I will say this; you are not to speak with Jessie Vanderlind. You are not to flirt with him. You are not to even gaze at him from a distance. If you are cleaning a room and he steps inside it, then you must immediately vacate that room and report directly to me. Do you understand?” “Yes.” “I’m just telling you this for your own good,” she informed me. “You’d think a girl your age would have more sense than you do.” “I understand,” I said, doing my best to keep my voice steady. Mama and Papa hadn’t said anything directly to us, but I’d overheard them talking a few nights ago while they were both drying the dishes. Papa hadn’t had any real work in over two months. The extra money we would be bringing home was really going to help. “I’m lucky to have this job,” I told her. “Yes,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I suppose you are. And I’m happy to let you keep it, just as long as you remember your place. Jessie Vanderlind is a very engaging young man when he wants to be, but just remember what I told you. He is to be left alone. Even if another giant chandelier comes crashing down on his head.” Chapter 26 Jessie I went back to my room and sat down on the bed. It felt like someone had just socked me in the stomach. The world was not fair. That much was obvious. If the world was fair, then I would still be human. That way I would be at liberty to fall in love with Miss Colette Gibson. I could woo her, and win her, and marry her. Then I could take her in my arms and kiss her and not fear that I would lose control and rip out her throat. But the world wasn’t fair. And I could not allow myself to fall in love. I thought about instructing Mrs. Denkler to let the girl go. There would be some kind of compensation, of course, but the smart thing to do would be to bar Colette from the castle. But I somehow couldn’t bring myself to do it. And why should the young woman lose her position just because I found her attractive? But it was more than finding her physically beautiful. The way she rushed to my aid when everyone else was standing and staring spoke of a kind heart, a brave heart. And when she’d clasped my hand, the sensation I’d felt was like nothing I’d ever experienced. It was like nothing I’d ever read about in books. Love at first sight always sounded so foolish to me. You couldn’t fall in love with someone after just looking at them. Love was built on knowing someone and having shared experiences and finding out you had a million little things in common. Love at first sight was just an expression perpetuated by novelists and palm readers. But all of my strongly held convictions about love melted away with the knowledge that a girl like Colette Gibson existed in the world. I said her name over and over again and it was ambrosia in my mouth. I kept playing the few brief moments we had spent together over and over again in my head. It felt like I would never be able to stop thinking about her. I rose from my bed several times to find her and then sat back down again. Seeking Miss Gibson would not be a good idea, but it was as if my body had a mind of its own. Any practical decisions I made were quickly overruled. When would Colette be done working for the day? I was half tempted to ring for Mrs. Denkler to find out. But I instantly knew that was a bad idea. Denkie was very protective of the family. If she sensed that I was unduly attracted to the girl, she would fire her on the spot. No, I had to keep my feelings to myself. I had to find a way to deny them. There was no one in which I could confide. I had to find a way to deny my love all on my own. After an hour of just staring at the wall, there was a gentle knock at my door. “Come in,” I called. In walked my sister. “Hello, brother,” she said, hurrying over and bestowing my cheek with a kiss. “I heard what happened with the chandelier and I wanted to check on you. Are you hurt?” I gave her a quick squeeze, trying not to think about how I had yet to eat that day. “I’m fine,” I assured her. “But I guess it’s fortunate that Grandfather turned me when he did or I would have been squashed like a bug under the heel of a boot.”",

It wasn’t the idea of a strong man, but the lightning strike of love had made me weak. “If I asked you to do something for me, would you be able to keep it a secret?” “What kind of secret?” Emily asked, her eyes instantly shining. “It’s not that big of a secret,” I told her, just something I’d like to keep from Old Denkie.” After a bit of thought, I added, “And probably Mother and Daniel.” “I can keep a secret,” she assured me. “I promise,” she said, crossing her heart. “Now what is it?” “I want you to find out what you can about a girl. She’s a maid that just started working here. But I want you to be very discrete.” “What do you want to know about her?” Emily asked, squirming a little with the excitement of her task. “Not much, really. I’d just like to know the days that she’ll be working here. And maybe the hours she’ll be working. And anything else you happen to find out.” “Because you like her?” Emily asked, wearing a big smile. “No.” I shook my head. “I’m not allowed to care about mortals anymore. You know that.” And then, before she could worry, I hastily added, “The only mortal I’m still allowed to love is you.” “So you do like her,” Emily said. “You love her,” she concluded with the perceptiveness of youth. “I don’t even know her,” I exclaimed. “If you’re going to let your imagination run away with you, then I’m sorry I asked. Please forget that I said anything.” “No, I’ll find out for you,” she said, giving me a sly look out of the corner of her eye. “I want to find out. And I’ll be clever about it. I promise.” With that, she got to her feet and started heading for the door. “Oh,” she said, stopping abruptly. “But you have to tell me; what’s her name?” I suppressed a sigh before telling her, “Colette Gibson.” Chapter 27 Colette Lilly and I were in the mud room, taking off our aprons and getting ready to head home for the day. We’d spent most of our afternoon finishing up the library. The time passed as a blur for me. I couldn’t even focus on the titles of the books I was dusting. All of my thoughts were consumed by the memory of Jessie Vanderlind. Part of me felt like I should apologize to Lilly. I had thought her tunnel focus on spending time with Walter had been foolish and a little immature. But just a few minutes with Jessie Vanderlind had made me realize that I was wrong. I knew nothing about him, yet all I wanted to do was be with him. Before that moment, I had never understood how deeply people could love. When I first looked into Jessie Vanderlind’s eyes, the first instant that I saw him, I felt like there was a violin string running through my body and someone had plucked it. I could still feel it vibrating, deep in the very core of me, even thought I hadn’t seen Jessie for hours. The door opened and a young girl stepped inside the small room. “Hello,” she said to me, giving me a hesitant smile. “Hello,” I said in reply. The girl looked to be eleven or twelve. She was very pretty with blonde, curly hair and large gray eyes. She wore a velvet dress and shiny Mary Jane shoes. I knew without guessing that she had to be a member of the Vanderlind family. No one else in Tiburon could afford such fine clothes. Maybe for a wedding, but not for just wandering around the house on a Monday evening. “What’s your name?” the girl asked. “My name is Lettie,” I told her. “And this is my sister, Lilly.” The girl smiled and tilted her head to one side. “Is Lettie short for something? Colette, maybe?” “That’s right,” I said. “What your name?” “I’m Emily,” she told me. “How do you do?” “How do you do?” I replied, suppressing a vague urge to drop a curtsy; she was so adorably formal. “How many days a week will you work here?” she asked. It seemed like an odd question, but I didn’t mind indulging a curious child. “We’re supposed to work ten to seven, every day, but Sunday,” I told her. “But Mrs. Denkler just told us this morning that we might have to work later some evenings.” “And you’re a maid?” Emily asked. Expanding her question to include my sister, she said. “You’re both maids?” “Yes,” I told her. “We’re both downstairs maids. And are you a Vanderlind? Or maybe the chauffeur.” “Yes,” she said with a broad smile. “I’m the chauffeur.” Then she hastily added, “But I’m also a Vanderlind. Jessie’s my brother.” Then her cheeks grew red for some reason and she dashed out of the room. I had to wonder what my brief exchange with Emily Vanderlind was all about. I couldn’t remember if she’d been in the great hall, watching the men raise the chandelier. Had her brother spoken to her about me? I immediately chastised myself for such a flight of fancy. Mr. Jessie Vanderlind would never have any interest in a girl like me. Mrs. Denkler had made that abundantly clear. “Come on. Let’s go,” Lilly said, breaking me out of my musings. “Papa’s probably waiting.” I had trouble sleeping that night. I kept waking up, thinking someone was in the room with us. It startled me to the point that I half considered waking Lilly. But I knew I was being foolish, so instead I got out of bed, put on my robe and went to sit by the window. The moon was only half full, so it was a perfect night to just sit and gaze at the stars. I’d heard that there were so many electric lights in New York City that the stars were washed away and you couldn’t really see them at night. That wasn’t the case in Tiburon. It was a small town. Actually, there were some houses on the outskirts of town that still didn’t even have electricity. I sighed, looking up at the sky. I’d always yearned for something outside of the life laid out before me. It wasn’t that I didn’t love my family and the house where we lived. I even enjoyed our modest town. But I’d always secretly pined for something more that I couldn’t place my finger on. And now that yearning had a name; Jessie Vanderlind. Movement in a nearby tree startled me a little and drew my attention. The trees were nothing but black silhouettes at night. I stared at the closest trees rather intently for several seconds. Was there something up in the apple tree, over toward the trunk? It was a dark form, but too large to be an owl or any other kind of bird. There was definitely a mass in the tree and I thought I had seen it move. I scanned the ground below the tree. I didn’t see a ladder or a car or anything. The apple’s lowest branches were too far up for anyone to climb up there without assistance. What in the world was in our tree? Feeling a shiver running up my spine, I drew the curtains and hurried back to bed. I knew I was being foolish, but I couldn’t shake the distinct feeling that someone or something was watching me. The next morning I slept in a little. I was tired from my bout of insomnia. One of the benefits of having a job that didn’t start until ten o’clock was that I didn’t have to get up at the crack of dawn. By the time I opened my eyes; Lilly had already gotten out of bed and opened the curtains. It seemed silly to be nervous about looking outside in full daylight, but I had a flash of anxiety. Whatever I had caught a glimpse of out the window during the night had seemed very real. But in the bright light of day, I felt ashamed of my cowardice. I forced myself to stand up straight and walk over to the window. There in the tree branches, where I had thought I’d seen a creature the previous evening, was a large squirrel’s nest. I immediately felt like a fool, but at least it explained why I’d seen movement in the tree. What it didn’t explain was how a sizeable squirrel’s nest had magically appeared overnight. And didn’t squirrels usually build their nests in the fall? I wasn’t a squirrel expert, but I didn’t think they did their building in the spring. I shrugged it off. I had always thought of myself as an observant person, but I’d obviously overlooked a large nest just outside of the window I gazed out of every day of my life. As I came downstairs, I could hear Lilly talking with our parents. “It’s because their one son has some kind of blood disease,” she was telling them. “I wonder what kind of disease that would be,” I heard my mother say. “It seems an awful lot of money.” As I walked into the kitchen, I heard my father shift his chair. “If they have the means, and don’t want to run out of blood, then it’s probably a smart move.” “I wonder how the poor dear managed to make the voyage from Europe, if he’s in such bad shape,” Mother said. Then she noticed me as I headed over to the breakfast nook. “Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” “I had trouble sleeping,” I said, helping myself to some toast from a plate. “Say, has anybody noticed the big squirrel’s nest up in the apple tree near Lilly and my window? It’s huge, but I don’t remember seeing it before. When did the squirrels build that?” “That’s been there for months,” my father informed me. “I’ve half a mind to knock it down.” “I don’t see how it’s hurting anyone,” Mama said in a gentle voice. She was of the strong conviction that my father didn’t have enough to do. He was always starting small projects and then letting them expand into giant tasks. “I hear Mr. Thorton is putting a new roof on his barn this afternoon. Maybe you could ride over after you drop the girls off and see what that’s all about.” Papa looked at Mama out of the corner of his eye. He knew she was worried that he’d end up cutting down the apple tree if he got started on the squirrels. “I guess I might as well leave the nest alone.” he said. “And Jim Thorton doesn’t know one end of a ladder from the other. I’d better go make sure he doesn’t bust his head.” Chapter 28 Jessie It was embarrassing to admit, but I followed Colette and her sister home. It was really more happenstance than anything intentional. I’d spent the day pacing in my room. I couldn’t get the vision of Colette Gibson out of my head and it was impossible for me to focus on anything else. By nightfall, I was restless and feeling like I needed to stretch my wings, so to speak. I headed to the castle roof. I figured no one would notice if I took a few laps soaring up and down the Tiburon River. I doubted there would be any fisherman around so late in the evening. There might be a few couples canoodling on the shore, but they would probably only have eyes for each other. As I looked over the edge of the castle roof, I could see Colette and her sister climbing into an automobile. It sounded like their father had stopped by to pick them up. I rose into the air as the car drove away, fully intending to stick to the waterway, but then I found myself following the Gibson family through the streets of Tiburon. I hid on a neighboring rooftop as Colette climbed out of the car, following her father and sister into an attractive house with a neat front yard. There was no distinction between the backyard and the open fields dotted with trees behind the house. After that I forced myself to fly back home. It would be inappropriate for me to spy on the family while they ate their dinner. I still missed sitting down to an evening meal each night. I wondered how long I had to be a member of the undead before I forgot how it felt to enjoy food that wasn’t blood red and in a cup. But after being home for a few hours, I found myself circling the Gibson house again, viewing it from all sides. I just wanted to be near Colette, but I knew there was no excuse for my behavior. I wouldn’t like it very much if there was some stranger sitting outside the castle, just hoping for a glimpse of Emily. So I decided to stop acting like a love-sick fool and go home. Giving one more glance toward the darkened house where a girl lived that I didn’t even know, I was shocked to see that very girl gazing out the window. There was no time for me to fly away before she would notice me, so I concealed myself in the branches of a tree. I knew she must have caught a glimpse of me because, after staring in my direction for several seconds, she swiped the curtain closed. I sat in the apple tree for at least an hour, never taking my eyes off the window. I wanted to make sure that no one was peeking out. Then I quickly gathered as many dead leaves and dried grasses as I could find, rolled it all into a ball and stuffed it into the crook of the tree where I had tried to conceal myself. It wasn’t the best deception, but it was the only thing I could think of to explain the dark figure that Colette had obviously glimpsed. I spent the next week trying not to think about Colette and failing miserably. It would have been one thing if she was just some girl I had seen through a shop window and found attractive. But I had spoken to Colette. I knew the music of her voice. She had rushed to my aid when she thought I was grievously injured. She had held my hand and tried to ease my pain, not realizing she was creating the excruciating pain of longing, just by doing so. And then the fates had arranged it so she was in my home six days a week, dusting, and polishing, and scrubbing at things. It was true that the castle was an enormous structure. It was easy enough to avoid someone else in the building, if that was what you desired. But I desired to be with Colette every minute of every day. Keeping away from her was exquisite torture. I was acting like an idiot. I knew that without a doubt. Colette Gibson was just a charming young woman who had caught my fancy. There was nothing more to it. I arose each evening with the new determination to forget about the pretty housemaid who probably thought no more of me than she did my brother. “Your sweethearts going to a dance,” my sister told me one evening after I had just gotten out of bed and made my way downstairs. Emily had become very good at engaging Colette in casual conversation, whenever she had the chance. I hadn’t asked her to pursue more information from the maid after my first request, but she somehow decided to take it upon herself. “She isn’t my sweetheart,” I told her in a stern voice. “And I’m sorry I asked you to find out about her in the first place. She’s just a young woman who works in this house and she deserves her privacy.” “So you don’t want to know about the dance?” Emily asked, her eyes a little wide with surprise. “No,” I told her, trying to make my voice sound firm, although inwardly I felt stung. I couldn’t imagine Colette going to a dance with any young man, but me. “You don’t want to know that it’s next Saturday night at the Mansfield Country Club in Mansfield, Ohio?” she said. I could tell that my sister was enjoying taunting me. “It’s none of my business,” I informed her. “And I want to hear nothing more about it.” The truth was I desperately wanted to hear about it, but knowing the details would do me no good. “And I suppose you don’t care that she doesn’t want to go because she doesn’t like her date,” Emily said, her voice teasing. “Why would she go if she doesn’t like her date?” I couldn’t help but asked. My little sister shrugged. “I guess she’s double dating with her sister and her boyfriend,” she said. “She wants to get out of it, but then her sister wouldn’t be able to go.” “Oh,” I said. This piece of information made me frown. Any man would be lucky to having Colette Gibson as his date, so I assumed her escort would behave like a gentleman, but that didn’t explain her reluctance to go. “There’s going to be swing music,” Emily went on. “Aren’t you a fan of swing music?” “I enjoy all types of music,” I muttered, still thinking about Lettie’s date. “Maybe you should get out some evening and go see a swing band,” Emily suggested with a suppressed giggle in her voice. I immediately understood what she was suggesting. “No,” I told her, shaking my head. “That wouldn’t be right.” “Why not?” Emily wanted to know. “Then maybe you could talk with her. Or even dance with her.” My little sister’s eyes started glowing again. “Come on,” she said, nudging my arm. “I know you want to.” “Emily,” I said, taking both her hands and bending down so that we were forehead to forehead. “I’m not going to any dance. Not a mortal dance,” I informed her. “You know that would be dangerous for everyone, including me.” “But you’re getting a lot better at controlling your appetite. Aren’t you?” she asked, leaning her weight slightly onto me. “I am, but a dance is not a place to test my new found self control,” I informed her, straightening my spine, but still holding her hands. “I suppose not,” my little sister said with a sigh. “It’s just that I like her so much. She’s really funny and she seems really nice.” Closing my eyes for a second, I indulged in a sigh of my own. “Can we please not talk about Miss Gibson anymore?” I really didn’t need any more confirmation about how wonderful she was. “She brings flowers to Arthur. Did you know that?” “What?” I opened my eyes and frowned at my little sister. “There have been a couple of days now where she shows up to work with a bouquet of wildflowers,” Emily reported. “I guess Colette and her sister ride over here on their bicycles. Sometimes she stops and cuts Arthur some flowers.” “Why would she bring Arthur wildflowers?” I was puzzled. Arthur didn’t even exist; not that she knew that. “I asked her the same thing.” Emily preened a little, pleased by her own cleverness. “She said that she hoped it might cheer him up a little to have some nature in his room. She said she felt bad that he was sick and couldn’t go outside himself.” “Oh.” I thought this over. “That’s very sweet.” And, unfortunately, it made me admire Miss Gibson even more. “She’s perfect for you,” Emily said. “I mean, really perfect.” “Perfect, except for one thing,” I reminded her, letting go of her hands. “We can never be together.” Chapter 29 Colette I didn’t know if Jessie Vanderlind was avoiding me or if he was never home. Or maybe he was always just in another part of the castle. Their home was so massive and the family usually slept so late, that it wasn’t unusual for us to never see any of them for days at a time. Except for the youngest girl, Emily. She seemed to be a morning person. She usually popped by to see Lilly and me at least once a day and frequently found a reason to spend time in whichever room we happened to be cleaning. She was a charming girl and I felt a little sorry for her. The rest of the family never seemed to be around, so she rambled the house by herself most of the time. Sometimes Emily would go to the back of the house where the makeshift clinic was set up to draw blood from the volunteers. She liked to put on a little apron and play nurse, chatting with the people and serving them sandwiches, along with something to drink. Word had started to spread around Tiburon that the Vanderlinds would pay good money and supply a meal in exchange for a pint of blood. The first few days only two or three people showed up and these were people who looked very down on their luck. But it didn’t take long before there was a line of people each morning as the nurses hired to draw the blood opened the back door. The clinic began using a signup sheet where people were supposed to write their names. But then it became clear that some of the people willing to volunteer were unable to sign their names, so rather than embarrass some poor fellow who was struggling, the nurses started listing the names themselves. It didn’t take long before the Vanderlinds had more blood than they could handle, but they never turned anyone away. We’d heard that some of the local hospitals were happy to take what could be spared and that rumor was confirmed by men in white jackets driving up to the castle in an ambulance and then leaving with chests packed full of ice. Lilly and I had only caught a few glimpses of the rest of the Vanderlind family, Jessie’s mother and brother. The brother, whose name was Daniel, was a lot like Jessie in general appearance, but he was made with less generous lines. His lips were thin and his hair was flat. He was somewhat handsome, but his features didn’t have the ample curves that Jessie’s had. No one ever saw poor Arthur, of course. He didn’t seem to ever leave his room and his isolation weighed on me. The real surprise was the mother. She didn’t look a day over twenty-five. In fact, she looked more like a sister than a mother to her two sons. She had raven black hair and a flawless complexion. “I wonder what she puts on her face at night to keep it so wrinkle-free,” Lilly said one day while we were having lunch with Millie. “You know, I asked her lady’s maid that very question,” Millie said between bites of a sandwich. “I’m not sure if she just didn’t understand me because of the language barrier, but she insisted that her mistress applied nothing to her face at all. She’s just naturally like that.” “Hmmm...” Lilly frowned. “I’m not sure I believe that. I bet she has some face cream from Europe that costs about a hundred dollars a bottle.” We didn’t have all that much to do as downstairs maids at the castle. Yes, we dusted quite a bit, washed windows, beat rugs, freshened drapes, and whatever else Mrs. Denkler could think of, but none of the things we were assigned to clean were actually all that dirty. If I found a thin layer of dust on any surface, it was always a surprise to me. There were only five Vanderlinds, after all, so it came as no wonder that there wasn’t much of a mess. Plus the family kept barely any kitchen staff. I’d only ever seen Emily seated for a meal. When I asked Mrs. Denkler about it, she said, “Not that it’s any of your business, but the family are practicing vegetarians. They eat very little, and their food is usually raw, so they don’t need a dozen chefs to prepare it.” Even with the peculiarities of the household, I loved working at the castle. The Vanderlinds had such beautiful things, and some of them appeared quite ancient. There were a few full suits of armor that we were assigned to oil one afternoon. We polished ornately carved chairs that were so massive, I thought of them as thrones. And they may very well have been thrones, for all I knew. But the best thing about working at the Vanderlind Castle was that it was where Jessie lived. Although I rarely caught a glimpse of him, I could feel his presence all around me and it kept the metal string running through my body vibrating all the time. “I’ve not been disappointed with your performance,” Mrs. Denkler told the two of us the next morning. Lilly and I exchanged glances. This was high praise from Mrs. Denkler. She went on, “As long as you girls don’t do anything silly, then I’d like to keep you on as part of the downstairs staff.” “Thank you, Mrs. Denkler,” we said in unison. I hadn’t even realized we were still under review. “If you keep up the good work, then after a period of six months you will receive a wage increase of fifty cents per day,” the housekeeper informed us. Lilly and I exchanged another look. That would be a whole extra dollar between us per day. That would be six dollars per week. Mama and Papa would be thrilled. “I’m afraid school starts in the fall,” Lilly felt the need to point out. “I can stay on because I’ve graduated, but our parents will expect Lettie to finish up high school.” “I could still come after school and on Saturdays,” I blurted. I’d been so happy working at the castle that it never occurred to me that I would go back to school. The housekeeper scowled at both of us. “That’s ridiculous,” she said. “Why would you waste your time at school when you already have good paying jobs?” “Our mother and father value education,” I had to admit, even though it pained me. I did not want to go back to school. I wanted to keep working. I wanted to be near Jessie. “I had not anticipated you leaving here so soon,” Mrs. Denkler said, scowling some more. “I might not be as happy with a new girl.” Then she looked me in the eye. “But you’ll stay until your school begins again?” I assured her that I was happy to stay. Since we were firmly established at the castle, Mama and Papa thought it would be okay for us to ride our bicycles to work as the weather grew fine. They were more concerned about us riding home as the sun was going down, so we had to promise to stick together and ride single file, even on the country roads. Some of the local boys liked to race their jalopies in the country and mother was constantly concerned that one of us might be knocked down by the reckless youths. We had to promise to pull off the road immediately if we heard the rattle of a car engine. Riding to work each morning was one of my favorite times of the day. I knew it was foolish, but I always held out hope that I would see Jessie. Not to speak with him or anything, but maybe just to catch a glimpse of him. The fields and meadows that we rode past on our bicycles were decorated with the cheerful faces of wildflowers. They reminded me of a dream I’d had the previous night where I was lying in a field, holding Jessie’s hand while the sun shone down on us and birds performed a serenade. It was a silly dream. Mrs. Denkler had made it clear that the Vanderlinds did not fare well in the sunshine. It made me sad to think about it, especially for poor Arthur. His life sounded very hard, always being confined to his room. “Hold up a minute,” I called to my sister, pulling over to the side of the road. “What is it?” she called, turning to look back at me as she slowed her bike. “Did your chain slip?” “No,” I told her, pushing down my kickstand and hurrying into the nearby field. “I just want to gather some flowers for Arthur, to cheer up his room.” “You’re not allowed in his room,” Lilly reminded me. “I know, but I can put them in a vase and the nurse can take them up the next time he needs a transfusion.” Lilly made a little noise of disapproval that she’d learned from our mother, but she didn’t try to stop me. “Just hurry up, please,” she said. “I don’t want to be late.” I quickly gathered what I could, laid the flowers in my bicycle basket, and then hurried to catch up with Lilly, who had already started pedaling, once she saw me returning to my bike. “What are those doing in here?” Mrs. Denkler asked, giving the flowers a disapproving look when I brought them in. “They’re for Arthur,” I explained. “I feel so sorry that he can’t enjoy the lovely weather we’ve been having, so I thought maybe I’d bring a little nature to him. Mrs. Denkler opened her mouth to say something, closed it again, and then frowned at the flowers some more. “I think there are some glass vases under the sink in the kitchen,” she said. “One of those should serve for wildflowers.” I knew this was the closest I was going to get to Mrs. Denkler’s approval, so I hurried to mostly unused kitchen. “Leave the flowers at the bottom of the stairs and the nurse will take them up,” she called after me. “And don’t take all day. You’re not being paid to fuss over flowers.” That night, Lilly and I were both rousted from our sleep by a commotion. The phone started ringing and a few moments later someone was pounding on the front door. “What is it?” Lilly wondered aloud as we both leapt out of bed to grab our robes. “I don’t know,” I told her. But then I sniffed the air. “Smells like smoke.” Then we both shivered. Somewhere there was a fire. The door to our room opened and Mama stuck her head in. “Girls, the school is on fire. Get dressed.” Before we could pepper her with questions, she shut the door again. Lilly and I looked at each other. “How did the school catch fire?” Lilly voiced the questions that I was wondering. After we both were dressed, we hurried downstairs to catch Papa just as he was leaving. He gave Mama a kiss and said, “It’ll be alright, Lillian,” and then he hurried out the door to hop in a car that was waiting for him. “What’s happening?” I asked, as soon as he’d left. “The school caught fire,” Mama told us. “Nobody knows how, but it’s a big one. Bundle up because we’re going to have to help with the line.” Tiburon had a volunteer fire department, of which our father was a member. But when a fire was quite large, every able bodied person was expected to help out, usually as a link in a bucket line. Citizens would form a line from the fire to the nearest well or pump. Then we would pass full buckets down the line to the firemen and bring empty buckets back up the line to be refilled. If the fire was very large, then several lines would form on several sides of the burning building. Most fires were handled by the volunteer firefighters, so when they immediately called for a bucket brigade, we knew things were not going well. We could see a weird orange glow in the sky as we got in the car. Even though we were some distance from the school, the smell of smoke filled the air. Mama drove along, cautiously, immediately pulling off the road if anyone was trying to get by. She didn’t want to delay any members of the fire department who were trying to catch up with the rest of the volunteers. “I think we’ll park at the library and then walk over,” she said as we approached the center of town. “That way we won’t be clogging up the roads.” Other members of the bucket brigade must have had the same idea because the library parking lot was almost full when we pulled in. “Come on, girls,” Mama said, immediately hurrying out of the car. “Stick together and stay out of the firemen’s way.” As soon as we saw the school, we simultaneously gasped. The entire building was engulfed in flames. Mrs. McGreevy, head of the bucket brigade, hurried over to us. “Come on. We’re wetting down the neighboring buildings to try to stop the fire’s spread,” she shouted over the racket of the fire. “If the wind picks up, the whole town could go.” We spent the next several hours passing full and empty buckets up and down the line. A few times the firemen thought they had the blaze under control, only to have it flare up again with the night wind. As dawn started to warm the sky, the fire quieted down and the bucket brigade was told that the fire department could handle things from there and everyone else should go home. No neighboring buildings had caught fire, but the school was just a smoking pile of ashes and cinders. “It looks like arson,” Papa said, late the next morning when we had all finally crawled from our beds. Mama called us in sick to the castle and Mrs. Denkler was apparently very understanding about the whole thing. “Looks like the entire perimeter of the school was doused with gasoline,” our father went on. “Thank the Lord Mr. Green wasn’t about or this could have been a real tragedy.” Mr. Green was the school’s janitor. He usually stayed there most evenings, but sometimes he went to visit his sister in Cincinnati during the summer. “What are they going to do about classes?” Lilly asked. “Where will everybody go in the fall?” Papa rubbed his chin. “That hasn’t quite been figured out yet,” he said. “Might be that school is just delayed until the town can get enough money to build a new one.” “Arson,” Mama repeated, shaking her head. “And the whole school gone. Who would do such a thing?” I was as upset as everyone else about the school, but also, secretly, my heart was singing. I’d received a reprieve. I’d be able to keep working at the castle. Chapter 30 Colette A few days after the fire, I left the house a little earlier than usual so that I could gather a proper bouquet of wildflowers. Mrs. Denkler frowned some more when she saw it. Shaking her head slightly, she said, “Just hurry up with that nonsense. Leave the vase at the bottom of the stairs.” “I’m so excited for Saturday,” Lilly told me later that day as we scrubbed the kitchen floor, even though it was already spotless. “Saturday?” I said vaguely. Was something happening on Saturday? I couldn’t remember. “It’s the dance,” Lilly exclaimed, giving me a look that let me know she thought it was an event that was impossible to forget. “In Mansfield,” she went on. “At the country club.” “Oh.” It was my turn to exclaim. “Is that happening already? I thought it wasn’t for a few more weeks.” “It’s this Saturday,” my sister said in a voice that let me know that she was going to brook no excuses. “I’ve already asked Mrs. Denkler if we can leave early.” “Oh,” I said again. “What did she say?” “Well, she didn’t like it, but she agreed,” Lilly told me. “Just as long as we come in early on Monday to make up the hours.” “That’s nice,” I said, although even I knew there was no enthusiasm in my voice. Lilly stopped her scrubbing and turned to look at me. “Aren’t you the least little bit excited?” she asked. “I haven’t exactly thought about it,” I told her, keeping my eyes on my work. Truth be told, I had thought about it from time to time, but always with a vague feeling of dread. “You’ll probably feel differently with Lev twirling you around the dance floor,” she told me. “I doubt that,” was my reply. “Are you sure he wouldn’t rather take some other girl? I mean, we could always say I twisted my ankle and then maybe...” I searched my brain for a substitute that Lev would find acceptable. “Don’t even think about it,” Lilly told me. “You are not spraining your ankle. I agreed to go to the job interview here just so you would agree to go to the dance. Now I’ve held up my end of the bargain and it’s time for you to hold up yours.” “But you like working here,” I insisted. “That’s beside the point,” she informed me. “You agreed to go with Lev Wilson to the dance at the Mansfield Country Club, so you are going and you are going to have a lovely time.” There didn’t appear to be any way to squirm out of it. Lilly could force me to go to the dance, and I wouldn’t sulk or anything, but with Lev as my date, I highly doubted the evening would be enjoyable. Not unless Lev caught laryngitis. Lilly and I each had an organdy dress from a year earlier, when our mother’s youngest sister got married. We’d both grown a little since then, but when my mother made the dresses, she’d included a generous seam allowance. She was able to let both dresses out and lower the hems so that they fit perfectly. Lilly took extra time on my hair and managed, with the aid of hair tonic and about a hundred bobby pins, to fashion it into an upsweep that both she and Mama said was quite becoming. Papa had out his camera and took our picture before the boys came to get us. Walter and Lev arrived looking freshly scrubbed, but it was obvious they were both in borrowed suits. Lev’s was a little too small and Walter’s was a little too big. I wondered if they would have been better off just switching what they were wearing, but I wasn’t going to say anything. I noticed that this time Lev’s right cheek had a faded yellow bruise on it and he had more plasters on his knuckles, which he tried to conceal by keeping his hands clasped behind his back most of the time. I didn’t know what kind of roughhousing he and his friends got up to, but they seemed a little too old for such violent hijinx. “Here,” Lev said, thrusting a box at me. “I got you something.” Inside was a wrist corsage with a single pink rose, surrounded by baby’s breath and tied with a pink ribbon. “Thank you,” I said. It was my first corsage and it was actually quite pretty. I only wished it had been given to me by somebody else. Anybody else, really. Lev shrugged, as if it was no big deal. “I know girls like flowers and this reminded me of you.” Walter presented Lilly with a nosegay of wildflowers, clumsily fashioned with a yellow ribbon. I knew she had secretly been hoping for a corsage of her own, but she acted like he had just handed her an emerald ring. Papa wanted to make another picture, but he was all out of film, so we piled into Lev’s new car with our dates undocumented. Lev got the door for me. He hadn’t said much since arriving to pick us up and that made me feel a little better about the evening. Maybe it wouldn’t be so miserable after all. “The Charlie Barnet Orchestra is going to be playing,” Lev told me as he drove us along. He kept the car at a reasonable speed and was considerate of other motorists out for an evening drive. “Barnet is almost still a kid, but I hear he’s a genius on the saxophone.” I began to actually look forward to the evening. I did like to dance, and swing bands were starting to be popular on the radio. It would be neat to get to experience one in person. Plus, it was nice to have something to think about besides my longing for Jessie Vanderlind. Over the past several days, thoughts of him had taken up way too much of my time. I needed to stop fantasizing about him and live my life. I needed to go out and have new experiences; not spend every minute of every day pining for a man who could never be mine. The Mansfield Country Club was practically glowing with the excitement of the evening. The bushes along the long driveway leading up to the main building had been festooned with twinkle lights. There were at least ten cars ahead of us, waiting for the valet service. Men in snappy uniforms and white gloves were helping guests out of their cars. We could already hear music drifting out of the building. Many of the ladies who were helped from the vehicles were older and dressed far more elegantly than I had been expecting. The men were all in suits, but not dressed quite as spectacularly as their wives and sweethearts. “Who’s hosting this dance?” I asked as we waited. Lilly might have mentioned it at some point, but I hadn’t been paying attention. “An associate of my boss,” Lev told me. “He’s a very well connected guy from way back in the day.” I scanned my memory to see if I had any inkling of what Lev Wilson did for a living. Didn’t his father sell appliances? Was that right? Did Lev sell appliances? No, that didn’t make any sense. Somewhere in the back of my brain I thought maybe I remembered he had something to do with security. I had no idea what kind of security. But, judging by the other guests at the dance, it was for people who had more money that anyone I knew. I thought it would be rude to ask Lev questions about his work when I knew he had probably already told me every detail about it, so I didn’t say anything else. As we entered the dance, Lilly and I were both handed a dance card, done up with pink ribbon, each with a miniature pencil attached. “You won’t need that tonight,” Lev said with a grin. “You can pretty much count on dancing every dance with me.” “Same goes for you,” Walter said, giving Lilly a nudge and then breaking into a wide grin. Lilly nudged her date in return. “I could say the same to you.” They both laughed. “Come here for a minute,” Lev said, herding us all to one side of the foyer. He reached in his pocket and pulled out a silver colored flask. “I know there’s a bar,” he said, uncorking it, “but it’s a cash bar, so I thought we might as well get a little warmed up first.” Lev took a large slug out of the flask and then shoved it in my direction. I’d had a few sips of wine before, but I’d never tried hard alcohol and I didn’t think it was time for me to start. “No thank you,” I told him. Flashing me a quick look of disdain, Lev then offered the flask to my sister. “No thanks,” she said, shaking her head. “It’s gives me a stomach ache.” I didn’t think Lilly had ever tried booze before either, but at least she had a good excuse. With a sigh, Lev positioned the flask in front of Walter. “Don’t let me down, Wally Boy,” he said. Walter accepted the bottle, shooting an apologetic look in my sister’s direction, and then took a modest sip. After which, he grimace a little as the liquor slid into his belly. Lev grabbed the flask back from his friend and took another big slug out of it, just to show us how it was done. After putting the cap back on the bottle, Lev said, “Come on. Let’s check out this Barnet fellow.” Grabbing me by the arm, he steered me through the crowd. “I’m ready to dance.” The ballroom was very large, with two art deco chandeliers overhead that started with a ring of crystals in a large circle and cascaded into smaller and small circles until the crystals came to a point. The band was at the far end, just finishing up a song. The room was full, but not overly crowded. There was still room to breathe. I hoped there wouldn’t be many more people arriving after us. I didn’t want to feel squashed. “My boss should be here, somewhere,” Lev said, scanning the crowd. His eyes must have encountered a presence in the room he didn’t like because he frowned. “Would you look at that pretty boy in the tuxedo? Does he think he’s at a coronation or something?” I turned to look in the general direction that Lev was sneering and locked eyes with Jessie Vanderlind. Chapter 30 Jessie I kept telling myself I wasn’t going to follow Colette to the dance. It would be the height of foolishness. And I would be putting Colette, and everyone at the dance, in danger. I kept telling myself I wouldn’t go as I requested that Mrs. Denkler find my tuxedo and have it pressed. I was still a fledgling vampire, after all, which meant I had less self control than someone who had been a member of the undead for a century. I kept reminding myself I wasn’t going to attend the dance as I ordered a boutonniere from the local florist shop. If I was unmasked as a vampire, it would put my entire family at risk, and that was something I would never do. I even kept telling myself I wasn’t attending the dance at the Mansfield Country Club as I dressed in my tuxedo, launched into the air and made my way across the countryside. “Tickets please,” a man at the door said as I mounted the front steps to the club. His nose was misshapen and had obviously been broken more than once. “Oh,” I stammered. I had been so busy convincing myself that I wasn’t attending the dance that I had forgotten about tickets. The tough guy at the door gave me a steady look. “You can’t get in without a ticket.” I gazed right back at him, fixing him with my eyes. “I’ve already given you my ticket,” I told him. “You were just about to tell me that I could go inside.” The man blinked twice and then said, “You can go on inside.” I liked the Mansfield Country Club. It was a nice, open space with a band shell at the far end of a well-lit ballroom. The floor was already filling up by the time I arrived. There were lots of attractive females present, all dressed in varying levels of finery. But I only had eyes for one girl. My timing was perfect because it was only about ten minutes before I caught a glimpse of Colette Gibson entering the dance. Her escort noticed me first, for some reason, saying something derogatory about my attire. But then Colette and I locked eyes. She immediately blushed and put a hand to her cheek. A new song started and I had to resist the impulse to take her in my arms and twirl her across the dance floor. Her date must have noticed my longing gaze, because he flashed a warning look in my direction and then led Colette to another section of the room. I tracked him with my eyes. Setting aside my instant jealously, I observed that he was obviously a man up to no good. I could see the faded marks of a fight on his cheeks and smell the coagulated blood under his skin. I noticed his knuckles were covered in plasters as he hooked a possessive hand through Colette’s arm. I had to wonder why Colette’s parents would allow her to go out with such a brute. Colette’s eyes lingered on me as her date dragged her off to be introduced to some older gentlemen and their wives. I was immediately glad that I had ignored every argument I’d made against going to the dance. I didn’t trust Miss Gibson’s date. He had an air about him that smelled like trouble. While I stood at a discreet distance from the couple, I began to pay more attention to the crowd. There were a lot more older people at the dance than I had expected. And some of them were quite garishly dressed. Several of the younger men were concealing recent wounds, which told me that perhaps there had been some kind of brawl. Tables ringed the room, out of the way of the dance floor, and I took a moment to glance at the cover of a dance card someone had set down next to her purse. The dance was apparently for members of the Fifteenth Chapter of the Lenox Avenue Corporation. The name meant nothing to me, but I had my suspicions about their business. I doubted they were part of a pipefitters union or some other legal operation. When the next song started, Colette was led by her date onto the dance floor. I could tell she was reluctant to go. Her eyes kept darting around the room and I wondered if she was looking for me. It wasn’t fair of me to show up and throw a wrench in her evening, so I concealed myself in the crowd, but where I could still keep a watchful eye. Much to my distaste, her brute of a date was a rather good dancer. He was much smoother than I would have been on the floor. Colette did an admirable job keeping up with him, but it was obvious the fellow was a bit of a showoff. Colette’s sister seemed much happier with her date, even though the fellow wasn’t nearly as light on his feet. They were hanging onto each other in a manner that bordered on immodest. Lettie frowned a few times while looking in her sister’s direction. But besides too high of spirits, Lilly and her date weren’t actually doing anything inappropriate. After an hour of dancing non-stop, Colette begged to be allowed to catch her breath. Her face was pink and she was breathing heavy. I could smell the perfume of her sweat and it was sweet. I sent up a silent thank you to the good people of Tiburon who had been consistently donating their blood to help poor Arthur. It kept our family well supplied. We even had enough to help out some of the regional hospitals. We were too isolated in Tiburon to share the wealth with any of the other vampire families, but I was grateful that my belly was full and I had a flask in my breast pocket in case of emergency. I felt completely under control. Colette’s date excused himself and headed off in the direction of the men’s room. I fought the urge to go over and ask her to dance. It would have been heaven to hold Colette in my arms, if only for the length of one song. But I knew it was wrong. I knew I couldn’t ask her. She more than likely only thought of me as one of her employers. I’d probably ruined her evening by showing up to the dance. A middle-aged man with a big belly and a pronounced scar across his cheek approached Colette. It was obvious from his stagger that he’d been spending most of his time at the bar. “Hey there, cutie,” he slurred. Colette appeared a little startled to be addressed by the man. “Hello,” she said, rather hesitantly. Then she quickly scanned the dance floor for her sister. “What do you say you and I twinkle our toes a little out on the floor?” he asked, swaying slightly to the left and then straightening up again. “No thank you,” was her reply. “What’s the matter?” the guy asked, immediately taking offense. “You think you’re too good for me or something?” “No,” she assured him. “It’s just that I’m waiting for my escort. He said he’d be right back and that I should wait here.” “Awe, he won’t mind,” the man assured her. “Not when he sees who you’re dancing with. I’m a big name in these parts.” “Thank you, but I think I’d rather wait,” Colette told him, still trying to be gracious. “Maybe you didn’t hear me properly,” the man snarled, turning quite red in the face. “I asked you to dance.” And then he grabbed her arm. “Hello, darling,” I said, immediately appearing at Colette’s side. “Sorry to have kept you waiting.” “Oh,” Colette said, her eyes as wide as saucers. “Who’s your friend?” I asked, smiling at the drunk. “My name is something you don’t need to know,” the man slurred. “Now, excuse me, we were just about to hit the dance floor.” I frowned a little. “There must be some confusion. I’m afraid the young lady promised me the next dance.” The man’s face puckered up like he’d just licked a lemon. “Do you know who I am?” he demanded. I looked him dead in the eye. “I think you are a very nice gentleman who was kind enough to converse with my date. But now you are feeling tired and you’d like to go home. You no longer wish to dance.” “As a matter of fact, I don’t want to dance. Not anymore,” the man said after digesting my words. “I’m tired. To hell with this shindig. I’m going home.” And then he staggered off. “Shall we?” I asked, extending my elbow toward Colette so that I could lead her onto the floor. The orchestra was just starting a slow song. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. As I put my arms around her, I could feel Colette tremble. If I was being honest, I was trembling slightly, too. Not from the confrontation, but just from being so close to her. “I’m sorry if that man frightened you,” I said. “No, I…” Colette stammered. After a moment she tried again. “I’m fine,” she assured me. “But what are you doing here?” I swirled her across the floor and it was like dancing on air. “I wanted to hear the band,” I said. “They’re quite good. Don’t you think?” Colette looked at my feet for a moment. “Your ankle,” she said. “Is it quite better?” “It troubled me for a day or two, but it’s all healed now,” I told her. She was so very close, I felt like I could get lost in her emerald green eyes. “I just can’t believe you’re here,” she said in a very quiet voice. “It’s like something out of a dream.” I couldn’t believe my ears. This beautiful creature in my arms couldn’t possibly feel the same way about me as I felt about her. It was my turn to stammer. “You mean to tell me…” “Hey, buddy.” I felt someone slap me aggressively on the arm. “You’re dancing with my girl.” I knew without looking that it was Colette’s brute of a date. “We’d just like to finish this song,” I told him, never letting my eyes leave Colette. I had to have misunderstood her. I just couldn’t believe there was any chance that all the feelings I had for her were mutual. I had to find out. Unfortunately, it was right then that the song drew to a close. “Before you go back to your escort,” I began as I reluctantly removed my hand from her waist. “I just wanted to ask you if…” But it was too late. The brute was right there, glaring at me like he’d caught me stealing from his father’s store. I could smell the liquor on his breath. Colette’s eyes flicked nervously to her date and then back to me. “Thank you for the lovely dance,” she said. I made a small bow. “It was my pleasure.” And then the brute took her roughly by the arm and pulled her through the crowd. I wanted to go after him and explain to him in detail the proper way to treat a lady, but I knew that was unwise. He thought he was a tough-guy and that probably meant he was always spoiling for a fight. If he took a swing at me, then I doubted I would be able to stop myself from shattering his spine. But I decided to follow them at a discrete distance, anyway. Drink was causing the young man’s temper to flare. I didn’t want him to take his bad mood out on Miss Gibson. Chapter 31 Colette Lev goose-stepped me outside like I was a recalcitrant toddler. “You’re hurting my arm,” I told him, but I wasn’t sure if he was listening. There was fury in his eyes. I desperately scanned the crowd, looking for my sister or Walter. Where had they gone? Once we were at some distance from the crowd, Lev shoved me a little away from him and said, “Let’s you and me get something straight.” We were around to the left side of the country club where no other guests had strayed. “When you’re out with me, I don’t expect to find you in the arms of some other guy. Got it?” “We were just dancing,” I said, not sure why he suddenly thought he owned me. “It’s not like it’s any of your business anyway. Just because we came to the dance together doesn’t mean I’m your property for the evening.” “I paid for that flower,” he said, jabbing a finger at my wrist. “I paid for the tickets. I paid for the gas to drive you here.” He took a step closer to me. “Maybe that means I feel like you owe me a little something.” “Here,” I said, shucking the corsage off my arm and trying to hand it to him. “Tell me how much all of that cost you and I’ll pay you back,” I told him. I didn’t feel like I should have to be beholden to a man just because he’d spent a few dollars. “Just so you know,” I said, “I’m only on this date because my sister begged me. So if you spent two dollars, or three dollars, or even five dollars, then that’s fine. I have a job. I will pay you back.” Lev’s face turned dark and I immediately regretted my words. My goal shouldn’t have been to throw the fact that I didn’t like him in his face. My goal should have been to return to where there were other people, find my sister, and get out of there. “You’re going to pay me back,” he said, grabbing my arm. “But it’s not going to be with money. You’re going to have to earn it.” “Let go of me or I’ll scream,” I told him, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice. “Go ahead and scream,” he said with a laugh. “No man at this dance is going to come running, just because he hears some broad scream.” So I kicked him in the shin, and when he bent forward because of the pain, I socked him in the nose. It wasn’t a solid punch, but it was enough to make him let go of my arm. Seizing my moment, I started running back toward the front of the country club. Lev lunged for me, catching my dress. I didn’t stop, even after my dress tore. I ran without looking back. I expected that Lev would tackle me at any moment, but instead all I heard was a sharp “yipe” like someone had kicked a dog. Once I was back among the crowd, I slowed down. I knew what Lev had said about the other guests, but I couldn’t imagine he could drag me off into the bushes kicking and screaming with nobody saying anything. I had thought that Lev was going to come blundering around the corner in a matter of seconds, but he didn’t. I didn’t know why, but I sure as heck wasn’t going to go back and look for him. I moved deeper into the crowd of people chatting on the lawn and waited, never looking away from where I assumed Lev was going to appear. It couldn’t have been more than a minute or two before a figure did appear from around the corner of the building. But it wasn’t Lev. It was Jessie Vanderlind, discretely straightening his bowtie and dusting dirt off of his tux. I was dumbfounded, but slipped inside the club before he could see me. After several minutes of searching, I finally found my sister and Walter canoodling at a small table in a cozy corner by the bar. “What happened to your dress?” was the first thing out of my sister’s mouth when I finally caught her attention. “Lev tore it,” I said, fighting back tears. “What?” Lilly jumped to her feet. “What happened?” “Lev got angry because I danced with another man,” I said. “He dragged me outside and said I owed him because he bought me a flower and got us these tickets. I told him I’d pay him back but…” My voice caught for a second. “But he said he didn’t want my money. I had to earn it.” “What?” Lilly exclaimed, gripping both of my hands. “So then I kicked him, but he still wouldn’t let go of my arm. So then I had to punch him in the nose.” I half considered telling them about seeing Jessie slinking around the corner of the building, but then changed my mind. Walter slammed his hands down on the table. “I can’t believe it,” he all but yelled. “What is wrong with that guy? Has he lost his mind?” He got to his feet. “You two stay here. I’m going to find us a different ride home.” Spinning on his heel, Walter ran straight into Lev’s chest. Lev was a much bigger man, but anger had blinded my sister’s beau to this obstacle. “We’re going outside,” Walter informed his former friend. “You need to be taught a lesson on how to treat a lady.” I expected Lev to get right back in Walter’s face, or may let the fists start flying right there in the bar of the Mansfield Country Club. But Lev didn’t react in any way that I expected. Instead, he just stood there, swaying slightly on his feet. His skin looked clammy and his eyes were darting around the room. “I came here to apologize,” he said to me in a small voice. “I realize that my actions were wrong and I really want to say I’m sorry.” We all just stared at him, our mouths practically hanging open. Walter was the first to find his voice. “I’m glad to hear you’re sorry, but your behavior is still unforgivable. I hope you understand that I am going to find a different way to get the girls home.” “Please don’t do that,” Lev said, his voice trembling. He scanned the room as if he was afraid there was a wild panther hiding in the corner and he didn’t want to draw its attention. “Please allow me to drive the three of you home as a way of making amends.” “No.” Walter shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.” Lev began to quake and tears started streaming down his cheeks. “Can’t you at least go in my car? Walter, you can drive. Lettie and Lilly can sit in the back seat. I’ll sit up front with you.” He looked at me, beseechingly. “I won’t say a word. I promise. I’ll keep my mouth shut the whole time. But please just let me see you home safely.” He was a total wreck. It was as if we were talking to a completely different man. The Lev Wilson who was standing before us was somehow broken, like he had looked into the abyss and it had scared the fight out of him. “I think it will be okay if Walter drives,” I said. Lev was so altered, it was shocking. I actually found myself feeling sorry for him. “Okay, good,” Lev said, wiping the tears from his cheeks. “I really appreciate that. And I’m so sorry for…” His voice started trembling again and he had no more words. “I think maybe we’d better just get going,” Walter said after several seconds of watching Lev cry. “Why don’t I fetch the car and the three of you can meet me at the side entrance?” I knew he was worried about Lev being humiliated in front of his boss. But then Walter remembered he didn’t want to leave us alone with him. “Or maybe…” Walter tried to think of another option. “It’s probably best if you go get the car,” Lilly said. She obviously was thinking the same thing I was thinking; there was no need for us to fear Lev Wilson. He was a broken man. Chapter 32 Jessie I have never been so close to murdering someone in my life. It took every ounce of self control I possessed not to snap the brute’s spine and toss his body into the river. I was so disgusted by him that I didn’t even want to drink his blood; I just wanted to make him disappear off of the face of the planet. But I knew killing Colette’s date would be a mistake. Violence is rarely the solution to stop violence. Instead I decided to acquaint the brute with his own mortality, just to let him know how insignificant he really was in this world. It turned out he frightened quite easily. I was surprised how quickly he crumbled. But I suppose bullies aren’t really known for their bravery. After giving the young man a new perspective on life, I considered borrowing a car and offering Colette and her sister a ride home. But I decided that was just me wanting to play the hero. Besides, I wanted Colette to know that she had nothing more to fear from her date. He would never harass her again. So I instructed him to find his companions and to drive them home with the greatest of care. I explained that if I ever found out he was bullying or threatening anyone ever again, I would find him. But I wasn’t too worried on that score. I had a feeling that he was going to do everything with the greatest of care for the rest of his life. After straightening out the brute, I immediately walked across the country club lawn and left the dance. I couldn’t be around people any longer. Staying would have been a mistake. I took the flask out of my pocket and finished off its contents in a matter of seconds. Then, once I was clear from the crowd, I took to the air. I had meant to go home, but I was still worried about Colette. I found myself following the brute’s car as Colette and the rest of her party headed for home. Lilly’s escort saw her to the door, but Lettie’s escort was afraid to leave the car. I felt a pang of guilt. I may have frightened him just a little too much. I’d meant to make him a good person, not turn him into a sniveling coward. After the boys left, I followed their car once again, waiting for my chance to catch the brute alone. I had to lessen my influence. I’d put so much fear into him, I doubted his ability to survive. I had to take pity on him and provide at least some relief, however reluctant I was to do so. The next day was Sunday and I knew Colette would not be working at the castle. Even still, I could find no rest in my bed. I couldn’t help but wonder what she would do on her day off. Did she go to church? Did she have any hobbies? What did she eat for breakfast? I wanted to know every little detail of her life. I was already hopelessly in love with her. But I knew it was wrong to love her. When a vampire fell in love with a mortal, it put the mortal at a horrible risk. Even though I would have rather faced the sun than harm one hair on Colette Gibson’s head, loving her still meant I was exposing her to danger. I knew I had to find a way to keep myself from her. Earlier in the evening I had thought that maybe she was about to confess to having feelings for me and I desperately wanted to hear the words that she’d never had a chance to say. But knowing that she cared would probably only make things worse; it would make parting from her all the more painful. No, there was what my heart desired and there was what was right. I had to end things with Colette before they even had a chance to begin. By Monday afternoon, I knew I had to see Colette again. Not to profess my love or anything like that, but just to make sure that she was okay. Her date had tried to brutalize her and that weighed heavily on my mind. I knew she was a brave girl or she wouldn’t have fought her date, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t upset, or still in fear of him. I just wanted reassurance that she was unscathed. I promised myself one last look at the girl and then I would leave her alone forever. I would confess my dilemma to my mother and explain that I needed to move away for a couple of decades. I could always return in twenty years when Colette Gibson was in her thirties, married and raising her children. Children I could never give her. With the safety of a wedding band on her finger, I knew I would find her much easier to resist. With that resolve in mind, I set out to seek Miss Gibson. I didn’t intend to speak to her. I would just gaze upon her one last time to commit her beautiful visage to memory. I could live off of that for a few decades until my feelings of love for her began to fade. A small amount of discrete searching allowed me to find Colette dusting books in the library. It was a task that Mrs. Denkler usually assigned to her every Monday, whether the books needed it or not. By a stroke of good fortune, she was alone. Her sister had been called away to assist one of the other maids. The library door glided silently open on well-oiled hinges. Poking my head in, but not fully stepping into the room, I could not see her. The room smelled of her sweetness, so I placed one foot cautiously over the threshold. Where was she? A second later, I caught a glimpse of her, high on top of a ladder, dusting the books on the shelf closest to the ceiling. She was humming softly to herself, thoroughly engaged in her task. I could see that she was happy and not at all traumatized by the events of Saturday evening. I meant to turn and leave as quietly as I’d entered. But then I just stood there, mesmerized by Colette’s beauty. Everything about her called me to her. I reminded myself that I had to be brave and wrench myself away. I couldn’t give her mortal love. That opportunity was gone for me. I could only deny myself the pleasure of seeing her so that she could have a happy life. It took all of my strength, but I turned to leave the library. That’s when a floorboard creaked beneath my shifting weight. Colette’s eyes immediately met mine. Her lips parted and she exclaimed, “Jessie?” She tried to descend the ladder, but the heel of her shoe got caught on the hem of her dress. Suddenly her legs were out from under her and she was tumbling head first toward the hardwood floor. Chapter 33 Colette I scanned the country club crowd for Jessie Vanderlind as we were leaving the dance, but he was nowhere to be found. Lev was a complete mess. He acted terrified by every trumpet of laughter and every shadow in the trees. “Did something happen after I left you?” I couldn’t help but ask him. “What?” he said, giving me a startled look. “No, nothing. Why do you ask?” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “You just seem very…” I wanted to say altered, but that probably wasn’t very nice. “You seem a little unsettled and I was wondering if anything happened while you were on the lawn by yourself.” “No.” He shook his head rapidly back and forth. “I was alone, by myself, and nothing happened. Nothing at all.” The three of us were standing by the side entrance, waiting for Walter to bring the car. Lev scanned the area with wild eyes, as if he expected the grim reaper to lunge out of the shadows. I clearly remembered Jessie Vanderlind brushing down his tux as he left the general area where Lev had decided to assault me. And I found it very unlikely that Jessie would stand idly by while someone was being attacked. Did he have anything to do with Lev’s current fragile state? “And you spoke to no one?” I asked again. “No,” Lev insisted, shaking his head. “I’ve already told you that. Now please stop asking me.” His eyes started welling with tears again so I decided to just keep my mouth shut. When we arrived home, Walter saw Lilly to the door, but Lev stayed in the car. We could hear him locking the doors as soon as we’d pushed them shut. “I’m so sorry about all of this,” Walter said as he escorted Lilly up the front porch steps. “I am so sorry,” Lilly whispered to me as we entered the front door. “You told me you didn’t want to go with Lev and I wouldn’t listen. I just feel so horrible.” “That’s okay,” I told her in a low voice. “Oh, here comes Mama.” “Hello, girls,” our mother said, beaming at us. She was already in her nightgown and robe. “I wasn’t expecting you home so early.” And then she caught sight of the giant tear in my dress. “Goodness. Lettie, what happened?” “I... was sitting down and didn’t realize the woman next to me was standing on my hem,” I told her. “So when I got up, it all tore.” “Goodness,” Mama said again, bending to examine the damage. “I don’t think I can mend this without it showing.” She scratched her chin and straightened up, still eyeing the hole. “I guess we could add a wide sash and that would hide it well enough. I might have just the right fabric in my scrap box.” “I knew you would think of something to save it,” I said, giving our mother a squeeze. “I felt like such a fool when it happened.” “I hope it didn’t spoil the dance for you,” Mama said. “Oh, no,” I assured her. “We had a lovely time. I think Walter and Lilly danced to every song.” “And what about you?” she asked. “Have you changed your mind about Lev Wilson?” I didn’t think it was worth upsetting my parents with Lev’s behavior, so I sighed and then said, “I’m afraid I just don’t like Lev in that way. We’ve decided to just be friends.” I set out for work extra early Monday morning. The weather was quite warm and I wanted to gather a large bouquet of wildflowers for Arthur. Mrs. Denkler never said if he enjoyed the flowers or not, but I figured he must have at least enjoyed them a little or she would have told me to stop. Lilly caught up with me on her bicycle and we rode the rest of the way to the castle together. “Thank you so much for not saying anything to Mama and Papa,” she said as we rolled along. “I don’t think they’d ever let me see Walter again if they knew about Lev’s behavior.” “I don’t know why,” I called back to her as we both pedaled single file. “It’s not like Walter did anything. As a matter of fact, I think he behaved quite gallantly during the whole incident. Don’t you?” “He did. Didn’t he?” Lilly said. I didn’t have to look back at my sister to know she was smiling. “But I still think Papa would try to stop me from seeing him. You know how protective he can get and he might find Walter guilty just through association.” We rode the rest of the way to the castle in silence. Lilly was probably thinking of Walter’s gallantry and I was thinking of Jessie. I desperately wanted to see him. But seeing one of the Vanderlinds was always strictly by chance. Even so, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I couldn’t stop wondering what he would have said to me if we’d been allowed to dance just a little longer. And I couldn’t help but wonder what I would have said to him. I knew I was being foolish because we barely even knew each other, but if I was being honest, I already felt like I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. Lilly and I were assigned to dust the library again. It was becoming a regular Monday ritual. It seemed impossible to believe that any dust had gathered since we’d wiped down all the books a week earlier, but Mrs. Denkler was in charge. It was our job to just do as she instructed. We worked side-by-side for about an hour, both of us lost in our own thoughts. I heard the door open and my heart jumped into my throat with the hope that it was Jessie. Whipping my head around, I saw it was just Millie. “Mrs. Denkler sent me to get one of you,” she said. Lilly and I exchanged looks. “You go,” I told her. “I’ll stay with the books.” I thought there might be a better chance of seeing Jessie if I stayed in the library, rather than going to a new task. After Lilly left, I began humming to myself. I loved climbing up the ladder to the highest shelf. There were giant volumes up there that appeared to be hundreds of years old. I wondered if any of them were as old as the castle. The creak of a floorboard caught my attention. I turned my head just in time to see Jessie Vanderlind trying to duck out of the door. “Jessie,” I exclaimed, immediately trying to climb down from my perch to speak with him. I needed to know what had happened at the dance. But the heel of my shoes got caught in the hem of my dress and before I knew what was happening, I was plummeting toward the ground head first. It all happened so quickly that I didn’t even have time to shriek. I just shut my eyes and had the fleeting thought that hitting the floor was really going to hurt. And then I let out an “Oof.” It was as if I flopped very hard on a bed and all the air was knocked out of me. I hadn’t hit the ground. In fact, I felt like I was a few feet above it. I opened my eyes to see that I was in Jessie’s arms. “Are you alright,” Jessie asked, holding me like a groom holds a bride when they cross the threshold of their new home as husband and wife. “Yes,” I said with a little gasp. He acted as if I was as light as a ragdoll. “My heel got caught and the next thing I knew...” It was so wonderful being in his arms that more words escaped me. “Here, let me untangle you,” he said, gently setting me down. “Hold onto me and I’ll unhook your hem.” I wobbled a bit and had to steady myself against his broad shoulders. “There,” he said, freeing my shoe. “All better.” He straightened up, but kept a steadying hand against my side. “Are you dizzy at all? Are you hurt in any way?” “I’m fine,” I assured him. “Just a little embarrassed. I saw you standing in the doorway and...” I looked across the room to the door. It had to have been a distance of at least twenty feet. “How did you manage to catch me?” I asked. “When I saw you, you were right by the door.” “No, no,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re remembering it wrong because of the fall. I was walking toward you. I was practically under the ladder.” “But...” I shook my head, trying to clear it. His arms were still around me and that was making it hard for me to think. “I could have sworn you were by the door.” “Then how could I have crossed the room so quickly? It’s not like I can fly,” he pointed out. “I suppose,” I said, shaking my head some more. I still felt so discombobulated. “I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to you at the dance. I saw you on the lawn and I was wondering if you’d spoken to my date when you were out there.” “On the lawn?” he repeated. “No, I only spoke to him when he came over while we were dancing.” “Are you sure?” I asked. “It seemed like you were coming from the same direction where he...” I stopped short when I saw the thunder in Jessie’s eyes. They told me everything I needed to know. Jessie had confronted Lev. That much was obvious. “Did you need me for something?” I asked, taking half a step backward, but I was reluctant to relinquish his touch. “Or were you just wanting a book?” Jessie half turned away from me for a moment and then looked back into my eyes. “I guess I’ve come to tell you goodbye.” “Goodbye?” I asked. “Yes.” He looked down. “I’m leaving Tiburon. I’m afraid I won’t be back for quite some time. Possibly years.” “What?” I exclaimed. “No, you can’t.” I blinked rapidly, trying to stop tears from filling my eyes. “I’ve only just met you. And I know I’m just a maid, but...” I wanted to tell him that I thought we were meant to be together, but I couldn’t speak. “No, you’re not just the maid,” he told me. “You’re everything. I just thought that I should leave because...” And then we were kissing. I don’t even know how it happened, but suddenly his lips were pressing against mine. And it was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I felt the kiss in every cell of my body. It felt like I had been dunked in soda from a fountain. For those few seconds we were standing still and the world was spinning around us. “Oh! Excuse me,” I heard Lilly’s voice exclaim. We quickly pulled apart and I turned to see my sister standing in the doorway, her eyes out on stalks. Chapter 34 Jessie Colette felt about me the same way I felt about her. It didn’t matter that I could already fly, I felt like I was walking on air. I took the stairs back to my room two at a time. Her kiss had been the one perfect moment in my life. I felt our entire lifetime together in that one embrace. I just couldn’t believe my good fortune. I was the luckiest man alive. And then I remembered I wasn’t alive. Not by a long shot. I was a vampire, a member of the undead. And she was a mortal. That realization quickly brought my spirits crashing back to earth. How could I take Colette’s heart and give her my own when we could never be together? I closed the door to my room and then sank into despair. Being so close to Colette, having her in my arms, had made me lose my head for a moment. But what I had done was wrong. Not saving her life — I would have gladly sacrificed my own life to keep her from harm — but kissing her had been a very foolish thing to do. I cursed my misfortune of having contracted scarlet fever. If I’d only managed to avoid that dreaded disease, then I would have still been a mortal. With Grandfather gone, there was no fear of him turning Emily into a member of the undead. I would have fallen under the same protection. But no, the fates had seen to it that I would forever be seventeen, and the love of my life would keep aging. The cruel injustice of it led me to anger and I took some of my frustration out on an ottoman, completely shattering its frame in the process. There was a knock on my door and then Daniel walked into my room without waiting for me to reply. “Why are you attacking the furniture?” he asked. “What’s that ottoman ever done to you?” “I’m just…” And then I couldn’t think of what to say. “I’m just frustrated that I wasn’t able to save Grandfather.” “I see.” Daniel raised his eyebrows high on his forehead. “And you think that the ottoman had something to do with it?” Seating himself in a chair at some distance from the ottoman, he crossed his legs and then folded his hands over one knee. “No, I…” And then I stopped myself again. “What do you want, Daniel?” I asked. “It’s not like you to be up at this hour.” It was the middle of the day and my brother never usually stirred until after six. “I was having trouble sleeping,” Daniel said with a sniff of vexation, “so I thought I’d get a book from the library. And while I was standing in the doorway, I overheard the most remarkable conversation between two of the maids.” I felt my body momentarily tense, but I tried to pretend like his words had no effect on me. “Eavesdropping on the staff?” It was my turn to raise an eyebrow. “That’s not like you.” Daniel would have been happy if everyone who worked at the castle was a deaf-mute. “What’s going on?” Daniel asked, ignoring my barb. “Have you been toying with one of the servants? How very bourgeois.” “I haven’t been toying with anyone,” I informed him. “They were probably gossiping about the fact that one of the girls took a tumble off a ladder in the library. I was nearby so I managed to catch her.” Daniel narrowed his eyes. “Nearby or on the other side of the room?” “I was standing closer to her than you are to me,” I told him, keeping my voice matter-of-fact. “I don’t see what business it is of yours, anyway.” “It’s my business if you’re exposing the family to danger,” he snapped. “You can’t go dashing across the library just because some little mortal might bust her head. You could expose us all with that kind of behavior.” “I didn’t expose us to anyone,” I informed him. “She slipped and I caught her. That’s the end of the story.” Daniel was the very last person I’d want to know about my feelings for Colette. At least not until I had decided what to do. He took the demise of our grandfather as a signal that he should ascend the throne as the head of the Vanderlind family. Mother and I found it quite amusing, but he took himself rather seriously. “Just be careful,” he told me. “I think Denkie should have known better than to hire a couple of pretty housemaids, but that’s no reason to lose your head. If you’re feeling edgy, you can always go visit Arthur, and then find a brothel. I hear Columbus has a few good ones and it’s not that far.” “Alright,” I said, just to placate him. I knew continuing to protest my innocence would get me nowhere. And Daniel might even begin to suspect I was lying if I protested too much. “Next time I’ll let the mortal land on her head.” “Good,” Daniel said, getting to his feet and heading toward the door. “Better a dead girl than having the villagers pounding on the castle door. I hate when they show up with their pitchforks and torches.” Chapter 35 Colette “Have you lost your mind?” Lilly said in a loud whisper. Jessie had slipped out the door as she’d entered the room. “Maybe I have,” I told her, still feeling a bit giddy from Jessie’s kiss. “What if Mama and Papa find out?” she said in a harsh whisper. Then her eyes grew wider. “What if Mrs. Denkler finds out? She’s scary enough as it is.” “No one’s going to find out,” I said to her, picking up my feather duster from where it had fallen. “It was just a harmless kiss.” “But how did it even happen?” Lilly wanted to know. “I slipped off a ladder and he caught me,” I explained. “He had his arms wrapped around me to steady me, and then it just happened.” My sister frowned. “He took advantage of you?” “No,” I exclaimed. “He stopped me from cracking open my skull.” “But he kissed you,” she said. “Without courting you. Or meeting our parents, or anything.” “It wasn’t like that,” I tried to assure her. “It just happened. I kissed him just as much as he kissed me.” Lilly frowned some more while plucking at her feather duster. “I think I have to tell Mama and Papa.” Whirling around, I stared at her, my mouth slightly open at her contemplated betrayal. “Why?” “Because that Vanderlind boy is trying to take advantage of you. He shouldn’t have kissed you like that.” “I told you, it was mutual. And also an accident,” I hastened to add. “And it will probably never happen again, so there’s no reason to get our parents all worried. You want to keep this job. Don’t you?” Lilly thought it over. “Yes, I really do. But… I don’t want…” She couldn’t even put words to her feelings. “I still think I should tell.” “Fine,” I said, pinching my lips together. “After all I’ve done so you could see Walter.” “That’s different,” she insisted. “If you decide to tell Mama and Papa, then I can’t stop you,” I said. “But I just want you to know that if we are sharing everything with our parents, then I am going to have to tell them that you left me alone with Lev Wilson for over an hour. And during that time, he attacked me and ripped my dress.” Lilly let out an audible gasp. “You wouldn’t.” I shrugged. “Why shouldn’t I? It’s the truth.” “But…” Lilly’s eyes were round with the fear of it. “Then they would never let me see Walter again.” “I know,” I told her. “And I don’t want that to happen.” Lilly opened and closed her mouth a few times, reminding me slightly of a goldfish in a bowl. Then she closed her lips firmly and returned to dusting, not speaking to me for the rest of the day. “What’s wrong with you girls?” Mama asked over dinner. “You’ve barely spoken two words to each other since you got home.” “Nothing, as far as I know,” I said, glancing over in Lilly’s direction. My sister refused to look at me. “Nothing,” she said, shaking her head back and forth a few times. “I’m just a little tired.” She looked down to cut her meat. “And besides, we work together all day.” And then, glancing in my direction, she added, “I think we’ve said everything that needs to be said.” Lilly was still ignoring me when we climbed into bed. That was fine. I could handle her anger, just as long as she kept my secret. And I knew she would. I wasn’t exactly playing fair, but I was keeping secrets for her, so I saw no reason why she shouldn’t keep one for me. And besides, Jessie and I had only kissed. It had been unexpected, but it wasn’t something I regretted. Nor was it something I would ever regret. Jessie Vanderlind had stolen my heart without even trying. I couldn’t sleep. There were too many thoughts of Jessie running through my head. Once my sister’s breathing turned to the steady rhythm of someone asleep, I crept out of my bed and shrugged into my robe. I needed to contemplate what had passed between Jessie and me in the complete silence that existed in the middle of the night. On tiptoe, I crossed the room to look out the window. The little creatures of the night were starting to sing to each other and I loved the music they made. Looking down at the ground below our window, I nearly jumped out of my skin when I realized that someone was looking back up at me. It only took a second for me to realize it was Jessie Vanderlind. “What are you doing out here?” I whispered, as I hurried across our yard to stand next to Jessie. I hoped none of my family had heard me easing out of the back door. The screen usually squeaked. “I had to see you,” he said, stepping closer to me. “I wanted…” He paused for a moment, running his fingers through his hair. “I wanted to apologize.” He was just so breathtaking handsome with his full lips and his ruffled black hair. I took several seconds just to stare at him, drinking him in. “Apologize?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes.” Jessie nodded. “Just because you’d fallen off a ladder was no reason for…” He paused again. “It’s just… I just feel like I might have taken advantage of you. I mean, just because you’d fallen off the ladder was no reason for me to…” He gestured at me with his hand. “I’m sorry.” “Don’t apologize,” I told him, stepping a little closer. “You saved me and then we accidentally kissed. That’s no reason to apologize.” “But don’t you see?” Jessie asked, his gray eyes like two perfect gray pearls from the islands of Polynesia. “Kissing you by accident would be like accidentally finding a leprechaun's pot of gold.” I squinted at him, no sure what he meant. “I’m afraid you’ve lost me.” “I mean,” he said, stretching his hands toward me for a moment and then stuffing them in the pockets of the long, dark coat he was wearing, “I wouldn’t want our kiss to have been something you didn’t want or you weren’t expecting. Kissing you, especially for the first time, should be perfect.” My heart was hammering so wildly in my chest that I could barely breathe. “Then kiss me now,” I told him. “Kiss me here under this apple tree. Let this be our first kiss.” It was such a brazen thing to say that I couldn’t even believe the words had come out of my mouth, but he didn’t seem put off by my request. “Are you sure?” Jessie asked, taking a half-step forward. “About the kiss. Because I know if I kiss you again, I would never want to…” And then we melted into each other’s arms, our lips pressing together with such passion that it felt like tiny fireworks were exploding in my chest. “Ever let you go,” Jessie whispered, once we paused for breath. “What’s that?” I asked, my head spinning from being so close to him. His breath smelled slightly of warm pennies. “I was just worried about kissing you,” he whispered into my hair. “I knew that if we were to kiss, I would never want to let you go.” “Then don’t,” I told him. “I’m happy to stay here forever.” He squeezed me tightly for another moment and then I felt him stiffen a little, as if gathering his resolve. “There’s something I have to tell you,” he said in a very controlled voice. “There’s something I have to confess before this goes any further.” “What is it?” I asked, hesitantly. He suddenly sounded so serious that it made me a little afraid. Jessie closed his eyes for a moment and released a deep sigh. “It’s about my family.” “Oh.” I thought of the rumors I’d heard about the Vanderlinds from Mrs. Denkler and the other snatches of gossip. The Vanderlinds all suffered from some type of rare illness. Something hereditary, I had to imagine. Jessie probably felt that he should be honest about his situation before we became too involved. “Don’t tell me,” I said, snuggling deeper into his arms. “I don’t want to know. Not yet.” “But…” he started to say. “Jessie, please don’t,” I insisted, cupping his face with my hands and looking into his fathomless gray eyes. “This moment is so perfect. And I feel about you in a way that I never imagined I could feel about anyone. Let’s pretend that the rest of the world doesn’t exist. At least for right now. Let’s just make this moment about the two us.” And then he kissed me again. Chapter 36 Jessie I felt like a foolish Romeo, standing underneath Colette’s window, but there was no place else in the world I wanted to be. I’d always had my suspicions about Romeo. He was, after all, already infatuated with a girl named Rosaline before sneaking into the ball and first seeing Juliet. Who was to say that, if their families hadn’t been sworn enemies and he’d actually been allowed to woo Juliet, that he wouldn’t have grown bored of her in a couple of months and fallen in love with yet another girl? But I didn’t feel that way about Miss Gibson. I knew I was about the same age as Romeo was in the play, but my love for Colette felt timeless. I knew I could never tire of her, not even in a hundred years. I sighed, feeling the irony of it. I would live to see a hundred years. And probably a hundred more after that, if I didn’t grow despondent under the weight of my own immortality and find some way to end it. Death by an angry mob was a popular way for the undead to give up on living. Of course I would probably have to travel to Romania to accomplish such a grisly task with any ease. The Romanians were always ready to put some world weary vampire to the stake. But then I caught a glimpse of Colette in the window of her house and it felt like my dead heart was beating in my chest. Just the sight of her filled me with life. I had to fight the urge to fly up the side of the house and speak to her through the glass. A few moments later and she was there by my side, her volumes of hair cascading around her shoulders. I had been yearning for her so much that my feelings were almost tangible. And there she was, right in front of me. It was exquisite torture not to sweep her up in my arms. I had meant to apologize for my behavior in the library. It had been ungentlemanly and I very much wanted Colette Gibson to think well of me. I meant to simply apologize, but somehow we ended up kissing again. It was our first kiss, our first real kiss, and there was a dream-like quality to it. The apple tree shading us from the light of the moon was in full leaf and the small animals and insects that came out in warm weather started to sing. It was then that I knew I couldn’t give Colette up. Not ever. Her soul fit with mine like two locking puzzle pieces that, once united, could never be pulled apart. But I also wanted to protect her from the curse that was my family. I needed to tell her exactly who I was, and what I was, so that she would understand the gravity of her decision to be with me. But when I tried to confess to the abomination that was my family, Colette silenced me. She didn’t want to cloud the skies of our new love with talk of anyone or anything but us. And I was too in love to insist. I should have stood strong and explained the evil that Grandfather had inflicted upon us, but instead we kissed again and everything in the world felt perfect. As we pulled apart in order for her to breathe, we both caught a glimpse of a shooting star streaking across the sky. “Do people wish on shooting stars here in America?” I asked, unwilling to turn my head to take in the full astronomical display. I preferred gazing into her green eyes. “Yes,” she said with a small nod, not looking away either. “But I feel like all of my wishes have already come true.” Chapter 37 Colette “I have a bit of good news to share,” Papa said, beaming at all of us as we sat around the dinner table the following evening. “What is it?” Mama asked, taking off her oven mitts after setting down the pot roast. “Well, the W.P.A. has decided that Tiburon needs a proper town hall. And guess who they’ve hired to run the construction?” “Oh!” Mama exclaimed, gasping. “That’s wonderful.” She hurried around the table to wrap her arms around Papa. I was thrilled. All of us were. But it was also a little confusing. “Shouldn’t they focus on rebuilding the school first?” I asked. Papa shook his head, even though he was still smiling. “I know. It doesn’t make much sense. Does it? But I guess the government already had the plans in place for the town hall before the school burnt down.” “But when are they rebuilding the school?” Lilly wanted to know. “It’s in the process of getting funded,” Papa told her. “And hopefully I get that project, too. But for now we should just be grateful that I’m steadily employed again.” He looked at Lilly and me. “There should be enough money for awhile,” he said. “If you girls want to leave your positions at the castle; it wouldn’t be a problem.” “No,” I exclaimed, the word bursting out of my mouth. I didn’t care if we had all the money in the world; I couldn’t stop working at the castle. I couldn’t forgo the chance of seeing Jessie every day, even if the chance was always slim. Surprised by my exuberance, everyone turned to look at me. “I mean, it would be silly to give up such good paying jobs,” I explained. “We should save the money in case things get lean again.” Papa reached over and petted my head. “That’s my bright girl.” The next several weeks drifted past in a pink haze of happiness. In the mornings I would ride out to an obliging field and gather an armload of wildflowers for Arthur. Then Lilly would catch up to me and we would head to the castle together to start our day of dusting and polishing. If it was a lucky day, then Jessie would find some way to see me. Lilly would be called away to help Millie and I’d be left on my own. Or Emily would come to ask for my help with some small task. Once the girl had led me to some secluded room, she would disappear, leaving her brother in her place. Our meetings in the castle were brief. There was only time for a few stolen kisses. But I knew that Jessie would come to see me at night, after my family had fallen asleep. That was when we had our real time together. Each night when we met, Jessie would try to tell me of the horrible curse that plagued his family. And each night I would stop him with a kiss. I didn’t want to tarnish the love I felt for him. His family could have been a pack of snarling wolves and I wouldn’t have cared. Jessie was beautiful and wonderful and kind. I didn’t believe in guilt by association and I knew I would love Jessie Vanderlind, no matter the dark secret his family was hiding. “Why don’t you speak with an accent?” I asked him one evening as we took a turn around the yard. “Don’t I speak with an American accent?” he said with some surprise. “You know what I mean,” I said, nudging his arm. “You’re from Hungary. Aren’t you? But you sound like you were born right here, in Tiburon.” “My grandfather didn’t believe in accents,” he said. I couldn’t let him get away with telling me so little. “What’s that supposed to mean?” “It means that my grandfather was very strict. He felt that if you were going to learn a language, then you should be able to speak it flawlessly.” “How many languages do you speak?” I wanted to know. He gave a shrug of modesty. “Only three or four.” “Three or four?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “You speak English and Hungarian. What other languages do you speak?” “French,” he told me. “And some German, but I could hardly pass for a native.” “Say something in Hungarian,” I requested. He gave me a puzzled look. “Why?” “Because this all sounds too preposterous and I’m not half sure that I should believe you.” He turned to look deeply into my eyes. “Szeretlek,” he said in a whisper. I didn’t understand him, but I had my suspicions because of the way he looked at me. “Okay, now say the same thing in French,” I told him. “Je t’aime,” was his reply, a small smile flitting across his lips. I kept going. “And German?” “Ich liebe dich,” he said, gazing steadily into my eyes. “And what does it mean in English?” I had to ask. Jessie pulled me into his arms. “I think you already know,” he said in a husky voice. And then he kissed me, his lips telling me how he felt without any words. My sister hadn’t spoken of Jessie since she stumbled upon our kiss, and I kept all thoughts of him to myself. Normally we shared all our foolish secrets, like sisters who are close tend to do. But when it came to Jessie, things felt different. First of all, I knew Lilly didn’t approve. After all, the maid falling in love with the tortured heir to the castle falling did sound like something out of a gothic novel. Even I had to admit that. But I didn’t care. I knew what I felt for Jessie was real. And I knew deep in my heart that he felt the same way about me. One morning I woke up and I was seventeen. I found it singular that I didn’t look any different when I washed my face in the morning and peered into the bathroom mirror. But things were different. They were very different. Because I knew that just down the Tiburon River, a few miles away, was a Justice of the Peace who would perform wedding ceremonies without parental consent, as long as both parties were older than seventeen. I had reached an age where I could say, “I do,” to Jessie, if he ever proposed. My whole family greeted me when I came down the stairs. “Happy Birthday,” Mama said, squeezing me tightly. Then she pulled Lilly into the hug. “My two, seventeen-year-old girls.” “Not for long,” Lilly joked. For almost two months out of the year, my sister and I were the same age. My family referred to it as our twin months and we’d always loved this special time when we little girls. “Well, then I’ll have to enjoy it while I can,” our mother said, hugging us both again. “I’m tired of your silly nonsense with these flowers,” Mrs. Denkler snapped at me as I filled a vase with the wildflower bouquet I’d gathered on the way to work. “Oh,” I said, not quite sure why she was annoyed. “You mean you don’t think they cheer Arthur up? I’m sure he must get depressed, never being able to leave his room.” Mrs. Denkler was about to say something, but then stopped herself. She left out the sharp sigh of someone who feels they have extended a great deal of patients and their efforts have gone unappreciated. “Just take the flowers up yourself today and set them outside Arthur’s door,” she instructed me. “It’s the one with the bird carving over it. The nurse will take them in. Just make sure you mind your own business and leave that poor boy alone. If I find out that you’ve so much as stuck your nose in the door, you will be dismissed on the spot.” I did as I was told, trotting up the grand staircase that led to the second floor. I hadn’t been allowed up the stairs and only knew that part of the castle from what could be gleaned from down below. The hallways were massive. I wouldn’t have been surprised if it were possible to drive a car down some of them. There was an ornately carved piece of wood over each door. I took several moments to stare at the carving of a wolf’s head suspended above a door. Its eyes seemed to follow me. I found the door for Arthur’s room easily enough. There was a carving of a peacock with its tail feathers spread into a fan. The bird was beautiful, but also somehow menacing. That paired up well with my memory of how a peacock looked from our family trip to the Cleveland Zoo. I stood outside the closed door for a moment, the vase of flowers still clutched in my hands, cocking my head to one side to listen. I felt so very bad for Arthur. None of the family got out much, as far as I could tell. Emily seemed perfectly healthy. And Jessie left the castle more than the others, but that seemed to be only after the sun went down. What was the illness that kept them all so isolated and cooped up in their home? I’d tried to do researched at the library, but came up with next to nothing. The only thing I could discover was that albinos had some sensitivity to light. Most of the Vanderlinds had very pale skin, but their hair wasn’t the white of an albino and they all had very gray eyes. As I set the vase down outside the closed door, I had to wonder about Arthur’s malady. If Jessie and I had a child, would he or she suffer the same fate? That wouldn’t prevent me from accepting a proposal from Jessie, but it would make me consider adoption instead of bearing my own children. I did rather desperately want to have Jessie’s child, but I also knew that there were many parentless children out in the world who deserved a loving home. I had an anxious day. I kept expecting to see Jessie at every turn, but he never appeared. I didn’t even see Emily, which came as a surprise. She was a lonely little girl and frequently sought Lilly and my company. She was so lucky to have escaped her family’s curse, whatever it was, but it seemed to have isolated her in an unexpected way. Chapter 38 Jessie “So you’re not fiddling with the maid,” Daniel said with a scoff as he sauntered into the library where I sat in a club chair, reading some of Sir Walter Scott’s poetry. “I can’t believe I was fool enough to have believed you.” “What are you talking about?” I asked, glancing up at him from over my book and doing my best not to be baited by my brother. I had been courting Colette for several weeks and I was always careful to ensure that my family knew as little as possible about my activities. Everyone but Emily, of course. She was my secret go-between and she thoroughly approved of where I had given my heart. “I followed you the other night,” he told me, perching himself on the arm of a chair. “I knew you’d been sneaking out of the house, so I followed you. And guess where you went?” I gave him a cool look, closing my book in the process. “Why don’t you tell me?” “You know damn well where you went.” he said. “You flew directly over to that little tramp’s house. I saw you with your arms around each other.” My temper ignited immediately when my brother referred to Colette as a tramp. She was nothing of the sort and I instantly felt compelled to defend her honor. But I knew that was what Daniel was expecting. “What’s it to you?” I asked, keeping my voice in check. “If you’re feeling the urge to dip your wick, then find some foolish young thing who doesn’t know where you live,” he told me. “Not one that works under the very roof of our home.” I wanted to strike him. I could feel the urge down to my fingertips. But what purpose would that serve? That would only convince Daniel that he was justified in his outrage. “You’re right,” I said, coolly. “She was a foolish choice.” Daniel was about to argue with me, but then he processed my words. “So you’ll end things with her?” I nodded a few times. “I shall give it some thought. It’s a matter that would have to be handled with some delicacy.” My brother gave me a flat look. “Just make sure that it’s handled,” he said. “Or I’ll be forced to discuss this with…” and there he paused. I knew he had meant to say Grandfather, but that was no longer an option. “Mother,” I supplied for him. “You’ll be forced to discuss this with our mother.” “I’m sure she’ll be thrilled,” he said, his voice at its most droll. I somehow doubted Mother would have the same reaction as her eldest son, but I said nothing. It was better for Daniel to think he had won. “If you feel the need to share this information with her, then let’s do it now,” I said, making a show of rising from my chair. “We might as well get this all out in the open.” “Forget it,” he said, getting to his feet and preparing to stalk out of the room. “I don’t want to worry her with such pointless trivia. Just make sure you end things with that foolish, little mortal. You should go to New York and find yourself a proper vampiress to love, if you’re feeling the need for a romantic liaison.” “That’s good advice,” I told him. “It’s something I’ll keep in mind.” Daniel left, feeling satisfied that he had the upper hand. But nothing he could do or say would ever change the way I felt about Colette. Our very souls were drawn to each other. There was nothing that could drive us apart, even with our apparently insurmountable differences. Some things were meant to be.” But Daniel’s actions did cause me concern. I didn’t want Colette to be exposed to the dangers of the vampire world. She didn’t want to hear about my family’s curse, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t arm her in some other way. I immediately flew to Main Street in Tiburon and gazed through the window of Houghton’s, the local jewelry shop. One side of the window displayed gold jewelry and the other half showed the silver items for sale. I spied a sterling silver locket in the shape of a heart. It was perfect for my plans. Pulling a pen, paper and an envelope from my pocket, I penned a quick note to the store owner, asking him to please have the locket delivered to the Vanderlind Castle the following day. With the letter, I included several bills. I knew it was probably more than the small silver trinket cost, but I preferred to pay too much rather than too little. After that I headed for home. My purchase was just a small gesture, but hopefully something that would go a few steps toward keeping my darling girl safe. Colette Gibson meant the world to me. My brother was probably right, as far as what was the reasonable thing to do, but he didn’t understand how I felt in my heart. And I doubted explaining it to him would make much of a difference. By the time I got up the next afternoon, the package had already arrived. I opened it to view the pendant up close, being careful not to actually touch the silver as I flipped open the clamshell box. It was a pretty puffed heart with the silver polished to a shine, yet also understated enough not to draw too much attention. I thought it would be perfect as a present for Colette. I would have gladly given her a diamond the size of a robin’s egg, but we were being clandestine with our love and a showy piece of jewelry might give things away. I tried to arrange to see Colette during the day while she was working, but luck was not on my side. Daniel was awake and skulking around the house. He didn’t bother saying anything to me, nor did he appear to be all that interested in keeping an eye on Miss Gibson, but his presence held me in check from speaking to her. That night I took extra care as I was leaving the castle. At first I flew toward the woods, until I was certain Daniel wasn’t following me. I waited a good hour longer than I normally did before heading to Colette’s house. There was always a strong chance my brother was waiting for me there. But I knew Daniel to be an impatient man. I was convinced that after sitting in wait for thirty minutes, he would give up and look for something else to do. The only problem was that I had no way of contacting Colette to explain my delay. I hoped her feelings wouldn’t be too hurt. I surveyed the area before alighting in the Gibson’s back yard. I was always reasonably cautious about such things, — it was never a good idea to be sighted by a mortal farmer with insomnia — but with Daniel’s suspicions aroused, I had to be even more cautious. I knew my brother meant to force my hand. Little did he realize in which direction I would pull. I had no intention of giving Colette up under any circumstances. Reassured that there were no other vampires about, I strode over to our apple tree, only to have Colette appear out of the shadows. “I didn’t think you were coming,” she said. “I’m sorry, darling,” I told her, immediately taking her in my arms. “My brother suspects there is something between us and…” “And you didn’t want to admit to caring for someone like me,” she said, attempting to finish my sentence for me. “No, that’s not it at all,” I insisted, pulling her even closer. “I would rather give him up than you. But he can cause trouble for us,” I had to admit. “So I waited until I was sure he wasn’t following me.” “How could he cause trouble for us?” she asked. “And why?” I scrunched my face and tried to think of a good way to explain it. “Daniel’s… very traditional,” was all I could think to say. “He’s very inflexible about the Vanderlind name and all that rot. I’m sure he would cause a stink if he thought we had any serious intentions in mind. But my brother is also kind of an idiot, so I rarely pay any attention to him,” I assured her. “So your family wouldn’t approve of me?” she asked, her eyes glistening with potential tears. “My mother would,” I told her. Colette sniffed. “How do you know?” “Because, above everything else, my mother wants her children to be happy.” I placed a tender kiss on her lips. “And you make me happier than I ever imagined I could be.” Colette leaned into me and sighed, contentedly. “I know exactly how you feel.” “I have something for you,” I said, reaching into the breast pocket of my coat for the small, velvet box. “What?” she asked, lifting her head, her eyes wide with surprise. “I have a present for you,” I told her, placing the box in both of her hands. “Open it.” “Oh, Jessie,” she exclaimed as she flipped open the lid. “Oh, it’s so beautiful. I love it.” Colette’s already beautiful face blossomed into a radiant smile. “How did you know?” she asked. “Emily told me,” I said, for lack of a better answer. I had unwittingly done something that had made her very happy and I didn’t want that happiness to fade one ounce, so I concealed my ignorance. “Emily,” she said, giving a small frown. “I don’t think I told her it was my birthday.” It was Colette’s birthday! I took a moment to thank my lucky stars that I had a gift for her. “You’ll have to forgive me, darling, but how old are you today?” “Seventeen,” she said, rather shyly. “Seventeen,” I repeated. Colette and I were the same age. But she would one day turn eighteen and I would never see another birthday. “Does turning seventeen hold any particular significance here in the United States?” I asked. “What do you mean?” Colette wanted to know. “I mean like how in countries where the predominant religion is Judaism, turning thirteen is held in high regard.” “Not really,” she said. And then, putting her hand to her cheek, she added, “Except for maybe one thing.” “What’s that?” I asked. And then Colette explained about a neighboring Justice of the Peace who was very accommodating about granting marriage licenses without a young lady’s parents giving consent, just as long as the girl was seventeen. This was very good news, indeed. I stared at her for a few seconds, torn between prudence and dropping to one knee and proposing right there, on the spot. If I had still been a mortal, then I would have done the latter. But the fact that Colette didn’t know that I was a member of the undead kept me from my matrimonial impulse. “Help me put this on,” Colette said, pulling the pendant from its box. I think she was concealing a blush. “Ah,” I said. I hadn’t anticipated she would ask for my assistance. “I’m afraid I’m a bit clumsy with delicate clasps.” “Oh, please try,” she told me. “I want to wear it right away.” Steeling myself against the pain, I took hold of the silver and attempted to fasten the pendant around her neck. The metal immediately began burning my skin instantly. It was like I was pinching a glowing hot poker between my fingers. I tried not to utter any acknowledgement of pain. I thought surely I could endure the agony long enough to secure a simple clasp. But I had never previously encountered silver as a member of the undead. The pain was excruciating. My hands started to tremble with the effort. “I can’t do it, I’m afraid,” I told her, releasing the chain. “Here, let me try,” she said, taking over. A moment later and the pendant was fastened around her slender neck. “There.” She turned toward me. “What do you think?”",

      "content": "“It looks lovely on you,” I told her. The happiness she exuded quickly made me forget about the pain coursing through my hands. Colette reached up and caressed the heart. “I’ve never loved a gift more,” she told me. “I’m so glad,” was my reply. “You must promise me to always wear it. Especially at night,” I added. “Promise that you’ll never take it off.” “I’ll never take it off,” she assured me, pressing the pendant to her own heart. “But why especially at night?” she asked. “Oh.” I hadn’t even realized I’d urged her to do so. “I...” I stammered, scrambling for any plausible excuse. “I just worry about you, sometimes. You and your sister riding your bicycles home after the sun has gone down. I just feel like if you wear this pendant, then it will be like a good-luck token.” Colette bestowed me with another one of her lovely smiles. “I promise I’ll wear it always,” she said putting her arms around my neck to kiss me. It was challenging to kiss her with the silver being so close to my skin. The memory of the pain that had shot through my hands was still at the forefront of my brain. But none of that mattered if the little trinket kept my darling girl safe from harm. I would have walked out into the noon day sun for her. Something caught my attention and I quickly scanned the skies. It wasn’t so much a noise that had reached my ears, but more like a silence. It was the silence of a bird taking wing. Or a vampire rising into the sky. Chapter 39 Colette The next morning, I couldn’t have been happier as I gathered blossoms for Jessie’s sick brother. The vivid wildflowers of summer had been replaced by the hardy sunflowers and Queen Ann’s lace of fall. The pendant hanging around my neck sent little shivers of happiness up my spine every time it brushed against my skin. The chain was long enough that I could tuck the pendant under the bodice of my dress and it wasn’t too visible with the heart nestling between my breasts. With the sun warming my face, I closed my eyes and thought of Jessie. His kisses filled me with an anticipation that I found challenging to suppress. I so desperately wanted to be with him in every way. I wanted to lie in bed with him, our bodies pressed together, smelling his warm-penny breath. I wanted to know what it was to be a woman and how it felt to be with him as my man. A little shiver of desire crept up my spine. Was seventeen too young to get married, if you knew you were truly in love? “How many flowers does one sick boy need?” Lilly called out as she coasted her bicycle to a stop. I opened my eyes and looked down, releasing a small laugh. I’d been enjoying the humming of the bees, and the grasses gently tugging at my skirt, so much that I hadn’t realized the enormous size of the bouquet I was holding. “What’s that?” Lilly asked as I was putting the flowers in my bicycle’s basket. She reached forward, touching the silver heart dangling from my neck and making it sway. “Oh.” I took half a step backward and covered the pendent with my hand. I guess it had slipped out of the top of my dress when I was bending over to pluck the flowers. “It’s…” I stammered. “Where’d you get it?” Lilly wanted to know. I had no explanation for her. All I could do was stare at her, wide-eyed. My sister’s face grew hard. “Did he give it to you?” I nodded my head. “For my birthday.” “I thought that was over,” Lilly said in a tight voice as she remounted her bicycle. “No,” I told her, also climbing on mine. “It’s definitely not over.” “I hope he hasn’t taken advantage of you,” Lilly said. “That’s usually what happens when the rich boy starts sniffing around the maid.” “It’s nothing like that,” I exclaimed. “You sound like Mama.” Lilly shrugged. “She’s right about a lot of things.” “She wasn’t right about Lev Wilson,” I pointed out as I pushed down on a pedal to get my bike rolling. “She still thinks he’s a nice boy.” “Just be careful,” my sister said, following me. “He’s always been a gentleman,” I insisted, not wanting to say his name out loud for some reason. “That’s not what I’m talking about,” Lilly told me. “At least not completely.” “What, then?” I asked over my shoulder. “I don’t know.” She rode for a few moments in silence. “There’s just something so very peculiar about the Vanderlind family. I don’t like their eyes.” “What about their eyes?” I asked. I loved gazing into Jessie’s eyes. “Their eyes all are the same color,” Lilly said. “Gray. And they’re all so cold... Sometimes it makes me think they’re dead inside, the blank grayness of their eyes.” Lilly was being ridiculous. Jessie was so loving and passionate and wonderful. He couldn’t have been more alive. “Don’t pester me with those,” Mrs. Denkler said when she saw the enormous bouquet I had gathered. “Just take them upstairs. And don’t bother Arthur.” At that point I had taken the flowers up to Arthur’s room numerous times, but the housekeeper always felt the need to warn me that the Vanderlind invalid needed to be left alone. Lilly was right, I thought as I arranged the blossoms in a vase. I had gone a little overboard with my flower gathering that morning. I needed a much larger vase than usual and I could barely see around it at I tottered up the stairs. At the top of the steps, as I peered through the flowers as thick as shrubbery, I thought I saw a figure slipping out of Arthur’s room. Moving my head to one side of the arrangement, I had a clearer view, but I was only able to catch a glimpse of Daniel heading around a corner at the end of the hall. I thought maybe he glanced back at me, but then again, maybe he didn’t. I made my way over to Arthur’s door and set the overfilled vase on the ground. As I pulled my arms away from the arrangement, the flowers expanded and pushed the door to the room open several inches. I froze, not sure what to do. The door was always firmly shut and Mrs. Denkler had warned us in no uncertain terms that we were to never bother Arthur under any circumstances. Did I close the door or leave it open? It was hard to know which was best. After giving it some quick thought, I decided I would just ease the door closed as quietly as possible. The family wanted Arthur to have privacy, after all. I meant to just gently tug the door shut and go back downstairs, but I couldn’t help glancing inside as I reached for the knob. And then I pulled up short. The room appeared to be empty. I guess I had been expecting a large hospital bed and a young man propped up on a pile of pillows, with a nurse tending to him, and some tubes coming out of his arm. But there was no bed, no nurse, not even a young man. At least there wasn’t a young man that I could see. The portion of the room that I could view through the crack in the door was bereft of any furniture. I felt something cold run through me. Glancing up, I double-checked that I was standing in front of the correct door, the one with the bird over it. What was going on? I felt the urge to open the door the entirely, but I also felt like I should just pretend that nothing happened and hurry back down the stairs. Indecision kept me glued to the floor, right at the threshold of the room, for several seconds. I thought about Jessie and how he had tried numerous times to confess his family’s sins to me, but I wouldn’t let him. Then, although my curiosity was killing me, I took hold of the doorknob and eased the door shut. “Is it what you were expecting?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She was standing right behind me and I was barely able to suppress a shriek. “I wasn’t expecting anything,” I told her, backing away from the door a few steps. “When I put the vase down, some of the flowers popped the door open, so I thought I should pull it shut.” Mrs. Denkler frowned. “Don’t lie to me, young lady. I saw you leaving the room. You had yourself a right good snoop.” “I didn’t,” I insisted. “I promise. All I did was stand here for a moment and then try to close the door.” The housekeeper looked like she was on the verge of believing me, when her eyes alighted on my neck. “What’s this?” she demanded, snatching at the pendant that Jessie had given me. “Didn’t I make myself perfectly clear on your first day that you are to wear no personal adornments whatsoever?” “I’m sorry, Mrs. Denkler,” I blurted. “I do remember you telling us, but…” “And silver, nonetheless,” she said, yanking at the chain and causing my head to jerk forward. “What in the world were you thinking?” “I’m sorry,” I said again. “It’s just…” She pulled at the chain another time. “Why on God’s green earth would you wear this?” she demanded. “I have to wear it,” I told her, trying to pry her hand open as she clutched at the locket. “I was told to wear it. Now let go or the clasp is going to break.” “Told to wear it?” she all but shouted. “And who, pray tell, told you to wear it?” “Jessie Vanderlind.” The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. Mrs. Denkler stopped yanking on the pendant, but she did not let go. “Jessie Vanderlind?” she repeated, her eyes wide as if she was having trouble understanding the words. Then she focused on me and gave a sneer of a smile. “Well,” she said, slowly. “Haven’t you been up to all kinds of little tricks? And right under my nose. I should have known better than to hire the likes of you.” The old lady laughed. “And here I thought you were just some good little girl. Oh, so very nice, always gathering flowers for a sick boy.” She jerked on the chain again and I clutched at her hand to stop her from breaking it. “Little did I realize you were just doing it to suck-up. How dare you even think you had a chance of winning the heart of someone like Jessie Vanderlind?” Angry tears filled my eyes. “Why shouldn’t I? He’s good and he’s kind. He loves me and I love him.” “Love?” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed with a rueful laugh. “You are such a little fool.” She looked my face over, closely. “You have no idea what’s going on. Do you? He hasn’t told you a thing.” No, Jessie hadn’t told me he loved me. Not in so many words. Or at least not in a language that I understood. But I knew it in my heart every time he looked at me. I felt it every time we kissed. “He does love me,” I insisted, practically clawing at her hand, but the old woman had a grip like a vice. This elicited more laughter from Mrs. Denkler. “You are such a fool. Someone like Jessie doesn’t know how to love.” She gave me a shake. “That part of him died when he was made.” “No,” I insisted, trying to push her off of me. Her words made no sense. “He loves me. I know he does. And I love him. I love Jessie Vanderlind.” “You have no idea what it takes to love a member of this family,” Mrs. Denkler hissed. “You don’t even know who the Vanderlinds really are. If he loves you so much, then why hasn’t he told you the truth about his family?” “He’s tried,” I insisted. “He’s tried dozens of times, but I wouldn’t let him.” She froze for a moment, her eyes looking quite wild. “I believe you,” she said. “But that makes things worse. Just wait until I tell his grandfather.” “His grandfather is dead,” I whimpered. “Mr. Vanderlind is dead.” “He will never be dead!” Mrs. Denkler shouted. “Do you hear me?” she demanded, giving me another good shake. “A man like that can never die!” “Stop it,” I cried, thrashing against her might, as well as her words. “Leave me alone,” I wailed, using all my strength to wrench myself free. But she yanked me back in the other direction. The clasp of the pendant finally snapping under the strain. I ended up falling forward and crashing through the door to Arthur’s room. I lay there, groaning for a moment. The castle’s floor was hard stone and the wind had been knocked out of me. My elbow throbbed and I let out a sharp whimper when I tried to push myself up. Through a blur of pain, I took in the room. It was, as I’d gleaned through the crack in the door, almost completely devoid of furniture. At the far end of the room there was some type of appliance. It looked like a large icebox, or some kind of new, fancy refrigerator. There was also a small sideboard laid out with rows of clean goblets on one side and dirty on the other. The dirty glasses were coated with the remnants of something that was red and looked sticky. A few flies circled lazily around the soiled crystal. The flowers I had gathered yesterday had been placed to the left of the sideboard, out of the way. “Where’s Arthur?” I asked, cradling my injured arm. Mrs. Denkler just stood there, looking down at me, clutching Jessie’s pendent in her fist. “There is no Arthur,” she told me. “Now get up.” Reaching down, she grabbed me by the shoulders and hauled me to my feet. “I don’t understand,” I said, feeling tearful again. “What happened to him?” “Nothing happened to him,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “You are such a stupid child. Isn’t it obvious?” “No.” I shook my head, covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to look at the room. I didn’t want to see the soiled goblets, all sticky and red. The housekeeper drew a sharp breath, her hands at her sides, balled into such tight fists that her knuckles were white. And then she sighed, her hands releasing, Jessie’s gift slipped through her fingers and onto the floor. “Arthur was sent to New York last week,” she said, her voice becoming much softer. I could tell she was trying to be reassuring. “There’s a clinic there. They think they might have a cure.” “But where are all of his things?” I asked, glancing around at the empty room. “He took everything with him,” she informed me. “He might be there for awhile.” “But…” I couldn’t stop shaking. “Why are you still taking blood donations if Arthur’s not here?” I forced myself not to glance in the direction of the large refrigerator at the far end of the room. “I’ve seen people lining up outside the clinic door, just like usual.” “It’s because…” Mrs. Denkler smoothed her hands over her skirt and I could tell she was casting about for an explanation. “It’s because so many people in the town have come to depend on earning a few extra dollars from donating blood.” She folded her hands in front of her and looked me in the eye. “The family didn’t want to take that money away from people in need. So all the blood is going to local hospitals.” She nodded her head, indicating the back of the castle. “You’ve seen the ambulances drive up and haul the blood away.” “Oh... “I forced myself to stop trembling. “Yes. I hadn’t thought of that. It’s very good of the Vanderlinds to provide such a service.” I forced myself not to think about the soiled goblets on the sideboard. I knew no good would come from asking their purpose. “Yes, they are a great family,” Mrs. Denkler said with conviction. “I’ve never met finer.” “I’m sorry for causing trouble,” I said, trying to stand up straight, but still feeling the need to clutch my elbow; it throbbed with a deep ache. I had to wonder if it was broken. “It’s just when I set the flowers down, the door popped open. That’s all.” “I understand,” Mrs. Denkler said in a voice that was almost kind. “It’s usually locked. I guess someone was careless and left it open.” She stepped forward and touched me on the shoulder. “You’ve had a rough day and I think you should go home now. I’ll have one of the chauffeurs take you home in the car.” “But what about my sister?” I asked, almost afraid to leave Lilly there without me. “And my bicycle?” “I’ll request one of the larger cars,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “There will be ample room to put your bicycle in the back. As for your sister, I’ll tell her you weren’t feeling well so I sent you home.” “Thank you,” I said in a choked whisper, staring hard at the floor. I wanted to ask to take Jessie’s gift with me, but she was staring at me too intently. “I need you to think very closely about what you’ve seen here today,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I need you to think about your relationship with Jessie Vanderlind. I understand that he’s a very handsome young man and I’m sure he can be charming when he chooses, but I hope you also understand that pursuing such a relationship might not be such a healthy choice for a young girl like you.” She reached out and squeezed my shoulder again, this time in a much firmer grip. “You might want to consider seeking other employment, if working here at the castle makes you uncomfortable.” The strength of her grip increased, making me squirm under its pressure. “But mind me when I tell you not to discuss what you’ve seen here,” she said. “About Arthur. The good people of Tiburon don’t need to know anything more about him. If the blood donations were to stop, then that could make things very unpleasant for a great many people.” Chapter 40 Jessie Mother, Emily and I were sitting in the dining hall, enjoying our evening repast when Daniel stalked in. We were used to him being moody and entitled, so his attitude was no surprise, but his presence seemed to fill the very air with disapproval. “Is there something you want to share with us?” Mother asked. “Am I to guess that there is something going on?” Knowing Mother, she just wanted to get on with whatever criticism Daniel was about to rain down on us. “Why don’t you ask him what’s going on?” Daniel said, thrusting his chin in my direction. “It’s called diner,” I said, lifting my goblet for his benefit. “Maybe you should have some. It might make you feel better.” Emily was seated next to mother, enjoying a meal of roasted pork and mashed sweet potatoes. I hated when Daniel had one of his little temper tantrums in front of her. She was at an impressionable age and I didn’t want her to think that she had to tolerate such poor behavior from a man. She kept her head bent to her meal, but I knew she was observing our exchange through her lashes. “It case you haven’t noticed,” Daniel said, continuing to address our mother, “your second son has been diddling with one of the housemaids.” If this came as a surprise to Mother, she did not react as if it was. She simply regarded Daniel with a calm expression on her face. “And you feel that Jessie’s activities somehow affect you?” “It could have damning repercussions for all of us,” he exclaimed. “I don’t see why he couldn’t just go to a cat house if he wants some pretty little mortal to toy with.” “He’s not toying with her,” Emily said, straightening up from her meal. “He’s in love with her.” She looked over at me, her eyes glowing. “And she is completely in love with him.” “That’s completely preposterous,” Daniel practically shouted. “No Vanderlind would soil himself by falling in love with a mortal girl.” Mother turned to look at me, her eyes filled with curiosity, but also encouragement. “Is this true, Jessie? Have you fallen in love with a mortal?” “Yes,” I said, addressing my mother, but steadfastly staring at my brother. “I am in love with Colette Gibson. She is a mortal young woman who works as a maid in this house.” “I knew it,” Daniel all but howled. “I knew you were too soft-hearted. You’ll bring shame to us all. You disgust me.” “Daniel, that’s hardly called for,” our mother chastised him. “And besides, falling in love is the best sort of news. It’s a reason to celebrate.” “Your son admits to being in love with a mortal and you think that’s good news?” Daniel was aghast. “Excuse me, but I really don’t want to be staked in my coffin because of his foolishness. God only knows how much he’s told her about our family.” “I haven’t told her anything,” I said, rising so quickly from my chair that it tipped over. “I’ve actually wanted to tell her. I thought I owed her the truth. But she refused to hear it. She said that she wanted to get to know me and not have her feelings influenced by any dark secrets the Vanderlinds might be concealing.” “She’s obviously just a little gold digger,” Daniel insisted. “She shows you the shapeliness of her ankle and suddenly you fancy yourself in love.” I wanted to fly across the room and smash my brother in the face. But I also knew that he probably wanted me to lose my temper and I wasn’t going to play his game. “I am in love,” I told him. “I know that’s an emotion you don’t easily understand, but just because you’ve never felt love doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.” “At least I know better than to fall in love with some little trollop who probably only sees you as a meal ticket.” He rubbed his chin. “Or maybe that’s how you see her? Were you waiting for someone pure so you could slake both your lust and your appetite?” “Boys!” Mother thundered, slapping her palm down loudly on the table. “That is enough.” She turned to my brother. “Daniel, you are acting beyond ill-bred. Didn’t I raise you to have better manners than this?” “Yes, Mother,” Daniel said, immediately cowed by her displeasure. “I’m glad you realize that,” Mother said. “Now take a seat and let’s hear what your brother has to say.” She turned to me. “Jessie, it makes me so happy to hear that you’ve found someone you care about. And you obviously know that loving a mortal comes with many disadvantages, so I know you didn’t enter into this thing lightly.” Her gaze was steady, but also kind. “I’d like to know what your plans are. Do you think you’d like to turn this girl and make her your bride? Is she the type of young lady who would fare well as a vampire?” “I don’t know,” I had to admit. I loved Colette with every ounce of my soul and I wanted to be with her every moment of the day, but the idea of turning her into a member of the undead had never entered my mind. I loved her for who she was, not for who she might become. “I’d have to give it some thought.” “It’s actually something you should have thought about before you started pawing at her,” Daniel grumbled. “Daniel,” Mother said, sharply. Then she turned back to me. “If you’re truly in love with this girl, then her future is something you have to think about very carefully.” I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no shred of doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. I nodded to Mother. “I understand.” Chapter 41 Colette Mama came running out of the house, apron still tied around her waist, when she saw the big car pull into the driveway. “What happened?” she asked, racing down the steps. “Are you alright?” “I’m fine,” I told her. “Mostly fine. I slipped off a ladder while dusting and hurt my elbow.” My arm had actually stopped throbbing, so I knew it was going to be fine, but it was also a convenient excuse for why I’d left work early. “Here, let me help you into the house,” Mama said, putting her arm around me. “Do you think I should call Doctor Winters?” “No, I don’t think so,” I told her. “It’s probably just really bruised. I’m sure it’ll be better if we just use some ice.” We didn’t have any ice in the house, so Mama sent the chauffeur off to get some. He looked like he wanted to protest, but my mother didn’t give him the opportunity. Then she tucked me in bed and fussed over me, making sure I was comfortable. “Are you sure it’s just your elbow?” she asked, once I was situated. “You seem very upset.” “I’m still a little rattled from the fall,” I assured her. “The castle floors are really hard and I was worried I was going to crack my head.” Mama kissed my head several times just to ward off the horrible thoughts that had obviously entered her brain. “I’m glad you’re alright. But let’s keep an eye on that arm of yours. If it swells more or the pain starts increasing, then I think we should call Dr. Winters anyway. Better safe than sorry.” After letting my mother fuss a bit more, I feigned sleepiness and she left the room. I loved my mother dearly and felt comforted by having her there with me, but I also needed time alone to think. Did Arthur exist? That was a big question that I had no way of answering. The state of his room indicated that he didn’t. Even if he had left for a clinic in New York, then there would still have been some remnants of his having stayed in the room for months on end. There would have been clothes, or leftover medical equipment. And he probably wouldn’t have taken all of his furniture with him. Not if he intended to return to his family home. No, there was nothing to indicate that Arthur had ever been a real person. If I believed that the Vanderlinds did not have a hemophiliac son, then that left a gaping question in need of an explanation. What did they do with the blood? That evening my arm felt much better, yet I didn’t go downstairs for dinner. I didn’t feel like I could face my family. Mama accommodated me by bringing a tray to my room, even though I had very little appetite. “What happened to you today?” Lilly whispered to me, once our bedroom light was off and we were both tucked in our beds. “I slipped and fell,” I told her. “You know how hard the floors are in the castle.” “Mama seems to think you fell off a ladder in the library,” she said. “But I know that’s not true.” Falling off a ladder seemed like such an easy excuse when the chauffeur drove me home. I had forgotten that Lilly would immediately see it for a lie. “I just slipped when I went to take the flowers upstairs,” I told her. Lilly was silent for a moment. “Was Jessie there when you fell?” “No,” I assured her. “But Mrs. Denkler was.” It took a long time for my sister to fall asleep. She knew I was lying about how I’d been injured, but she didn’t pester me for the truth. I was tempted to tell her anyway. I was confused and frightened. I wanted to talk to someone. I wanted someone I trusted to tell me I was being foolish and that there was probably a reasonable explanation for everything. Plus Lilly and I had always shared our secrets, ever since we were little girls. It was a struggle not to tell her, but I knew if I did, then she would tell Mama and Papa. And then we would be forced to give up our positions at the castle. And I would probably never see Jessie again. After more than an hour, my sister’s breathing took on the steady rhythm of the sleeper. But I stayed tucked in my bed, paralyzed with indecisiveness. I loved Jessie. There was no doubt in my mind that I loved him. But that didn’t mean I wasn’t afraid. Finally I couldn’t stand it any longer and I slipped out of bed. Castle gossip being what it was, Jessie had probably already heard about my accident. I wondered how much Mrs. Denkler had told the family about my Arthur discovery. Was Jessie outside the house waiting for me at that very moment? I wouldn’t go outside. Mrs. Denkler had frightened me enough to make that an impossibility. But I had to know if he was out there. Stealing across the room, I pressed myself against the wall, right next to the window. I had to know if he was outside, but I didn’t want him to see me. Our room was dark and the moon was getting close to full. I doubted Jessie would be able to see me, but I still only pulled the curtain aside just enough to peep out. It was difficult for me to see anything on the lawn in the middle of the night. I could make out the apple tree where Jessie and I spent so many wonderful nights arm-in-arm. The tree’s leaves were changing color and falling to the ground. I felt a pang in my chest. I wondered if there was any way I could give Jessie up. I would have to leave my position at the castle, but I had to leave that anyway, once the school was reopened. Ending my secret love affair with Jessie Vanderlind would break my heart. But I knew deep down that it was also probably the smartest thing I could do. No good could come from me being sucked deeper and deeper into whatever dark secret the Vanderlinds were hiding. And then Jessie stepped out of the shadows and looked up at the window where I stood. I thought the darkness would conceal me, but it was obvious that he could see me plain as day. His hair was ruffled and his dark coat billowed around his legs as the wind kicked up. I couldn’t move. All thoughts of my own safety vanished from my mind. All I wanted to do was to run to Jessie, to be with Jessie. Pushing the curtain aside, I pressed one hand against the window’s glass. Jessie took another step forward in response. “What are you doing?” Lilly called from her bed. “What are you looking at out there?” “Nothing,” I told her, hastily stepping away from the window. “I just saw something. I thought there was a fox in the yard, but I think it’s probably just the neighbor’s dog.” “Well, get back in bed,” she told me. “Aren’t you freezing?” “No,” I told her, shaking my head. I hadn’t even noticed the cold. I did not want to go to work the next day, so I claimed that my arm was still too painful to do any polishing or dusting. And it did still hurt quite a bit when I tried to move it. The truth was that I didn’t know what to make of my emotions and working in the castle all day wasn’t going to help me figure them out. Whenever I was anywhere close to Jessie, all I wanted to do was be with him. I needed to have my head clear so I could think things out. Of course I regretted my decision just as soon as Mama left to drive Lilly over in the car. At least when I was in the castle, there was always the hope of a chance-encounter with Jessie. I had no hope of seeing him while sulking around the house all day. But why did I want to see him so desperately? Being away from Jessie felt almost physically painful. But I also felt like I was losing my mind. Was this how everyone my age felt when they fell in love? Was this how Lilly felt about Walter? I went out for a walk to try to clear my head. “You’re so restless today. Do you have a fever?” Mama asked when we sat down for lunch. She pressed her lips to my forehead. “No, you feel just fine.” “I didn’t sleep well last night,” I told her. “I think I’m just overtired.” The day seemed to stretch on forever. I began to look forward to Lilly returning home from work in the hope that she had some news of Jessie. Maybe Emily had spoken to her or maybe Mrs. Denkler had a message for me. But when my sister got home there was nothing. It had apparently been just an ordinary day of dusting and polishing. By the time the sun started to set, I’d worked myself up into a mental state of torment. I began to understand why Guinevere had locked herself away in a convent because she couldn’t deal with how she felt about Lancelot while still being married to the king. As night drew in, I came to a conclusion. Being with Jessie was wrong. I could feel it in my gut that there was danger in the castle. But that didn’t keep me from loving him. I spent hours tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep, but fearing to look out the window. And then, when I finally did manage to close my eyes, I had a tortuous dream where Jessie and I were in love, but I was prohibited from marrying him. Instead I was packed off in a horse drawn carriage and sent far away. The last I saw of Jessie was his figure fading in the distance as he watched the coach carry me off. “How do you feel?” Mama asked when I came downstairs the next morning. “Better,” I told her, but that was only part of the truth. Yes, my arm did feel quite a bit better. — It was only a little sore. — But I actually felt better because I had come to a decision. It was true that I had been frightened by what Mrs. Denkler partially revealed to me about the Vanderlind family. There was obviously a secret there much darker than I had ever imagined. My mind couldn’t even begin to fathom what it might be. But I also knew that nothing could stop me from loving Jessie. If, for some reason, I was never to see him again, I would still love him just as passionately until the day I died as I did at that very moment. I knew I was barely seventeen and these were crazy thoughts for someone my age, but I felt my love for him deep in my soul. It was like it had always been there. Meeting him for the first time had just awoken those feelings from hibernation. I walked into town that afternoon with something on my mind. Would Jessie forgive me for the way I behaved? How could I let him know that I didn’t care about his family’s curse; I loved him for being him. As I strolled along, I stopped to look in the window of Houghton’s and then an idea came to me. The jewelry store was closed on Sundays, but I knew Mr. Houghton lived in the rooms above the shop, so I took a chance and rang the bell. “Yes, young lady?” Mr. Houghton said, peering out of a window on the second floor. He was an older man who lived by himself and had no family. His white hair stuck out on either side of his balding head so that he reminded me of how I’d always imagined Kris Kringle. “Sorry to bother you,” I called up to him. “But I need to buy a present and I have to have it for tonight.” Mr. Houghton was kind enough to open his store just for me. I had been earning good money for the whole summer, but giving most of it to Mama and Papa, so I didn’t have much to spend. There was a gold plated pocket watch that I thought Jessie might like, even though pocket watches were quickly going out of fashion. I had enough money for the watch itself, but not enough for any engraving. Mr. Houghton looked at me from over the top of his bifocals and said, “I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I’m running a Sunday special. Today only, engraving is free.” It took me several minutes to think of just the right words. When I had decided, Mr. Houghton engraved them on the inside of the watch cover. He wrote: Our love is timeless. All of my heart, Lettie As I walked home, Jessie’s present concealed in the pocket of my coat, I wondered if Jessie would come see me that night. I didn’t know if he was angry with me or hurt by my behavior. All I knew was I had to speak to Jessie Vanderlind and earn his forgiveness. Chapter 30 Colette “Did you know you were in love with Walter the first time you met him?” I asked as Lilly and I got ready for bed. My sister had been brushing her hair in front of the mirror and she paused as she thought about it. “I knew that I thought he was good looking,” she told me. “I knew right away that I found him attractive.” “But how long until you knew you were in love with him?” I persisted as I wiggled into my nightgown. “And who says I am in love with Walter?” she asked, giving me a coy look over her shoulder. “Oh, come on, Lilly,” I told her. “How long until you knew you were in love?” “Not that long,” she admitted. “I knew that I liked him a whole lot and then one day I just knew it was love. I think I really knew it at the dance when, instead of trying to defend Lev’s behavior, he was instantly trying to think of another way to get us home. That’s when I knew I wanted to marry him.” I took a moment to digest the fact that my sister knew she wanted to marry Walter Bennett. “And you think you’d feel differently if he’d rushed to Lev’s defense and said some horrible excuse like, ‘boys will be boy,’ or something like that?” Lilly frowned a little. “I don’t know. I’d like to think that I would. But I also know Walter, and he would never say anything so aweful. That’s a big part of the reason why I love him.” I envied Lilly. Her love for Walter seemed so simple. They loved each other and one day they would get married. There was no disease. There was no difference in social position. There wasn’t some dark family curse keeping them apart. “Are in love?” Lilly asked. Her question caught me by surprise. I wanted to tell her yes. I wanted to share that I was madly in love with Jessie Vanderlind and that he was in love with me. It didn’t feel right to keep my feelings from her, even thought I’d been fighting for the last few days to keep them from myself. “I don’t know,” I told her, after giving it some thought. “Things are complicated.” Lilly shook her head. “If the first word out of your mouth wasn’t yes, then you’re not in love. That’s not how love feels.” I pulled down the blankets on my bed and climbed in. “I guess you would know.” “Well, I’m glad if you’re not,” she said, reaching over to switch off the lamp that sat on a small table between our two beds. “I mean, I want you to be in love, but not with that Vanderlind boy. I know he’s beautiful, but there’s something not right with that family. I don’t know what it is, but there’s obviously something not quite right.” I thought about Lilly’s words as I waited for her to fall asleep. My first impulse had been to admit to her that I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. In fact, I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. But I was still reluctant to tell her. Maybe it was because I knew Lilly would disapprove. Maybe it was because I wasn’t sure of Jessie’s feelings. We’d never said I love you, but I had no doubt about my feelings. Once Lilly’s breathing became regular, I put on my robe and slipped outside. I didn’t know if Jessie was going to be there, but I was ready to wait all night. As I hurried across the lawn, Jessie stepped out of the shadows and caught me in his arms. “Oh, Jessie,” I exclaimed in a loud whisper, my voice practically startled out of me. “What happened?” he asked, a concerned frown pulling at the corners of his mouth. “Mrs. Denkler said she had to send you home on Friday. And then I saw you in the window Friday night, but you didn’t come out.” “I went upstairs to leave Arthur’s flowers in the hallway, but his door popped open a few inches,” I told him, taking strength from the fact that his arms were still around me. “I went to pull it closed, but then Mrs. Denkler came up and accused me of looking in the room.” “Oh,” Jessie said, looking even graver than he had before. “And then she saw the pendant you gave me and she grew very angry. We’re not allowed to wear any personal adornment at work and she tried to rip it form my neck. I stumbled and ended up falling into the room,” I confessed. “I saw what was in there. And what wasn’t.” “And what did Mrs. Denkler say to you?” he asked, cautiously. “She said that Arthur had been sent to a clinic in New York,” I admitted. “And that it would be a very bad thing for the town if the blood donations were to stop.” Jessie took me by the shoulders and held me slightly away from him so he could look into my eyes. “I should have never let this happen,” he said. “I should have just kept away, even with how I feel about you.” “No,” I told him, shaking my head. “If you feel anything for me like I feel about you, then that would have been impossible.” “I feel more for you than I ever imagined I could.” His eyes searched mine. “But I need to explain,” Jessie said, furrowing his forehead as he struggled with some dark burden that I knew he was reluctant to share. “I need to tell you about my family.” “Please don’t,” I said, closing the gap between us. “Not now. I know that there is some horrible secret that you hide from the world. But I don’t want to know. Not yet. I just want to love you, and know that you love me, and not worry about whatever your family really does with the blood for Arthur.” “I love you,” Jessie whispered, his voice hoarse. “I’ve loved you since before I even met you. I can’t begin to explain how, but it’s true.” “I know,” I told him. “I feel the exact same way.” “But still,” he went on. “This secret of my family’s... It’s much worse than you can possibly imagine.” “Please don’t,” I told him, touching his perfect lips to stop his words. “Don’t tell me you love me and then spoil it all in the next breath. Let me just enjoy this moment.” He nodded his head slightly. “I have something for you,” I said, suddenly feeling shy. Jessie was from an incredibly wealthy family. The watch I had purchased for him was only made of gold plate. “What is it?” he asked, sensing my sudden reluctance. “It’s not much,” I admitted, pulling the small package form the pocket of my robe. He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it. “If it’s from you, then I shall cherish it forever,” he assured me. I carefully observed his face as he unwrapped the watch and read the engraving. “It’s wonderful,” he said, and I could tell he was sincere. “The engraving alone means the world to me.” “I meant every word,” I told him. “I’m not sure how, but our love does feel timeless. At least it does for me.” “It does for me,” he quickly assured me. “I know that I’ll never stop loving you.” And then he dropped to one knee and took my hand. “There’s a question I need to ask you.” Chapter 42 Jessie “She left?” I asked, frowning at my little sister. “Yes,” Emily said, nodding a few times. “Mrs. Denkler sent her home in a car.” My impulse was to rush over to the Gibson house immediately to see if Colette was alright, but the sun was still shining in the sky so I wouldn’t have made it very far. “Do you have any idea what happened?” I asked, both of my hands clenched at my sides with the frustration of my impotence. “All I know is that Colette went upstairs to deliver the flowers that she brought. Mrs. Denkler followed her.” Emily shifted from foot to foot, obviously feeling anxious as well. “And then Denkie was dragging Colette downstairs by the arm and ordering the chauffeur to bring the car around to the back to take her home.” I ran my hand through my hair a few times. “Do you think it had anything to do with Arthur?” I asked. “I don’t know.” Emily looked alarmed. She knew how important it was to keep the family’s unfortunate situation a secret. “That’s the only thing I can think it might be.” Quickly, I sought Mrs. Denkler, finding her in her sitting room, having a cup of tea. “What happened to Colette?” I asked. “Who?” she asked, frowning slightly, as if trying to place the name. “Colette Gibson,” I said for clarity. “I heard that she had to go home for the day.” “Oh, you mean Miss Gibson, the housemaid,” she said, setting down her cup. “Yes, I think we may no longer be in need of Miss Gibson’s services.” “What in the world happened?” I asked. I needed some sort of explanation because my imagination was running wild. “Someone apparently left the door to Arthur’s room unlocked and it popped open. I’m afraid she saw into the room,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “I heard she was injured,” I pressed. “She stumbled and may have hurt her arm,” the housekeeper admitted. “But it was just a little bump. Nothing of consequence.” “But what did you tell her?” I asked. “How did you explain Arthur’s absence?” She gave a small shrug, as if she couldn’t understand my concern. “I said that he had left last week for a clinic in New York.” “And she believed you?” I demanded. “I see no reason why she wouldn’t believe me,” Mrs. Denkler said with the conviction of a person who was used to never being questioned. “I think she found the soiled goblets a bit disconcerting, and she did have a few questions as to why we were still paying people for their blood. But I explained that it was healthier for the town if the donations continued.” I stared at the housekeeper for several seconds, trying to decide if she was being intentionally obtuse. “Are you saying that you purposely frightened the girl?” Mrs. Denkler shook her head. “Girls like that are never frightened. Not even when it’s obvious that they should be.” She gave me a penetrating look with eyes as hard as flint. “She’s the kind of girl who always makes trouble in a great house. I should have seen that. I would have never hired her, but...” She paused for a moment with a far-away look in her eyes and then shook her head. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll release her from her position tomorrow and that will be the end of it.” “You will do no such thing,” I informed her. The housekeeper put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “I have a responsibility to run this house in the manner that it was run when your grandfather was alive. He never tolerated nonsense from the staff. Especially the kind of nonsense I suspect has been going on for the past few months.” She gave me a significant look. “The Vanderlind reputation must be upheld.” “You have an obligation to do as you are told, Mrs. Denkler,” I informed her. “You are not above being released from your position. Just remember that.” Mrs. Denkler’s eyes bulged with surprise and she clutched at the lace on her high collar. “You wouldn’t,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been the housekeeper for the castle since before you were born.” Her eyes were glistening and I saw that she was actually fighting back tears. “You’re right, Denkie,” I told her, squeezing her shoulder to be reassuring. “I wouldn’t. But let’s not fight over this. Just make sure that Miss Gibson remains employed here and we’ll say nothing else about it.” The tears were instantly replaced by Mrs. Denkler’s customary shrewd appearance. “You want the maid to stay a maid. I understand.” That was not my point, by any means, but I didn’t want to argue with her any longer. The rest of the day passed at a snail’s pace. I was practically climbing the walls. As soon as the sun dipped below the horizon, I was out the door. And outside Colette’s window a few minutes after that, concealing myself in the long shadows of the backyard. It was foolish to arrive so early. My skin was throbbing with the pain of the dwindling sunlight and Colette wouldn’t be expecting me until much later, if she was expecting me at all. But I had to be near here. I had to know that she wasn’t injured in any way. I had to know if she still loved me, or if she now considered me some kind of fiend. As the minutes slowly dragged by, I grew increasingly anxious about Colette’s affections. I’d only known her for a few short months, but her feelings for me were the axis upon which my whole world turned. If Mrs. Denkler had revealed more than she’d admitted, or if Colette was able to surmise the truth from what she saw in Arthur’s room, then there was a strong possibility that I would never hold my dear girl in my arms again. It would be a harsh reality, but one that I would more than likely have to face. I only wished that I had been the one to tell her about the curse that my grandfather had spread to all of us. That would have been the noble thing to do. Instead I just kept ignoring the truth because I so desperately wanted to be with her. If only I hadn’t caught scarlet fever. If only Grandfather had been a better man. But such was my life. I had to accept the fact that fate was a cruel master. The light in Colette’s bedroom came on as the hour approached ten and then went off again shortly thereafter. I knew that Colette shared a room with her sister and that she had to wait until Lilly had fallen asleep. I stood by our apple tree and waited, my eyes glued to the window. An hour ticked past and there was no movement that I could discern. As the second hour got underway, I saw the curtain twitch and caught a glimpse of Colette’s hair. She probably assumed she was concealed by the darkness of her room, but I could see her as plain as day. Stepping away from the tree, I stood on the lawn, looking up at her. Moving the curtain aside, Colette looked down at me. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from her. She was just so lovely; it ripped at my heart not to be able to take her in my arms. But she wasn’t moving. She wasn’t coming down to be by my side. She just stood there, safe behind the walls of her family’s home, and stared at me. Did she know the full truth? Or had she simply guessed that the secret that I’d been on the verge of telling her so many times was much worse than she’d ever imagined. I knew she hadn’t completely turned against me. If she had, then she wouldn’t have been standing there with her palm pressed against the glass. Lilly must have awoken and drawn Colette’s attention because she suddenly turned away and then disappeared from view. I stood on the lawn for most of the rest of the night, but Colette did not return to the window. I knew she wouldn’t, but I found it almost impossible to leave. I decided to sleep in my coffin that dawn. It wasn’t my usual custom, but I felt like I needed walls around me or I might explode. I hated that I was a vampire. I felt desperate to escape the prison of being a member of the undead. I longed for the simple pleasures of mortality, like holding Colette’s hand while strolling in the sunshine. “What’s this I hear about housemaids sneaking into Arthur’s room?” Daniel demanded as he stalked into the dining hall the next evening. “I knew we should have never hired anyone local.” “I think you’re being a bit overdramatic, darling,” Mother said, setting down her goblet. “One of the maids got a peek into Arthur’s room because someone left the door unlocked. But Mrs. Denkler explained it all away, so there’s no need to get your nose bent out of shape.” “Well, I think we should fire her anyway,” Daniel said, helping himself to a crystal goblet and filling it from a carafe on the table. “Or maybe get rid of her altogether. One can never be too cautious about these things.” “You will not touch one hair on her head!” I found myself snarling from my seat on the other side of the table. It was a ridiculous thing to have said. Mother was making light of the problem and that was probably the best course of action. But Daniel was so cavalier about ending the life of the girl I loved, that I found it hard to control my temper. “Oh,” my brother said with an amused smirk. “Was it the little trollop who Jessie’s been toying with? Well, this does add an intriguing twist to the evening.” “She’s not a trollop and I haven’t been toying with her,” I informed him, knowing full well that I was rising to the bait. Daniel cocked an eyebrow and took on a superior tone. “So what have you decided to do with the girl?” he asked. “Don’t leave us all in suspense.” “I’ve decided that I’m going to ask her to marry me,” I said, glaring straight back into his eyes. “You can’t!” Daniel practically shrieked. “The undead can’t marry the living. The Bishops would never stand for it.” “They would if I conjoin with her,” I said, keeping my own voice steady. “And that is what I intend to do.” “Conjoin?!” Daniel sounded like I had just offered him a slug of poison. “You know some little trollop for a few weeks and you decide you want to be with her forever?” “Yes,” I said, firmly. “Then just turn her, you fool!” my brother exclaimed. “That’s the reasonable thing to do. You can’t bond yourself for eternity to someone who is going to get old and gray while you’re still in your prime. That’s insanity.” “That’s love,” our mother said in a much quieter voice. Daniel swung around to face her. “You’re not helping!” he shouted. “Watch your tone,” she said to him. Then, turning to me, Mother said, “Sweetheart, you know that if you conjoin with a mortal, then you can never be with anyone else, not for the rest of eternity. You wouldn’t be able to be with your own kind.” “Not that a vampiress would have you,” Daniel said with a sneer. “You would probably be shunned from vampire society,” Mother pointed out. “And what would you do after she passed away?” It was a thought so painful to me that I had trouble even thinking about it. “I don’t know.” “You make me sick,” my brother said. “Thinking you’re in love... You’ve been going to the damn theater too often. You’re not in love. You don’t know anything about it.” I shrugged my shoulders. “It’s the way I feel.” “But you’re only seventeen,” Mother insisted. “How do you know it’s the way you will always feel?” “Turn her,” Daniel said. “If you don’t like her as a vampiress, you can always stake her and be done with it.” “Daniel,” Mother exclaimed. “I hope you are being facetious.” My brother gave her a flat look. “What would you have me say? He can’t conjoin with her. That would bring shame to all of us. I’m not going to be ostracized from all good society just because Jessie has a crush.” “It’s more than a crush,” I assured him. “Much more.” “Oh, save your romantic pap for the mortal,” Daniel snarled. “I don’t buy any of it.” “I’m sorry you feel that way,” I told him, “but I’m not changing my mind.” “Mother,” Daniel said, turning to face her. “Are you going to stand for this nonsense?” Our mother lifted her hands, palms up, in dismay. “The heart wants what the heart wants.” “I think the family’s honor should come before Jessie’s foolish notions of love.” I knew Daniel and I would never see eye-to-eye, so I addressed our mother when I said, “I want to go before the Bishops and explain my position.” “You will do no such thing,” Daniel snapped, shoving between us and getting right up in my face. “I won’t let you.” I gave him a steady look. “It’s not up to you.” “I am the head of this family now,” Daniel said, sticking his chin in the air. This caused me to grin. “Only in your own mind.” “Mother, are you going to allow him to do this?” Daniel whined. “Both of you need to stop,” she said in her most no-nonsense tone. “I think we should wait and allow cooler heads to prevail. Daniel, you need to stop thinking you’re in charge. I had quite enough of that from your grandfather.” Turning to me, she said, “And you need to slow down. This is a monumental decision and it shouldn’t be made on just one day’s sleep.” “But...” I intended to protest that I hadn’t made the decision lightly, but Mother held up her hand. “Daniel is right in that this decision will affect all of us, so I ask that you not do anything too hastily.” Reaching up, she caressed my cheek and looked into my eyes. “I know you don’t take love lightly,” she told me, “but I think a little patience is called for. A few months delay won’t mean the end of the world. And right now I think you really need some perspective.” “You’re wrong,” I said. “Both of you. The love I feel for Colette is different than anything I ever imagined. It’s as if my life only really began when I met her.” “I can’t stay here and listen to this nonsense,” Daniel growled. “I’m going upstairs to pack a bag. If Jessie’s going to ruin the family, I’m sure not going to stand around and watch it.” He glanced at our mother. “I’m going to New York. Call me when you’ve talk some sense into him.” If it had been only Daniel who was against me, then I would have simply ignored him. But I had always heeded the advice of my mother. I knew she had my best interest in mind. If she thought I needed time to reconsider, then I needed to take some time. Daniel was as good as his word. He left the castle later that night. I was happy to see the back of him. I didn’t need him glowering at me and complaining about the honor of the family. Families survived scandal all the time. It was true that conjoining with a mortal was something that would probably ostracize me from the undead world, but I found that the more I thought about it, the less I cared. I’d never wanted to be part of the undead world. “You won’t have enough time to make it to New York,” Mother said, as Daniel was headed out the door. “I’ll overnight in Cleveland,” he said, giving her a brusque kiss on the cheek. “I just need to get out of here before I ram a stake through Jessie’s romantic heart.” “It’s probably best that you go for a little while,” she said, leading him to the door. “Have a safe flight.” “Update me when my little brother has come to his senses,” he said, sparing me a withering glance and then disappearing into the night. It was painful, but I didn’t go to see Colette that night. My brain became too full of pink champagne bubbles whenever I was near her. I desperately wanted to fly along the river to try to clear my head. But I knew if I went outside, then I would suddenly find myself in Colette’s yard. So I stuck to the castle, spending most of the night in my room. My isolation was a special kind of torture, with my thoughts being constantly filled by Colette. I wanted to see her so desperately, and yet I had no idea if she wanted to see me. I spent another day in my coffin, practically tearing apart the upholstery. All I could think about was Colette. How could she possibly have won my heart so easily? And how could I ever give her up? Ending my romance with Colette Gibson and then leaving Tiburon for the next couple of decades would be the right thing to do. Turning her into a member of the undead would be the selfish thing to do. And conjoining with Colette for the rest of her life, and the rest of my eternity, would be the foolish thing to do. I knew all of that. The only problem was; I didn’t know which option to choose. I couldn’t see clearly which was the right path to take. By the time the sun was starting to set and I climbed out of my coffin for the evening, I knew only one thing for sure; I had to see her. I took special care dressing that evening. It was possibly the last time I would ever see my darling girl and I wanted to look my best. I put on a dark gray suit and even went so far as to decorate my lapel with a red carnation. I took my fill of blood and then slipped out of the castle without a word to anyone. I was undecided in my actions, but I didn’t want Mother or Emily to interfere. I was grateful Daniel had left. Just knowing he was in New York made me feel less on edge. As I flew along, I resolved that I had to confess. I had to explain everything to Colette and then let the cards fall where they may. She deserved to know what I was. She deserved to know the truth. Chapter 43 Colette “Colette Gibson,” Jessie said, looking up at me with his fathomless gray eyes. “Will you marry me?” “Yes,” I said, as soon as the words had passed through his perfect lips. I probably should have hesitated. I probably should have taken some time to think it over. But I didn’t want to. Every fiber of my being wanted to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I didn’t care that his family was hiding some dark, morbid secret. That had nothing to do with Jessie. That had nothing to do with our love. Jessie sprang to his feet and swept me up in his arms. Under his long coat, he was wearing some type of dark suit. There was a red flower in his lapel. He had come dressed for the occasion and I wished that I was wearing something besides my nightgown and wrapper. But then he washed all my awkwardness away by saying, “You’ve made the happiest man in the world.” And then he kissed me. It was a kiss that both filled me with heat and made me shiver. “Should we go to your family? Or should I speak to your father alone?” Jessie asked. “How are things like this handled in your country?” “I...” I stammered. I had no idea what to tell him. I wanted to be his bride, but I knew my family would insist upon a lengthy engagement and I wanted to be with Jessie that very instant. “I think we should elope.” It was as if dark clouds filled Jessie’s eyes. “Why?” he asked. “Because I can’t wait to be your wife,” I explained. “Every second I’m away from you feels like an eternity.” “But your family...” he began. “I know,” I told him. “I hate to cause my parents any grief, but once they see how happy I am as Mrs. Jessie Vanderlind, then I know they’ll forgive us for running off.” Jessie frowned. “It wouldn’t be honorable,” he said. “We’re already starting our life together with too many secrets. And if you would only let me...” “Don’t,” I said, stopping his lips with a kiss. “I know you have your secrets, but share them with me when we are husband and wife.” “When?” he asked, burying his face in my hair. “If we are to be wed, then I want it to be this instant.” “Tomorrow night,” I told him. “We can sneak down the Tiburon to Yontville and wake up the Justice of the Peace. Then I can call my family in the morning and tell them the good news.” The clouds parted from Jessie’s brow. “I love you Colette Gibson,” he told me. “I can’t believe you want to be my wife.” “I’ve never wanted anything more in the world,” I assured him. Then I thought of something. “What about your family?” I asked. He was quiet for a moment. “What about them?” “Will they approve of us?” I put a hand to my cheek at the thought of how they would react. “I can’t imagine they will.” A rich young man running off with the maid was not something fine families usually found appealing. “I hate to think of your family disliking me. And I don’t want them to think that I’m some kind of...” I fought off the urge to say gold digger. “My sister already adores you,” Jessie assured me, squeezing me in his arms. “And my mother will love you just as soon as I tell her that you are my bride.” “What about your brothers?” I asked, with some hesitancy. “What about Arthur and Daniel?” “Arthur is...” he began. “Arthur is someone we don’t have to worry about.” He shook his head and then continued with, “And Daniel left for New York last evening. We don’t expect him back for at least a month.” And then he kissed me again, a deep, penetrating kiss that I felt all the way down to my toes. “I don’t think I can wait that long,” I said, my breath catching in my throat with anticipation. “Tomorrow evening then,” he said, running his fingertips across my cheek, down my neck and to my collarbone. His caress sent shivers through my whole body. “Where shall we rendezvous? Shall I meet you here, by our favorite apple tree?” “No,” I said, thinking it over. I hated deceiving my family. It would be an emotional challenge for me to sneak off, if only for less than a day. And when I came home again, I would no longer be a girl. I would be a married woman. I wanted to leave the house by myself. I wanted to say goodbye to my present life and step away from childhood all on my own. “I’ll meet you at the castle,” I finally told him. Jessie was about to say something in protest, but I stopped him by adding, “I mean outside the castle, in the woods out there along the river. If you can arrange a boat, then we can row down to the next town.” Jessie probably could have arranged a car, but a boat sounded so much more romantic. “Are you sure that’s what you want?” Jessie asked. “It will be dark. I would feel better accompanying you.” “No, this is something I have to do on my own,” I assured him. “And besides, Tiburon is perfectly safe, day or night. We haven’t had so much as a robbery since I can remember.” “But...” Jessie tried protesting again. “How will you get there? On your bicycle? What kind of bridegroom would I be if I allowed that to happen?” “Don’t you worry about me,” I said, patting him on the forearm to assure him. “You just focus on finding a boat that doesn’t leak. Our elopement will be a lot less romantic if we ended up getting soaked.” “Shall we meet at midnight?” he asked. I nodded. “Midnight,” I repeated. “But shouldn’t we choose an exact spot? Do you know of an old tree or something? How will we find each other?” Jessie gave it some thought. “There’s that large oak tree by the water’s edge. The one where the boughs hang way out over the water.” I knew the exact tree. “Sure,” I told him. “It’s got a rope swing. In the summer, kids use it all the time for swimming.” “Oh.” Jessie frowned a little. “I’m not sure that there’s a rope swing.” “I think we’re probably talking about the same tree, but maybe we should pick someplace else, just in case.” “Don’t worry,” Jessie assured me, bending slightly to nuzzle my hair. “No matter where you are, I’ll always be able to find you.” Chapter 44 Colette I begged off from work for another day. I needed time alone in the room I shared with Lilly to prepare for my elopement, and I couldn’t exactly pack with my family around. My mother frowned when I told her that I was staying home. “If you’re still in pain, then maybe we really should call the doctor.” “I don’t think that’s necessary,” I said. “I’m sure by tomorrow I’ll be right as rain.” Mama reached up and laid her hand against my cheek, looking into my eyes. “Are you sure that’s all it is?” she asked. “It’s just a sore arm. Nothing else is bothering you?” “No.” I shook my head back and forth a few times. “Nothing at all.” I’d always been an obedient daughter and never given my parents much grief. They were good parents and I knew they loved me, so it seemed only fair to show them the same consideration. Not telling them about my engagement to Jessie was one of the most difficult things I’d ever done. But I knew if I told them, then they would want me to wait. They’d insist that I finished high school and get to know Jessie better. But I wouldn’t wait. I couldn’t wait. Being in Jessie’s arms, sharing a life together, was all I could think about. Papa needed to get out the door bright and early to make sure everything was running smoothly on the town hall project. They were going to pour the foundation soon and he wanted to make sure it was done right. Mama was going to drop him off and then drive over to meet up with a few of her old school friends who live in the next town. They got together for a luncheon a few times a year. This was perfect for my plans because it left me with the house to myself for a few hours until Mama returned. Even though I was still in my nightgown when my parents were about to leave, I ran downstairs to give both of them a hug and a kiss goodbye. “You’re being awfully affectionate this morning,” Papa remarked as I took a moment to give him a second squeeze. “Am I?” I asked, putting my arms around Mama and hugging her again, too. “I just wanted to let you know how much I love you.” Mama gave me a kiss on the head. “We love you too, you silly girl. Are you sure you don’t feel well enough to go to work? You seem to be full of energy and I wouldn’t want you to lose your position.” Gingerly moving my elbow up and down, I said, “It still hurts a little, but I’m sure I’ll be fine in another day if I just take it easy.” After they left, pulling the door closed behind them, I turned around to find Lilly sitting on the stairs, watching me. “What are you up to, Lettie?” she asked, suspicion in her eyes. “Nothing,” I assured her. “I’m just letting my arm heal.” “Is that all it is?” she asked, getting to her feet. “Because you’re acting awfully funny.” “No, I’m not,” I insisted. “If you want to give your notice at the castle, then I’m all for it,” she said. “Papa has his town hall job and then he’ll work on the school. We don’t have to keep working there. Our family’s doing fine now.” Her comment surprised me. “Don’t you like working at the castle?” “If I’m being completely honest, no,” she said. “The work is fine, but the family makes me uncomfortable. There’s something about them that’s just not right. You can see it in their eyes.” “They all have beautiful eyes,” I insisted. I couldn’t bear to hear Jessie criticized. “No.” Lilly shook her head. “They all have cold eyes. Dead eyes. Like the eyes of a shark.” “You’re being ridiculous,” I told her. “And you’re only saying that because of the color. The Vanderlinds can’t help it that their eyes are gray.” “I suppose,” Lilly said. “But I still don’t like it there. I heard that Mrs. Zucker’s cousin isn’t working out at the store. They’re going to be hiring again and I’m thinking of asking for my old job back.” My first impulse was to tell her not to do it. I couldn’t imagine leaving the castle, even if I wasn’t betrothed to Jessie. But then I thought about how odd it would be if Lilly was still working there as a maid while I was Jessie’s wife. “Maybe you should,” I told her. “That might be a good idea, seeing that you don’t like it.” “I’ll ask for you, too,” my sister told me. “I think it would be better if we left the castle together.” “Thank you,” I said, giving her a hug. “I love you, Lilly.” “I love you, too,” she said, pulling away from me while giving me another suspicious look. “But I wish I understood why you are acting so strangely.” After Lilly left for work, it didn’t take me long to decide on my wedding trousseau. I wanted to wear my organdy dress as my bridal gown, but it was still torn from my encounter with Lev Wilson. I decided on my green dress with the white flowers. It was of a light fabric, so I knew I’d probably be chilly, but once Jessie and I were together, he could put his arms around me and keep me warm. I positioned the dress and my favorite hat, the straw one with the silk daisies on it, toward the front of the closet. That way it would be easier to retrieve my clothes without disturbing my sister. After that I pulled a small suitcase down from the closet shelf, flipped it open on the bed, and packed my prettiest nightgown. I knew I would also need something to wear the next morning, so I added a sweater and a wool skirt, along with some warm tights and a few toiletries. There was still my toothbrush and a few other items, but I thought I would slip those things in at the last minute, so that no one in my family would notice anything missing. Taking a seat at my desk, I pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and found a pen. I didn’t want my family to panic when they found my bed empty in the morning. That wouldn’t be a nice thing to do to them. So I thought I would write a note, just to assure everyone that I was fine and in no danger. It would lessen the surprise when Jessie and I called the next morning as newlyweds, but it was better not to make my parents worry. Dear Family, I’m sorry for keeping this secret from you, but Jessie Vanderlind and I have fallen in love. In fact, by the time you read this note, I will already be his wife. I apologize for sneaking off and eloping in this way, but I know you would counsel me to wait to get married until we’re both a little older. I’m afraid I love Jessie too much to delay. I hope you’ll forgive me, once you see how happy he makes me. He truly is the most wonderful man I have ever met. We’ll call you when we get up. Please don’t worry until then. I’m sure Jessie will take good care of me. I love you all very much. Lettie It was just as I was signing my name when I heard the front door open and close. Snatching the note off my desk, I tossed it into the suitcase, on top of my clothes. Snapping the lid shut, I quickly tucked the whole thing under my bed. “Lettie,” I heard my mother call as she was climbing the stairs. A moment later she was poking her head in the door. “Hi, Mama,” I said. “What are you doing back so soon?” “I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said, pulling the pin from her hat. “After dropping your father off, I drove half way there before I realized the luncheon isn’t until next week.” Chapter 45 Jessie I’d already worn my favorite suit when I’d proposed to Colette, so I felt at a bit of a loss for proper wedding attire. I wondered if it would be considered bad manners to wear the suit again for the ceremony. My next choice was to wear my tuxedo, but I decided against that pretty quickly. I sincerely doubted Colette had a wedding dress tucked away in her closet and it wouldn’t do to be dressed fancier than the bride. I did have a blue suit that I’d been told was becoming, but I couldn’t seem to find it anywhere in my closet. After an extensive search, I discovered it crumpled on the floor. It must have not been hung up properly when the household contents were unpacked. It definitely needed a good pressing. When I’d flown back from Lettie’s, I’d spent the rest of the night searching for a boat. My mother had plans to get a couple of small boats for the castle, but no one had gotten around to ordering them yet. Most people who used the river had already taken their boats out of the water in anticipation of the first big freeze. I had to soar up and down the river for a few hours until a small rowboat, pulled up on the bank and turned over to dry, caught my eye. It wasn’t the most attractive of conveyances, but I hoped that Colette would find it romantic. By the time I’d towed it back to the castle and hid it in the woods, the sun was preparing to rise. As I hurried inside, the sunlight had already starting to lighten the sky, making my skin ache. I had to laugh at my own stupidity. I didn’t want to be such a distracted bridegroom that I ended up inadvertently roasting myself. Once I was safe inside the walls of the castle, I found that I was inordinately tired. But there were still so many things that I had to get done. I had to choose my wedding suit. I had to figure out a plan to avoid the sun once we’d been officially wed. I loved Lettie more than I loved my own life, but it would be a terrible shock for her to see her new husband burn to a crisp the morning after her wedding. I also needed to find some type of ring for my darling girl. I intended to have her real wedding ring specially crafted, but there wasn’t time at the moment. I would just have to go through the family vault and find a temporary ring adequate for the ceremony. My head throbbed and I realized I was hungry. I hurried to Arthur’s room and helped myself to one of the blood packets in the refrigerator. Packing had to wait, I decided as I finished my meal. I needed time to rest. The knowledge that Colette would soon be my bride must have put me at ease because I quickly found the repose that was usually so elusive. When I finally opened my eyes again, the sun had set on another day. I immediately leapt to my feet and started packing, which led to the dilemma about which suit to wear. I rang for a maid and handed her the blue suit. “I need this pressed right away,” I told her. “Bring it to me just as soon as it’s ready.” And then I headed to the vault, where we kept quite a bit of the family jewelry. The vault was a large room in the dungeon that Grandfather had converted into a walk-in safe. Three of its walls were stone and the fourth was a large, metal door with a combination lock. It would be foolhardy for a mortal to steal from vampires, but we saw no reason to subject the servants to temptation. Especially with so much jewelry around. We could easily lose dozens of pieces and never even notice for a few decades, if ever. Once I opened the vault, I was faced with a real challenge. What was an appropriate ring for a girl like Lettie? I dug through boxes upon boxes of jewelry, putting rings aside that I thought might be a possibility, but nothing seemed quite right. I knew that Lettie came from a good family, but she wasn’t used to the wealth of a family like the Vanderlinds. I didn’t want to overwhelm her with a giant diamond, but I didn’t want to insult her with a ring of no consequence. It was just impossible to put everything I felt for Miss Gibson into one tiny piece of jewelry. “You wanted to see me?” Mrs. Denkler asked, appearing in the vault’s doorway. “What?” I had been so absorbed in finding the right piece of jewelry that I hadn’t even heard her approaching. “One of the maids said you were looking for me,” she said, her eyes flitting over the pile of jewelry in front of me. “Is there something I can help you find?” “No, that’s quite alright,” I assured her. “This is…” I couldn’t think of an excuse for why I was combing through diamond rings. “I didn’t send for you,” I finally managed to say. “I just wanted my blue suit pressed.” “One of the maids is doing it now,” she said. “Is there a special occasion?” “No, no,” I assured her. “I just found my blue suit crumpled on the floor of my closet and I want it pressed.” “The maid said you wanted it right away,” she said, persisting in knowing why I was acting so suspiciously. “I’d like it done,” I told her. “Whoever hung up my clothes made a poor job of it.” “I apologize,” the housekeeper said. “I will see to it that whoever is responsible has their pay docked.” “Please don’t do that,” I said, not wanting to cause trouble for somebody else, just to conceal my own secret activities. “It’s not necessary. It’s really just the one suit.” “I believe your brother has a blue suit of similar style. If you like, I could ask him if you may borrow it. The two of you are about the same size,” she said. “Daniel is in New York,” I told her. “Isn’t he?” Mrs. Denkler gave a brief look of surprise. “Oh, yes. That’s right. I’d forgotten.” She stared at me for a moment. “May I ask if there is a specific ring you are searching for? I have all the jewelry catalogued. Perhaps I can help.” “No,” I snapped, tired of her meddling. “I’m fine. I just want to look through the vault in peace.” Mrs. Denkler stared at me for another moment, her mouth opening to say something and then shutting again, the words unsaid. Finally, she decided on, “You know that my first priority in this world is your family.” “I know,” I told her, feeling a little guilty for being short-tempered. “You’ve proven your loyalty many times. “May I at least know if you’ve eaten recently,” she asked. “I could bring you something, if you’re hungry.” “No, thank you,” I told her. “I ate just before I came down here.” “I understand,” she said. “And I hope that someday you’ll understand why I have to do this.” And then she slammed the vault door shut. Chapter 46 Colette The moon was full in the sky as I walked along the edge of the road with my hat clamped on my head and my suitcase under my arm. It was a bright evening with a real hunter’s moon illuminating everything with the unearthly quality of moon glow. It took forever for Lilly to fall asleep. She kept wanting to talk about leaving the castle and going back to Zucker’s. She was doing her best to get me excited about the plan. More than once I was on the verge of confessing the truth, but something always held me back. I was afraid she would go immediately to Mama and Papa so that they would stop me from leaving. I couldn’t have that. I couldn’t have Jessie standing alone in the woods, wondering what had happened to me. It was better to leave my family the note and call them in the morning when I was a new bride. Finally Lilly’s breathing became steady and I slipped out of bed. Gathering up my clothes and suitcase, I crept out into the hall before dressing. That way if Lilly woke up, she wouldn’t catch me in the act. She would probably just assume I was using the water closet. Saying goodbye to my girlhood home was difficult. I had to brush away more than one tear. It was only the thought of Jessie that gave me the strength to leave my family. Thinking of him spurred me onward. I had slipped out of the house and was far down the road before I remembered that the note was still in my suitcase. I’d forgotten to leave it. My family would not know what had happened to me. The thought of how worried my mother would be almost turned my feet around. But then I looked at my watch and saw that it was getting close to midnight. And I still had a very long way to walk. I resolved that I would have to get up very early and give my parents a call. That way they would only have a few minutes of worry, if any at all. I walked along, trying to hurry. It was a long way to the castle on foot. I don’t know why I didn’t tell Jessie to come get me. Then we would be walking arm-in-arm. I should have at least taken my bicycle. At the rate I was going, I wouldn’t rendezvous with Jessie until one in the morning. I spied an obliging bike on the porch of a house and decided I had to borrow it. I made sure to memorize the address and location of the house so I could return the bicycle the next day. I didn’t like the idea of taking it without permission, but time was of the essence and I hadn’t thought my plan out very clearly. Riding made things go much faster. There was even a basket on the front of the bicycle, so I balanced my suitcase there. It was a cool evening, but I was pedaling as quickly as my legs would take me. Stopping for a moment, I stripped my coat off so I wouldn’t break into a sweat. My green dress felt very thin in the night air, but I didn’t want to elope with Jessie while covered in sweat. When I reached the turnoff for the castle, I tucked the borrowed bicycle behind some trees. I didn’t want anyone else to borrow it before I had a chance to return it to its owners. Then I headed down the road toward the castle on foot with my suitcase in my hand and my coat over my arm. The night air had gone from chilly to cold, but I wanted to make sure I had fully cooled down from my ride before putting on my coat again. As the castle came into view, I stopped for a moment to take it in. I was about to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I would be his bride. Soon the castle would be my home. It felt so very right to me, like it was somehow meant-to-be. “Destiny,” I murmured to the wind. I turned left off the road, crossed a portion of the expanse of lawn that led up to the Vanderlind estate, and then started making my way through the woods. The full moon was helpful with my progress, but it was still slow going. There wasn’t enough light for me to see my watch, but I began to fear that I was late. I tried going faster, but my feet kept getting tripped up by rocks and fallen branches. I thought if I went too quickly I would twist an ankle. Jessie would just have to be patient. The deeper I went into the woods, the darker things became. I could no longer see the castle to my right and was only vaguely aware that the public road was somewhere off to my left. Not many people stayed up past midnight in Tiburon, and they definitely weren’t out driving around. I was starting to feel very alone and wished, not for the first time, that I had agreed to Jessie meeting me at my house. I had to keep going, I decided. The sooner I got to the river, the sooner I would be in Jessie’s arms. The sound of a twig snapping caused me to freeze for a moment, straining to listen. “Jessie?” I asked in a small voice. I heard nothing after that, so I kept going, quickening my pace, even though it made me stumble. Another twig snapped, but I didn’t stop. It was probably just a raccoon, or maybe even a skunk out for a midnight stroll, but I was getting spooked. I started to run. Not a flat-out sprint, but faster than a jog. “Colette.” I stopped suddenly, thinking I’d heard somebody call my name. “Jessie?” I called back. “Is that you?”I strained to hear my fiancé’s reply, but all that reached my ears was another twig snapping. I instantly knew it wasn’t Jessie. He would not toy with me. If it was him in the woods, then he would say something. He wasn’t the kind of man who took delight in terrifying a girl. Someone or something was following me. And it knew my name. Chapter 47 Jessie “Mrs. Denkler! Open the damn door! Mrs. Denkler!” I shouted, hammering on the metal until my fists were bloody. I stopped, allowing my hands a moment to heal. Our housekeeper must have gone crazy. That was the only explanation that entered my head. Why would she possibly lock me in the vault? What excuse could she offer for such behavior? I heard the sound of something scraping along the stone floor. I had to assume it was still Mrs. Denkler on the other side. “Mrs. Denkler,” I said in an elevated voice, but without shouting. “Why are you doing this?” When she still didn’t answer I said, “Denkie, please tell me. What’s going on?” “I have too much respect for your family to allow you to do what I think you’re planning on doing,” the housekeeper informed me in a calm voice. If I was still a mortal, I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear her, but my undead ears could distinguish every word. “And just what is it that you think I’m planning on doing?” I asked. “You’re running off to marry that mortal girl,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone. “The pretty one who works here as a maid.” And then, mostly to herself, she added, “This is all my fault. I should have never hired her.” Banging against the metal door was a futile gesture, but the rest of the walls were made out of stone. I knew that striking a stone wall would hurt, but I thought there was a chance I could break through one of them and get out of the vault that way. I couldn’t stand the thought of Colette being alone in the woods, thinking that I had abandoned her. Assessing the room and its orientation in the castle, I thought the wall to the right of the door was probably my best bet. Taking a deep breath to steel myself against the pain, I drew back my arm and punched the wall with all of my might. A shriek of pain escaped my lips, but I ignored it. Once the pain started to subside, I clenched my other fist and struck the wall again in the same spot. A small bit of dust drifted into the air, but the rocks were still solid and the mortar, so recently applied, didn’t crumble. “What are you doing in there?” the housekeeper asked. “Trying to get out,” I told her through clenched teeth as I cradled my hand. “You don’t have to be so dramatic,” she said. “I’ll let you out eventually. I’m just waiting until the trollop is out of the picture.” “She’ll never be out of the picture,” I informed her. “Not with the way I feel about her. I will love her for the rest of her life, and then for the rest of mine.” There was silence on the other side of the door, so I added, “Do you understand me?” My words were only met with more silence. I tried to calm myself. Beating my fists against the wall wasn’t getting me anywhere. Colette would be upset, but once I was free, I would find her and explain what had happened. She would understand that I didn’t intentionally stand her up. We could always elope in a night or two, once she had forgiven me. But I hated the thought of my darling girl in tears. I hated the thought of hurting her. And I didn’t want her to be in the woods all alone. Tiburon was a safe community, but you never knew if there was a wayward tramp or rabid dog that might be wandering the woods in the dark. I should have never agreed to let Colette walk by herself. I should have insisted that I meet her outside her home so that we could head to the river together. “Mrs. Denkler, you need to open the door right now,” I said in the calmest voice I could muster. “It’s not your place to tell me what to do and what not to do.” “So you admit that you intend to run away with her?” she asked. “Do you plan on turning the little tramp?” I kicked the wall in frustration. “She’s not a tramp,” I snarled, my voice ragged with pain as I waited for my foot to heel. “She’s the most wonderful girl in the world. And yes, I am going to marry her. I will conjoin with her. Whether you like it or not.” “But not turn her?” Mrs. Denkler asked. “You’ll leave her bound to her mortal coil?” “No, I will not turn her,” I admitted. “That is something I will never do.” “But she’ll age,” Mrs. Denkler insisted. “She’ll grow old and gray. The beauty you see now is only temporary. Her life will end and you will still be young and fresh. Why not just turn her, if you love her so much?” “Because I love her too much to do that to her,” I said, pressing my forehead against the vault door. “Loving someone means doing what’s right for her, not just what makes you happy.” And then I knew that I couldn’t marry Colette without telling her the complete truth about my family. I couldn’t bind her to me without her knowing that I was a vampire. She would try to stop me from confessing, but I loved her too much to keep the secret from her until we were wed. “Haven’t you ever loved someone like that?” I asked, stepping away from the door. My hands were fully healed, but I knew battering them against the walls would get me nowhere. I had to persuade Mrs. Denkler to open the door. “Haven’t you ever loved someone so much that you would do anything for him?” “But Colette is mortal,” Mrs. Denkler said again, her voice sounding unsure. “And you are a vampire. Some day she will die. Then what will you do?” It was a question I had asked myself many times. “I will spend eternity cherishing her memory.” There was a long pause, and then I heard the sound of the combination lock being turned. Slowly, the door cracked open. “I loved your grandfather like that,” Mrs. Denkler said, avoiding my eye as I stepped out of the vault. “I would have done anything for him. But he didn’t feel the same way about me. So I became this,” she said, raising her hands and then letting them fall to her side. “I became his servant.” “But why?” I asked. “At least it allowed me to be near him and see him every day. It allowed me to help raise his family, even if none of you are my own.” “But he offered to turn you,” I said. “I heard him do it. More than once.” The housekeeper shook her head. “He only did that once I was old and the bloom of my youth was gone. He only started making the offer when he knew I wouldn’t accept it.” I stared at her, horrified. For Grandfather to torture her in that way was unforgivable. And yet she was still devoted to him. “I’m sorry,” I told her. It was the only thing I could think of to say. Reaching forward, she pressed a hand to my forearms. “I’m sorry for what I did,” she went on. “I was so worried about protecting the Vanderlind name that I forgot to protect you.” “It’s alright,” I said, patting her hand. “I understand. But now I have to go.” “Go,” she told me. “You must hurry. I only hope it’s not too late.” I was halfway down the hall before the real meaning of her words filter through to my brain. “Too late?” I paused to ask. Mrs. Denkler gave me a strangled look. “I mean, I hope she isn’t mad at you for being late.” I gave her a smile. “I just hope I can find a way to earn her forgiveness.” Chapter 48 Colette My lungs were burning and I had to stop for a moment to catch my breath. My hat was gone, my suitcase was gone, and I was terrified because I knew I was not alone. There was something out there, stalking me through the trees. I thought I’d heard it say my name, but that was impossible because whatever was chasing me wasn’t human. The sound of some leaves rustling behind me gave me a start and I started running again. I knew I was headed deeper into the woods and away from the road. I knew the creature was flushing me away from my only chance to flag down a passing car or signal someone in a nearby house. Branches tore at my dress and ripped out my hair. One of my shoes got stuck in the mud and was pulled from my foot. A few steps after that and my other foot got tangled in a tree root and I fell to the ground with a sob. I freed my leg, but did not immediately get to my feet again. I needed to calm down. I needed to catch my breath. There was a large log next to where I’d fallen and it afforded me some protection from the eyes of the predator that was pursuing me. I just needed to rest for a moment and come up with a plan. I wished I knew what was pursuing me so that I could better figure out how to defend myself. If it was a wolf or a bear, then I needed to climb a tree. If it was a man, then I needed to find a sharp stick and defend myself. But it seemed to be both human and beast. It seemed to have the senses of an animal. It could hear me from a distance and smell my scent in the air. But it could also speak. The creature had called my name. At least I thought it had called to me. But I knew that had to just be terror fueling my imagination. It was probably a stray dog that had gone feral and was hungry. I probably looked like an easy target. All I needed to do was climb a tree and bide my time. Once it was light out, I was sure I would be able to get back to the road and flag down a motorist. Lying on the ground, not moving, made me realize how cold it was outside. There was frost on the leaves all around me. My breath started to slow. I knew I had to do something. The beast was probably still looking for me. None of the trees around me had branches low enough for me to climb. I wondered how close I was to the river. The oak tree which was to be my rendezvous point with Jessie would be easy to mount. My heart throbbed at the thought of my love. Where was he? What had happened to him? If he was in the woods, then I needed to warn him about the creature. The idea of something horrible happening to Jessie frightened me as much as the beast in the woods. Getting to the oak tree was my best bet. Then I could climb to safety and warn Jessie if he was waiting there for me. I tried to think about the way I had run and the orientation of the river. My breathing was becoming more regularly and I felt like it was time to make a move. The small creatures that provide the night with its music had taken up their melodies again. It probably meant that the beast, whatever it was, had moved on in pursuit of some other dinner. With great trepidation, I got to my feet. And there he was. Jessie, my love, was standing no more than thirty yards away. I could see him silhouetted in the moonlight. “Jessie,” I called, my heart hammering loudly in my chest. “We have to get out of here. There’s something…” I started hurrying toward him. “I don’t know what it is, but there’s some creature in the woods.” Jessie came bounding toward me, eager to be by my side. I held my arms out to him. “We have to go,” I said, fighting back a sob of relief as his arms encircled me. “There’s someone else in the woods with us.” “I know,” he said. Looking up, I saw that it wasn’t Jessie who was embracing me. It was his brother, Daniel. “Oh,” I stammered, trying to pull away from him, my mind racing. “Did Jessie send you? There’s something in the woods. Something evil.” “I know,” he said again, a wolfish smile twisting his lips. “I think it might be me.” And then I saw his teeth glinting in the moonlight. They were long white daggers of ivory. I tried to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. “Please, by all means scream,” he told me. “It makes things so much better.” I felt limp in his arms, like a rabbit paralyzed by fear as it stares into the eyes of a snake. I caught a glimpse of his eyes and suddenly I understood what Lilly had meant. Jessie’s eyes had always appeared warm and kind to me. But his brother’s eyes where that of the detached predator. He was a shark ready to strike. Daniel wrenched my head to one side. “I’m going to enjoy this so much,” he whispered into my hair. And then he lowered his head and I felt a stinging at my neck. I realized with horror that Daniel had sunk his jagged teeth into my neck. He was drinking from me. He was drinking my blood. I tried to struggle. I willed my arms and legs to move, but they were awkward and lifeless. Tears sprang to my eyes with the sure conviction that I was going to die. Daniel was some kind of demon and he was sucking the life out of me. I thought of the note that I had forgotten to leave for Mama and Papa. It was still in my suitcase, lost somewhere in the woods. I was going to die and my family would never know what had happened to me. And what about Jessie? Did he know that his brother was Satan incarnate? Or was this the evil he always wanted to tell me about, but I refused to listen. I could no longer feel my legs and my hands were ice cold. Daniel was a vampire. He was a member of the undead and he needed human blood to live. That explained Arthur and the sticky, red goblets in his room. And then I realized something else; Jessie and his mother were probably vampires, too. That explained why they could never be out in the daytime. It explained a lot of things. Jessie had wanted to tell me. He’d tried to tell me his family’s secret many times. But I wouldn’t listen. I was too stupid to ever think that there was a problem our love couldn’t surmount. I was too naive to realize that such evil existed in the world. My darling Jessie was a vampire. And yet he loved me. There was no doubt in my mind that he loved me. My vision started to blur and I closed my eyes. The world only came into focus again when my body was jarred, quite painfully. I opened my eyes to see that I had been dropped into some kind of ditch. There was loose soil all around me. I tried to think of where I was. My brain felt fuzzy and slow. Town hall, I finally decided. A work crew was digging the foundation for town hall. Papa would find me. He would find my body in the morning and then my family would know I was dead. There was some comfort in that. I didn’t want them to spend the rest of their lives wondering. I could barely move, but I turned my head to see the man who had killed me standing at the lip of the deep hole where I lay. Just then the clouds drifted away from the moon and I was able to see Daniel more clearly. At a distance he looked so much like Jessie. Tears sprang to my eyes. I would never see my love again. Daniel started kicking dirt into the hole to cover my body. Small rocks and debris rained down on me. “Why?” bubbled to my lips. “Why are you doing this?” The vampire paused for a moment, cocking his head to one side as he considered his actions. “I thought I was doing it to protect the family,” he said. “I wasn’t going to let the Vanderlind name be besmirched by some cheap, little mortal. But now that you ask me, I realize that I’m doing it to teach my brother a lesson. Maybe next time he won’t be so eager to fall in love.” The world was growing dark again and it was a struggle for me to keep my eyes open. I had lost too much blood to do anything but die. Daniel started kicking more dirt on me and I curled into a ball and closed my eyes. “Good bye, Jessie,” I whispered, hoping the night breeze would carry my words to his ears. “Good bye, my love. I will miss you forever.” Epilogue Jessie I raced to the oak tree, but Colette wasn’t there. I searched the woods, then the streets of Tiburon, and then tried peeking in the windows of her family’s home. Colette was gone. It was as if she’d simply been plucked from the earth. For the next two years I searched for her, all night, every night, but she was nowhere to be found. I found her shoe, and an old tramp found some of her clothes in a small suitcase, but those were all the clues that were ever uncovered. My darling girl had vanished without a trace. Mrs. Denkler hung herself from the rafters in her private quarters two days after Colette disappeared. I think she blamed herself for delaying me. It wasn’t her fault, but part of me held her responsible. If only she hadn’t slammed shut the vault door. If only I’d insisted that I meet Colette under our apple tree instead of letting her walk alone at night. If only I’d left town like I’d intended, instead of wooing Colette and falling in love. I spent the next several decades hating myself and longing for the life Colette and I would never share. She was gone and, although I had not harmed her, I knew I was responsible for her death. If I hadn’t loved her, she would still be among the living, the sun shining on her tempestuous hair, the birds singing their morning music just for her. For many years I thought that maybe travel might help me forget the pain that was always present within me, but it did little to blunt the agony. And I found myself compelled to return home every fall. I knew I would never see my darling girl again, but I could not keep from searching for her. Year after year, I combed the woods in the fall, when the moon was full. I continued to do so decade after decade, even though it was obvious she was gone. I also carried the misery of having caused Colette’s family pain. Not knowing what had happened to their daughter must have been the worst part. I know it was for me. Or maybe it was better that way. I couldn’t judge; I only knew that I was doomed to live for eternity without the woman I loved. It was somewhere around the turn of the century that I began to feel a change. I hadn’t forgotten Colette, or stopped loving her, but the pain somehow shifted. It became a dull ache in the corners of my soul, rather than a tangible throb in my breast. I stopped going to Europe. Tiburon was my home. I even began to go out on occasion, strolling the town’s streets after sunset. Sometimes I would take in a film at the cinema, or drop by the library on Thursday nights, when it stayed open late. It felt good to traverse the streets where I knew Colette’s footsteps had fallen. Somehow it made me feel closer to her. One evening in the early fall, I felt an urge to reread The Great Gatsby. The castle library had a signed, first-edition, of course, but I wanted to hold a book that had been caressed by many hands. I was seated in a quiet corner of the library, just starting to become engrossed in the plot, when I heard the sound of two young women hurrying into the room. Glancing up, I had the shock of my life. There, standing before me, was Colette Gibson, just as fresh and young as the first day I saw her. My darling girl had come back to me.

Here are the first couple of chapters so that you can try before you buy. xo ~ Gayla Twist Broom with a View Prologue: When an Assassination Forces a Holiday “I don’t understand why someone who is two hundred years old should know all that much more than someone who is sixteen,” said Violet Popplewell to her mother. “There’s only a limited amount of things to know in this world.” Mrs. Popplewell gave a resigned sigh while her busy hands shuffled papers at her desk in her small office. “There’s no point arguing, Violet. Your great-aunt Vera is going with you, and that is that. I know she can be a little trying at times, but a girl your age cannot simply travel to an unknown city by herself. You must admit that. Especially with things being so unsettled. ” Violet considered brooding for a moment but fought the impulse. She was a practical girl, after all, and what can’t be mended must be borne. She returned to her room to make another attempt at packing. “Unsettled.” That was her mother’s word for impending war. The Archmage of Canterbury was dead. His body, entirely drained of blood, had been found with those of his wife and child in their private chambers. There was little doubt the assassin was a Vampire. Within twenty-four hours, rumors of a looming war had spread across England like a winter storm. It didn’t matter that there was no proof that Vampires were behind the murders or even condoned the act. Nor did it matter to Mrs. Popplewell that the dastardly deed had happened in London, which might as well have been a million miles from Gallows Road in the little corner of Surrey that was the Popplewells’ home. The British Isle was no longer deemed a safe place for young Witches to dwell. For Violet, who had rarely travelled even to London, visiting X, the mysterious city-state renowned for its magic, ought to have seemed a wondrous romantic journey. But most young ladies taking their first trip abroad had months to plan down to the smallest detail of the lace pattern on a handkerchief. New wardrobes were commissioned. Farewell parties were held. And Violet would enjoy none of those niceties. She was simply being shipped off, like a parcel, to be kept out of harm’s way. Violet surveyed the state of her bedroom, sighed, and set about attempting to create order from the general disarray. Her steamer trunks were bare, while clothes, shoes, books, and toiletries were strewn across every surface of the room. Earlier that morning, she had, in her haste, attempted to enchant her clothes to arrange themselves. But instead of compliantly settling into her trunks, the gowns had chased each other about the room in a colorful display of hide-and-go-seek. The stack of books she intended as her additional travelling companions had toppled across the floor, their pages flapping as if caught in a strong breeze. Her brush and comb had attacked her, snatching and dragging at her hair; she’d had to leave the room for three-quarters of an hour to give the spell a chance to wear off. It was no use; try though she might, magic never obeyed Miss Popplewell’s wishes the way she intended. Most children born to the Craft assumed that the world was their dollhouse, to be rearranged at their whim. But harnessing the unseen forces of the world was a tricky business full of hidden complications and unseen traps. And though almost an adult, Violet still struggled to bend the magical world to her will. She frequently found that the harder she tried, the more difficult it became to cast even the simplest spell. Her mother was constantly reminding the frustrated girl that most of their kind only truly mastered the Craft in their later years, when the tempestuous fires of youth had largely sputtered out. Yet Violet’s powers always seemed just inches from her grasp. Every once in a while, she would unexpectedly conjure extraordinary wonders. Unfortunately, these anomalies came without warning, and afterward, she could never remember what she had done differently. Perhaps it was the way she held her mouth. Standing in her disorderly room, Violet hesitantly reached into her pocket and felt the familiar handle of the old magic wand that had belonged to her grandmother. Many modern Crafters no longer relied on a wand to produce magic, but for the girl, wand work always seemed to yield the best results. She gripped it for a moment, deliberated, and then decided she couldn’t face another failure. Instead, she began the dull task of packing by hand. An hour later, all the necessities of life were neatly encapsulated in two large trunks at the foot of Violet’s bed. But her satisfaction was interrupted by a sound emanating from the next room—like two pelicans simultaneously trying to swallow the same fish. Ostensibly called the guest room, the chamber next to Violet’s was almost permanently occupied by her great-aunt, Vera Tartlette. The sound was one of indescribable vexation, which Aunt Vera invariably made when faced with a world-shattering crisis. Violet heard it at least twice a week. With a small sigh, she went to check on the situation. “Do not fret, my dear,” Aunt Vera began, her voice quavering. Violet entered the room with some trepidation. “I only need a few more moments to sort myself out, and then I’ll be in to help you directly.” The guest room was in far worse shape than Violet’s had been an hour earlier. Clothes, books, toiletries, and shoes all swirled haphazardly through the air. With a sweeping gesture, Vera would transfer a pile of undergarments to the bottom of her empty steamer trunk. Then, finding dissatisfaction with their placement, she’d whisk her hands to one side to remove them again. After that, the gowns would go in, only to be removed a moment later in the same fashion. All the while, Aunt Vera chattered continuously, either to Violet or to herself, weighing the advantages of taking each item versus the hazards of leaving it behind. Knowing as she spoke that she would only make things worse, Violet ventured, “Vera, the train does have a schedule to keep.” At this point, the elderly Witch was turning in circles in the center of the little room as though, by making eye contact with each item, she could fathom its every possible use into her head. But once she lost sight of the beaded gloves or motion sickness pastilles or whatever she was looking at, the item and its usefulness were crowded out by new ones. “Don’t bedevil me with schedules,” her aunt wailed impatiently as an airborne shoe nearly collided with a lit candle. “I said I would help you and I shall, but you really must leave me to my own packing first.” “For goodness sake.” Violet felt on the edge of exasperation with her great-aunt already, and they hadn’t even set out for the station. Drawing the old wand from her pocket, almost without thinking, she made three decisive strikes through the air. In a hailstorm of clothes, shoes, books, and papers, Vera’s possessions all found their proper place, and trunk lids slammed firmly shut. The room went still. Vera gazed in silence at the neatly arranged steamer trunks for several moments, as if trying to remember where she had left her knitting. Then she blinked and, turning her eyes to her young ward, said, “There now. Shall we see about your trunks?” Chapter 1: Witch Friendly Does Not Mean Witch Exclusive The city-state of X lay somewhere on the European continent, just at the invisible line that separated the western half, land of Witches, Sorcerers, and other Crafters, from the dark eastern half, realm of the Vampires. It stood before, or rather almost encrusting, Mount Drood, a craggy bluff that rose sharply above the rolling hills surrounding it and marked the beginning of the Alps. Half the city climbed the steep slope of Mt. Drood and crowned its peak, while the other half stood almost perpetually in its shadow. To say that Violet Popplewell had always dreamt of going to X was not to say that she had actually wanted to go. Quite the contrary; since she was a small child, tales of that magical city had filled her with unease. In anxiety-filled dreams, she would find herself wandering its labyrinthine streets while tall, windowless buildings frowned down upon her. Violet’s first glimpse of X in waking life was little different from her nocturnal visions. As their train pulled into the station in the deepening gloom of early evening, she caught glimpses of the city’s towers, black against the purple sky. She’d seen pictures of the famous edifices, but nothing could have prepared her for the soaring spires of stone, iron, and glass of a city built by magic. London, but for a tiny handful of magically enhanced buildings shrouded in spells of concealment, had nothing to compare. No building crafted by Mortals could hold a candle to these impossible structures. A mighty hall lined with pillars rested on the sculpted shoulders of a stone colossus. Staircases spiraled upwards, disappearing into the sky with no visible means of support or conclusion. Walkways, and even a road or two big enough to drive a carriage across, rested on impossibly slender, graceful arched pylons—when they weren’t resting on thin air. Here and there, immense trees grew, wrapping around buildings and then providing support for additional constructions. And buildings intertwined with the naked rock of the mountain so promiscuously that one couldn’t tell what was natural and what was Crafted. The train station was their first indication of the chaos that had gripped the city. Strangely, it had never occurred to Violet that she wasn’t the only magical being seeking refuge from the impending war. Travellers crowded the platform from end to end, and getting through the bustling swarm of humanity was like swimming through a hot, angry soup. It had been an exhausting journey of barely catching their train, then crossing the channel by ferry, and then a much lengthier train ride to X. Neither lady was in the mood to be jostled. Once on the street, Vera realised that she had left her notebook on the train and couldn’t remember the name of the guest house where they had a reservation, much less where it was located. Violet suggested they cast a seeking spell, which sent Vera into a loudly whispered tirade. “Cast a spell? Here, on the street, where we might be seen by anyone?” Violet hastened to remind her aunt that, “such cautions must surely be needless in X of all places.” Any Mortal living in this city who remained ignorant of magic must be deaf, blind, and terminally stupid. Raising her hands in reluctant preparation, Vera admitted with some trepidation, “I’m afraid it’s been well over a century since I last cast this particular spell.” Having spent all her life in Surrey, she had little opportunity to get lost. The incantation did not go well. Vera stumbled over the words in a barely audible voice, for fear of being overheard by the aforementioned blind deaf mute. Her trembling hands did not aid in the creation. By the time she reached the end of the third stanza, there was only a dim light pooling around their feet, leading nowhere discernible. Violet had no desire to embarrass her aunt, but she also did not wish to keep wandering around the darkened streets where who knows what kinds of magical creatures were lurking down every alley. The girl was quite sure she’d seen a man in a black cape slip from one shadow to the next as they approached. Sneaking her wand out of her pocket, Violet created a quick enhancement spell, which she cast towards her aunt and herself. The light around their feet began to gain power. An illuminated path appeared, leading them down the street. After only a block, the trail ended at the steps of the Pensione Belladonna. “There,” Vera said, brushing her hands against each other as if to remove some invisible soot. “That wasn’t so very difficult, now was it? There never really is any reason to panic.” They mounted the steps, and the man in the cape, who had been following them by way of the shadows, faded into the night. * * * * * * * * * “The proprietress had no call to deceive us,” Aunt Vera stated over dinner. “I don’t care how crowded the city has become. What does that have to do with our reservation?” Violet had no choice but to agree. On entering the musty guest house, they were quickly bustled down a narrow wooden staircase to a pair of basement rooms with bare stone walls. The floor was damp flagstone, and both chambers strongly smelled of mold. Instead of the panoramic view of the River Stygia they’d been promised, each room had a small, arched window near the ceiling that offered views of passersby from the ankles down. Violet cast her gaze across the dining table to the English faces who were just tucking into their evening meal. “Honestly, we may as well have stayed in Surrey,” she said with a sigh. “Except that there we’d be comfortable.” “And better provided for. This mutton is entirely flavorless,” Vera replied in a disapproving whisper. “I believe it’s been drained,” came a slow, creaking voice beside Vera. An elderly Witch with skin the color of parchment and matching hair had turned to address Vera with a smile that might have been sardonic. “Drained?” replied Vera. “You know. Of blood.” Vera’s neighbour had been introduced to them as Miss Abigail Fate, one of three sisters who had been staying in X for several months. Violet liked them immediately, but she was currently positioned at the table to hear very little of what the ladies said. They were, to the girl’s mind, the best sort of elderly women—dressed in soft, lavender clothes and smelling of rosewater, with sweet, reassuring voices and ready smiles. The only odd thing about them was their three matching pairs of smoked eyeglasses, which instantly brought to mind the nursery rhyme “Three Blind Mice.” Violet prayed she didn’t accidentally hum the tune aloud. Vera was in a position to hear Miss Abigail’s words quite clearly. “I’m sorry; I’m not sure what you mean,” Vera said, addressing the senior Witch. “For the Vampires,” Miss Fate said with a smile. One of her sisters leaned in to see down the length of the table, holding a pair of opera glasses to the lenses of her eyeglasses and peering through them. “It’s a cheap way of feeding both the Crafter and Vampire guests, you see,” said the sister in a hushed voice. “Vampire guests?” Vera asked, her eyes growing very round. It became immediately obvious to the Witch that two of the patrons of the Pensione Belladonna had plates that were noticeably bare. In contrast, their wine goblets were full to the brim. And not with the Proprietress’s weak Chianti but with a thicker liquid in the darkest shade of crimson. A little shiver ran up Vera’s spine, and she couldn’t keep her eyes from darting again in the direction of the two barren place settings. The elderly gentleman seated behind one of the plates seized the opportunity to say, “My dear lady, perhaps it’s true that this little haven is not everything one could wish, but what place on this earth is?” he asked with a smile. Violet had not held tight to the thread of the conversation, but she could detect nothing but kindness in the elder gentleman’s crinkled eyes. “Surely,” he went on, addressing Miss Tartlette, “you must have come away from your comfortable and familiar home because you found it wanting in some way. And now that you are here, all is strange, and the shortcomings are not familiar ones. But what is that? I’m sure you’ll find the wonders of the great city of X are worth a few inconveniences. In my humble opinion, we who seek to drink from the font of perfection must be forever thirsty. Wouldn’t you agree, Sebastian?” At this, the gentleman turned to his companion, an elegantly dressed and handsome young man, who remained silent, swirling his wine goblet listlessly. Undaunted, the older man returned his beaming gaze towards Vera. It was obvious from the gentlemen’s appearance that they were father and son. But where the old man’s brightly colored waistcoat strained over an advancing belly and gleaming strands of silver-grey adorned his widow’s peak, the young man’s frame was still slender, and his widow’s peak was black as jet, matching his linen suit. Where the father seemed almost childlike in his jovial eagerness, the son was as somber as the grave. But it was not a sinister somberness—more the appearance of someone suffering from a severe case of melancholia. In fact, the two were so comically unalike that Violet had to restrain herself from smirking at them. “I do not expect perfection from a pensione,” Vera indignantly replied to the elder of the pair, “but we were led to expect something quite different from what we got.” They had been introduced to the two gentlemen in a general way when they sat down at table, but Vera was discomfited to realize that she had forgotten their names and wasn’t sure of the correct etiquette under the circumstances. Did the introduction actually count? “We were promised two rooms on the top floor, with a view of the river and the cathedral,” Vera said to the table at large. “Ah, I see,” said the old gentleman. “I see the trouble. Alas, in the confusion of so many arrivals, my son and I ended up in exactly two such rooms.” Vera stiffened and retorted with a crisp, “How delightful for you. I do hope you enjoy them.” “My dear lady, you misunderstand me,” the gentleman went on. “My son and I have rooms on the top floor in full sun every morning. It won’t do at all, though we had resigned ourselves to make the best of it.” Violet could feel her aunt withdrawing into herself. Vera had no ability to deal with strangers who were overly forwards. She had turned her attention to diligently cutting her mutton into perfectly uniform bites. But the man seemed so kindly; Violet could not fathom why her aunt was always so suspicious. The girl saw no reason to snub him, so, replying for Vera, she said, “I wish we were so lucky.” “But you can be,” said he, lighting the room with the warmest smile she’d encountered since leaving Surrey. “Please, allow me to explain. We have no use for morning views. Sebastian and I far prefer to slumber in the comfortable darkness of a basement room and cultivate our perfect view from within. For we believe that if the sun rises in one’s heart, then no darkness can take it away. Isn’t that right, Sebastian?” The younger man persisted in his silence. “So what I propose is this.” The gentleman continued undaunted. “We can trade our rooms for yours. Then everyone would be happy.” Violet found his smile infectious and was unable to resist returning it when he directed it her way. She wanted to accept his kind offer at once, but she felt the restraining hand of her aunt pressing on her sleeve. “I’m afraid we couldn’t possibly,” Vera said in the slightly pinched voice she used when trying to keep her composure in extreme circumstances. Her eyes bulged slightly with anxiety as she fixed her gaze on her plate. “But my dear lady!” the old gentleman protested. “Surely you can see the mutual benefit of my proposal.” He turned to the young man seated next to him. “Won’t you explain it, Sebastian? You always explain things so much better than I.” “It would not be of any inconvenience,” Sebastian said in a deep, quiet voice. “It genuinely would be our preference as much as yours.” “No, no,” Vera insisted. “We absolutely couldn’t impose upon you. It’s quite out of the question.” She dabbed at the corners of her mouth with her napkin and pushed away from the table, abandoning the mutton upon which she had labored so carefully. “Come along, my dear,” she said to her niece. Confused and alarmed at her aunt appearing so outraged, Violet allowed herself to be led out of the dining room. She really couldn’t conceive of why Vera was so offended. At the door, Violet glanced back to see the old gentleman looking crestfallen. But the young man had finally lifted his eyes and caught hers in a gaze that she found difficult to interpret. * * * * * * * * * * Having retreated to the relative privacy of the sitting room, Violet turned furiously on her great-aunt. “What possible reason could there be for not accepting their offer? You yourself said that our dreadful rooms would be the death of you. You think you know all about proper etiquette, but in truth, you’re quite rude.” “I do not understand this city,” Vera muttered aloud. “I was told that this house was Witch friendly.” “Witch friendly does not mean Witch exclusive,” came a voice behind them. It was Miss Abigail Fate with her two sisters. They had followed Violet and Vera from dinner, concerned over the discomfort of the ladies. Miss Abigail shuffled into the room, guiding the other two and gazing about the sitting room through the opera glasses that her sister had been using at dinner. Violet hadn’t realized before how old and shrivelled the three of them actually were. So much so that, when they settled onto a small couch ideally meant for two, it accommodated them all with ease. “Are you speaking of Count Du Monde and his son?” the third Fate sister asked. She had not paid attention to the conversation at dinner, instead devoting herself entirely to the task of chewing her mutton with an enormous set of false teeth. “I’m not quite sure,” Vera confessed. “I’m afraid I didn’t quite catch their names. In any event, my young niece doesn’t understand how serious a thing it is to put ourselves in the debt of perfect strangers. Especially,” she said, her voice lowering, “that sort.” Violet felt a wave of exasperation. She was so tired of people telling her she didn’t understand the ways of the world just because she’d only been in it for the interval of sixteen years. Vera was being a prig, as far as she was concerned. The old gentleman and his son were perfectly amiable, just sitting there enjoying a glass of wine and eating their… Well, come to think of it, they weren’t eating anything. Their plates were noticeably bare. Violet’s eyes widened suddenly as realization dawned on her. “Just a moment!” she exclaimed. “You don’t mean to say that,” she began and then faltered. “That kindly old gentleman?” She shook her head, unable to get a grasp on it. “Surely not.” “I’m afraid so,” said the third Miss Fate, taking the opera glasses from her sister and raising them to her smoked spectacles. “This house has always been tolerant of Vampires. Though just now, the Du Mondes are the only two.” “Vampires?” Violet whispered, barely able to form her mouth around the word. The idea left her quite breathless. “Vampires,” said Vera, disapproval rolling off her tongue. “Not to worry. They’re the good sort of Vampires,” Miss Abigail assured them. “Well behaved and polite. Not at all the sort that go around biting people on the neck whenever the impulse strikes. We rather like them, don’t we, Hazel?” “Indeed, yes,” agreed the sister next to her. “Count Du Monde can be a little informal in his manner. But as far as Vampires go, they’re quite acceptable.” Vera drew herself up, her hand flying to the lace collar at her throat. “Well, I’m not willing to accept them. Just imagine, Witches and Vampires under the same roof. It’s too vulgar to contemplate.” She turned to her niece, who stood speechless at the news. “Violet, what would your mother think if she knew I’d let you stay in such an establishment?” “Well...” Violet began, not quite sure what anyone would think. She’d always known that there were Vampires in X. It was another wonder in a city full of wonders; Vampires and Witches coexisted peacefully within its walls. But it was her understanding that Vampires primarily dwelt in Night Town, the infamous under-city where Witches never dared tread. She had assumed that X was entirely segregated. In truth, she was as shocked as Vera by the idea of sharing a roof with the undead, the mortal enemy of all Witches, creatures with whom her kind had been at war since before history began. And yet, when she considered the phrase “the mortal enemy of all Witches” and placed it in her mind under a portrait of the amiable Count Du Monde, the resulting image could only be described as absurd. How could such a kindly old gentleman be a danger to anyone? Perhaps, Violet thought reluctantly, he was using Vampire glamour to beguile her, putting her off her guard. But she’d been taught that Witches were immune to Vampire enchantments. Regardless, the Count’s behaviour could hardly be called glamorous. Mortals who survived an encounter with a Vampire always described them as “wondrous, fascinating, luminous creatures, with eyes like impossibly deep pools in which one could drown.” The words “well meaning but terribly awkward” were never part of those accounts. Besides, the Misses Fate considered these Vampires perfectly acceptable dinner companions. And the Fate sisters were obviously very traditional Witches. So Violet didn’t see why Vera should be making such a fuss. Go here to keep reading Broom with a View xo ~ GT",

      "content": "Prologue Jessie I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. Chapter 1 Colette “But it’s not fair,” Lilly insisted, her face a little flushed from trying to make her point. “How am I supposed to find a husband, if I can’t even go out on one date?” “Well,” Papa said, letting his voice drag a little as if he was giving the whole thing a lot of thought, “there’s what’s fair and there’s what’s right. I’m choosing to raise you girls with what’s right.” Lilly was not to be so easily defeated. “Tons of girls get married right out of high school and you won’t even let me go out on a date. Dorothy Smiley is engaged and she’s Lettie’s age,” she pointed out. “She’s only sixteen.” Mama and Papa were quiet for a moment, both frowning to themselves. Papa’s eyes shifted toward his wife. Mama cleared her throat. “Those are special circumstances,” she said, looking at the table instead of her daughter. “I don’t think Dorothy Smiley is a good example of how I want to raise my children.” I could tell by the way Mama folded her hands that she wasn’t going to speak any more about that topic, although I wasn’t sure why. Dorothy was a local girl who was always very popular with the boys. I think she’d been dating since she was fourteen. Whenever I saw her about town, she was always laughing and chatting with a bunch of boys clustered around her. They were drawn to her like bees to a flower. “But I’m graduating in just a few months. Don’t you think that most girls should have gone out on at least one date before they graduate from high school?” Papa gave her a stern look. “I’m never thought of my daughters as ‘most girls’ and I doubt I ever will.” “But Walter Bennett is really nice,” Lilly said, persisting in her cause. “He’s stopped by Zucker’s a bunch of times now and he’s always been perfectly polite.” My sister worked a few afternoons a week at the local five and dime. I knew that her prospective beau had come in several times under the excuse of needing one thing or another. He never spent much money, but he sure did take his time about shopping for whatever he needed. “How a boy behaves when he’s out in public and how he behaves when he’s alone with a girl can be two very different things,” Mama insisted. “But…” Lilly drew breath to continue her argument. Papa’s hand came down flat on the table. He didn’t bang it down like when he was angry about a client trying not to pay his bill, but I could tell his temper was starting to rise. “In my day, no nice girl would be seen out with a boy, unless she had a proper chaperone,” Mama said, trying to head-off Papa’s growing annoyance. A thought occurred to her. “Maybe that’s the solution?” “A chaperone?” Lilly all but wailed. “Mother, no one has a chaperone these days.” “Well I’m not letting this young pup come a courting without one,” Papa growled. I had to fight not to smile. No one said, “come a courting” anymore, as far as I knew. “No dear, that’s not what I meant,” Mama said, putting a gentle hand on her husband’s forearm. “I meant that my real objection to Lilly going out with this Walter fellow is that I don’t want her to be on her own with a boy she only knows from the five and dime.” Then Mama directed her gaze across the table toward me. “Maybe if Lettie was to accompany them. And they didn’t go anywhere in a car. They could always walk down to the diner for a soda.” Oh, great. Now I was being dragged into the mix. The last thing I wanted was to be a third wheel on my sister’s first official date with a boy. Lilly immediately turned to look at me, hope glowing in her eyes. “That could work,” she said, all too eagerly. “I’m sorry, but I think I’d feel very awkward,” I told them. I could just imagine sitting at the counter, reading a book and feeling like the whole town was pitying me as the poor, dateless sister of Lillian Gibson. “It wouldn’t be awkward,” Lilly insisted. “We’d include you in everything, I promise.” I knew my sister had every intention of making me feel comfortable and included on this hypothetical date, but I’d seen her flirting with Walter across the counter top. When he was around, she didn’t have eyes for anyone else. I even knew that Mr. Zucker had scolded her more than once for taking too long with only one customer while other people were waiting. “Well, what if it were to be a double date?” Mama suggested. “No,” Papa said, flatly. “Lilly is only sixteen.” “She’ll be seventeen soon enough,” Mama reminded him. “And we can’t keep our girls locked in the house forever. Even if we tried, the young men would eventually start crawling up the drainpipes to flirt with them.” I began to get nervous that both my parents were warming to the idea. “I’m afraid I don’t know anyone who would want to come along,” I hurriedly told them all. I didn’t have any particular boy who was a friend and it would be too embarrassing to ask a boy from school. I put my hand to my cheek, blushing at the mere thought of it. “Oh, I’m sure Walter has lots of nice friends,” Lilly said, practically bouncing in her chair. “I know there are tons of boys who would be happy to come along.” Then she added as an afterthought, “We could always do something to fix your hair,” My hands immediately flew to my hair. Had it already struggled out of its bun? My hair was a raucous gathering of curls and it never behaved the way I intended. “I meant we could tame it with hair tonic or something,” Lilly quickly added. I could tell she hadn’t meant to be unkind. “I…” I stammered. I knew Lilly desperately wanted to go on her date, and I hated to disappoint her, but the thought of being fixed up with a boy who had no desire to be out with me in the first place made me cringe. “I’m sorry, but I really don’t want to go,” I said, pushing my chair away from the dining room table. “And I have some homework to do before going to bed,” I told them before hurrying away, grateful that the dishes had already been cleared. I knew that if I sat there any longer then Lilly would persuade me into going. And that was the very last thing I wanted to do. I hurried upstairs, but not before I caught more of my father’s conversation. “I think your mother has a very good point,” he said to his eldest daughter. “No matter how much I dislike it, you girls are growing up. So you can go on your date…” “Oh Papa,” Lilly exclaimed, clapping her hands with excitement. “Wait, let me finish,” father said in his sternest voice. “You can only go if your sister accompanies you.” “Oh,” Lilly said, sounding more than a little forlorn. I hurried up the stairs before I could hear any more. It’s not that I didn’t want to see my sister happy. There was actually nothing I wouldn’t do for her. But I was pretty sure that she’d be able to convince our mother and father that she would be just as safe with one of her friends on a double date as she would with me. I probably should have been excited about the prospect of a double date, but I wasn’t. I liked boys well enough, I just didn’t happen to have a crush on any particular boy. Truth be told, I probably spent too much time reading Austen and the Brontes. I daydreamed of a love much bigger and more passionate that anything I imagined a local boy could provide. I closed the door to the room I shared with Lilly and then went over to perch on the cream colored dressing chair that I kept by the window. The window faced the backyard and I liked to pull open the curtains and sit there, gazing over the open fields behind our property. There had been quite a bit of construction in our little town of Tiburon, Ohio before the market crashed. But when the stocks all dropped, so did the building trade. At least it kept our home from being crowded by too many neighbors. Many of my free hours were spent looking out that window and thinking of my future. Where would I be in ten years? Would I still be in Tiburon, happily married and raising a family? Or did the world have more in store for me? The way the tree branches in our backyard swayed and waved let me know that the evening had turned quite breezy. The warm weather would find us eventually, but it wouldn’t be for another few weeks at the least. I heard Lilly coming up the stairs. She wasn’t exactly stomping her feet, — that’s something Papa would never allow — but I could tell she was unhappy. She said nothing as she came into our room. As a matter of fact, she took great pains to close the door very quietly. I turned toward her as she came in, but she wouldn’t look at me. “I’m sorry,” I said as she began brushing her hair in front of the vanity table that we shared. “I’m sure Mama and Papa would let you go on a double date with Betty Schaffer. Or maybe cousin Irene.” Our cousin was older and had been on lots of dates, so that felt like a safe bet. Lilly stopped her brushing and looked at me through the mirror’s reflection. “I already asked and Papa said no. He’s convinced that the only girl who will truly look out for my well being is you.” I had to wonder why our father was being so cautious. Neither of us girls had ever done anything to cause him any concern. We were conscientious at school and we did as we were told when home. Lilly even had a part time job and I one set up for over the summer. But I guess it was hard for him to accept that we were turning from girls into young women. At least that’s what Mama usually said. Walking across the room, I pulled my flannel nightgown off the hook on the back of the door. It was an evening to wear wool socks to bed. I thought I might get in a bit of reading before turning out the light. I still had some math problems to solve and a chapter of American history to go over, but I figured I could do that in the morning before school. “Won’t you please agree to come on a double date with me?” Lilly asked rather abruptly as I was climbing into bed with a book tucked under my arm. “You can borrow any of my things that you want. Anytime, without even asking. And I promise that Walter will fix you up with one of his really handsome friends. And I’ll help fix your hair and I’ll do the dishes all by myself for a month, you won’t even have to help me.” She was promising so much, I couldn’t help but giggle. It was obvious that she wanted this date with Walter more than she cared about me borrowing her tortoise shell combs or snagging her only pair of silk stockings. “Oh, alright,” I finally said, completely capitulating. “If it means that much to you.” “Really?” Lilly leapt to her feet. “You’ll really go?” “Yes, I’ll really go,” I told her, no matter how much I didn’t want to. “Oh, Colette,” Lilly exclaimed, rushing over to my bed and throwing her arms around me. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she said, kissing my cheek. “You’re the best sister ever.” In a burst of joy she did a twirl while crossing the room to snatch her nightgown off the hook. “I can’t wait to tell Walter.” Chapter 2 Jessie “You can’t be serious,” Daniel exclaimed, rising abruptly from his chair and nearly tipping it over in the process. “Ship the whole damn thing to America? Really, Grandfather, I think you’ve gone a bit mad.” “I assure you, my sanity is as sound as it’s ever been,” our grandfather growled, glaring across the table at my older brother. “And I am quite serious. I’ve made up my mind.” Doing his best to suppress his outrage, my brother dropped back into his chair and tried to compose himself. “Don’t you think the mortals might notice if a medieval castle suddenly sprang up in the middle of Manhattan? It might lead to a few questions, you know.” “That’s why we’re not moving to Manhattan,” our grandfather informed the family in general. My mother, Daniel, my younger sister Emily, and I were all sitting with him around our dining room table. “We’re staying out of New York altogether,” Grandfather announced. “You have to be joking.” Daniel was incredulous. “Are we moving to the wild to live with the savages? I guess we’d better remember to ship the moat. We’re going to need it.” “There’s more to America than just New York and the great plains,” our mother said in a calm voice that I knew she hoped was soothing. I suspected she had anticipated her father’s announcement to leave Budapest, so it didn’t come as much of a shock. “I’ve read that spots in the Midwest of America are quite developed now and can be remarkably lovely.” Daniel flashed Mother a look. “You don’t always have to take his side.” It wasn’t Mother’s habit to take her father’s side, but she did know how to pick her battles. This was one she probably knew she would lose, so she didn’t intend to fight. That or she had something else in mind and she was waiting to see how things played out. “But there isn’t even any society in America.” Daniel was not giving up so easily. “At least not our kind of society.” “There are more of our kind in America than you realize,” Grandfather informed him. “And there are more moving there every day. With Hitler grabbing for power, I think a great many of our kind will be leaving Europe in the next year or two.” “Oh.” Daniel appeared mollified. “You didn’t say we were going to be moving to an undead enclave. If we have our friends around us, then that will be different.” “I will not make our family a target by moving to an undead enclave,” Grandfather said flatly. “In fact, we’re moving to where no mortal would ever think to look for vampires.” “You can’t be serious!” Daniel said again, even though our grandfather was not a man who tended to make jokes. Laying both hands flat on the table, Grandfather looked Daniel square in the eye. “You are welcome to stay here,” he said. “But let me be clear about one thing. If you choose to stay, you will be cut off from the family without a cent.” His threat did the trick. There was no way in the world Daniel would be willing to give up his share of the Vanderlind fortune. That wasn’t in his nature. There was nothing he loved more than wealth and the power it brought. I knew this without a doubt. Daniel had been married once, not so many years ago, but when he was still mortal. His wife, Anna, had been a lovely girl who seemed to sincerely love him, for whatever reason. But she accidentally discovered our grandfather’s dark secret; the disease which he had methodically spread to his own children, accidentally killing one of his daughters in the process. Anna had wanted to flee the castle with her husband. She was convinced it was better to live a life of poverty than to make a deal with the devil. But Daniel had other ideas. He’d only been persuaded to marry her in order to procreate while he was still a mortal. Grandfather put great stock in not letting the Vanderlind line dwindle. But instead of escaping from evil with his wife, Daniel dragged Anna before our grandfather. I was barely sixteen, but I was convinced Grandfather would kill my sister-in-law. I went to confront him and did my best to save Anna, only to receive his disdain. “You’ve always been soft on mortals,” Grandfather told me, obviously disgusted by my compassion. “I happen to be a mortal,” I informed him, with all the bravery and ignorance that a sixteen year old boy could muster. “For the moment,” he informed me. “But your time will come, so enjoy your foolish mortal emotions while you can.” I knew that transforming into the undead could easily twist a human from a being filled with compassion to a creature filled with hate. I sincerely hoped that fate would not befall me when my time came to be transformed. Grandfather became a creature of the night at the age of twenty-four and he decided it was the ideal age for any vampire. So when each of his children turned twenty-four, he turned them, whether they wanted to be vampires or not. And he intended to do the same for his grandchildren; an event that Daniel looked forward to with great anticipation, but one that I dreaded. Grandfather arranged for all of his children to marry into wealth in order to expand our already sizeable family fortune, but the spouses of his offspring were not considered worthy enough to be transformed into the undead. My uncle’s wife and my own father had both mysteriously disappeared soon after my mother and uncle were made. The spouse of my aunt who had died during transformation also disappeared under mysterious circumstances, but he took his luggage and quite a bit of my aunt’s jewelry with him. After Daniel betrayed his wife, Grandfather decided to temporarily spare Anna’s life, although she essentially became a prisoner in the castle. She was to bare Daniel a few children before Grandfather would decide it was time for her demise. But Anna denied her husband any offspring by hanging herself from a chandelier a few months after her discovery of our family’s dark secret. Daniel was furious, but I admired her for her convictions. My brother never took another wife. When his maker’s day came, he was still childless. This greatly displeased Grandfather, but he turned Daniel anyway, deciding it would be up to Emily and me to keep the Vanderlind line alive. “Will our Uncle be moving with us?” my little sister screwed up the courage to ask as we all sat around the dining table, glaring at one another. She was madly devoted to our cousin Dorian, with that unique fervor of little girls. “Your Uncle will finish up business here before coming over. That should only take a year or two,” was Grandfather’s reply. But that didn’t exactly provide an answer to Emily’s real question. “What about Dorian?” I asked, deciding to help her out. “Will he be making the voyage with us or will he stay here and cross with his father?” Grandfather made a small, guttural sound in the back of his throat. “I haven’t decided yet on the safest place to keep your cousin.” Cousin Dorian was only a little older than I was, but he already had a keen eye for the ladies. It was all Grandfather could do to keep him from causing a scandal. “I still say this is all nonsense,” Daniel grumbled. “This is a big decision and I think it should be open to family discussion.” “You can think whatever you want,” Grandfather informed him. “But I’ve already purchased the land in America and the workmen will be arriving tomorrow to start dismantling the castle. I’ve already instructed Mrs. Denkler to oversee the servants while they pack up the household.” “Where are we going?” Mother asked. “Where is it in America that we are all moving to?” Grandfather leaned back in his chair, folded his hands, and smiled with some satisfaction. He was handsome, in a brutish short of way, and he appeared no older than his daughter, who appeared no older than her eldest son. “A nice little town in Ohio,” he assured us. “Right on the shore of the Tiburon River.” Chapter 3 Colette “They’re using only workers they’re bringing over from Europe,” my father grumbled from behind his newspaper as I sat down to breakfast the next morning. “I can’t believe that not one man from Tiburon is going to earn an honest day’s pay for that monstrosity they’re building on the edge of town.” “I’m not sure that warrants calling it a monstrosity,” mother said, trying her best to coax him back into a good mood as she served eggs and toast. “I hear that it’s an entire castle they’re moving from Hungary stone by stone. That sounds very exciting to me. I’ve always wanted to see a castle.” “I wonder why they’re moving here.” I couldn’t help but say aloud. “Europe is getting to be a real mess,” my father informed me. “That Hitler fellow is starting to cause all sorts of problems. I wouldn’t be surprised if that had something to do with it.” I was sure my father was right, but that wasn’t exactly what I meant. My question had more to do with why a wealthy family living in a cosmopolitan city like Budapest would then decide to move to the outskirts of a small town in the middle of Ohio. It wasn’t the first place I would choose to live if I had enough money to ship an entire castle all the way over from Europe. Lilly came hurrying into the breakfast room and slipped into her seat. Papa glanced at his watch. “Cutting it a bit close, aren’t you?” he asked. “I had trouble sleeping last night so it was hard to get up this morning,” she told him. That may have been true. I’d slept like a stone, so I couldn’t say for sure. But I also knew that Lilly had spent extra time in front of the mirror this morning, making sure her hair was perfect. She was going straight to her job at Zucker’s after school and I was sure she had plans for Walter to meet her there. “You’re not coming down with anything, I hope,” Mama said, reaching across the table to lay a hand on Lilly’s cheek. “You’re not warm, but you look a little flushed.” “I’m just excited,” Lilly told her. “Lettie’s agreed to go, so I’m going to have my first date with Walter.” Papa gave me surprised look. “Is that true, Colette?” “Yes,” I admitted. “Lilly talked me into it.” “Oh,” Papa said with a frown. I got the feeling he had been counting on me not giving in and so his plan of keeping his daughters from dating had backfired. “That’s very nice of you,” Mama told me, not glancing in her husband’s direction. “But we are expecting both of you to behave very responsibly on this date and not let it go to your heads.” “We won’t, Mama,” Lilly quickly assured her. As far as I knew, the date was just to be Walter and a friend escorting us to the diner for a soda and then home again. I couldn’t see how drinking a soda while sitting at the counter of Top’s Diner could go to anyone’s head. Lilly had to hurry through breakfast or we were going to be late. Tiburon didn’t have anything as fancy as a school bus, so Lilly and I had to walk to the high school when the weather was fine. Papa would give us a lift if it was too cold or wet to walk, but it had to be awfully cold or very, very wet for that to be deemed necessary. As we headed toward school, Lilly was practically dancing on air. She linked her arm through mine and skipped along. “Lettie, have I told you how much I love you?” she asked. “You’re the best sister ever.” I had to laugh. “Would you be saying that if I hadn’t agreed to chaperone your date?” My sister pretended to think it over. “Well, I would still love you, I suppose, but you’d probably lose the title of best sister.” By the time Lilly came home from her job that evening and we’d all sat down for supper, things were practically settled with Walter. “He’s going to ask his friend Lev Wilson,” she told the family as we ate. “And if Lev is free, we’re going out on Friday night.” I felt my stomach drop a little. It was already Wednesday. I didn’t think my first date with a boy would be thrust upon me so quickly. “Lev Wilson,” Papa repeated, mulling the name over. “Didn’t he used to be on the football team for Tiburon High?” “Yes, I think he was the quarterback or something a few years ago,” Lilly told him. “Walter said that he was offered a scholarship to Notre Dame, but that his father had a heart attack the summer before he was going to start so he couldn’t go.” “I remember hearing something about that,” Papa said as he cut his meat. “Sounds like he’s a boy with good values; not abandoning his family like that.” “I’m sure all of Walter’s friends are very nice,” Lilly was quick to assure him. I wondered if that was because things weren’t confirmed with Lev and Lilly didn’t want to jeopardize the date, if I should have to be escorted by another boy. “The boat for the castle is arriving early tomorrow morning,” Papa said, abruptly changing the topic. He probably didn’t want to linger over thoughts of his daughters actually going out on a double date. “I just found out Bill Galler out of Akron is going to oversee the day laborers that were hired to help out.” “We should all drive over early and take a look,” Mama suggested. “And then we could drop the girls at school.” Papa rubbed his chin. “I would like to see what they’re up to,” he mused. “Bill says the pay is pretty good. Men are driving in from as far as Columbus.” “Good,” Mama said, a small smirk playing across her lips that her husband was now interested in seeing the monstrosity. “It’s settled then.” Our father had a professional interest in the assembling of the castle. He ran a small construction company and had built several of the larger houses and a few of the businesses around town. When the market crashed, his business shrunk down to building garages and assembling houses that people had order from the Sears & Roebuck catalog. But he’d built our lovely home himself, and the property was paid for, so we were better off than most, although we did have to keep our day-to-day living lean. There were butterflies in my belly as I climbed into bed that evening and they weren’t about the fast approaching double date. I was excited about the castle. It just sounded so romantic; I couldn’t help but wonder who would live there. Did they have any children? And if yes, would those children attend Tiburon High? It seemed incongruous for someone who lived in a real European castle to simply go to the local high school. I was pretty sure if there were any children living at the castle, they would probably have tutors or attend boarding school. When it was time to get up extra early the next morning, I did not want to leave my bed. Not because I wasn’t excited about my day, but because I was having the most wonderful dream and I didn’t want to let it go. There was a boy who was tall and handsome with dark hair and pale skin. He had me wrapped in his arms and he was trying to say something to me, something wonderful. But then there was Lilly, shaking my arm. “It’s time to get up,” she told me. “If you want to miss seeing the boats bringing in the stones for the castle, then go right on sleeping.” I scrambled out of bed and hurried to get ready. But as I dressed for the day, I tried to cling to the fragments that I could remember from my dream. It was just too wonderful not to savor. But it quickly faded, as dreams usually do, and I was left with just a vague yearning for a boy who I would probably never meet. The Tiburon River ran to the south of the town and the castle was to be reassembled on its northern bank. It was officially a river, but not a very mighty one. There was no way for a cargo ship massive enough to make a transatlantic voyage to sail down the waterway. So the stones of the castle were offloaded from the ship somewhere out east and loaded onto railcars. At some point they were then loaded onto shallow-bottomed barges that usually traversed the Ohio River and wended their way to the Tiburon River. And eventually the pieces and parts of the castle reached Tiburon. Papa drove the car down a dirt road. Eventually the road petered out so we had to walk about a quarter of a mile after that to get to the river. The barges had already arrived and were lined up along the bank ten deep. Working the barges were dozens of men, covered in grime, with dark, ruddy faces and fierce bright eyes shouting to each other in a language that was unrecognizable to me. Local men swarmed the landing where the stones were being offloaded. A couple of large platforms with winches had been erected on the land to transfer the large stones, some of which were as small as a child’s Radio Flyer red wagon. Other stones were as large as large as a Model T. The stones were a uniform dark gray in color and each was tagged with a number in bright red paint. I assumed that was so the workers would know how to put the castle back together again. A massive foundation had already been dug into the ground about thirty yards from where the barges were being unloaded. Men were standing in a long line, passing stones about the size of a pound of flour hand-over-hand into the foundation like firemen passing buckets to quench a fire. My father’s friend, Bill Galler, was standing near the edge of the foundation, so Papa strode over to speak to him. Mama, Lilly and I followed in his wake. We knew nothing about the workings of a construction site beyond to stay out of the way. That was a lesson our father had made clear since we were very little girls. “How’s it going, Bill?” Papa asks, shaking the other man’s hand with a firm grip. “Seems like half of Columbus must have come up here today. Where’s everybody sleeping.?” “There’s a small tent city on the other side of the woods,” Bill told him. “A couple of tents for Americans and then another one for the foreigners.” “Why didn’t they hire more local men from here in Tiburon, if you don’t mind me asking?” Papa inquired, not sounding pleased, but not sounding angry either. “Don’t know,” Mr. Galler said, taking off his hat and wiping his brow, even though it was a chilly morning. “I was as surprised as anyone when I got the call offering me the job.” After thinking it over he said, “It might be my name. Galler is Hungarian, you know. My family came over about fifty years ago. We don’t think much about the connection anymore, but that might be it. Or maybe I just got lucky.” Clapping my father on the shoulder, he said, “Either way, I’m sure it wasn’t an intentional snub on you. Or anyone in Tiburon,” he added. “Sure looks like you have your work cut out for you,” Papa said, surveying the line of men moving the smaller stones. “What’s going on with this foundation?” “It’s a dungeon, if you can believe it,” Mr. Galler told him, causing Lilly and I to exchange quick looks. “It’s a real honest-to-goodness medieval castle and those things usually came with a dungeon back in the day. At least that’s my understanding.” “I hope they don’t intend to use it as one now,” Papa said, taking a few steps closer to the massive hole and peering around. “Not that I know of,” Mr. Galler told him. “There’s not a lot of communication on this end, but my understanding is that it’s to be used for storage.” He put his hat back on his head. “That or as guests bedrooms.” When my father gave him a questioning look, he cracked into a smile. His comment made Papa chuckle. “Well, I suppose if they’re trying to keep things historically accurate then they have to put in the dungeon.” He rubbed his chin. “As a matter of fact, I may have a use for it.” When Mr. Galler gave him a curious look, he added, “A couple of young fellows are taking out my daughters on Friday night.” “Well I don’t blame them boys,” Mr. Galler said, shooting us a smile over his shoulder and tipping his hat to our mother. “Your girls have turned out quite pretty. I’m sure there are many young men here about who would like to have that honor.” “Speaking of our girls, I believe we’d better get going,” Mama said, interjecting herself into the conversation. “We don't want them to be late for school.” Papa looked reluctant to leave the bustle of the worksite. “Would you mind taking them over there on your own, Lillian?” he asked. My older sister had been name after our mother. “I’d sure like to stick around awhile.” He looked at Mr. Galler. “If you don’t mind, Bill.” “Be happy to have you,” Mr. Galler said. “I’ve never worked on anything this big before. I guess this is the closest I’ll ever get to erecting a skyscraper in New York City.” “Fine with me,” Mama said, trying to keep the glee from her voice. She loved any reason to drive the car when our father wasn’t around. And, with things being so slow for his work, Papa was around more often than not. “Should I swing back to pick you up before lunch?” Papa cast a questioning eye in Mr. Galler’s direction. “My wife came down with me to stay a few weeks,” was the man’s reply. “She always packs my pail with enough food for three men.” “How about I just swing by before I get super started?” Mama asked, smiling at the two men. Papa was downplaying it all, but it was obvious he was as excited about the construction of the castle as some men get about a new car. “That’ll be fine, Lillian,” Papa said. “Come along, girls,” Mama said, putting an arm around Lilly and the other around me. “We’d better hurry or you’ll be tardy.” We turned to start heading back to the car. I really would have rather stayed and watched the men work, than sit staring at the blackboard while Mr. Wilmore droned on about the quadratic formula, but I knew I would never be allowed to stay. Still, as we left, I felt a great longing to know more about the castle and its future inhabitance. “Please, Mr. Galler,” I said, quickly ducking back around. “What is the name of the family who is going to live here?” Mr. Galler smiled. He seemed like a very genial man. “Vanderlind, I believe,” he told me. As far as I know, the family’s name is Vanderlind.” “Vanderlind,” I said to myself as I turned to catch up with my mother and sister. The name had a dashing quality to it, like a character written by Sir Walter Scott. I couldn’t help but glance back over my shoulder again to catch another glimpse of the massive stones being moved ashore for the construction of the Vanderlind Castle. Chapter 4 Jessie “I want you to glean as much information as you can about this move from your grandfather,” Mother said in a low voice as she pretended to straighten my tie. “Don’t make it obvious, but listen whenever you can.” It was the night after Grandfather had dropped his bombshell about the move. One of the other vampire families was throwing a ball and we had dressed accordingly. “What kind of information?” I asked her, also keeping my voice low. My tie was already perfect; the adjustment of it was just a pretense. My mother gave just the hint of a shrug. “Anything.” she said. “Where is it? That would be good for a start. I can’t even find Tiburon, Ohio on a map. And who is in charge of the construction? Any details about the town or the voyage would be helpful. Just tell me anything you hear.” “I think Mrs. Denkler will probably know more about that than anyone,” I told her. Mrs. Denkler was the castle house keeper and seemed to know more about our family than was normally healthy for a mortal. Grandfather trusted her implicitly, which was saying a lot. He’d even offered to turn her a few times, but she’d refused. “If you’d only made me the offer when I was still young and beautiful,” she would always tell him, “then I would have jumped at the chance.” There seemed to be a steady supply of mortals in Europe who were willing to work for the undead — I didn’t know if that was because they were hoping to become undead themselves or because vampires usually paid a little better — but Mrs. Denkler showed a devotion to our family that was above and beyond ordinary mortal loyalty. “You know that Denkie has always been my father’s agent,” Mother said, ruining the shape of the tie just so she would have to wrap it again. I nodded. She was right. “I’ll keep my ears open,” I assured her. “And…” Mother hesitated for a moment. “No words about this to your brother or Emily. Let’s just keep this conversation between us.” “Understood,” I said with a nod. “Now you look extra handsome,” Mother said in a brighter voice, stepping back to admire her handy work. “I can only imagine how well you’ll look once you’ve been turned. There won’t be a girl in the New World who can resist your charms.” I always felt awkward when anyone made a joke about me chasing after girls. I was old enough to find the opposite sex very appealing, but I wasn’t exactly “girl crazy”. Or at least that was how my cousin Dorian was frequently described. What I truly wanted — and wasn’t willing to ever admit aloud — was someone to love and cherish with every fiber of my heart. And to know in my soul that the girl felt the same way about me. But, given the circumstances of my family, I doubted I would ever have the opportunity to fall in love. Unless I could find a way to escape my grandfather’s clutches and elude the family curse. I was only seventeen, so at least I still had a few years to try. As we planned our transatlantic voyage, Mother was adamant that Mrs. Denkler book everyone separate cabins, using different names for each member of the family. Grandfather was reluctant. “That would be like saying we’re ashamed to be Vanderlinds,” he insisted. I assumed that Grandfather was only being stubborn because using separate cabins was someone else’s idea. “But just think, Father,” our mother implored him. “If one of us was to be accidentally discovered, the whole family could be wiped out.” Shaking her head and frowning, she added, “No. The more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that we must take separate cabins. I wouldn’t even be opposed to separate ships.” But on this point, Grandfather was firm. He could see the sense in the family having separate cabins and traveling under assumed names — travel documents were easy enough to have forged — but he would not hear of separate ships. Eventually Mother had to concede. I said nothing to anyone, but I had the strong suspicion that all our mother really wanted was the separate cabins. She brought up the separate ships so that her father would have something to rail against and feel satisfied. It was finally settled that Emily and I, being the only two family members who still remained mortal, would travel together under the Vanderlind name. The rest of the family would travel under different assumed names. We would not associate with each other except by the most casual of meetings. My uncle and cousin would follow later, once all the business of the Vanderlind estate was settled. Arranging for the boat was actually the easiest things to organize when compared to the numerous tasks necessary for our move to America. It was all well and good for my grandfather to announce that we were leaving for America, but orchestrating the move was a monumental task. First we Vandlerinds had to decide on the necessities we needed for the next several months. Our essentials were packed and transported to a large estate that Grandfather had rented. Then the servants had to pack their own possessions and join us. After that the entire contents of the castle was packed and stored in a warehouse. That made room for several architects, carpenters and electricians to come in and take apart the rooms that had been modernized with wood floors, also removing the doors, woodwork and light fixtures. After that the stone masons came in, numbering every single stone that comprised the castle so it could be disassembled. The top stones of the castle were sent to a warehouse while the bottom stones of the structure were loaded onto numerous freight trains. They crossed several countries before being loaded onto a massive cargo ship that headed out across the Adriatic and on its way to America. It was unsettling to see the hole where the castle had sat for the last couple of centuries, like viewing the gap left after a tooth has been ripped from the mouth of a giant. But there was hardly time to reflect upon our departure due to an absurd number of bon voyage parties that were thrown in our honor. There were parties in the country with horseback riding and polo. There were parties in the city on rooftops that could only be accessed by the air. All mortals had to be carried up by the undead. There was even an elaborate banquet in the catacombs under Buda Castle followed by dancing. Each of our undead hosts did his or her best to outshine the previous party. I began to feel that the parties had started to spiral out of control in terms of ostentation. The entire experience of having our friends wish us farewell was rather exhausting. Especially for a mortal like me, because the parties usually ran until just before dawn. As one of the guests of honor, it would have been considered the height of bad manners for me not to stay until the bitter end. The months of constant bacchanal probably explained why, when an outbreak of scarlet fever ravaged through the streets of Budapest, I was quick to be overpowered by the malady. Chapter 5 Colette It turned out that Lev Wilson was available Friday night and the double date was arranged. Lilly was behind the moon. My feelings were more reserved. I just couldn’t imagine what I would have to talk about with a young man of twenty who worked doing… I couldn’t even remember what he did for a living. That’s how little I was interested in the date. “You don’t actually have to say that much,” Lilly told me as we were getting ready and I expressed my concerns. “All you really have to do is smile, be pleasant and listen when he talks. You can do that much, can’t you?” “I’m sure I can,” I assured her, but the very idea of just smiling and nodding at a young man made me dread the date even more. I knew there were plenty of girls at school who would laugh their heads off whenever a boy said anything even remotely funny, but I couldn’t bring myself to be so mindless. Why should I pretend a boy is interesting or charming or intelligent when he’s not? It seemed to me that just gave the male half of the species a false sense of superiority. Of course this wasn’t something I could say to most girls or they would stare at me like I’d lost my mind. “Questioning a boy’s intelligence is no way to land a husband,” a friend’s older sister once told me when a few of us had been invited to their house for a sleep-over and I had brought up my thoughts on the subject. The only person I could really share my feelings about wanting more out of life than to be a wife and mother was my friend Lois. She was top in our class. She even had her father petition the school so that she could enroll in some of the advanced science and early engineering classes that girls were usually discouraged from taking. She’d already been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and they barely accepted any women. We’d talked about me moving with her to Cambridge and getting an apartment together when she started college. I was sure I could probably find work as a secretary somewhere. My typing skills were quite good. But Lois was also madly in love with a fellow student, Laurence, who was nearly as smart as her. I had a feeling they would get married after graduation and start their collegiate careers as husband and wife. Lilly spent almost as much time taming my hair for our double date than she did fixing her own. Most women tried to get a wave into their hair while I was constantly battling my waves for fear they would upset a ship or two. “You’re just so very pretty,” Lilly said, once she was finished styling my hair and was gazing over my shoulder at our reflections in our dressing table mirror. “I think I’m half afraid to introduce you to Walter. He might like you best.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her, knowing that she was teasing. “I’m sure your beau won’t even notice me.” Lilly broke into a smile. “I hope you’re right.” I decided to wear my favorite green dress with the little white flowers on it. The cotton fabric was too light for the chilly evenings we were still experiencing, but I’d outgrown my heavier plum-colored dress and didn’t have much else to wear. Lilly was dressed quite smartly and I felt I should at least try to match her appearance. It would look odd if she was in a dress and I was just wearing a wool skirt and sweater. At the last minute, Lilly misplaced one of her favorite gloves and you would have thought she’s lost a diamond ring, the way she savaged our room looking for it. I finally discovered that it was still in the pocket of her coat. She’d overlooked it in her haste. Walter and Lev arrived promptly at six thirty, their skin well scrubbed and their hair filled with so much oil that I knew mother was afraid to ask them to sit down for fear they’d leave two matching stains on back of the couch. Many women tatted doilies for their couches just to protect them from such a menace. My sister was telling the truth when she said Lev was handsome. He had a strong chin and a defined brow. He looked just like a fictional football hero, which was what he had actually been only a few years earlier. I had no interest in sports, but I could see he was a very muscular young man and I thought I remembered seeing him around town, usually followed by a swarm of giggling girls. In a way, that made me feel better. If Lev had the attention of a lot of females, then there was no fear of him becoming interested in me as a potential sweetheart. I was sure he was probably perfectly nice, but a sporty-type of beau didn’t interest me in the least. I did notice that a few of the knuckles on Lev’s hands had plasters on them. He kept his hands clasped discretely behind his back most of the time. I scanned my memory again for what kind of work he did, but came up with nothing. Whatever it was, a few abrasions would probably teach him to remember his work gloves. March had come in like a lion and stayed that way. I could tell Lilly was reluctant to bundle up and run the risk of wrinkling her immaculately ironed dress, but she did it without voicing a complaint under the watchful eye of our mother. I layered a sweater over my green dress before adding my coat. I saw no reason to come down with a cold just because my sister had a crush. Finally we were out the door and heading toward town. The Gibson house wasn’t exactly in the country, but we were definitely on the outskirts of town so we had a bit of a walk ahead of us. That didn’t matter; Lilly and I were used to the exercise. Lilly and Walter took the lead, walking side-by-side and rather close together. Lev kept his pace even with mine and began talking, so I did my part to try to listen. His conversation seemed to focus mostly on football, which made listening more of a challenge. I had no idea why anyone would be so interested in a bunch of grown men running up and down a field chasing after a ball. It’s seemed oddly childish to me, as if Lev still enjoyed playing with blocks or flying paper airplanes. But he didn’t ask me any questions, so it was easy enough to pretend to be interested. All I had to do was nod every few sentences and to smile whenever he paused to look in my direction. But I did find it remarkably rude that Lev had not taken the trouble to ask me one question about myself. I knew I was just a girl in high school, so chances were good I didn’t have too much to say that a man of twenty would find interesting, but good manners seemed to dictate that he at least try to ask me about myself. Seated at the counter at Top’s, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Everyone but me, of course. Lilly and Walter were laughing and chatting and generally making themselves cozy. Lev stopped yammering at one point and took a long pull on his soda. I could easily imagine that his throat was dry. I felt it was probably my turn to say something, but I really hadn’t been paying enough attention to keep our current thread of conversation going. So I decided I might as well bring up something I found interesting for a change. “Who are some of your favorite authors?” I was bold enough to inquire. “Authors?” Lev all but sputtered on his drink. “Yes,” I said, not sure why my question was being treated as so shocking; I hadn’t ask him the brand of briefs he preferred. “Who do you like to read?” “I don’t,” he told me, wrinkling his nose in disgust, as if I’d just asked him what dress he liked to wear. “I read the paper and maybe an owner’s manual now and then, but I never read for pleasure.” He pulled another face. “Why would I?” That was it. I wanted to go home. Lev may have been handsome and well-built, but reading was one of my favorite things in the whole world and I could never be interested in a boy who not only did not read, but ridiculed me for taking enjoyment in it. I immediately gave up all attempts at trying to pay attention to the words coming out of Lev’s mouth and started covertly watching the clock behind the counter. We had to be home by nine, so that meant leaving Top’s by eight-forty at the latest. The end of my first official date with a boy couldn’t come soon enough. Chapter 6 Jessie “Stick out your tongue, young man,” the doctor instructed and I did as I was told. “Yes, it’s as I expected,” the doctor said after taking several moments to examine my mouth and throat. “It’s definitely scarlet fever. Quite a bad case, I’m afraid.” “How soon will he be able to travel?” my grandfather asked. After months of packing, shipping and attending farewell parties, we were to leave Budapest in five days and I didn’t even feel like I could get out of bed. My head ached fiercely and my throat was so sore I could barely even swallow a little broth. There was a red rash covering most of my body. It itched something fierce, but I was usually too tired to scratch. The doctor gave Grandfather an astonished look. “I’m not sure you understand the current health of this young man,” he said in a low, yet serious voice. “He will not be able to do anything but rest for at least a month.” Then, glancing at my mother, he added, “I do not wish to alarm you, but there is a chance that he might not recover if he isn’t treated with great care.” “What are you on about?” Grandfather thundered. “Of course he’ll recover. Don’t be absurd. I’m just trying to decide if we can still set sail for America at the end of the week.” I was sure there was more to the conversation, but I was too tired to listen. I felt both clammy and chilled. My throat was on fire, yet I couldn’t manage to swallow much water whenever it was brought to my lips, even though I was parched. I must have slipped into the throws of the fever for some time because the next thing I remember I could hear Mother and Grandfather talking as they stood to one side of my bed. I held very still and just listened, keeping my eyes closed. I knew if I gave any indication I was awake, my mother would turn all of her attentions to me and I wanted to hear what they had to say. “I don’t understand why you can’t just set sail with Daniel,” my mother was saying. I could tell from the tone of her voice that she was trying to keep her emotions under control. “When Jessie regains his strength, the three of us will join you.” “I suppose you intend to keep Emily here with you?” Grandfather snarled. “Of course,” Mother said, as if any other option was simply absurd. “She’s still a little girl. She needs to be with her mother. I’m not sending her off with the likes of you and Daniel. Young girls need kindness, not to be toyed with like a cat toys with a mouse.” “I would not toy with my grandchild,” Grandfather exclaimed, his voice starting to sound like thunder. “I didn’t mean you,” Mother informed him. “Now I love all of my children equally,” she said, “but I think I also understand the nature of each of my children. I’m afraid that Daniel would not be able to resist tormenting a mortal child, even if she is his own sister.” This silenced Grandfather for a moment. He knew Mother was right. But he also probably suspected she had ulterior motives. My mother did not want her children to be members of the undead. “I don’t see why we don’t just turn him now and save ourselves the trouble,” Grandfather said, his voice conveying that my illness was causing him to feel put upon. “No!” Mother said, rather sharply. “He’s only seventeen. He’s too young to be turned.” “He’s not that young,” Grandfather insisted. “He’s almost a man.” “Being almost a man and being a man are two very different things,” Mother insisted. “You wouldn’t want to leave him stuck on the edge of manhood for eternity.” “I suppose not,” Grandfather muttered, pulling on his bottom lip. My fever must have started to rise again because after that I didn’t remember much else beyond the doctor’s concerned face hovering over my bed. He looked very grave and I remember thinking that he was about to tell Mother I was going to die. I should have been so lucky. Later that night, I remember hearing a noise and opened my eyes to see my grandfather looming over my bed. “What is it, Grandfather?” I asked in a hushed voice, not wanting to make too much noise, my head ached so badly. “The doctor has his doubts that you will survive,” Grandfather said, his voice cold and emotionless. “And we’ve already booked our tickets for America.” My eyelids felt heavy, but I tried to peer through the dark. Was Grandfather actually angry that my illness was ruining his plans? “I’m sorry,” I said. It didn’t really make sense to me to apologize, but I had no idea what he wanted from me and I couldn’t think of anything else to say. “I will not have your weakness prevent this move,” he informed me. “Your mother has offered to stay behind with Emily to nurse you, but we both know that means I would never see any of you again.” I said nothing. I was too weak to put up a fight. It was clear that he had made up his mind and nothing I could do would stop him. “So I am to be seventeen forever?” Grandfather bent over me, pushing my head to one side. “You’re going to be a Vanderlind forever.” Then I felt a hot sting on my neck like two hornets had synchronized their attack. Grandfather had his mouth pressed against my flesh and I knew he was feeding from me, draining me of all my blood at a rapid rate. I wanted to fight him, but the fever had left me as weak as a kitten. I could barely raise my hands in protest. And when I did try to defend myself, he immediately pinned me to the bed. As I lay there, I could feel the blood draining from my body. First my feet went numb. It was like standing outside too long in the snow. Then I could no longer feel my hands. Shortly after that I could feel my heart struggling to beat in my chest. I must have cried out as I struggled to cling to my last moments of life because suddenly my mother burst through the door. “Father! What are you doing?” she shrieked. Then she raced across the room and wrenched him away from my shuddering form. “He was going to die anyway,” Grandfather insisted. “I’m just facing the inevitable.” “But he’s just a boy.” Mother was weeping with rage and grief. “You should at least give him the chance to become a man.” “It’s too late now,” Grandfather informed her. “I’ve drunk too much. He’s going to die now, either way. The only question you have to answer is whether I bring him back.” “No!” Mother dropped to her knees, clutching my hand. “Oh, my darling Jessie. I should have known. I should have known he would try to do this to you,” she said between sobs. I opened my mouth to try to speak. I wanted to tell her to just let me die. My body was already feeling much warmer. I felt like I was floating in a lake on a sunny day. The pain of my illness had been washed away. I was ready to face the afterlife. Chapter 7 Colette “I’m sorry, Lilly, but I honestly don’t want to go.” “What are you talking about?” my sister exclaimed. We were in the backyard the next morning, clearing out the weeds that had survived the winter, and turning over the soil in Mama’s vegetable patch. “Lev said he had a wonderful time. He wants to see you again.” “I just don’t think we have very much in common,” I told her as I tugged at a dead thistle, its little stingers piercing my worn work gloves in a few spots. “Men and women never have much in common,” she told me. “You shouldn’t let that bother you.” “He doesn’t even like to read,” I grunted, still battling the plant. “Not at all.” “You put too much stock in reading,” Lilly said. “I think you’ll find most men don’t care for it.” “Papa likes to read,” I pointed out. The thistle finally gave up the fight and I tumbled a little to one side as it released its grip on the soil. “He reads all the time.” “Yes, but Papa is an educated man,” Lilly pointed out. “I think I would prefer an educated man,” was my response. “Yes, but it’s not Lev’s fault he’s not educated. He was going to go to college,” my sister insisted. I really couldn’t imagine Lev in a collegiate atmosphere. He just didn’t appear that bright. I wondered if this was something I should mention to Lilly. “Please, Lettie,” Lilly pleaded. “You know Walter and I can’t go out again unless you go with us. And I really, really like him.” “I’d be happy to meet another one of Walter’s friends,” I told her. “You said he knew a lot of nice boys.” Lilly let her shoulders slump. “But what about Lev? Don’t you think that would hurt his feelings?” “Lilly,” I couldn’t help but say, “we went out on one date for a soda. It’s not as if we were going steady or anything. Besides, I doubt Lev is desperate for female attention. I’m sure there are a lot of girls who would be happy to listen to him talk about football.” Lilly widened her eyes a little, believing she had figured something out. “Is that why you don’t want to see him again? Because he talked too much about football?” “It’s not the only reason,” I told her. “Then what is?” Sighing, I pulled at a few more shriveled weeds. “He never asked me about myself,” I said, feeling a little foolish for no reason. “Not one thing.” “Oh, is that all?” Lilly said, dusting some soil from her gloved hands. “You don’t understand,” I told her. “If there had been just a photograph of me there in my place, it would have been the same to Lev. And when he finally stopped speaking for a moment, and I asked him a question, he ridiculed me.” Standing up, I brushed some dried grass from my legs. “I’m sorry,” I told her, picking up my hoe. “I don’t want to prevent you from seeing your beau, but I will not go out on another date with Lev Wilson.” “But…” Lilly started to protest. “I don’t see why I have to be miserable, just so you can be happy,” I told her chopping vigorously at the soil with the hoe. “Just explain to Walter that Lev and I didn’t hit it off and have him fix me up with another boy. Or none at all, for all I care. I’ll just bring a book on your next date and be a third wheel.” “No, that’s alright,” Lilly hastened to say. “I’ll just tell Walter you need someone who is a little more intellectual. He should understand that.” That afternoon was the first time I rode my bike out to the castle. It hadn’t been my intention. My original destination was the library to hunt for a new book to read, but somehow I found the wheels of my bike rolling toward the shores of the Tiburon River. And the next thing I knew, I was admiring the progress that had been made on reconstructing the castle. I knew better than to get too close to the work in progress. I didn’t want to be in the way. But even from a distance, I could see the walls of the castle starting to rise. The dungeon must have already been finished and the stones for the ground floor in place. I had somehow thought they would build the exterior walls first and then fill in the middle, but they appeared to be building everything up, layer by layer. All of the stones from the barges had been off-loaded onto the shore. The boats themselves had disappeared; probably they were headed back down to the Ohio River. There was still a massive pile of rocks on the shore, but I had heard a second round of barges would arrive with more stones once the first pile had been cleared. It was amazing the amount of progress the stone masons had done in only a few days. But the sheer number of people reconstructing the castle probably made the whole thing go quicker than expected. There didn’t seem to be very many windows to the castle. None at all, as far as I could tell. I thought about the drawings and photographs of castles I’d seen in books. There never were any windows. That made sense, especially if a castle’s primary purpose was to defend its inhabitants against a siege. There was no sign of the Vanderlind family. It seemed unlikely that they would arrive before the castle was completely finished. Wealthy people probably hated being inconvenienced even more than us regular folks. I knew it was foolish, but I couldn’t wait for the Vanderlinds’ arrival. I didn’t think the family would actually socialize with people from Tiburon, but it would be exciting to see a few of them as they drove through town, or maybe catch a glimpse of them as they entered the policemen’s ball, or stopped by to pay a call on the mayor. I imagined it would be like catching a glimpse of royalty. I had read how the English who owned grand houses would have a day each month when their homes were open to the public. That way regular folks could come in and admire the art and finery. I sincerely hoped that the Vanderlinds would adhere to that sort of tradition, so that I would have a chance to see inside the castle. It was something I wanted very much and I just knew there had to be a way. That night I dreamt of the Vanderlind Castle. Or at least I had a dream about a castle and decided it was how the castle being built on the other side of town should look. In my dream there was a fine family with a mother and father, an aging dowager, and several children of varying ages. My dark haired boy was the middle child. He was there, playing croquet on the lawn with his brothers and sisters. I wasn’t sure why I was there. Things were vague, as they sometimes are in dreams. But as the dark haired boy was lining up a shot, he looked up and smiled at me, his dark eyes twinkling in the sunlight. When I woke up the next morning, I took several minutes to luxuriate in my bed. I knew the memories of my dark haired boy would slip away soon enough, so I wanted to savor them while I could. It probably wasn’t healthy to pine for a boy who was only a product of my imagination, but for a few moments I decided to just indulge in my secret fantasies. My sister’s desire to spend time with Walter would brook no opposition. When, after a few days of constant pressure, pleading, and offered bribes yielded no results, Lilly realized that Walter really would have to wrangle another of his friends. I hoped for one with a smaller head, but with a bit more going on upstairs. And that’s exactly what Walter did. He must have combed through every boy he’d ever met to fix me up with a very studious fellow named Herschel Tuft. He was a grade above me at school and he had won the Tiburon High School mathematics prize three years running. It turned out that Walter and Herschel were second or third cousins — I wasn’t exactly sure of their family connection — but it sounded reassuring enough for Papa to agree to the date. This time it was more than just a soda at Top’s. We were actually going to walk into town to see a movie. I loved movies so I felt this date wasn’t going to be as much of an imposition on me. I recognized Herschel from school, of course, as soon as he walked in our front door. I distinctly remembered him accepting his math award the previous year. There was a peculiar angle to the way he held his head when he was nervous and it had stuck in my brain. Herschel was a pale boy, tall and slender with sandy blond hair that was straight as a pin. He didn’t have his hair loaded up with any kind of hair tonic, which I knew met with our mother’s approval. I’d never previously spoken to Herschel, or had any classes with him, but I immediately felt more comfortable being around him than I had Lev. At least he was closer to me in age. In contrast to Lev, Herschel said as little as possible while the four of us walked into town. I didn’t mind the silence. In fact, I preferred it to stories about football games. But I did think we should have a little conversation so I tried with, “What do you intend to do after graduation?” Herschel gave me a started look, as if I was a pet cat that had suddenly started speaking one day. “College,” he eventually answered. I nodded, waiting for more than a one word reply. When I realized nothing else was coming, I tried, “What do you think you’ll study?” “Mathematics,” he told me, this time without as much hesitation. I figured that was about as much as I was going to get out of him, so I let things go at that. There was a bit of problem when we were buying our tickets. Herschel headed up to the gal at the ticket window and purchased a single ticket. I guess that was his way of letting me know he had no interest in me romantically. Fortunately, the feeling was mutual. Unfortunately, it did lead to some awkwardness. I got in line with every intention of buying my own ticket, but then Walter insisted on treating me. I tried to argue with him, but he insisted. It was somehow more humiliating having my sister’s beau purchase my ticket than it would have been if I’d bought my own. Fortunately the film we saw was rather entertaining and I found myself laughing off the whole situation. Herschel, on the other hand, did not appear to enjoy the show. He did not laugh once during the entire movie and frequently looked quite bored. On the walk home, I took the lead, trailing Herschel in my wake. I’d actually enjoyed myself more than on my date with Lev. But I didn’t want to prolong Herschel’s agony, so that speeded my steps. Lilly and Walter were walking at a leisurely pace, of course. They obviously did not want their date to end. When I got to our front porch, I took a seat on the step. The weather was warming up a little, but the flagstones still chilled my bottom. I couldn’t exactly go inside without my sister, and Papa hadn’t put the porch swing back up since taking it down in the fall, so there was no other place to wait. Herschel eventually wandered up and sat beside me. He said nothing, so I said nothing. I did steal a glance at my watch. If my sister and her beau did not step lively, then we would be late getting home and that would be the end of Walter Bennett. “I apologize for not purchasing your ticket,” Herschel eventually said, breaking the silence. “I must save every penny I have for college next fall, And Walter said this wouldn’t really be a date, so I saw no reason to incur the expenditure.” “That’s alright,” I told him. “I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy the picture.” “I enjoyed it,” Herschel told me. “Really?” I was surprised. “I don’t think I heard you laugh once during the whole film.” Herschel chewed over this observation. “I don’t…” he began and then he thought it over some more. “I don’t believe guffawing loudly in a public place is an accurate assessment of enjoyment.” Guffawing? I thought to myself. Herschel was certainly more intellectual than Lev, but he wasn’t exactly a pleasant person to be around. Fortunately for me, Lilly and Walter came into view at that exact moment, walking arm-in-arm. It was a relief because I knew Papa would scold both of us if we were late, and I really didn’t want to spend any more time speaking with Herschel Tuft. Chapter 8 Jessie I woke to a hunger that I never imagined was possible. The urge to feed was overwhelming. It literally crippled any other thought that entered my head. I could smell odors that would have never registered in my mortal nose. I knew the chambermaid had been in the room recently to change my linen. My mother must have sent her away immediately because the smell of her was very faint, but my urge to rip out the girl’s throat and feast on her red juices was overwhelming. Fortunately, Mother was right there with a large jug of blood. “It’s alright, my darling. Everything is going to be alright,” she said, handing me cup after cup of the red nectar until I just grabbed the entire jug and gulped it down. It was the most delicious thing I had ever tasted. It was ambrosia in my mouth. I could feel the blood coursing through my body, making every part of me tingle with satisfaction. There was only a small part of my brain that wondered how the liquid I was drinking had been acquired. Did some poor soul sacrifice his life for the precious elixir? I was ashamed to admit it, but a large portion of me didn’t care. All I wanted was more. After the jug was gone, I was a little better. I felt saner. I still had horrible pangs of hunger, but not the kind of pangs that drove a person to do depraved things. I took notice of my hands. The red rash from my illness was gone and my skin looked extraordinarily pale. A small scar that I had been at the base of my thumb for as long as I could remember had vanished. “Are you better now?” Mother asked, clasping my hands and pulling them to her cheek. “Do you feel under control?” I looked at her, but suddenly I couldn’t speak. There was bile filling my throat. I felt like beetles and slugs were trying to crawl out of my mouth. I hated everyone and everything. I wanted to set the world on fire. I wanted to cause pain. I wanted to see mortals quaking with terror so that I could delight in their agony. “Jessie?” My mother stared at me, her eyes wide with fear. I’d always loved Mother dearly and I didn’t want to frighten her. I didn’t want to cause her any more pain than she’d already suffered with a monster for a father. And it was that conviction that centered me. The plague that I was tempted to let spill from my lips abated. I felt my old self again. “Yes,” I finally managed to say.”Yes, I think I’m…” I could not even think of the words to describe how I was feeling. “Calm,” was what I ended up saying. “I’m so sorry.” Mother burst into tears. “I should have known my father would try something like this. I should have guarded the door.” She hung her head and released a deep sob. “I should have taken you all away years ago.” “I think we both know Grandfather would have never allowed that to happen,” I said, sitting up a little in my bed and stuffing a pillow behind my head and shoulders. “He would have pursued us to the ends of the earth.” Grandfather was a very controlling man. He did not like the idea of anyone disobeying him, especially his own flesh-and-blood. His word was law. “That’s true,” Mother said with a large sniff, her eyes glistening. She always looked beautiful, even when she cried. That was one of the things I remembered about her, even before she was turned. Her beauty had been enhanced by becoming a member of the undead, but it wasn’t created by it. “But still…” she said. “I should have tried. I should have thought of something.” I put my arms around her. “Please don’t cry.” She suddenly straightened up, pulling away from me and looking into my eyes. “You haven’t changed. Have you?” she exclaim. “I thought for a moment there…” She brushed at her tears. “But it’s not true. Is it? You’re still my wonderful boy.” Running my hand through my hair a couple of times, I thought things over. I didn’t feel any different. Not really. Not deep inside. There had been a moment where I’d felt like I could have let the world tumble into the darkest pit of human misery, but that moment had passed. Yes, my sense of smell was better than a bloodhounds and I could see clearly without there being a light in the room. Yes, I craved human blood. I could already feel I would need more of the red nectar before much longer. But no, I did not feel innately different. I no longer felt hate in my heart. That moment was gone. I had no desire to kill or torture mortals. If anything, I felt sad for the life I would never live. I mourned for the girl I would never marry and the children I would never cradle in my arms. “I think I’m the same,” I finally told my mother. “I don’t feel any cruelty in here,” I said, tapping on my chest. “Thank God,” Mother said, wrapping me in her arms. “Thank God.” I held her for a few minutes and let her cry in my arms. Then she pulled away from me and dried her eyes. “Now I only have Emily left.” My poor little sister. She was a dear girl. The weight of continuing the family line would fall upon her shoulders. “We must find a way to protect her,” I said. “We must get her away somehow.” Mother thought about it for quite some time before saying, “No, there is no way to take her away from my father.” She turned to look me in the eye, her face quite solemn. “If Emily is to be saved from the curse of eternal life, then it is Grandfather who must be removed from us.” Chapter 9 Colette “You didn’t like Herschel either?” my sister exclaimed as I walked my bike along side of her. “You’re impossible.” It was Sunday and I had ridden out to the castle after church to see how things were progressing. I had expected the building site to be quiet, but there was still at least fifty men working, positioning stones and moving lumber into the castle. The second battalion of barges had already arrived and been offloaded. I understood there was to be a third and fourth round of boats on the way, the final of which would contain the castle furniture and family possessions. I stood at the edge of the worksite, not wanting to be in the way, but still wanting a glimpse of what was happening. Most of the men who had been hired to help with the offloading of the larger stones had completed their work and been sent on their way. Of the men who remained, most must have been from Hungary. None of the conversations I overheard were in English. The exterior of the castle was looking close to complete, as far as my untrained eye could tell. The structure was much more massive than I had ever imagined. I guessed maybe it was six or eight stories tall. I couldn’t exactly estimate by windows because there weren’t any and I didn’t know how high the ceilings were on each level. The exterior was entirely composed of the large gray stones that we’d seen being unloaded that first day. The castle wasn’t exactly an inviting structure, but historically speaking, I suppose it wasn’t meant to be. I still found the whole idea of a family moving their ancestral home across an ocean and rebuilding it in our small Ohio town incredibly romantic and I longed to know more about the people who were going to live there. Several of the workers were standing in a cluster close at hand and I noticed that some of the men were glancing in my direction. They were rough-looking and dirty from their labors, but they weren’t regarding me in a way that felt menacing. Still, I thought it was a good idea to be on my way. As I was turning my bicycle around, I heard someone call out, “You there.” I didn’t stop. There was no possible reason someone at the worksite would be addressing me. “Hello! Young lady,” the man called out again. This time I knew he had to be addressing me because there were no other females around. “Yes?” I asked, while mounting my bicycle and rolling a few feet down the dirt road. I saw no reason to be within grabbing distance, even if my behavior came off as a little rude. A young man stepped forward. He was covered with grime, but had piercing blue eyes that looked intelligent. “You are from this town?” he asked, waving a hand in the direction of Tiburon. “You live nearby?” He had an accent, but I could understand him easily enough. “Yes,” I said, rather hesitantly, unsure why he was asking. “I have seen you here before. You are curious about the castle.” He said it as a statement, rather than a question. “I’ve never seen a real castle before,” I told him. I wasn’t sure what answer he was expecting. “It is fine that you look now,” the young man told me, “but when the family is here, you must never come to this place. You must stay away.” At first I thought he was trying to tease me in some foreign way that I didn’t understand. But his face was so grave; I quickly realized that wasn’t the case. “Why?” I asked. What need could there be for anyone to avoid the castle, beyond annoying the occupants? “The family, they are…” he said a foreign word that I did not understand. “They are?” I repeated. The young man turned to the group of workers he had been chatting with before approaching me. They were all observing our conversation rather closely. My new friend asked them something in whatever language they were all speaking. I assumed it was Hungarian. The men shook their heads. A few called out more words that I could not understand. Turning back to me, the young man tried again. “They are a cursed family,” he said. “They are…” and then he tried pantomiming out the word he could not translate into English. He began bearing his teeth, which were straight, but yellow. Then he made the action of biting down. “You understand?” he asked. After that he slapped his lean belly a few times. “They must feed.” “Oh,” I said, doing my best to suppress a laugh. Was he really trying to warn me that the Vanderlind family was gluttons? But he was looking at me with such a serious face. Maybe he meant that vicious dogs guarded the castle and they would bite any trespassers. Yes, that made more sense. He probably thought I might try to sneak onto the castle grounds and would get a bad mauling for my curiosity. “Thank you for telling me,” I said, trying to match his grave manner. “I will be careful. I promise.” A look of relief spread across the young man’s face. “I am glad you understand,” he told me. “You will tell other people? They will not come here?” “Yes, I’ll do that,” I assured him, even though I had no intention of doing so. It didn’t seem appropriate for me to wander the streets of Tiburon warning people of the new family’s angry dogs before they’d even set foot in America. Besides, I was quite sure the local police would make the family post a sign or something, if they had animals that were dangerous. I pondered the young man’s’ warning as I rode my bike home. That’s when I ran across Lilly, walking along the road, so I stopped to walk with her. She immediately brought up my date with Herschel, of course. “You didn’t like Lev because he talked too much and now you say you don’t like Herschel because he didn’t talk at all. Seriously, Lettie. I can’t figure you out.” “That’s not exactly true,” I said in my defense. “I didn’t like Lev because…” What could I say? I didn’t like him because he was so very full of himself that there didn’t seem to be any room left for him to care about anyone else. He just didn’t seem like a kind person to me. But I couldn’t exactly say that because he was a good friend of Walter’s. “Because I just didn’t feel we had a connection,” I said, although it sounded like a poor excuse, even to my own ears. “He thought you had a connection,” my sister observed. “Yes, but don’t both people have to mutually feel the connection for there to actually be one?” I asked. “If he felt anything, it was probably just hormones.” “Lettie,” Lilly exclaimed, and then she covered her face with her hands and laughed with embarrassment. “Don’t let Mama and Papa hear you talking like that. They’ll never let you out of the house again.” Chapter 10 Jessie It was not ideal for a fledgling vampire to be shunted onto an ocean liner only a few days after being turned. But Grandfather was a man of little compassion for other people’s suffering. Besides, the ship on which we’d booked our passage had all the requirements for a family of vampires to make a successful voyage. The boat didn’t launch until the evening, so if we waited to board until the last minute, then we could go under the cover of darkness. The ship also docked in New York in the late afternoon. We would all have to find excuses for lingering in our cabins, but that obstacle wasn’t insurmountable. Most stewards would be happy to let an ailing passenger spend a few more hours in his bunk if the right amount of currency was exchanged. We had to make sure that we all had a safe place to spend the daylight hours. Coffins could not be accommodated. — Even a steward on the make would grow suspicious after seeing a coffin in several different cabins. — But overly large steamer trunks were not out of the question. Grandfather had one made for each of the family who was a member of the undead. Steamer trunks were usually put in storage and not left in first class cabins, but it wasn’t such an oddity that it would be remarked upon with any interest. My mother suggested that each trunk be made by a separate craftsman, so they would all have a distinctive look and not be thought of as purchased together. She was adamant about everyone keeping a separate identity and my grandfather eventually saw the wisdom of this plan, even if he was unwilling to compliment her for such forethought. In the last decade, crossing the Atlantic had gone from a thirty day ordeal to just a four day voyage. It was a boon for vampires looking to travel to America because it meant no more trying to bring live animals aboard the ship or surviving on rats. Jars of blood, properly sealed, were easily palatable for up to a week, if kept out of the sun. Our grandfather had always fed traditionally, preferring the blood of beautiful young boys or virile young men. He had enough money and Budapest had enough members of the underclass, that these poor souls could be acquired and disposed of without too much trouble. Every once in awhile, a mother would raise a ruckus, searching for her missing child. But the Vanderlind wealth shielded Grandfather from any real concern about prosecution. There were rumors about our family, but there would always be rumors about us no matter where we lived. After my mother was turned, she couldn’t stomach the idea of causing another human pain to satisfy her own appetite. She said she’d rather starve than to harm an innocent mortal. So she came up with a plan to keep our family in good supply of the sustenance we needed while actually helping the mortals of the human race. Mother invented another son, Arthur. Poor Arthur was a sickly boy, suffering from a rare blood disease. His malady meant he was in need of multiple blood transfusions each day. Mortals interested in selling their blood were provided with a meal and a generous payment. Soon the castle had more blood than was needed. Other like-minded vampire families began contributing funds so that they too could feed without causing harm. It wasn’t too long before clinics were set up in four neighborhoods of Budapest so that blood could be collected without a direct connection to the Vanderlind family. Many vampires agreed that the voluntary collection of blood was the humane thing to do, but it did little to ease a vampire’s natural instinct to hunt. As I struggled to control my appetite and adjust to the new life that had been thrust upon me, there was another worry that plagued my mind. It was too late for a change in our cabin arrangements. My sister and I would have cabins that were adjoined by a stateroom. Before I had been transformed, that seemed an ideal pairing. I could keep an eye on her and shield her from any shipboard Romeos or unscrupulous travelers who were toying with the idea of relieving a first class young girl of her purse. But as a vampire, the whole situation made me uneasy. I was too new to the world of the undead to trust myself alone with any mortal. I loved my sister dearly and would have rather walked out into the blazing sun of high noon than harm her, but that didn’t mean my predatory instincts wouldn’t take over in a moment of weakness. Fortunately, my mother thought of a solution to ease my mind. Mrs. Denkler was crossing on the same ship as us, only her cabin was in third class. Our housekeeper would pose as Emily’s governess and simply stay in the cabin with her. Denkie had nerves of steel and I was convinced she could face down a vampire much more powerful than the likes of me. It felt good to know that my sister would be protected from the evil that lurked in her own home. That would make the crossing less of an ordeal. We travelled by private train cars to the port city of Drubrovnik on the Adriatic Sea, where the ship that would take us to America was anchored. Our boarding was planned with precision. We family members climbed in our custom steamer trunks while it was only late afternoon and then we were driven to the docks in separate vehicles. That way we could start boarding the boat, one-by-one, immediately after sunset. My sister and Mrs. Denkler came in the car with me. At first I felt claustrophobic in my substitute coffin. Although the trunk was quite large, I felt cramped and had to tuck my legs to fit inside. For several seconds I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Then I remembered that I didn’t have to breathe and I was just being foolish. “Mama is getting out of her trunk now,” Emily said, tapping on my trunk. She had a pair of opera glasses with her so she could watch the activities of the other family members while remaining inconspicuous. “They’re driving toward the ship now, so I think it’s okay for you to get out,” she said a few minutes later. All of the trunks had been ingeniously designed so that they could be locked and unlocked from the inside. The visible lock on the outside was really just a decoy to deceive any curious maids or light fingered crewmen. That way there was no chance of someone thrusting open the lid at an inappropriate hour and getting the surprise of his life as a vampire burst into flames and quickly shriveled into a pile of ash. That would have definitely been a story a man could tell his grandchildren from the insane asylum. I jiggled the lock, was unable to open it, and felt a flash of frustration. Then I realized I had my eyes closed, which was silly because as a member of the undead, I could see perfectly in the dark. With my eyes open, I easily popped the lock and flipped open the lid. Slipping out of the trunk, I crawled into the back seat next to my sister. She gave me a smile, then reached over and straightened my tie. Even though it was no longer necessary for me to breath, I still took a few moments to gulp in some of the night air. Mortal habits were hard to break. And it was always good to give the impression of breathing. It was smart for a vampire to try to appear as alive as possible. “Grandfather’s going now,” Emily said, glancing at me and then returning to her opera glasses. Under normal circumstances, Grandfather would have insisted upon going first. But like most bullies, he was a coward at heart. He wanted to make sure that no one tried to stop my mother before he put himself at risk. I wasn’t sure why anyone would stop Mother. She was simply a beautiful young woman travelling first class to the New World. “Are you sad about leaving Hungary?” Emily asked as we watched the others move closer and closer to the ship. There had been so many parties in the last few months, and then I had been gravely ill, and then I was abruptly transformed into the undead. With all that going on, I’d hardly had time to reflect on our moving. If I took a moment to think about it, then yes, there was some sadness at leaving the country we had always called home. I had school friends whom I was to be parted from forever. But I would have been parted from them anyway after being turned immortal. And yet there was another emotion brimming in my chest. It was much more powerful than my sadness, but I concealed it from everyone. In truth, I felt oddly compelled to go to America. My feelings were hard to describe, but I almost felt like my real life was waiting for me there. I didn’t exactly know how to explain it, but part of me was looking forward to the move with eager anticipation. “Jessie?” Emily prompted me and I realized I had not spoken in several seconds. Her face looked both sad and hopeful. I knew it must have been hard on her to have me turned so young. Neither of us had wanted to follow the family tradition that Grandfather was hell-bent to inflict upon us. We’d sometimes spoken of running away once we were both a little older. Those childhood plans were now gone. If Emily was to run, it would have to be on her own. I could no longer go with her. I forced a smile to my lips and said, “I think it’s going to be a grand adventure.” “You know what I think?” she asked, almost shyly. “What’s that, my little love?” I asked, slipping my arm around her and giving her a squeeze. She was not yet thirteen, so she still sometimes let me cuddle and squeeze her. “I think it’s going to be like Dorothy.” “Dorothy?” I asked, giving her a puzzled look. “From The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” she explained. It was her favorite book from when she was very little. “Don’t you remember? Dorothy’s whole house is swept up by a cyclone and crashes down in a place that’s filled with magic.” Her eyes were shining with the romance of it. “Why do you talk such nonsense?” Mrs. Denkler felt the need to interject. She’d been sitting in the front seat next to the driver, glowering at us the whole time. “The castle wasn’t swept up in a cyclone. It was dismantled and moved by hundreds of workmen and at great expense. And America is not a land filled with magic. Far from it. The east coast is supposed to be quite civilized, but the whole middle of the country is filled with savages and Irishmen.” “Don’t listen to Denkie,” I said, giving Emily another squeeze and shooting our housekeeper a warning look over my sister’s shoulder. “She’s still pouting that we’re not moving to the North Pole.” “The North Pole?” Emily gave her temporary governess a surprised look. “Yes, I heard her talking to Grandfather about it. She’s always wanted to move to the North Pole so that she can look for Father Christmas.” “She never said such a thing,” Emily said with a giggle. “You’re making that up.” “I might be,” I said, frowning a bit while nodding my head. “But I think you’re right about Dorothy. Maybe our house will land in a magical place.” Chapter 30 Jessie Emily peeked through her opera glasses again, directing them at the docks. “Daniel’s in line to go through customs,” she said. “And there are a couple of people behind him.” We had our chauffeur pull down to the dock so we could unload and prepare to board the ship. By the time we got all of our baggage out of the car, Daniel was already through the line. First class passengers were treated as above reproach. Beyond glancing at our tickets, no one stopped us as we made our way onto the ship. It was that easy, but only because of our Grandfather’s fortune. And our mother’s forethought. A steward showed us to our cabins. We each had sleeping quarters, and then there was a small stateroom that was set between our cabins. It was actually very charming with wood paneling and brass framed portholes. And the rooms were not nearly as cramped as I’d anticipated. That was another benefit to traveling first class. It afforded a person a lot more breathing room. There was a tap at the door while we were all settling in for our four day journey. “Bonjour,” a young woman in a maid’s uniform said as she let herself into our shared accommodations. “Oh,” she exclaimed, as if she hadn’t expected anyone to be in the rooms. “You must forgive me,” she said, her cheeks turning quite red. “I had expected that everyone would be on deck for the launch of the boat. I am just here to turn down your beds for the night.” Seeing the young woman’s blush reflex made my stomach contract with hunger. She was a beautiful, petite thing with bobbed hair and painted lips. I forced my mind to think of my luggage, which contained a dozen bottles of blood, all neatly tucked between ample padding. “You want I should come back later?” she asked. I placed her accent as French, but probably not from Paris. I glanced over at Emily, who shook her head just the tiniest bit. I was grateful to her. I think she understood that I was struggling with my newly acquired dietary restrictions and she didn’t want temptation to stumble in my path in the form of a shapely servant. “We won’t need bed service during our voyage,” I told the maid. “Is there anything I can get you?” she asked, looking from me to my sister and then back again. “Some water? Or ice, perhaps?” “Just solitude, I think,” I told her. We really didn’t need one of those forward maids who was always barging in to see if anything was needed. “We’ve both had a bout of scarlet fever so we’re looking for an uneventful voyage with plenty of peace and quiet.” “You poor things,” she clucked. “Then I shall bring you some broth to strengthen your blood.” The maid was remarkably persistent and she kept peeking at me, shyly, in a way that let me know that she was probably new to her job and desperate to make a good impression. “No thank you. We are in need of nothing.” I assured her. “And besides, if we do happen to have some urgent need, then there’s always my sister’s governess to take care of us both.” “Very good,” said the maid, glancing briefly in Mrs. Denkler’s direction. “Then I shall leave you to have a pleasant journey.” Once the maid had gone, Emily walked over to me and took my hand. “Are you feeling well enough to go up on deck? I would love to be there when we launch.” She gave me a hesitant smile. “And maybe toss some of those paper streamers into the air.” I knew Emily was worried about me mingling with the mortal crowd up on deck. She was such a little doll to be so concerned for me. She had always been quite the considerate child. And I didn’t want to deny her the enjoyment of our grand departure. “Just give me a moment in my cabin and we can head right up,” I told her. “Now that you mention it, I think I’d like to toss some paper streamers myself.” In my cabin, I opened the small trunk that held most of the food I would use on our voyage. There were twelve quart bottles to last me four days. It seemed like an excessive amount, but I had the keen hunger common to most fledglings and there was also always the risk of bad weather while we were at sea. We didn’t want a delay of a day or two leading to disaster. I kept another two small pint bottles in a valise in case of emergencies, but I hoped I wouldn’t need them. Unsealing the wax around one of the quart bottles, I pulled the cork and took a long pull. “Oh...” I couldn’t help but sigh and close my eyes, savoring the moment. It tasted so good. “Hurry up,” Emily called, rapping on my cabin door. “The boat’s about to leave.” “Coming!” I called, setting the bottle down and searching for the cork. I thought I’d put it on the table, but it was nowhere to be found. “Go ahead with Mrs. Denkler,” I called out as I searched. “I’ll catch up with you.” “She doesn’t want to go,” my sister informed me. “She says she has too much unpacking to do.” Where was that blasted cork? I hated to leave the bottle just sitting open. “Jessie,” my little sister called. “We’ve got to go now or we’ll miss everything.” “I’ll be right there,” I told her, setting the bottle down on the sink of the small bathroom that was part of my cabin. As I was striding toward the door, the trunk holding my food supply caught my eye. I’d told the maid we didn’t need anything, so we weren’t expecting anyone in the rooms, but just to be on the safe side, I snapped the trunk closed and locked it. Better safe than sorry. I didn’t want to end up eyeing every mortal passenger on the ship like they were sides of beef. Our departure was actually quite enjoyable. There was the excitement in the air that always seems to accompany the start of a journey. People cheered and waved to their loved ones standing on the shore. There were paper streamers, just like in the movies, and Emily had a delightful time letting them tumble from her fingers and trail over the side of the ship. I was doing well. Even though the ship’s deck was crowded, I felt I had control over my hunger. I caught a glimpse of my mother and grandfather out of the corner of my eye, standing separately and observing the festivities. Daniel was nowhere to be found, but he never was one to mingle with mortals, even when he was a mortal. There was a shift in the crowd as some noisy young men roughly surged through it. I could smell the beer on their breath, which explained their heightened jocularity. People were being jostled and a few of them even stumbled. I instinctively put my arm around my little sister to protect her from the high spirited youths. Emily looked up at me and smiled. “You’re a little old for her, aren’t ya?” one of the young men asked. He couldn’t have been older than nineteen or twenty. His face was a ruddy pink from alcohol. I gave the fellow a sharp look, but decided the best course of action was to ignore him. Emily, being on the verge of young womanhood, felt embarrassed by his comment. “He’s my brother,” she told him. The young man smiled. “Does that mean you’re free?” he said, his mouth spreading into a lascivious grin. “This is my lucky day.” “She is a child,” I told him. “And your comments are not appreciated.” “I think she’s old enough to make up her own mind.” The man reached out to touch Emily’s cheek. “Aren’t you, pretty girl?” Before I even thought of what I was doing, my hand shot out and I’d grabbed the young man firmly by the wrist. I wasn’t used to my undead strength and I held him quite tightly. There was a surprised look in his eyes, backed by a little pain. But the surprise quickly turned to alcohol-fueled fury. He took a swing at me, but I blocked his blow as easily as if he’d been moving through water. Then he went to call out for some help from his friends, but I gave him a sharp shake, glared into his eyes, and said, “I wouldn’t if I were you.” “Let’s go look at the moon on the other side of the ship,” Emily said, placing her small hand on my arm. “Come on, Lucas. I think we should go.” I was confused for a moment as to why Emily had referred to me as Lucas. But then I realized that she didn’t want the young man to know my real name. Emily had obviously inherited my mother’s good head, along with her beauty. Knowing it was the smart thing to do; I released the young man and allowed my sister to lead me away, her arm looped through mine. Having her next to me was more helpful than she could have ever realized. All I wanted to do was go back to the young man and tear out his throat. “I think we should go back to our cabin,” Emily said in a subdued voice, once we were away from the crowd. “That’s probably a good idea,” I told her, my teeth clenched together. As soon as we’d crossed the threshold to the stateroom, I rushed to my cabin to have another few gulps of blood. I felt like I could barely contain myself and I knew I desperately needed to calm down. But when I checked the sink in my tiny bathroom, the quart bottle had been emptied, rinsed and set out on the counter. I stared at the empty bottle for several seconds. Who would do such a thing? “Mrs. Denkler,” I called rushing back to our shared room. I had seen her sitting on a small couch as we’d entered our quarters. When she looked up from her needlework I asked, “Who has been in the cabin since we left?” “Just the maid,” she said, completely unconcerned. “Why?” “Did she go into my room?” I asked, ignoring her question. “She took some towels in there,” was her reply. “Did she take something? Is anything missing?” “How long was she in my room?” I persisted. “Just a few moments, I think,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I don’t know for sure because I was changing when she let herself in. All I did was peek out the door and she told me that you had requested more towels.” “I didn’t request towels,” I said in a stern voice. Mrs. Denkler went back to her needlework. “I guess she must have confused our cabin with somebody else’s.” Chapter 11 Colette As the spring weather began to warm the ground, I found an excuse to visit the construction site every couple of days. The castle was magically growing before my eyes. The exterior of the building was complete. As the stonemasons departed for parts unknown, electricians, carpenters and gardeners arrived. It was rumored that a whole crew of Italian craftsmen had been brought in just lay down the parquet floors. This meant that there was less activity outside the castle, but I could hear hammering inside the building, and men calling out to each other in various languages. “Why do you always want to go look at that dreary old fortress?” Lilly asked me one afternoon as I was heading off on my bicycle for another visit. “I think it’s going to end up looking surprisingly ugly. And just so drab. Don’t you?” “Oh, no,” I told her. “I think it’s romantic. I mean, just imagine, a couple of hundred years ago knights in armor would have ridden right up to the castle door. Ladies in Waiting would have woven tapestries to cover the walls.” I wondered if any of the original furniture from the castle had survived and if the Vanderlind family still owned any of it. Now that was something I would have loved to see. “So that’s why you like it? For the history lesson.” Lilly smiled and shook her head. “You’re a funny kind of girl.” I didn’t correct my sister, but she hadn’t exactly gotten it right. I did love history, but that wasn’t why I was so captivated by the castle. It was more about the feeling I had in my chest whenever I was near the building; a kind of tickling or buzzing that I couldn’t explain. There was something magical about the castle that I felt deep in my soul, but I didn’t know how to put into words. And maybe part of me didn’t want to put into words. There are some things a girl wants to keep to herself, thoughts not even to be shared with a dearly loved sister. My father also found himself drawn to the castle, but his interest was for professional reasons. He was the best builder in town, but he’d never been offered once day’s work at the castle. That hurt his pride, but it didn’t prevent him from being curious about the construction. Whenever he had a little free time, we would ride out in our car together to see the progress that had been made. Lilly and Mama rarely went, but I was always happy to accompany him. My father was a cordial man and people were usually happy to speak with him. If he found a worker who understood English, he could usually strike up a conversation. I was always eager to listen in. I felt almost a mania to glean as many details as I could about the castle. One afternoon my father discovered that the men who were putting in the rose garden were all from Great Britain. “You’re not from Hungary?” he asked, somewhat surprised. “Wasn’t the garden part of the original house? I thought the family had the shrubs and topiary shipped over as well.” “No. You’ve been misinformed,” a man with thin legs and a round belly told him while leaning on the end of his shovel. I got the impression he wanted a break from his labor. “This place never had a proper English rose garden. But I guess the lady of the house always wanted one.” “And what better way to get a proper English garden than to have one planted by proper Englishmen,” my father said with a smile. “That’s right.” The man smiled in return, exposing a large set of yellow teeth. “The lads and I thought it might be a bit of an adventure. Plus the money was right. We brought the rose bushes with us and everything. Most of them fared the voyage without complaint.” Then he added in an aside, “The roses, not the lads. We had a bit of rough weather.” “It must be nice to be able to order the creation of an entire formal garden on a whim,” my father observed, half to himself. “Yes, there must be more money than Midas behind those walls,” the gardener agreed, eyeing the castle. “Imagine wanting to move to this tiny town in the middle of nowhere.” Then he realized we were more than likely inhabitants of Tiburon, so he quickly added, “Not that the town doesn’t have its charms.” His face went rather pink. “But you always think of rich people as living in London, or Paris. New York, even. Not a small town in the middle of Iowa.” “Ohio,” my father said, correcting him, but keeping his voice genial. “I supposed they want a bit of privacy,” the man said, taking off a heavy work glove and scratching beneath his nose. “I hear that they pretty much like to keep to themselves.” “I guess they won’t be attending any town hall meetings,” Papa joked. “But I suppose the very rich don’t like to dirty their hands.” “Not like me and the lads,” the gardener said, slipping on his glove again as if he’d just remembered he had work to do. “Still, it’d be nice to get a peek inside, when the old gal is done,” he said, eyeing the castle once more. “I don’t suppose they’ll be holding tours.” “If they do, I’ll be the first in line,” my father assured him. “Is the family going to be arriving soon?” I asked. The castle was pretty much devoid of windows, so it was impossible to get a sense of the comings and goings of anyone inside. “Not that I know of, Miss,” he told me, his face rather serious. “Although, from what I’ve heard from some of the I-talian fellows, the family isn’t very nice. In fact, there were one or two stories that could stand a grown man’s hair on end, if anyone was to believe them.” Papa cleared his throat. “I’m not sure it’s right to start rumors about a family before they’ve even driven into town,” he said with a note a censure. The man shrugged. “It’s hard to have a big house like this, and all the money that goes with it, and not at least stir up a few rumors.” Turning his attention back to me, he leaned forward a little and gave me a stern look. “I hope you aren’t expecting a prince charming to go along with the castle as a matched set.” I immediately felt my face go red and I placed a hand to my cheek. My father stepped slightly in front of me, as if to shield me from the gardener’s impertinence. “My daughter enjoys studying history,” he informed the man. “I think she’s just hoping for some more facts about the castle’s past.” The man nodded, his expression growing sober. “Just as long as she remembers that sometimes where there’s smoke, there’s fire.” His eyes became thoughtful. “Or blood, as the I-talians tell it.” I was grateful for my father’s protection, and I did enjoy history, but I still felt the humiliation of being thought of as some silly school girl longing for a prince to move into the neighborhood and notice her. I probably felt doubly embarrassed because maybe the man’s assessment of me hinted at the truth. I couldn’t help but wonder about the stories being spread by the Italian workers. And what expression did they have in Italy about blood? I glanced around, wondering when the Italians took their coffee break and if there was any way I could speaking with one of them. When we returned home that evening, Lilly was sitting on the front steps waiting for us. “Hello Papa,” she said, springing up to give our father a kiss as he climbed the stairs. “Hello, Lettie,” she said, giving me a squeeze, her face all smiles. “What’s going on?” I asked, returning her smile with a suspicious glance. She usually wasn’t quite that much of a welcoming committee. “Oh, it’s nothing,” she said, but she could hardly suppress her smile. “It’s just that Lev Wilson bought a new car. From the White Motor Company. He and Walter just drove it all the way down from Cleveland.” I had to admit, I was impressed that Lev could afford a car. Especially a new one. It made me wonder where he got his money. “How can he afford that?” I had to ask. “From his work, of course,” Lilly said, giving me a small frown. “Oh,” I said with a nod. It was too embarrassing to admit that I had no idea what Lev did for a living. I was sure he had told me, I just hadn’t bothered to listen. “Did he buy it on credit or something?” I asked. He was still a young man and didn’t have a college education, so I doubted he made that much money. Lilly frowned again and shrugged as she trailed me into the house. “That really isn’t something I could ask.” “And just why, exactly, are you bringing all this up?” our father asked as he shrugged out of his jacket. “Well…” Lilly paused for a moment as she gathered her nerve. “Lev and Walter invited Lettie and me to go for a drive after dinner tomorrow,” she blurted. “Just to see the new car, of course.” Papa frowned. “Haven’t you been seeing an awful lot of Walter?” “Not really,” Lilly insisted. “Not an awful lot. In fact, not very much at all.” Mama had walked into the room while we were talking. “Another date with Walter,” she exclaimed. “I hope you two aren’t getting too serious.” “Well, I like him very much, if that’s what you mean,” Lilly said. And then her face flushed a little, “But just so you know, Walter has always been a gentleman.” “I’m glad to hear it,” Mama said, taking our father’s coat and folding it over her arm. “That’s just how a young man should behave.” “That’s how any man should behave,” Papa felt the need to add. “So can we go?” Lilly asked, her eyes shining with excitement. “Just a short drive.” Glancing over at me, she added, “Maybe out to see the castle. I know Colette likes that kind of stuff.” “Your sister was just at the castle with me,” Papa informed her. “Oh, but I’m sure she wouldn't mind going again tomorrow.” She looked eagerly in my direction. “Would you, Lettie?” I had no desire to see Lev Wilson again, but I was already itching to get back to the castle. “I guess I wouldn’t mind,” I said. “As long as it’s just for an hour.” I thought I could put up with anyone’s company for an hour. Lilly bounced up and down and then gave me a hug. “I hope you realize that your mother and I haven’t given our approval yet,” Papa said, his voice stern. Lilly stopped bouncing. “Oh, please,” she said, sounding as if she was Cinderella about to be denied admission to the ball. “I promise it will only be for a half an hour. Maybe an hour at the most.” Our mother and father exchanged looks. “I’m not sure I approve of you riding around in cars with boys,” Mama said. “But if Walter is the gentleman that you claim, then I suppose it’s alright by me, if it’s alright with your father.” Lilly clasped her hands together and turned to look at Papa. “It’s fine, as long as your sister’s with you,” Papa said. “But I want those boys to come inside so I can look them both in the eye again. Most young men remember to mind their p’s and q’s when they know that a father is keeping a close eye on his daughters.” “Well of course they’ll come in,” Lilly said. “Walter would insist on that, anyway.” Lilly hurried off to call her beau and I started setting the table for dinner. I was reluctant to see Lev again, but I could probably just block out his words while gazing at the castle. Plus I desperately wanted to speak to one of the Italian carpenters about the Vanderlinds. What were the hair-raising stories about the new family moving into town? Chapter 12 Jessie Mrs. Denkler went with Emily to the dining room for dinner, but I ordered a meal to be delivered to my room. I intended to try to show up for a few meals with the general public, if only to please my sister and to give the appearance of being mortal, but I was too riled up from my encounter on deck to attempt a meal that night. I ordered a steak, extra rare, along with roasted potatoes, greens and a bottle of wine. I didn’t go overboard on the wine. I knew I had to order a good vintage to keep up appearances, but I saw no reason to spend a lot of money, when all I was going to do was pour it down the drain. I did think for a moment to offer the bottle to Mrs. Denkler, but then changed my mind. She was in charge of my little sister, after all. I didn’t want to give her an excuse to get tipsy. After Emily and her temporary governess had returned from their meal and gone to bed, I sat up reading. I was still unused to my new hours of existence. I didn’t know how to give up my days and find ways to fill my nights. As the hour dragged on past midnight and most of the ship’s passengers had gone to bed, I went up on deck to have a look around. The night was mild and the skies were very clear. The Milky Way was on full display and I took a moment to marvel at the beauty of the heavens. “Are you having trouble sleeping too?” I heard a familiar voice ask me. I looked up to see that my mother had also decided upon a late-night stroll. “Oh…” I stammered for a moment before I realized that we weren’t supposed to know each other. “Yes,” I managed. “I know many people find the gentle rocking of a boat sleep-inducing, but it has the opposite effect on me.” Mother gave a gentle laugh. “I suffer from the same malady, I’m afraid.” Then she turned her head slightly, just enough to let me know that she had heard something or sensed someone else on deck. Taking a moment to focus, I had to agree with her. I could definitely smell the hormonal-laced musk of an adolescent male close at hand. “Did you enjoy the ship’s departure?” I asked, just for something to say so it wouldn’t look awkward with us both just standing there. “I found it quite exhilarating,” she told me with a gentle smile. “Begging your pardon,” a voice said. We both turned to see a young cabin boy who had stepped out of the shadows. His hair was a crown of golden ringlets and his eyes were wide and a brilliant shade of blue. By any standard, he was remarkably beautiful, even though his eyes were crusted slightly with sleep. “Would either of you fine people be needing anything?” I saw my mother suppress a smirk. The boy had obviously been asleep somewhere in a dark corner and was concerned that he might have been discovered shirking his duties. “I am perfectly comfortable,” my mother told him. “Thank you for asking.” Turning to me, she added, “Anything for you, Mr.…?” She let her words hang in the air, seeing that ostensibly we had not been introduced. “Vanderlind,” I told her, suppressing a smile of my own. “Jessie Vanderlind.” My mother provided her false names and we exchanged how-do-you-dos. Then mother turned to the cabin boy and said, “And what is your name, young man?” The cabin boy looked startled for a moment and then said, “I am Christian Franzen, Ma’am. How do you do?” “How do you do?” Mother replied. Christian Franzen stood there for a moment, feeling awkward and unsure of what to do next. “It was nice meeting both of you,” he told us, “but I suppose I’d better be getting back to work.” After he’d hurried off, my mother remarked in a low voice, “What a beautiful young man. His features are quite striking. Did you see the color of his eyes?” “There was no missing them,” I had to admit. The boy’s beauty was hard to ignore. “Blue,” Mother said, a bit wistfully. “A clear blue, like the sky on a perfect day.” Then in a voice that was hardly audible she whispered, “I do hope your grandfather doesn’t catch a glimpse of him. That could only lead to trouble.” “It is a rather lovely night,” I said, making a show of looking at the stars in the sky. There was the gentle sound of footsteps approaching and I meant to give my mother warning in case she hadn’t heard them. “I should probably return to my cabin now or my husband will wonder where I’ve got off to,” Mother said. “It’s was very nice speaking with you. I hope you have a good night.” As she turned and left, an elderly couple approached, walking slowly, arm-in-arm. Part of me wondered why they were up at such an hour. And another part of me mourned that I would never have the chance to grow old with someone that I loved. The little French maid continued to be persistent in her quest to be of service to Mrs. Denkler, my sister and me. Emily reported that she had knocked on our door twice the next day. She even had the temerity to ask if she could check with me directly to see if I needed anything, even though Denkie had told her I was resting. Resting was not an accurate description of what I was doing in my oversized trunk. I couldn’t lie down completely straight and that made it a challenge to get comfortable. I tried not to thrash around too much because I didn’t know if there happened to be anyone lurking in my cabin. I didn’t want a maid or cabin boy to wonder about the rustling in Mr. Vanderlind’s enormous trunk. Emily tried reading to me to pass the time for both of us. After the initial excitement, she found life aboard ship too sedentary. I could have just as easily taken a book into the trunk with me, but it hadn’t occurred to me when I’d climbed in for the day. Turning my mind off was the problem. We vampires didn’t exactly sleep; we went into a state of repose that was supposed to be similar to deep meditation. At least that was what I had been told. So far I hadn’t been able to find any type of repose, sleep, meditation or otherwise. Eventually my sister became restless. “Would you mind if I went up on deck?” she asked, her voice apologetic. “Just for a little while. There’s shuffleboard up there and…” Her voice faded. I could tell she was trying to decide if she was being selfish. “Emily, don’t worry about me,” I told her. “I’ll be fine. You go and enjoy yourself. It’s what I want you to do. And take old Denkie with you. She could use some fresh air.” Emily giggled. She loved when I referred to Mrs. Denkler in this way. “I won’t be long,” she assured me and I could hear her getting to her feet. “Take as long as you like,” I insisted. “It’s not like I’ll be up and about until nightfall.” After Emily and Mrs. Denkler went out, I tried to turn my thoughts off and just focus on nothing. But my life had gone through so many changes in the last week that it made it almost an impossible thing to do. Even so, after an extended period of frustration, I eventually found myself starting slip into the void. That was until I heard somebody in my room. I was immediately jerked into consciousness by the slight creak of hinges being opened. Who was out there? I couldn’t begin to imagine. It wasn’t Emily or Mrs. Denkler. Of that I was convinced. Neither one of them had any cause to sneak into my cabin. Perhaps one them was looking for something and trying not to disturb me. I gave that idea some thought. But then I heard the light clinking of bottles and I was filled with rage. The only bottles I had in my room were my food supply. Why was someone rifling through my trunk? Was it the same person who had dumped the first bottle? Was he back to finish the job? I felt an impotent rage. I wanted to burst from my trunk and confront the scoundrel, but that was a bad idea for numerous reasons. There was nothing I could do but sit there, not making a sound, and hope the person was not doing what I suspected he might be doing. The bottles eventually stopped rattling, but then a more alarming sound reached my ears. It was someone trying to open the very trunk that contained me. He was fiddling with the lock. I froze, afraid even the slightest movement might give me away. The thief struggled with the lock for several minutes. Then there was the sound of a door opening and closing. I could hear the voices of Mrs. Denkler and my sister. The person standing outside my sleeping trunk instantly grew very quiet. And then I could hear him walking lightly across the room. I made a vow that if whoever was out there tried to hurt Emily or Denkie in any way, I would burst from my makeshift coffin and dispatch the thief to the great beyond. I thought I could probably cause their demise before the sun burnt me to cinders. Even with this resolve, I understood that even the smallest bit of sunlight was excruciatingly painful to a member of the undead. But it was a horror I would have to face in order to protect my family. Emily and Mrs. Denkler must have gone into their cabin for a moment because their voices grew more muffled, but they didn’t sound agitated in any way. I strained my ears in my custom-made prison for any sound that might indicate a struggle. All I heard was soft footsteps crossing the floor and the sound of a door being quietly pulled open and then shut again. With the click of the latch, I felt myself relax slightly. Whoever had been snooping meant my family no harm. The person was probably just a petty thief looking for easily concealable items. Several hours later, I felt the ease that comes over all vampires with the setting of the sun. While I waited a few minutes for the last rays of the day to dwindle, I listened for sounds of anyone being in the cabin that shouldn’t have been there. And then, feeling reasonably sure I had taken all necessary precautions, I popped the interior locks on my trunk and opened the lid. No one was in my cabin. That gave me some relief. I peeked out the door to glimpse Denkie and my sister reading books in our shared living space. They both looked perfectly fine. Then I turned to see what was missing from my room. A watch and chain, a pair of gold nail scissors, and a pearl lapel pin had all disappeared off of my bureau. These were annoying losses, but nothing to cause me great regret. I had shipped anything of real value when the contents of the castle were sent over. Taking a fortifying breath, I turned my attentions to my true concern; the trunk holding my food for the next few days. The lid was closed and I was reluctant to open it. But whatever had happened, I had to face it. Flipping open the lid, I surveyed the eleven bottles that had been so carefully packed. They were all empty. Someone had snuck into my cabin and drained every single one. Chapter 13 Colette “Good evening, Mr. Gibson,” Walter Bennett said. I could tell he was using his very best manners. “Mrs. Gibson.” There was a big smile on his face and he couldn’t stop from looking in Lilly’s direction. It struck me for the first time that my sister and Walter might be in love. It was more than likely what older people referred to as “young love” but that probably didn’t keep it from feeling any less real to them. “Good evening, Sir,” Lev said, shaking Papa’s hand. He was obviously part of the good-manner’s club. “Mrs. Gibson,” he said with a nod to our mother. “Good evening, boys,” Mama said. “That’s quite a bruise you’ve got there,” Papa said, referencing a purple discoloration and a small plaster high on Lev’s left cheek. Lev’s hand self-consciously flew up to gingerly touch his injury. “Nothing much,” he said rather quickly. “I was roughhousing with some friends and there was a little accident.” “Was anyone else hurt?” our mother asked, immediately concerned. “Oh. No, it was nothing like that,” Lev assured her. “A couple of us were wrestling where we shouldn’t have been and my face got banged on the corner of a table.” He touched his cheek again and then forced his hand back down to his side. “It looks a lot worse than it is.” The four of us piled into Lev’s new car. It was shiny black and showroom new. Lilly and Walter claimed the back seat, so that left me to sit up front with Lev. “What do you think of her?” Lev asked as he started the car up. “Isn’t she a beauty?” I was a little surprised that Lev had bothered to ask me a question. But seeing that he was really fishing for a compliment, it wasn’t too much of a shock. The sun was just starting to set, so there was still a lot of daylight left. I couldn’t help but notice as Lev gripped the wheel that his right hand was purpled and slightly swollen. “Did that happen while you were roughhousing, too?” I asked, nodding toward his hand. Lev glanced at his bruises and then shot me a rueful grin. “You could say something like that.” I wasn’t sure what to make of his comment, but I didn’t feel the urge to dig for details. If Lev had gotten into a fight with one of his friends, then that had nothing to do with me. And if afterward, they had decided to patch things up and just call it roughhousing, then that was their business, not mine. All I was obligated to do was be polite and go see the castle. Lev drove his car with surprising caution, keeping under the speed limit and being considerate of other motorists. He even showed remarkable patience when a farmer pulled his tractor out onto the road ahead of us and we had to inch along for several minutes until the man turned off the main road and onto a dirt one. I began to wonder if I’d misjudged Lev. Maybe he was just nervous during our first date. Male animals in the jungle were known to show off colorful plumage or magnificent manes to attract a mate. Maybe Lev’s constant bragging was just his ill-judged attempted to impress me. I decided I should at least try to give him another chance. When we reached the dirt road turnoff that led to the castle, Lev used additional caution, moving the car forward at a pace that was even slower than the tractor that had blocked our way. “Don’t want to scratch her,” Lev told me. “Her paint’s barely dry.” “Gee!” Lilly exclaimed when the castle finally came into view. “It’s just so massive.” I turned in my seat to look at her. It occurred to me that my sister probably hadn’t seen the castle much since the first day when the family had headed down to watch the barges come in. Or, if she’d gone with Papa, she’d been too busy daydreaming about Walter to notice any progress the workers had made. She wrinkled her nose. “It’s not very pretty, though.” “Most castles weren’t built to be beautiful,” Lev told her. “They were built to withstand a siege.” And then he added, “There are some pretty castles in Bavaria, though. My uncle travelled there when I was a kid and he sent me a lot of postcards. Really magical stuff. Straight out of the fairytales.” Thinking it over for a few seconds, he added, “I’d like to travel there one day.” My opinion of Lev was growing by leaps and bounds. But then he had to go and ruin it all by saying, “I’m descended from royal blood, of course.” No one in the car made a response to his comment. It just sounded like such a ridiculous exaggeration that I thought it would be better to ignore it. “If I showed my face in Europe, they’d probably try to clap a crown on my head,” Lev told us, just to make matters worse. “Is that what they did to your uncle?” Walter asked, causing my sister to giggle. “Well, he was invited to visit many of the royal houses,” Lev snapped, unwilling to just let it go. “Royalty recognizes royalty, even if it’s a distant connection.” I had promised myself to just sit there and bide my time through the date, but it was just too much. I really couldn’t let Lev keep bragging like he was next in line for the throne of England. “So what’s your lineage?” I asked him. “What?” Lev gave me a sharp look. “What is your heritage?” I wanted to know. “Which royal families are you descended from and how did you end up here, in America?” “That’s right, Lev,” Walter jeered. “Tell us your family tree.” The sunlight was almost gone, but I could see Lev growing pink under the collar. “I’ll have to ask my grandfather,” he said in a clenched voice. “He’s the family historian.” “Let’s get out and walk around a little before the sun goes completely down,” I suggested, in part to end the conversation and in part because I wanted to see if any of the Italian workmen were still lingering around the castle. “Sure,” Walter agreed. “Lev, why don’t you knock on the door? Introduce yourself. Let them know who you are.” “Alright, cut out the smart talk,” Lev growled, flashing his friend a menacing look. The smile quickly faded from Walter’s face. “Yeah. Sorry,” he said. “I was just joshing you.”",

      "content": "Prologue Jessie I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. Chapter 1 Colette “But it’s not fair,” Lilly insisted, her face a little flushed from trying to make her point. “How am I supposed to find a husband, if I can’t even go out on one date?” “Well,” Papa said, letting his voice drag a little as if he was giving the whole thing a lot of thought, “there’s what’s fair and there’s what’s right. I’m choosing to raise you girls with what’s right.” Lilly was not to be so easily defeated. “Tons of girls get married right out of high school and you won’t even let me go out on a date. Dorothy Smiley is engaged and she’s Lettie’s age,” she pointed out. “She’s only sixteen.” Mama and Papa were quiet for a moment, both frowning to themselves. Papa’s eyes shifted toward his wife. Mama cleared her throat. “Those are special circumstances,” she said, looking at the table instead of her daughter. “I don’t think Dorothy Smiley is a good example of how I want to raise my children.” I could tell by the way Mama folded her hands that she wasn’t going to speak any more about that topic, although I wasn’t sure why. Dorothy was a local girl who was always very popular with the boys. I think she’d been dating since she was fourteen. Whenever I saw her about town, she was always laughing and chatting with a bunch of boys clustered around her. They were drawn to her like bees to a flower. “But I’m graduating in just a few months. Don’t you think that most girls should have gone out on at least one date before they graduate from high school?” Papa gave her a stern look. “I’m never thought of my daughters as ‘most girls’ and I doubt I ever will.” “But Walter Bennett is really nice,” Lilly said, persisting in her cause. “He’s stopped by Zucker’s a bunch of times now and he’s always been perfectly polite.” My sister worked a few afternoons a week at the local five and dime. I knew that her prospective beau had come in several times under the excuse of needing one thing or another. He never spent much money, but he sure did take his time about shopping for whatever he needed. “How a boy behaves when he’s out in public and how he behaves when he’s alone with a girl can be two very different things,” Mama insisted. “But…” Lilly drew breath to continue her argument. Papa’s hand came down flat on the table. He didn’t bang it down like when he was angry about a client trying not to pay his bill, but I could tell his temper was starting to rise. “In my day, no nice girl would be seen out with a boy, unless she had a proper chaperone,” Mama said, trying to head-off Papa’s growing annoyance. A thought occurred to her. “Maybe that’s the solution?” “A chaperone?” Lilly all but wailed. “Mother, no one has a chaperone these days.” “Well I’m not letting this young pup come a courting without one,” Papa growled. I had to fight not to smile. No one said, “come a courting” anymore, as far as I knew. “No dear, that’s not what I meant,” Mama said, putting a gentle hand on her husband’s forearm. “I meant that my real objection to Lilly going out with this Walter fellow is that I don’t want her to be on her own with a boy she only knows from the five and dime.” Then Mama directed her gaze across the table toward me. “Maybe if Lettie was to accompany them. And they didn’t go anywhere in a car. They could always walk down to the diner for a soda.” Oh, great. Now I was being dragged into the mix. The last thing I wanted was to be a third wheel on my sister’s first official date with a boy. Lilly immediately turned to look at me, hope glowing in her eyes. “That could work,” she said, all too eagerly. “I’m sorry, but I think I’d feel very awkward,” I told them. I could just imagine sitting at the counter, reading a book and feeling like the whole town was pitying me as the poor, dateless sister of Lillian Gibson. “It wouldn’t be awkward,” Lilly insisted. “We’d include you in everything, I promise.” I knew my sister had every intention of making me feel comfortable and included on this hypothetical date, but I’d seen her flirting with Walter across the counter top. When he was around, she didn’t have eyes for anyone else. I even knew that Mr. Zucker had scolded her more than once for taking too long with only one customer while other people were waiting. “Well, what if it were to be a double date?” Mama suggested. “No,” Papa said, flatly. “Lilly is only sixteen.” “She’ll be seventeen soon enough,” Mama reminded him. “And we can’t keep our girls locked in the house forever. Even if we tried, the young men would eventually start crawling up the drainpipes to flirt with them.” I began to get nervous that both my parents were warming to the idea. “I’m afraid I don’t know anyone who would want to come along,” I hurriedly told them all. I didn’t have any particular boy who was a friend and it would be too embarrassing to ask a boy from school. I put my hand to my cheek, blushing at the mere thought of it. “Oh, I’m sure Walter has lots of nice friends,” Lilly said, practically bouncing in her chair. “I know there are tons of boys who would be happy to come along.” Then she added as an afterthought, “We could always do something to fix your hair,” My hands immediately flew to my hair. Had it already struggled out of its bun? My hair was a raucous gathering of curls and it never behaved the way I intended. “I meant we could tame it with hair tonic or something,” Lilly quickly added. I could tell she hadn’t meant to be unkind. “I…” I stammered. I knew Lilly desperately wanted to go on her date, and I hated to disappoint her, but the thought of being fixed up with a boy who had no desire to be out with me in the first place made me cringe. “I’m sorry, but I really don’t want to go,” I said, pushing my chair away from the dining room table. “And I have some homework to do before going to bed,” I told them before hurrying away, grateful that the dishes had already been cleared. I knew that if I sat there any longer then Lilly would persuade me into going. And that was the very last thing I wanted to do. I hurried upstairs, but not before I caught more of my father’s conversation. “I think your mother has a very good point,” he said to his eldest daughter. “No matter how much I dislike it, you girls are growing up. So you can go on your date…” “Oh Papa,” Lilly exclaimed, clapping her hands with excitement. “Wait, let me finish,” father said in his sternest voice. “You can only go if your sister accompanies you.” “Oh,” Lilly said, sounding more than a little forlorn. I hurried up the stairs before I could hear any more. It’s not that I didn’t want to see my sister happy. There was actually nothing I wouldn’t do for her. But I was pretty sure that she’d be able to convince our mother and father that she would be just as safe with one of her friends on a double date as she would with me. I probably should have been excited about the prospect of a double date, but I wasn’t. I liked boys well enough, I just didn’t happen to have a crush on any particular boy. Truth be told, I probably spent too much time reading Austen and the Brontes. I daydreamed of a love much bigger and more passionate that anything I imagined a local boy could provide. I closed the door to the room I shared with Lilly and then went over to perch on the cream colored dressing chair that I kept by the window. The window faced the backyard and I liked to pull open the curtains and sit there, gazing over the open fields behind our property. There had been quite a bit of construction in our little town of Tiburon, Ohio before the market crashed. But when the stocks all dropped, so did the building trade. At least it kept our home from being crowded by too many neighbors. Many of my free hours were spent looking out that window and thinking of my future. Where would I be in ten years? Would I still be in Tiburon, happily married and raising a family? Or did the world have more in store for me? The way the tree branches in our backyard swayed and waved let me know that the evening had turned quite breezy. The warm weather would find us eventually, but it wouldn’t be for another few weeks at the least. I heard Lilly coming up the stairs. She wasn’t exactly stomping her feet, — that’s something Papa would never allow — but I could tell she was unhappy. She said nothing as she came into our room. As a matter of fact, she took great pains to close the door very quietly. I turned toward her as she came in, but she wouldn’t look at me. “I’m sorry,” I said as she began brushing her hair in front of the vanity table that we shared. “I’m sure Mama and Papa would let you go on a double date with Betty Schaffer. Or maybe cousin Irene.” Our cousin was older and had been on lots of dates, so that felt like a safe bet. Lilly stopped her brushing and looked at me through the mirror’s reflection. “I already asked and Papa said no. He’s convinced that the only girl who will truly look out for my well being is you.” I had to wonder why our father was being so cautious. Neither of us girls had ever done anything to cause him any concern. We were conscientious at school and we did as we were told when home. Lilly even had a part time job and I one set up for over the summer. But I guess it was hard for him to accept that we were turning from girls into young women. At least that’s what Mama usually said. Walking across the room, I pulled my flannel nightgown off the hook on the back of the door. It was an evening to wear wool socks to bed. I thought I might get in a bit of reading before turning out the light. I still had some math problems to solve and a chapter of American history to go over, but I figured I could do that in the morning before school. “Won’t you please agree to come on a double date with me?” Lilly asked rather abruptly as I was climbing into bed with a book tucked under my arm. “You can borrow any of my things that you want. Anytime, without even asking. And I promise that Walter will fix you up with one of his really handsome friends. And I’ll help fix your hair and I’ll do the dishes all by myself for a month, you won’t even have to help me.” She was promising so much, I couldn’t help but giggle. It was obvious that she wanted this date with Walter more than she cared about me borrowing her tortoise shell combs or snagging her only pair of silk stockings. “Oh, alright,” I finally said, completely capitulating. “If it means that much to you.” “Really?” Lilly leapt to her feet. “You’ll really go?” “Yes, I’ll really go,” I told her, no matter how much I didn’t want to. “Oh, Colette,” Lilly exclaimed, rushing over to my bed and throwing her arms around me. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she said, kissing my cheek. “You’re the best sister ever.” In a burst of joy she did a twirl while crossing the room to snatch her nightgown off the hook. “I can’t wait to tell Walter.” Chapter 2 Jessie “You can’t be serious,” Daniel exclaimed, rising abruptly from his chair and nearly tipping it over in the process. “Ship the whole damn thing to America? Really, Grandfather, I think you’ve gone a bit mad.” “I assure you, my sanity is as sound as it’s ever been,” our grandfather growled, glaring across the table at my older brother. “And I am quite serious. I’ve made up my mind.” Doing his best to suppress his outrage, my brother dropped back into his chair and tried to compose himself. “Don’t you think the mortals might notice if a medieval castle suddenly sprang up in the middle of Manhattan? It might lead to a few questions, you know.” “That’s why we’re not moving to Manhattan,” our grandfather informed the family in general. My mother, Daniel, my younger sister Emily, and I were all sitting with him around our dining room table. “We’re staying out of New York altogether,” Grandfather announced. “You have to be joking.” Daniel was incredulous. “Are we moving to the wild to live with the savages? I guess we’d better remember to ship the moat. We’re going to need it.” “There’s more to America than just New York and the great plains,” our mother said in a calm voice that I knew she hoped was soothing. I suspected she had anticipated her father’s announcement to leave Budapest, so it didn’t come as much of a shock. “I’ve read that spots in the Midwest of America are quite developed now and can be remarkably lovely.” Daniel flashed Mother a look. “You don’t always have to take his side.” It wasn’t Mother’s habit to take her father’s side, but she did know how to pick her battles. This was one she probably knew she would lose, so she didn’t intend to fight. That or she had something else in mind and she was waiting to see how things played out. “But there isn’t even any society in America.” Daniel was not giving up so easily. “At least not our kind of society.” “There are more of our kind in America than you realize,” Grandfather informed him. “And there are more moving there every day. With Hitler grabbing for power, I think a great many of our kind will be leaving Europe in the next year or two.” “Oh.” Daniel appeared mollified. “You didn’t say we were going to be moving to an undead enclave. If we have our friends around us, then that will be different.” “I will not make our family a target by moving to an undead enclave,” Grandfather said flatly. “In fact, we’re moving to where no mortal would ever think to look for vampires.” “You can’t be serious!” Daniel said again, even though our grandfather was not a man who tended to make jokes. Laying both hands flat on the table, Grandfather looked Daniel square in the eye. “You are welcome to stay here,” he said. “But let me be clear about one thing. If you choose to stay, you will be cut off from the family without a cent.” His threat did the trick. There was no way in the world Daniel would be willing to give up his share of the Vanderlind fortune. That wasn’t in his nature. There was nothing he loved more than wealth and the power it brought. I knew this without a doubt. Daniel had been married once, not so many years ago, but when he was still mortal. His wife, Anna, had been a lovely girl who seemed to sincerely love him, for whatever reason. But she accidentally discovered our grandfather’s dark secret; the disease which he had methodically spread to his own children, accidentally killing one of his daughters in the process. Anna had wanted to flee the castle with her husband. She was convinced it was better to live a life of poverty than to make a deal with the devil. But Daniel had other ideas. He’d only been persuaded to marry her in order to procreate while he was still a mortal. Grandfather put great stock in not letting the Vanderlind line dwindle. But instead of escaping from evil with his wife, Daniel dragged Anna before our grandfather. I was barely sixteen, but I was convinced Grandfather would kill my sister-in-law. I went to confront him and did my best to save Anna, only to receive his disdain. “You’ve always been soft on mortals,” Grandfather told me, obviously disgusted by my compassion. “I happen to be a mortal,” I informed him, with all the bravery and ignorance that a sixteen year old boy could muster. “For the moment,” he informed me. “But your time will come, so enjoy your foolish mortal emotions while you can.” I knew that transforming into the undead could easily twist a human from a being filled with compassion to a creature filled with hate. I sincerely hoped that fate would not befall me when my time came to be transformed. Grandfather became a creature of the night at the age of twenty-four and he decided it was the ideal age for any vampire. So when each of his children turned twenty-four, he turned them, whether they wanted to be vampires or not. And he intended to do the same for his grandchildren; an event that Daniel looked forward to with great anticipation, but one that I dreaded. Grandfather arranged for all of his children to marry into wealth in order to expand our already sizeable family fortune, but the spouses of his offspring were not considered worthy enough to be transformed into the undead. My uncle’s wife and my own father had both mysteriously disappeared soon after my mother and uncle were made. The spouse of my aunt who had died during transformation also disappeared under mysterious circumstances, but he took his luggage and quite a bit of my aunt’s jewelry with him. After Daniel betrayed his wife, Grandfather decided to temporarily spare Anna’s life, although she essentially became a prisoner in the castle. She was to bare Daniel a few children before Grandfather would decide it was time for her demise. But Anna denied her husband any offspring by hanging herself from a chandelier a few months after her discovery of our family’s dark secret. Daniel was furious, but I admired her for her convictions. My brother never took another wife. When his maker’s day came, he was still childless. This greatly displeased Grandfather, but he turned Daniel anyway, deciding it would be up to Emily and me to keep the Vanderlind line alive. “Will our Uncle be moving with us?” my little sister screwed up the courage to ask as we all sat around the dining table, glaring at one another. She was madly devoted to our cousin Dorian, with that unique fervor of little girls. “Your Uncle will finish up business here before coming over. That should only take a year or two,” was Grandfather’s reply. But that didn’t exactly provide an answer to Emily’s real question. “What about Dorian?” I asked, deciding to help her out. “Will he be making the voyage with us or will he stay here and cross with his father?” Grandfather made a small, guttural sound in the back of his throat. “I haven’t decided yet on the safest place to keep your cousin.” Cousin Dorian was only a little older than I was, but he already had a keen eye for the ladies. It was all Grandfather could do to keep him from causing a scandal. “I still say this is all nonsense,” Daniel grumbled. “This is a big decision and I think it should be open to family discussion.” “You can think whatever you want,” Grandfather informed him. “But I’ve already purchased the land in America and the workmen will be arriving tomorrow to start dismantling the castle. I’ve already instructed Mrs. Denkler to oversee the servants while they pack up the household.” “Where are we going?” Mother asked. “Where is it in America that we are all moving to?” Grandfather leaned back in his chair, folded his hands, and smiled with some satisfaction. He was handsome, in a brutish short of way, and he appeared no older than his daughter, who appeared no older than her eldest son. “A nice little town in Ohio,” he assured us. “Right on the shore of the Tiburon River.” Chapter 3 Colette “They’re using only workers they’re bringing over from Europe,” my father grumbled from behind his newspaper as I sat down to breakfast the next morning. “I can’t believe that not one man from Tiburon is going to earn an honest day’s pay for that monstrosity they’re building on the edge of town.” “I’m not sure that warrants calling it a monstrosity,” mother said, trying her best to coax him back into a good mood as she served eggs and toast. “I hear that it’s an entire castle they’re moving from Hungary stone by stone. That sounds very exciting to me. I’ve always wanted to see a castle.” “I wonder why they’re moving here.” I couldn’t help but say aloud. “Europe is getting to be a real mess,” my father informed me. “That Hitler fellow is starting to cause all sorts of problems. I wouldn’t be surprised if that had something to do with it.” I was sure my father was right, but that wasn’t exactly what I meant. My question had more to do with why a wealthy family living in a cosmopolitan city like Budapest would then decide to move to the outskirts of a small town in the middle of Ohio. It wasn’t the first place I would choose to live if I had enough money to ship an entire castle all the way over from Europe. Lilly came hurrying into the breakfast room and slipped into her seat. Papa glanced at his watch. “Cutting it a bit close, aren’t you?” he asked. “I had trouble sleeping last night so it was hard to get up this morning,” she told him. That may have been true. I’d slept like a stone, so I couldn’t say for sure. But I also knew that Lilly had spent extra time in front of the mirror this morning, making sure her hair was perfect. She was going straight to her job at Zucker’s after school and I was sure she had plans for Walter to meet her there. “You’re not coming down with anything, I hope,” Mama said, reaching across the table to lay a hand on Lilly’s cheek. “You’re not warm, but you look a little flushed.” “I’m just excited,” Lilly told her. “Lettie’s agreed to go, so I’m going to have my first date with Walter.” Papa gave me surprised look. “Is that true, Colette?” “Yes,” I admitted. “Lilly talked me into it.” “Oh,” Papa said with a frown. I got the feeling he had been counting on me not giving in and so his plan of keeping his daughters from dating had backfired. “That’s very nice of you,” Mama told me, not glancing in her husband’s direction. “But we are expecting both of you to behave very responsibly on this date and not let it go to your heads.” “We won’t, Mama,” Lilly quickly assured her. As far as I knew, the date was just to be Walter and a friend escorting us to the diner for a soda and then home again. I couldn’t see how drinking a soda while sitting at the counter of Top’s Diner could go to anyone’s head. Lilly had to hurry through breakfast or we were going to be late. Tiburon didn’t have anything as fancy as a school bus, so Lilly and I had to walk to the high school when the weather was fine. Papa would give us a lift if it was too cold or wet to walk, but it had to be awfully cold or very, very wet for that to be deemed necessary. As we headed toward school, Lilly was practically dancing on air. She linked her arm through mine and skipped along. “Lettie, have I told you how much I love you?” she asked. “You’re the best sister ever.” I had to laugh. “Would you be saying that if I hadn’t agreed to chaperone your date?” My sister pretended to think it over. “Well, I would still love you, I suppose, but you’d probably lose the title of best sister.” By the time Lilly came home from her job that evening and we’d all sat down for supper, things were practically settled with Walter. “He’s going to ask his friend Lev Wilson,” she told the family as we ate. “And if Lev is free, we’re going out on Friday night.” I felt my stomach drop a little. It was already Wednesday. I didn’t think my first date with a boy would be thrust upon me so quickly. “Lev Wilson,” Papa repeated, mulling the name over. “Didn’t he used to be on the football team for Tiburon High?” “Yes, I think he was the quarterback or something a few years ago,” Lilly told him. “Walter said that he was offered a scholarship to Notre Dame, but that his father had a heart attack the summer before he was going to start so he couldn’t go.” “I remember hearing something about that,” Papa said as he cut his meat. “Sounds like he’s a boy with good values; not abandoning his family like that.” “I’m sure all of Walter’s friends are very nice,” Lilly was quick to assure him. I wondered if that was because things weren’t confirmed with Lev and Lilly didn’t want to jeopardize the date, if I should have to be escorted by another boy. “The boat for the castle is arriving early tomorrow morning,” Papa said, abruptly changing the topic. He probably didn’t want to linger over thoughts of his daughters actually going out on a double date. “I just found out Bill Galler out of Akron is going to oversee the day laborers that were hired to help out.” “We should all drive over early and take a look,” Mama suggested. “And then we could drop the girls at school.” Papa rubbed his chin. “I would like to see what they’re up to,” he mused. “Bill says the pay is pretty good. Men are driving in from as far as Columbus.” “Good,” Mama said, a small smirk playing across her lips that her husband was now interested in seeing the monstrosity. “It’s settled then.” Our father had a professional interest in the assembling of the castle. He ran a small construction company and had built several of the larger houses and a few of the businesses around town. When the market crashed, his business shrunk down to building garages and assembling houses that people had order from the Sears & Roebuck catalog. But he’d built our lovely home himself, and the property was paid for, so we were better off than most, although we did have to keep our day-to-day living lean. There were butterflies in my belly as I climbed into bed that evening and they weren’t about the fast approaching double date. I was excited about the castle. It just sounded so romantic; I couldn’t help but wonder who would live there. Did they have any children? And if yes, would those children attend Tiburon High? It seemed incongruous for someone who lived in a real European castle to simply go to the local high school. I was pretty sure if there were any children living at the castle, they would probably have tutors or attend boarding school. When it was time to get up extra early the next morning, I did not want to leave my bed. Not because I wasn’t excited about my day, but because I was having the most wonderful dream and I didn’t want to let it go. There was a boy who was tall and handsome with dark hair and pale skin. He had me wrapped in his arms and he was trying to say something to me, something wonderful. But then there was Lilly, shaking my arm. “It’s time to get up,” she told me. “If you want to miss seeing the boats bringing in the stones for the castle, then go right on sleeping.” I scrambled out of bed and hurried to get ready. But as I dressed for the day, I tried to cling to the fragments that I could remember from my dream. It was just too wonderful not to savor. But it quickly faded, as dreams usually do, and I was left with just a vague yearning for a boy who I would probably never meet. The Tiburon River ran to the south of the town and the castle was to be reassembled on its northern bank. It was officially a river, but not a very mighty one. There was no way for a cargo ship massive enough to make a transatlantic voyage to sail down the waterway. So the stones of the castle were offloaded from the ship somewhere out east and loaded onto railcars. At some point they were then loaded onto shallow-bottomed barges that usually traversed the Ohio River and wended their way to the Tiburon River. And eventually the pieces and parts of the castle reached Tiburon. Papa drove the car down a dirt road. Eventually the road petered out so we had to walk about a quarter of a mile after that to get to the river. The barges had already arrived and were lined up along the bank ten deep. Working the barges were dozens of men, covered in grime, with dark, ruddy faces and fierce bright eyes shouting to each other in a language that was unrecognizable to me. Local men swarmed the landing where the stones were being offloaded. A couple of large platforms with winches had been erected on the land to transfer the large stones, some of which were as small as a child’s Radio Flyer red wagon. Other stones were as large as large as a Model T. The stones were a uniform dark gray in color and each was tagged with a number in bright red paint. I assumed that was so the workers would know how to put the castle back together again. A massive foundation had already been dug into the ground about thirty yards from where the barges were being unloaded. Men were standing in a long line, passing stones about the size of a pound of flour hand-over-hand into the foundation like firemen passing buckets to quench a fire. My father’s friend, Bill Galler, was standing near the edge of the foundation, so Papa strode over to speak to him. Mama, Lilly and I followed in his wake. We knew nothing about the workings of a construction site beyond to stay out of the way. That was a lesson our father had made clear since we were very little girls. “How’s it going, Bill?” Papa asks, shaking the other man’s hand with a firm grip. “Seems like half of Columbus must have come up here today. Where’s everybody sleeping.?” “There’s a small tent city on the other side of the woods,” Bill told him. “A couple of tents for Americans and then another one for the foreigners.” “Why didn’t they hire more local men from here in Tiburon, if you don’t mind me asking?” Papa inquired, not sounding pleased, but not sounding angry either. “Don’t know,” Mr. Galler said, taking off his hat and wiping his brow, even though it was a chilly morning. “I was as surprised as anyone when I got the call offering me the job.” After thinking it over he said, “It might be my name. Galler is Hungarian, you know. My family came over about fifty years ago. We don’t think much about the connection anymore, but that might be it. Or maybe I just got lucky.” Clapping my father on the shoulder, he said, “Either way, I’m sure it wasn’t an intentional snub on you. Or anyone in Tiburon,” he added. “Sure looks like you have your work cut out for you,” Papa said, surveying the line of men moving the smaller stones. “What’s going on with this foundation?” “It’s a dungeon, if you can believe it,” Mr. Galler told him, causing Lilly and I to exchange quick looks. “It’s a real honest-to-goodness medieval castle and those things usually came with a dungeon back in the day. At least that’s my understanding.” “I hope they don’t intend to use it as one now,” Papa said, taking a few steps closer to the massive hole and peering around. “Not that I know of,” Mr. Galler told him. “There’s not a lot of communication on this end, but my understanding is that it’s to be used for storage.” He put his hat back on his head. “That or as guests bedrooms.” When my father gave him a questioning look, he cracked into a smile. His comment made Papa chuckle. “Well, I suppose if they’re trying to keep things historically accurate then they have to put in the dungeon.” He rubbed his chin. “As a matter of fact, I may have a use for it.” When Mr. Galler gave him a curious look, he added, “A couple of young fellows are taking out my daughters on Friday night.” “Well I don’t blame them boys,” Mr. Galler said, shooting us a smile over his shoulder and tipping his hat to our mother. “Your girls have turned out quite pretty. I’m sure there are many young men here about who would like to have that honor.” “Speaking of our girls, I believe we’d better get going,” Mama said, interjecting herself into the conversation. “We don't want them to be late for school.” Papa looked reluctant to leave the bustle of the worksite. “Would you mind taking them over there on your own, Lillian?” he asked. My older sister had been name after our mother. “I’d sure like to stick around awhile.” He looked at Mr. Galler. “If you don’t mind, Bill.” “Be happy to have you,” Mr. Galler said. “I’ve never worked on anything this big before. I guess this is the closest I’ll ever get to erecting a skyscraper in New York City.” “Fine with me,” Mama said, trying to keep the glee from her voice. She loved any reason to drive the car when our father wasn’t around. And, with things being so slow for his work, Papa was around more often than not. “Should I swing back to pick you up before lunch?” Papa cast a questioning eye in Mr. Galler’s direction. “My wife came down with me to stay a few weeks,” was the man’s reply. “She always packs my pail with enough food for three men.” “How about I just swing by before I get super started?” Mama asked, smiling at the two men. Papa was downplaying it all, but it was obvious he was as excited about the construction of the castle as some men get about a new car. “That’ll be fine, Lillian,” Papa said. “Come along, girls,” Mama said, putting an arm around Lilly and the other around me. “We’d better hurry or you’ll be tardy.” We turned to start heading back to the car. I really would have rather stayed and watched the men work, than sit staring at the blackboard while Mr. Wilmore droned on about the quadratic formula, but I knew I would never be allowed to stay. Still, as we left, I felt a great longing to know more about the castle and its future inhabitance. “Please, Mr. Galler,” I said, quickly ducking back around. “What is the name of the family who is going to live here?” Mr. Galler smiled. He seemed like a very genial man. “Vanderlind, I believe,” he told me. As far as I know, the family’s name is Vanderlind.” “Vanderlind,” I said to myself as I turned to catch up with my mother and sister. The name had a dashing quality to it, like a character written by Sir Walter Scott. I couldn’t help but glance back over my shoulder again to catch another glimpse of the massive stones being moved ashore for the construction of the Vanderlind Castle. Chapter 4 Jessie “I want you to glean as much information as you can about this move from your grandfather,” Mother said in a low voice as she pretended to straighten my tie. “Don’t make it obvious, but listen whenever you can.” It was the night after Grandfather had dropped his bombshell about the move. One of the other vampire families was throwing a ball and we had dressed accordingly. “What kind of information?” I asked her, also keeping my voice low. My tie was already perfect; the adjustment of it was just a pretense. My mother gave just the hint of a shrug. “Anything.” she said. “Where is it? That would be good for a start. I can’t even find Tiburon, Ohio on a map. And who is in charge of the construction? Any details about the town or the voyage would be helpful. Just tell me anything you hear.” “I think Mrs. Denkler will probably know more about that than anyone,” I told her. Mrs. Denkler was the castle house keeper and seemed to know more about our family than was normally healthy for a mortal. Grandfather trusted her implicitly, which was saying a lot. He’d even offered to turn her a few times, but she’d refused. “If you’d only made me the offer when I was still young and beautiful,” she would always tell him, “then I would have jumped at the chance.” There seemed to be a steady supply of mortals in Europe who were willing to work for the undead — I didn’t know if that was because they were hoping to become undead themselves or because vampires usually paid a little better — but Mrs. Denkler showed a devotion to our family that was above and beyond ordinary mortal loyalty. “You know that Denkie has always been my father’s agent,” Mother said, ruining the shape of the tie just so she would have to wrap it again. I nodded. She was right. “I’ll keep my ears open,” I assured her. “And…” Mother hesitated for a moment. “No words about this to your brother or Emily. Let’s just keep this conversation between us.” “Understood,” I said with a nod. “Now you look extra handsome,” Mother said in a brighter voice, stepping back to admire her handy work. “I can only imagine how well you’ll look once you’ve been turned. There won’t be a girl in the New World who can resist your charms.” I always felt awkward when anyone made a joke about me chasing after girls. I was old enough to find the opposite sex very appealing, but I wasn’t exactly “girl crazy”. Or at least that was how my cousin Dorian was frequently described. What I truly wanted — and wasn’t willing to ever admit aloud — was someone to love and cherish with every fiber of my heart. And to know in my soul that the girl felt the same way about me. But, given the circumstances of my family, I doubted I would ever have the opportunity to fall in love. Unless I could find a way to escape my grandfather’s clutches and elude the family curse. I was only seventeen, so at least I still had a few years to try. As we planned our transatlantic voyage, Mother was adamant that Mrs. Denkler book everyone separate cabins, using different names for each member of the family. Grandfather was reluctant. “That would be like saying we’re ashamed to be Vanderlinds,” he insisted. I assumed that Grandfather was only being stubborn because using separate cabins was someone else’s idea. “But just think, Father,” our mother implored him. “If one of us was to be accidentally discovered, the whole family could be wiped out.” Shaking her head and frowning, she added, “No. The more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that we must take separate cabins. I wouldn’t even be opposed to separate ships.” But on this point, Grandfather was firm. He could see the sense in the family having separate cabins and traveling under assumed names — travel documents were easy enough to have forged — but he would not hear of separate ships. Eventually Mother had to concede. I said nothing to anyone, but I had the strong suspicion that all our mother really wanted was the separate cabins. She brought up the separate ships so that her father would have something to rail against and feel satisfied. It was finally settled that Emily and I, being the only two family members who still remained mortal, would travel together under the Vanderlind name. The rest of the family would travel under different assumed names. We would not associate with each other except by the most casual of meetings. My uncle and cousin would follow later, once all the business of the Vanderlind estate was settled. Arranging for the boat was actually the easiest things to organize when compared to the numerous tasks necessary for our move to America. It was all well and good for my grandfather to announce that we were leaving for America, but orchestrating the move was a monumental task. First we Vandlerinds had to decide on the necessities we needed for the next several months. Our essentials were packed and transported to a large estate that Grandfather had rented. Then the servants had to pack their own possessions and join us. After that the entire contents of the castle was packed and stored in a warehouse. That made room for several architects, carpenters and electricians to come in and take apart the rooms that had been modernized with wood floors, also removing the doors, woodwork and light fixtures. After that the stone masons came in, numbering every single stone that comprised the castle so it could be disassembled. The top stones of the castle were sent to a warehouse while the bottom stones of the structure were loaded onto numerous freight trains. They crossed several countries before being loaded onto a massive cargo ship that headed out across the Adriatic and on its way to America. It was unsettling to see the hole where the castle had sat for the last couple of centuries, like viewing the gap left after a tooth has been ripped from the mouth of a giant. But there was hardly time to reflect upon our departure due to an absurd number of bon voyage parties that were thrown in our honor. There were parties in the country with horseback riding and polo. There were parties in the city on rooftops that could only be accessed by the air. All mortals had to be carried up by the undead. There was even an elaborate banquet in the catacombs under Buda Castle followed by dancing. Each of our undead hosts did his or her best to outshine the previous party. I began to feel that the parties had started to spiral out of control in terms of ostentation. The entire experience of having our friends wish us farewell was rather exhausting. Especially for a mortal like me, because the parties usually ran until just before dawn. As one of the guests of honor, it would have been considered the height of bad manners for me not to stay until the bitter end. The months of constant bacchanal probably explained why, when an outbreak of scarlet fever ravaged through the streets of Budapest, I was quick to be overpowered by the malady. Chapter 5 Colette It turned out that Lev Wilson was available Friday night and the double date was arranged. Lilly was behind the moon. My feelings were more reserved. I just couldn’t imagine what I would have to talk about with a young man of twenty who worked doing… I couldn’t even remember what he did for a living. That’s how little I was interested in the date. “You don’t actually have to say that much,” Lilly told me as we were getting ready and I expressed my concerns. “All you really have to do is smile, be pleasant and listen when he talks. You can do that much, can’t you?” “I’m sure I can,” I assured her, but the very idea of just smiling and nodding at a young man made me dread the date even more. I knew there were plenty of girls at school who would laugh their heads off whenever a boy said anything even remotely funny, but I couldn’t bring myself to be so mindless. Why should I pretend a boy is interesting or charming or intelligent when he’s not? It seemed to me that just gave the male half of the species a false sense of superiority. Of course this wasn’t something I could say to most girls or they would stare at me like I’d lost my mind. “Questioning a boy’s intelligence is no way to land a husband,” a friend’s older sister once told me when a few of us had been invited to their house for a sleep-over and I had brought up my thoughts on the subject. The only person I could really share my feelings about wanting more out of life than to be a wife and mother was my friend Lois. She was top in our class. She even had her father petition the school so that she could enroll in some of the advanced science and early engineering classes that girls were usually discouraged from taking. She’d already been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and they barely accepted any women. We’d talked about me moving with her to Cambridge and getting an apartment together when she started college. I was sure I could probably find work as a secretary somewhere. My typing skills were quite good. But Lois was also madly in love with a fellow student, Laurence, who was nearly as smart as her. I had a feeling they would get married after graduation and start their collegiate careers as husband and wife. Lilly spent almost as much time taming my hair for our double date than she did fixing her own. Most women tried to get a wave into their hair while I was constantly battling my waves for fear they would upset a ship or two. “You’re just so very pretty,” Lilly said, once she was finished styling my hair and was gazing over my shoulder at our reflections in our dressing table mirror. “I think I’m half afraid to introduce you to Walter. He might like you best.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her, knowing that she was teasing. “I’m sure your beau won’t even notice me.” Lilly broke into a smile. “I hope you’re right.” I decided to wear my favorite green dress with the little white flowers on it. The cotton fabric was too light for the chilly evenings we were still experiencing, but I’d outgrown my heavier plum-colored dress and didn’t have much else to wear. Lilly was dressed quite smartly and I felt I should at least try to match her appearance. It would look odd if she was in a dress and I was just wearing a wool skirt and sweater. At the last minute, Lilly misplaced one of her favorite gloves and you would have thought she’s lost a diamond ring, the way she savaged our room looking for it. I finally discovered that it was still in the pocket of her coat. She’d overlooked it in her haste. Walter and Lev arrived promptly at six thirty, their skin well scrubbed and their hair filled with so much oil that I knew mother was afraid to ask them to sit down for fear they’d leave two matching stains on back of the couch. Many women tatted doilies for their couches just to protect them from such a menace. My sister was telling the truth when she said Lev was handsome. He had a strong chin and a defined brow. He looked just like a fictional football hero, which was what he had actually been only a few years earlier. I had no interest in sports, but I could see he was a very muscular young man and I thought I remembered seeing him around town, usually followed by a swarm of giggling girls. In a way, that made me feel better. If Lev had the attention of a lot of females, then there was no fear of him becoming interested in me as a potential sweetheart. I was sure he was probably perfectly nice, but a sporty-type of beau didn’t interest me in the least. I did notice that a few of the knuckles on Lev’s hands had plasters on them. He kept his hands clasped discretely behind his back most of the time. I scanned my memory again for what kind of work he did, but came up with nothing. Whatever it was, a few abrasions would probably teach him to remember his work gloves. March had come in like a lion and stayed that way. I could tell Lilly was reluctant to bundle up and run the risk of wrinkling her immaculately ironed dress, but she did it without voicing a complaint under the watchful eye of our mother. I layered a sweater over my green dress before adding my coat. I saw no reason to come down with a cold just because my sister had a crush. Finally we were out the door and heading toward town. The Gibson house wasn’t exactly in the country, but we were definitely on the outskirts of town so we had a bit of a walk ahead of us. That didn’t matter; Lilly and I were used to the exercise. Lilly and Walter took the lead, walking side-by-side and rather close together. Lev kept his pace even with mine and began talking, so I did my part to try to listen. His conversation seemed to focus mostly on football, which made listening more of a challenge. I had no idea why anyone would be so interested in a bunch of grown men running up and down a field chasing after a ball. It’s seemed oddly childish to me, as if Lev still enjoyed playing with blocks or flying paper airplanes. But he didn’t ask me any questions, so it was easy enough to pretend to be interested. All I had to do was nod every few sentences and to smile whenever he paused to look in my direction. But I did find it remarkably rude that Lev had not taken the trouble to ask me one question about myself. I knew I was just a girl in high school, so chances were good I didn’t have too much to say that a man of twenty would find interesting, but good manners seemed to dictate that he at least try to ask me about myself. Seated at the counter at Top’s, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Everyone but me, of course. Lilly and Walter were laughing and chatting and generally making themselves cozy. Lev stopped yammering at one point and took a long pull on his soda. I could easily imagine that his throat was dry. I felt it was probably my turn to say something, but I really hadn’t been paying enough attention to keep our current thread of conversation going. So I decided I might as well bring up something I found interesting for a change. “Who are some of your favorite authors?” I was bold enough to inquire. “Authors?” Lev all but sputtered on his drink. “Yes,” I said, not sure why my question was being treated as so shocking; I hadn’t ask him the brand of briefs he preferred. “Who do you like to read?” “I don’t,” he told me, wrinkling his nose in disgust, as if I’d just asked him what dress he liked to wear. “I read the paper and maybe an owner’s manual now and then, but I never read for pleasure.” He pulled another face. “Why would I?” That was it. I wanted to go home. Lev may have been handsome and well-built, but reading was one of my favorite things in the whole world and I could never be interested in a boy who not only did not read, but ridiculed me for taking enjoyment in it. I immediately gave up all attempts at trying to pay attention to the words coming out of Lev’s mouth and started covertly watching the clock behind the counter. We had to be home by nine, so that meant leaving Top’s by eight-forty at the latest. The end of my first official date with a boy couldn’t come soon enough. Chapter 6 Jessie “Stick out your tongue, young man,” the doctor instructed and I did as I was told. “Yes, it’s as I expected,” the doctor said after taking several moments to examine my mouth and throat. “It’s definitely scarlet fever. Quite a bad case, I’m afraid.” “How soon will he be able to travel?” my grandfather asked. After months of packing, shipping and attending farewell parties, we were to leave Budapest in five days and I didn’t even feel like I could get out of bed. My head ached fiercely and my throat was so sore I could barely even swallow a little broth. There was a red rash covering most of my body. It itched something fierce, but I was usually too tired to scratch. The doctor gave Grandfather an astonished look. “I’m not sure you understand the current health of this young man,” he said in a low, yet serious voice. “He will not be able to do anything but rest for at least a month.” Then, glancing at my mother, he added, “I do not wish to alarm you, but there is a chance that he might not recover if he isn’t treated with great care.” “What are you on about?” Grandfather thundered. “Of course he’ll recover. Don’t be absurd. I’m just trying to decide if we can still set sail for America at the end of the week.” I was sure there was more to the conversation, but I was too tired to listen. I felt both clammy and chilled. My throat was on fire, yet I couldn’t manage to swallow much water whenever it was brought to my lips, even though I was parched. I must have slipped into the throws of the fever for some time because the next thing I remember I could hear Mother and Grandfather talking as they stood to one side of my bed. I held very still and just listened, keeping my eyes closed. I knew if I gave any indication I was awake, my mother would turn all of her attentions to me and I wanted to hear what they had to say. “I don’t understand why you can’t just set sail with Daniel,” my mother was saying. I could tell from the tone of her voice that she was trying to keep her emotions under control. “When Jessie regains his strength, the three of us will join you.” “I suppose you intend to keep Emily here with you?” Grandfather snarled. “Of course,” Mother said, as if any other option was simply absurd. “She’s still a little girl. She needs to be with her mother. I’m not sending her off with the likes of you and Daniel. Young girls need kindness, not to be toyed with like a cat toys with a mouse.” “I would not toy with my grandchild,” Grandfather exclaimed, his voice starting to sound like thunder. “I didn’t mean you,” Mother informed him. “Now I love all of my children equally,” she said, “but I think I also understand the nature of each of my children. I’m afraid that Daniel would not be able to resist tormenting a mortal child, even if she is his own sister.” This silenced Grandfather for a moment. He knew Mother was right. But he also probably suspected she had ulterior motives. My mother did not want her children to be members of the undead. “I don’t see why we don’t just turn him now and save ourselves the trouble,” Grandfather said, his voice conveying that my illness was causing him to feel put upon. “No!” Mother said, rather sharply. “He’s only seventeen. He’s too young to be turned.” “He’s not that young,” Grandfather insisted. “He’s almost a man.” “Being almost a man and being a man are two very different things,” Mother insisted. “You wouldn’t want to leave him stuck on the edge of manhood for eternity.” “I suppose not,” Grandfather muttered, pulling on his bottom lip. My fever must have started to rise again because after that I didn’t remember much else beyond the doctor’s concerned face hovering over my bed. He looked very grave and I remember thinking that he was about to tell Mother I was going to die. I should have been so lucky. Later that night, I remember hearing a noise and opened my eyes to see my grandfather looming over my bed. “What is it, Grandfather?” I asked in a hushed voice, not wanting to make too much noise, my head ached so badly. “The doctor has his doubts that you will survive,” Grandfather said, his voice cold and emotionless. “And we’ve already booked our tickets for America.” My eyelids felt heavy, but I tried to peer through the dark. Was Grandfather actually angry that my illness was ruining his plans? “I’m sorry,” I said. It didn’t really make sense to me to apologize, but I had no idea what he wanted from me and I couldn’t think of anything else to say. “I will not have your weakness prevent this move,” he informed me. “Your mother has offered to stay behind with Emily to nurse you, but we both know that means I would never see any of you again.” I said nothing. I was too weak to put up a fight. It was clear that he had made up his mind and nothing I could do would stop him. “So I am to be seventeen forever?” Grandfather bent over me, pushing my head to one side. “You’re going to be a Vanderlind forever.” Then I felt a hot sting on my neck like two hornets had synchronized their attack. Grandfather had his mouth pressed against my flesh and I knew he was feeding from me, draining me of all my blood at a rapid rate. I wanted to fight him, but the fever had left me as weak as a kitten. I could barely raise my hands in protest. And when I did try to defend myself, he immediately pinned me to the bed. As I lay there, I could feel the blood draining from my body. First my feet went numb. It was like standing outside too long in the snow. Then I could no longer feel my hands. Shortly after that I could feel my heart struggling to beat in my chest. I must have cried out as I struggled to cling to my last moments of life because suddenly my mother burst through the door. “Father! What are you doing?” she shrieked. Then she raced across the room and wrenched him away from my shuddering form. “He was going to die anyway,” Grandfather insisted. “I’m just facing the inevitable.” “But he’s just a boy.” Mother was weeping with rage and grief. “You should at least give him the chance to become a man.” “It’s too late now,” Grandfather informed her. “I’ve drunk too much. He’s going to die now, either way. The only question you have to answer is whether I bring him back.” “No!” Mother dropped to her knees, clutching my hand. “Oh, my darling Jessie. I should have known. I should have known he would try to do this to you,” she said between sobs. I opened my mouth to try to speak. I wanted to tell her to just let me die. My body was already feeling much warmer. I felt like I was floating in a lake on a sunny day. The pain of my illness had been washed away. I was ready to face the afterlife. Chapter 7 Colette “I’m sorry, Lilly, but I honestly don’t want to go.” “What are you talking about?” my sister exclaimed. We were in the backyard the next morning, clearing out the weeds that had survived the winter, and turning over the soil in Mama’s vegetable patch. “Lev said he had a wonderful time. He wants to see you again.” “I just don’t think we have very much in common,” I told her as I tugged at a dead thistle, its little stingers piercing my worn work gloves in a few spots. “Men and women never have much in common,” she told me. “You shouldn’t let that bother you.” “He doesn’t even like to read,” I grunted, still battling the plant. “Not at all.” “You put too much stock in reading,” Lilly said. “I think you’ll find most men don’t care for it.” “Papa likes to read,” I pointed out. The thistle finally gave up the fight and I tumbled a little to one side as it released its grip on the soil. “He reads all the time.” “Yes, but Papa is an educated man,” Lilly pointed out. “I think I would prefer an educated man,” was my response. “Yes, but it’s not Lev’s fault he’s not educated. He was going to go to college,” my sister insisted. I really couldn’t imagine Lev in a collegiate atmosphere. He just didn’t appear that bright. I wondered if this was something I should mention to Lilly. “Please, Lettie,” Lilly pleaded. “You know Walter and I can’t go out again unless you go with us. And I really, really like him.” “I’d be happy to meet another one of Walter’s friends,” I told her. “You said he knew a lot of nice boys.” Lilly let her shoulders slump. “But what about Lev? Don’t you think that would hurt his feelings?” “Lilly,” I couldn’t help but say, “we went out on one date for a soda. It’s not as if we were going steady or anything. Besides, I doubt Lev is desperate for female attention. I’m sure there are a lot of girls who would be happy to listen to him talk about football.” Lilly widened her eyes a little, believing she had figured something out. “Is that why you don’t want to see him again? Because he talked too much about football?” “It’s not the only reason,” I told her. “Then what is?” Sighing, I pulled at a few more shriveled weeds. “He never asked me about myself,” I said, feeling a little foolish for no reason. “Not one thing.” “Oh, is that all?” Lilly said, dusting some soil from her gloved hands. “You don’t understand,” I told her. “If there had been just a photograph of me there in my place, it would have been the same to Lev. And when he finally stopped speaking for a moment, and I asked him a question, he ridiculed me.” Standing up, I brushed some dried grass from my legs. “I’m sorry,” I told her, picking up my hoe. “I don’t want to prevent you from seeing your beau, but I will not go out on another date with Lev Wilson.” “But…” Lilly started to protest. “I don’t see why I have to be miserable, just so you can be happy,” I told her chopping vigorously at the soil with the hoe. “Just explain to Walter that Lev and I didn’t hit it off and have him fix me up with another boy. Or none at all, for all I care. I’ll just bring a book on your next date and be a third wheel.” “No, that’s alright,” Lilly hastened to say. “I’ll just tell Walter you need someone who is a little more intellectual. He should understand that.” That afternoon was the first time I rode my bike out to the castle. It hadn’t been my intention. My original destination was the library to hunt for a new book to read, but somehow I found the wheels of my bike rolling toward the shores of the Tiburon River. And the next thing I knew, I was admiring the progress that had been made on reconstructing the castle. I knew better than to get too close to the work in progress. I didn’t want to be in the way. But even from a distance, I could see the walls of the castle starting to rise. The dungeon must have already been finished and the stones for the ground floor in place. I had somehow thought they would build the exterior walls first and then fill in the middle, but they appeared to be building everything up, layer by layer. All of the stones from the barges had been off-loaded onto the shore. The boats themselves had disappeared; probably they were headed back down to the Ohio River. There was still a massive pile of rocks on the shore, but I had heard a second round of barges would arrive with more stones once the first pile had been cleared. It was amazing the amount of progress the stone masons had done in only a few days. But the sheer number of people reconstructing the castle probably made the whole thing go quicker than expected. There didn’t seem to be very many windows to the castle. None at all, as far as I could tell. I thought about the drawings and photographs of castles I’d seen in books. There never were any windows. That made sense, especially if a castle’s primary purpose was to defend its inhabitants against a siege. There was no sign of the Vanderlind family. It seemed unlikely that they would arrive before the castle was completely finished. Wealthy people probably hated being inconvenienced even more than us regular folks. I knew it was foolish, but I couldn’t wait for the Vanderlinds’ arrival. I didn’t think the family would actually socialize with people from Tiburon, but it would be exciting to see a few of them as they drove through town, or maybe catch a glimpse of them as they entered the policemen’s ball, or stopped by to pay a call on the mayor. I imagined it would be like catching a glimpse of royalty. I had read how the English who owned grand houses would have a day each month when their homes were open to the public. That way regular folks could come in and admire the art and finery. I sincerely hoped that the Vanderlinds would adhere to that sort of tradition, so that I would have a chance to see inside the castle. It was something I wanted very much and I just knew there had to be a way. That night I dreamt of the Vanderlind Castle. Or at least I had a dream about a castle and decided it was how the castle being built on the other side of town should look. In my dream there was a fine family with a mother and father, an aging dowager, and several children of varying ages. My dark haired boy was the middle child. He was there, playing croquet on the lawn with his brothers and sisters. I wasn’t sure why I was there. Things were vague, as they sometimes are in dreams. But as the dark haired boy was lining up a shot, he looked up and smiled at me, his dark eyes twinkling in the sunlight. When I woke up the next morning, I took several minutes to luxuriate in my bed. I knew the memories of my dark haired boy would slip away soon enough, so I wanted to savor them while I could. It probably wasn’t healthy to pine for a boy who was only a product of my imagination, but for a few moments I decided to just indulge in my secret fantasies. My sister’s desire to spend time with Walter would brook no opposition. When, after a few days of constant pressure, pleading, and offered bribes yielded no results, Lilly realized that Walter really would have to wrangle another of his friends. I hoped for one with a smaller head, but with a bit more going on upstairs. And that’s exactly what Walter did. He must have combed through every boy he’d ever met to fix me up with a very studious fellow named Herschel Tuft. He was a grade above me at school and he had won the Tiburon High School mathematics prize three years running. It turned out that Walter and Herschel were second or third cousins — I wasn’t exactly sure of their family connection — but it sounded reassuring enough for Papa to agree to the date. This time it was more than just a soda at Top’s. We were actually going to walk into town to see a movie. I loved movies so I felt this date wasn’t going to be as much of an imposition on me. I recognized Herschel from school, of course, as soon as he walked in our front door. I distinctly remembered him accepting his math award the previous year. There was a peculiar angle to the way he held his head when he was nervous and it had stuck in my brain. Herschel was a pale boy, tall and slender with sandy blond hair that was straight as a pin. He didn’t have his hair loaded up with any kind of hair tonic, which I knew met with our mother’s approval. I’d never previously spoken to Herschel, or had any classes with him, but I immediately felt more comfortable being around him than I had Lev. At least he was closer to me in age. In contrast to Lev, Herschel said as little as possible while the four of us walked into town. I didn’t mind the silence. In fact, I preferred it to stories about football games. But I did think we should have a little conversation so I tried with, “What do you intend to do after graduation?” Herschel gave me a started look, as if I was a pet cat that had suddenly started speaking one day. “College,” he eventually answered. I nodded, waiting for more than a one word reply. When I realized nothing else was coming, I tried, “What do you think you’ll study?” “Mathematics,” he told me, this time without as much hesitation. I figured that was about as much as I was going to get out of him, so I let things go at that. There was a bit of problem when we were buying our tickets. Herschel headed up to the gal at the ticket window and purchased a single ticket. I guess that was his way of letting me know he had no interest in me romantically. Fortunately, the feeling was mutual. Unfortunately, it did lead to some awkwardness. I got in line with every intention of buying my own ticket, but then Walter insisted on treating me. I tried to argue with him, but he insisted. It was somehow more humiliating having my sister’s beau purchase my ticket than it would have been if I’d bought my own. Fortunately the film we saw was rather entertaining and I found myself laughing off the whole situation. Herschel, on the other hand, did not appear to enjoy the show. He did not laugh once during the entire movie and frequently looked quite bored. On the walk home, I took the lead, trailing Herschel in my wake. I’d actually enjoyed myself more than on my date with Lev. But I didn’t want to prolong Herschel’s agony, so that speeded my steps. Lilly and Walter were walking at a leisurely pace, of course. They obviously did not want their date to end. When I got to our front porch, I took a seat on the step. The weather was warming up a little, but the flagstones still chilled my bottom. I couldn’t exactly go inside without my sister, and Papa hadn’t put the porch swing back up since taking it down in the fall, so there was no other place to wait. Herschel eventually wandered up and sat beside me. He said nothing, so I said nothing. I did steal a glance at my watch. If my sister and her beau did not step lively, then we would be late getting home and that would be the end of Walter Bennett. “I apologize for not purchasing your ticket,” Herschel eventually said, breaking the silence. “I must save every penny I have for college next fall, And Walter said this wouldn’t really be a date, so I saw no reason to incur the expenditure.” “That’s alright,” I told him. “I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy the picture.” “I enjoyed it,” Herschel told me. “Really?” I was surprised. “I don’t think I heard you laugh once during the whole film.” Herschel chewed over this observation. “I don’t…” he began and then he thought it over some more. “I don’t believe guffawing loudly in a public place is an accurate assessment of enjoyment.” Guffawing? I thought to myself. Herschel was certainly more intellectual than Lev, but he wasn’t exactly a pleasant person to be around. Fortunately for me, Lilly and Walter came into view at that exact moment, walking arm-in-arm. It was a relief because I knew Papa would scold both of us if we were late, and I really didn’t want to spend any more time speaking with Herschel Tuft. Chapter 8 Jessie I woke to a hunger that I never imagined was possible. The urge to feed was overwhelming. It literally crippled any other thought that entered my head. I could smell odors that would have never registered in my mortal nose. I knew the chambermaid had been in the room recently to change my linen. My mother must have sent her away immediately because the smell of her was very faint, but my urge to rip out the girl’s throat and feast on her red juices was overwhelming. Fortunately, Mother was right there with a large jug of blood. “It’s alright, my darling. Everything is going to be alright,” she said, handing me cup after cup of the red nectar until I just grabbed the entire jug and gulped it down. It was the most delicious thing I had ever tasted. It was ambrosia in my mouth. I could feel the blood coursing through my body, making every part of me tingle with satisfaction. There was only a small part of my brain that wondered how the liquid I was drinking had been acquired. Did some poor soul sacrifice his life for the precious elixir? I was ashamed to admit it, but a large portion of me didn’t care. All I wanted was more. After the jug was gone, I was a little better. I felt saner. I still had horrible pangs of hunger, but not the kind of pangs that drove a person to do depraved things. I took notice of my hands. The red rash from my illness was gone and my skin looked extraordinarily pale. A small scar that I had been at the base of my thumb for as long as I could remember had vanished. “Are you better now?” Mother asked, clasping my hands and pulling them to her cheek. “Do you feel under control?” I looked at her, but suddenly I couldn’t speak. There was bile filling my throat. I felt like beetles and slugs were trying to crawl out of my mouth. I hated everyone and everything. I wanted to set the world on fire. I wanted to cause pain. I wanted to see mortals quaking with terror so that I could delight in their agony. “Jessie?” My mother stared at me, her eyes wide with fear. I’d always loved Mother dearly and I didn’t want to frighten her. I didn’t want to cause her any more pain than she’d already suffered with a monster for a father. And it was that conviction that centered me. The plague that I was tempted to let spill from my lips abated. I felt my old self again. “Yes,” I finally managed to say.”Yes, I think I’m…” I could not even think of the words to describe how I was feeling. “Calm,” was what I ended up saying. “I’m so sorry.” Mother burst into tears. “I should have known my father would try something like this. I should have guarded the door.” She hung her head and released a deep sob. “I should have taken you all away years ago.” “I think we both know Grandfather would have never allowed that to happen,” I said, sitting up a little in my bed and stuffing a pillow behind my head and shoulders. “He would have pursued us to the ends of the earth.” Grandfather was a very controlling man. He did not like the idea of anyone disobeying him, especially his own flesh-and-blood. His word was law. “That’s true,” Mother said with a large sniff, her eyes glistening. She always looked beautiful, even when she cried. That was one of the things I remembered about her, even before she was turned. Her beauty had been enhanced by becoming a member of the undead, but it wasn’t created by it. “But still…” she said. “I should have tried. I should have thought of something.” I put my arms around her. “Please don’t cry.” She suddenly straightened up, pulling away from me and looking into my eyes. “You haven’t changed. Have you?” she exclaim. “I thought for a moment there…” She brushed at her tears. “But it’s not true. Is it? You’re still my wonderful boy.” Running my hand through my hair a couple of times, I thought things over. I didn’t feel any different. Not really. Not deep inside. There had been a moment where I’d felt like I could have let the world tumble into the darkest pit of human misery, but that moment had passed. Yes, my sense of smell was better than a bloodhounds and I could see clearly without there being a light in the room. Yes, I craved human blood. I could already feel I would need more of the red nectar before much longer. But no, I did not feel innately different. I no longer felt hate in my heart. That moment was gone. I had no desire to kill or torture mortals. If anything, I felt sad for the life I would never live. I mourned for the girl I would never marry and the children I would never cradle in my arms. “I think I’m the same,” I finally told my mother. “I don’t feel any cruelty in here,” I said, tapping on my chest. “Thank God,” Mother said, wrapping me in her arms. “Thank God.” I held her for a few minutes and let her cry in my arms. Then she pulled away from me and dried her eyes. “Now I only have Emily left.” My poor little sister. She was a dear girl. The weight of continuing the family line would fall upon her shoulders. “We must find a way to protect her,” I said. “We must get her away somehow.” Mother thought about it for quite some time before saying, “No, there is no way to take her away from my father.” She turned to look me in the eye, her face quite solemn. “If Emily is to be saved from the curse of eternal life, then it is Grandfather who must be removed from us.” Chapter 9 Colette “You didn’t like Herschel either?” my sister exclaimed as I walked my bike along side of her. “You’re impossible.” It was Sunday and I had ridden out to the castle after church to see how things were progressing. I had expected the building site to be quiet, but there was still at least fifty men working, positioning stones and moving lumber into the castle. The second battalion of barges had already arrived and been offloaded. I understood there was to be a third and fourth round of boats on the way, the final of which would contain the castle furniture and family possessions. I stood at the edge of the worksite, not wanting to be in the way, but still wanting a glimpse of what was happening. Most of the men who had been hired to help with the offloading of the larger stones had completed their work and been sent on their way. Of the men who remained, most must have been from Hungary. None of the conversations I overheard were in English. The exterior of the castle was looking close to complete, as far as my untrained eye could tell. The structure was much more massive than I had ever imagined. I guessed maybe it was six or eight stories tall. I couldn’t exactly estimate by windows because there weren’t any and I didn’t know how high the ceilings were on each level. The exterior was entirely composed of the large gray stones that we’d seen being unloaded that first day. The castle wasn’t exactly an inviting structure, but historically speaking, I suppose it wasn’t meant to be. I still found the whole idea of a family moving their ancestral home across an ocean and rebuilding it in our small Ohio town incredibly romantic and I longed to know more about the people who were going to live there. Several of the workers were standing in a cluster close at hand and I noticed that some of the men were glancing in my direction. They were rough-looking and dirty from their labors, but they weren’t regarding me in a way that felt menacing. Still, I thought it was a good idea to be on my way. As I was turning my bicycle around, I heard someone call out, “You there.” I didn’t stop. There was no possible reason someone at the worksite would be addressing me. “Hello! Young lady,” the man called out again. This time I knew he had to be addressing me because there were no other females around. “Yes?” I asked, while mounting my bicycle and rolling a few feet down the dirt road. I saw no reason to be within grabbing distance, even if my behavior came off as a little rude. A young man stepped forward. He was covered with grime, but had piercing blue eyes that looked intelligent. “You are from this town?” he asked, waving a hand in the direction of Tiburon. “You live nearby?” He had an accent, but I could understand him easily enough. “Yes,” I said, rather hesitantly, unsure why he was asking. “I have seen you here before. You are curious about the castle.” He said it as a statement, rather than a question. “I’ve never seen a real castle before,” I told him. I wasn’t sure what answer he was expecting. “It is fine that you look now,” the young man told me, “but when the family is here, you must never come to this place. You must stay away.” At first I thought he was trying to tease me in some foreign way that I didn’t understand. But his face was so grave; I quickly realized that wasn’t the case. “Why?” I asked. What need could there be for anyone to avoid the castle, beyond annoying the occupants? “The family, they are…” he said a foreign word that I did not understand. “They are?” I repeated. The young man turned to the group of workers he had been chatting with before approaching me. They were all observing our conversation rather closely. My new friend asked them something in whatever language they were all speaking. I assumed it was Hungarian. The men shook their heads. A few called out more words that I could not understand. Turning back to me, the young man tried again. “They are a cursed family,” he said. “They are…” and then he tried pantomiming out the word he could not translate into English. He began bearing his teeth, which were straight, but yellow. Then he made the action of biting down. “You understand?” he asked. After that he slapped his lean belly a few times. “They must feed.” “Oh,” I said, doing my best to suppress a laugh. Was he really trying to warn me that the Vanderlind family was gluttons? But he was looking at me with such a serious face. Maybe he meant that vicious dogs guarded the castle and they would bite any trespassers. Yes, that made more sense. He probably thought I might try to sneak onto the castle grounds and would get a bad mauling for my curiosity. “Thank you for telling me,” I said, trying to match his grave manner. “I will be careful. I promise.” A look of relief spread across the young man’s face. “I am glad you understand,” he told me. “You will tell other people? They will not come here?” “Yes, I’ll do that,” I assured him, even though I had no intention of doing so. It didn’t seem appropriate for me to wander the streets of Tiburon warning people of the new family’s angry dogs before they’d even set foot in America. Besides, I was quite sure the local police would make the family post a sign or something, if they had animals that were dangerous. I pondered the young man’s’ warning as I rode my bike home. That’s when I ran across Lilly, walking along the road, so I stopped to walk with her. She immediately brought up my date with Herschel, of course. “You didn’t like Lev because he talked too much and now you say you don’t like Herschel because he didn’t talk at all. Seriously, Lettie. I can’t figure you out.” “That’s not exactly true,” I said in my defense. “I didn’t like Lev because…” What could I say? I didn’t like him because he was so very full of himself that there didn’t seem to be any room left for him to care about anyone else. He just didn’t seem like a kind person to me. But I couldn’t exactly say that because he was a good friend of Walter’s. “Because I just didn’t feel we had a connection,” I said, although it sounded like a poor excuse, even to my own ears. “He thought you had a connection,” my sister observed. “Yes, but don’t both people have to mutually feel the connection for there to actually be one?” I asked. “If he felt anything, it was probably just hormones.” “Lettie,” Lilly exclaimed, and then she covered her face with her hands and laughed with embarrassment. “Don’t let Mama and Papa hear you talking like that. They’ll never let you out of the house again.” Chapter 10 Jessie It was not ideal for a fledgling vampire to be shunted onto an ocean liner only a few days after being turned. But Grandfather was a man of little compassion for other people’s suffering. Besides, the ship on which we’d booked our passage had all the requirements for a family of vampires to make a successful voyage. The boat didn’t launch until the evening, so if we waited to board until the last minute, then we could go under the cover of darkness. The ship also docked in New York in the late afternoon. We would all have to find excuses for lingering in our cabins, but that obstacle wasn’t insurmountable. Most stewards would be happy to let an ailing passenger spend a few more hours in his bunk if the right amount of currency was exchanged. We had to make sure that we all had a safe place to spend the daylight hours. Coffins could not be accommodated. — Even a steward on the make would grow suspicious after seeing a coffin in several different cabins. — But overly large steamer trunks were not out of the question. Grandfather had one made for each of the family who was a member of the undead. Steamer trunks were usually put in storage and not left in first class cabins, but it wasn’t such an oddity that it would be remarked upon with any interest. My mother suggested that each trunk be made by a separate craftsman, so they would all have a distinctive look and not be thought of as purchased together. She was adamant about everyone keeping a separate identity and my grandfather eventually saw the wisdom of this plan, even if he was unwilling to compliment her for such forethought. In the last decade, crossing the Atlantic had gone from a thirty day ordeal to just a four day voyage. It was a boon for vampires looking to travel to America because it meant no more trying to bring live animals aboard the ship or surviving on rats. Jars of blood, properly sealed, were easily palatable for up to a week, if kept out of the sun. Our grandfather had always fed traditionally, preferring the blood of beautiful young boys or virile young men. He had enough money and Budapest had enough members of the underclass, that these poor souls could be acquired and disposed of without too much trouble. Every once in awhile, a mother would raise a ruckus, searching for her missing child. But the Vanderlind wealth shielded Grandfather from any real concern about prosecution. There were rumors about our family, but there would always be rumors about us no matter where we lived. After my mother was turned, she couldn’t stomach the idea of causing another human pain to satisfy her own appetite. She said she’d rather starve than to harm an innocent mortal. So she came up with a plan to keep our family in good supply of the sustenance we needed while actually helping the mortals of the human race. Mother invented another son, Arthur. Poor Arthur was a sickly boy, suffering from a rare blood disease. His malady meant he was in need of multiple blood transfusions each day. Mortals interested in selling their blood were provided with a meal and a generous payment. Soon the castle had more blood than was needed. Other like-minded vampire families began contributing funds so that they too could feed without causing harm. It wasn’t too long before clinics were set up in four neighborhoods of Budapest so that blood could be collected without a direct connection to the Vanderlind family. Many vampires agreed that the voluntary collection of blood was the humane thing to do, but it did little to ease a vampire’s natural instinct to hunt. As I struggled to control my appetite and adjust to the new life that had been thrust upon me, there was another worry that plagued my mind. It was too late for a change in our cabin arrangements. My sister and I would have cabins that were adjoined by a stateroom. Before I had been transformed, that seemed an ideal pairing. I could keep an eye on her and shield her from any shipboard Romeos or unscrupulous travelers who were toying with the idea of relieving a first class young girl of her purse. But as a vampire, the whole situation made me uneasy. I was too new to the world of the undead to trust myself alone with any mortal. I loved my sister dearly and would have rather walked out into the blazing sun of high noon than harm her, but that didn’t mean my predatory instincts wouldn’t take over in a moment of weakness. Fortunately, my mother thought of a solution to ease my mind. Mrs. Denkler was crossing on the same ship as us, only her cabin was in third class. Our housekeeper would pose as Emily’s governess and simply stay in the cabin with her. Denkie had nerves of steel and I was convinced she could face down a vampire much more powerful than the likes of me. It felt good to know that my sister would be protected from the evil that lurked in her own home. That would make the crossing less of an ordeal. We travelled by private train cars to the port city of Drubrovnik on the Adriatic Sea, where the ship that would take us to America was anchored. Our boarding was planned with precision. We family members climbed in our custom steamer trunks while it was only late afternoon and then we were driven to the docks in separate vehicles. That way we could start boarding the boat, one-by-one, immediately after sunset. My sister and Mrs. Denkler came in the car with me. At first I felt claustrophobic in my substitute coffin. Although the trunk was quite large, I felt cramped and had to tuck my legs to fit inside. For several seconds I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Then I remembered that I didn’t have to breathe and I was just being foolish. “Mama is getting out of her trunk now,” Emily said, tapping on my trunk. She had a pair of opera glasses with her so she could watch the activities of the other family members while remaining inconspicuous. “They’re driving toward the ship now, so I think it’s okay for you to get out,” she said a few minutes later. All of the trunks had been ingeniously designed so that they could be locked and unlocked from the inside. The visible lock on the outside was really just a decoy to deceive any curious maids or light fingered crewmen. That way there was no chance of someone thrusting open the lid at an inappropriate hour and getting the surprise of his life as a vampire burst into flames and quickly shriveled into a pile of ash. That would have definitely been a story a man could tell his grandchildren from the insane asylum. I jiggled the lock, was unable to open it, and felt a flash of frustration. Then I realized I had my eyes closed, which was silly because as a member of the undead, I could see perfectly in the dark. With my eyes open, I easily popped the lock and flipped open the lid. Slipping out of the trunk, I crawled into the back seat next to my sister. She gave me a smile, then reached over and straightened my tie. Even though it was no longer necessary for me to breath, I still took a few moments to gulp in some of the night air. Mortal habits were hard to break. And it was always good to give the impression of breathing. It was smart for a vampire to try to appear as alive as possible. “Grandfather’s going now,” Emily said, glancing at me and then returning to her opera glasses. Under normal circumstances, Grandfather would have insisted upon going first. But like most bullies, he was a coward at heart. He wanted to make sure that no one tried to stop my mother before he put himself at risk. I wasn’t sure why anyone would stop Mother. She was simply a beautiful young woman travelling first class to the New World. “Are you sad about leaving Hungary?” Emily asked as we watched the others move closer and closer to the ship. There had been so many parties in the last few months, and then I had been gravely ill, and then I was abruptly transformed into the undead. With all that going on, I’d hardly had time to reflect on our moving. If I took a moment to think about it, then yes, there was some sadness at leaving the country we had always called home. I had school friends whom I was to be parted from forever. But I would have been parted from them anyway after being turned immortal. And yet there was another emotion brimming in my chest. It was much more powerful than my sadness, but I concealed it from everyone. In truth, I felt oddly compelled to go to America. My feelings were hard to describe, but I almost felt like my real life was waiting for me there. I didn’t exactly know how to explain it, but part of me was looking forward to the move with eager anticipation. “Jessie?” Emily prompted me and I realized I had not spoken in several seconds. Her face looked both sad and hopeful. I knew it must have been hard on her to have me turned so young. Neither of us had wanted to follow the family tradition that Grandfather was hell-bent to inflict upon us. We’d sometimes spoken of running away once we were both a little older. Those childhood plans were now gone. If Emily was to run, it would have to be on her own. I could no longer go with her. I forced a smile to my lips and said, “I think it’s going to be a grand adventure.” “You know what I think?” she asked, almost shyly. “What’s that, my little love?” I asked, slipping my arm around her and giving her a squeeze. She was not yet thirteen, so she still sometimes let me cuddle and squeeze her. “I think it’s going to be like Dorothy.” “Dorothy?” I asked, giving her a puzzled look. “From The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” she explained. It was her favorite book from when she was very little. “Don’t you remember? Dorothy’s whole house is swept up by a cyclone and crashes down in a place that’s filled with magic.” Her eyes were shining with the romance of it. “Why do you talk such nonsense?” Mrs. Denkler felt the need to interject. She’d been sitting in the front seat next to the driver, glowering at us the whole time. “The castle wasn’t swept up in a cyclone. It was dismantled and moved by hundreds of workmen and at great expense. And America is not a land filled with magic. Far from it. The east coast is supposed to be quite civilized, but the whole middle of the country is filled with savages and Irishmen.” “Don’t listen to Denkie,” I said, giving Emily another squeeze and shooting our housekeeper a warning look over my sister’s shoulder. “She’s still pouting that we’re not moving to the North Pole.” “The North Pole?” Emily gave her temporary governess a surprised look. “Yes, I heard her talking to Grandfather about it. She’s always wanted to move to the North Pole so that she can look for Father Christmas.” “She never said such a thing,” Emily said with a giggle. “You’re making that up.” “I might be,” I said, frowning a bit while nodding my head. “But I think you’re right about Dorothy. Maybe our house will land in a magical place.” Chapter 30 Jessie Emily peeked through her opera glasses again, directing them at the docks. “Daniel’s in line to go through customs,” she said. “And there are a couple of people behind him.” We had our chauffeur pull down to the dock so we could unload and prepare to board the ship. By the time we got all of our baggage out of the car, Daniel was already through the line. First class passengers were treated as above reproach. Beyond glancing at our tickets, no one stopped us as we made our way onto the ship. It was that easy, but only because of our Grandfather’s fortune. And our mother’s forethought. A steward showed us to our cabins. We each had sleeping quarters, and then there was a small stateroom that was set between our cabins. It was actually very charming with wood paneling and brass framed portholes. And the rooms were not nearly as cramped as I’d anticipated. That was another benefit to traveling first class. It afforded a person a lot more breathing room. There was a tap at the door while we were all settling in for our four day journey. “Bonjour,” a young woman in a maid’s uniform said as she let herself into our shared accommodations. “Oh,” she exclaimed, as if she hadn’t expected anyone to be in the rooms. “You must forgive me,” she said, her cheeks turning quite red. “I had expected that everyone would be on deck for the launch of the boat. I am just here to turn down your beds for the night.” Seeing the young woman’s blush reflex made my stomach contract with hunger. She was a beautiful, petite thing with bobbed hair and painted lips. I forced my mind to think of my luggage, which contained a dozen bottles of blood, all neatly tucked between ample padding. “You want I should come back later?” she asked. I placed her accent as French, but probably not from Paris. I glanced over at Emily, who shook her head just the tiniest bit. I was grateful to her. I think she understood that I was struggling with my newly acquired dietary restrictions and she didn’t want temptation to stumble in my path in the form of a shapely servant. “We won’t need bed service during our voyage,” I told the maid. “Is there anything I can get you?” she asked, looking from me to my sister and then back again. “Some water? Or ice, perhaps?” “Just solitude, I think,” I told her. We really didn’t need one of those forward maids who was always barging in to see if anything was needed. “We’ve both had a bout of scarlet fever so we’re looking for an uneventful voyage with plenty of peace and quiet.” “You poor things,” she clucked. “Then I shall bring you some broth to strengthen your blood.” The maid was remarkably persistent and she kept peeking at me, shyly, in a way that let me know that she was probably new to her job and desperate to make a good impression. “No thank you. We are in need of nothing.” I assured her. “And besides, if we do happen to have some urgent need, then there’s always my sister’s governess to take care of us both.” “Very good,” said the maid, glancing briefly in Mrs. Denkler’s direction. “Then I shall leave you to have a pleasant journey.” Once the maid had gone, Emily walked over to me and took my hand. “Are you feeling well enough to go up on deck? I would love to be there when we launch.” She gave me a hesitant smile. “And maybe toss some of those paper streamers into the air.” I knew Emily was worried about me mingling with the mortal crowd up on deck. She was such a little doll to be so concerned for me. She had always been quite the considerate child. And I didn’t want to deny her the enjoyment of our grand departure. “Just give me a moment in my cabin and we can head right up,” I told her. “Now that you mention it, I think I’d like to toss some paper streamers myself.” In my cabin, I opened the small trunk that held most of the food I would use on our voyage. There were twelve quart bottles to last me four days. It seemed like an excessive amount, but I had the keen hunger common to most fledglings and there was also always the risk of bad weather while we were at sea. We didn’t want a delay of a day or two leading to disaster. I kept another two small pint bottles in a valise in case of emergencies, but I hoped I wouldn’t need them. Unsealing the wax around one of the quart bottles, I pulled the cork and took a long pull. “Oh...” I couldn’t help but sigh and close my eyes, savoring the moment. It tasted so good. “Hurry up,” Emily called, rapping on my cabin door. “The boat’s about to leave.” “Coming!” I called, setting the bottle down and searching for the cork. I thought I’d put it on the table, but it was nowhere to be found. “Go ahead with Mrs. Denkler,” I called out as I searched. “I’ll catch up with you.” “She doesn’t want to go,” my sister informed me. “She says she has too much unpacking to do.” Where was that blasted cork? I hated to leave the bottle just sitting open. “Jessie,” my little sister called. “We’ve got to go now or we’ll miss everything.” “I’ll be right there,” I told her, setting the bottle down on the sink of the small bathroom that was part of my cabin. As I was striding toward the door, the trunk holding my food supply caught my eye. I’d told the maid we didn’t need anything, so we weren’t expecting anyone in the rooms, but just to be on the safe side, I snapped the trunk closed and locked it. Better safe than sorry. I didn’t want to end up eyeing every mortal passenger on the ship like they were sides of beef. Our departure was actually quite enjoyable. There was the excitement in the air that always seems to accompany the start of a journey. People cheered and waved to their loved ones standing on the shore. There were paper streamers, just like in the movies, and Emily had a delightful time letting them tumble from her fingers and trail over the side of the ship. I was doing well. Even though the ship’s deck was crowded, I felt I had control over my hunger. I caught a glimpse of my mother and grandfather out of the corner of my eye, standing separately and observing the festivities. Daniel was nowhere to be found, but he never was one to mingle with mortals, even when he was a mortal. There was a shift in the crowd as some noisy young men roughly surged through it. I could smell the beer on their breath, which explained their heightened jocularity. People were being jostled and a few of them even stumbled. I instinctively put my arm around my little sister to protect her from the high spirited youths. Emily looked up at me and smiled. “You’re a little old for her, aren’t ya?” one of the young men asked. He couldn’t have been older than nineteen or twenty. His face was a ruddy pink from alcohol. I gave the fellow a sharp look, but decided the best course of action was to ignore him. Emily, being on the verge of young womanhood, felt embarrassed by his comment. “He’s my brother,” she told him. The young man smiled. “Does that mean you’re free?” he said, his mouth spreading into a lascivious grin. “This is my lucky day.” “She is a child,” I told him. “And your comments are not appreciated.” “I think she’s old enough to make up her own mind.” The man reached out to touch Emily’s cheek. “Aren’t you, pretty girl?” Before I even thought of what I was doing, my hand shot out and I’d grabbed the young man firmly by the wrist. I wasn’t used to my undead strength and I held him quite tightly. There was a surprised look in his eyes, backed by a little pain. But the surprise quickly turned to alcohol-fueled fury. He took a swing at me, but I blocked his blow as easily as if he’d been moving through water. Then he went to call out for some help from his friends, but I gave him a sharp shake, glared into his eyes, and said, “I wouldn’t if I were you.” “Let’s go look at the moon on the other side of the ship,” Emily said, placing her small hand on my arm. “Come on, Lucas. I think we should go.” I was confused for a moment as to why Emily had referred to me as Lucas. But then I realized that she didn’t want the young man to know my real name. Emily had obviously inherited my mother’s good head, along with her beauty. Knowing it was the smart thing to do; I released the young man and allowed my sister to lead me away, her arm looped through mine. Having her next to me was more helpful than she could have ever realized. All I wanted to do was go back to the young man and tear out his throat. “I think we should go back to our cabin,” Emily said in a subdued voice, once we were away from the crowd. “That’s probably a good idea,” I told her, my teeth clenched together. As soon as we’d crossed the threshold to the stateroom, I rushed to my cabin to have another few gulps of blood. I felt like I could barely contain myself and I knew I desperately needed to calm down. But when I checked the sink in my tiny bathroom, the quart bottle had been emptied, rinsed and set out on the counter. I stared at the empty bottle for several seconds. Who would do such a thing? “Mrs. Denkler,” I called rushing back to our shared room. I had seen her sitting on a small couch as we’d entered our quarters. When she looked up from her needlework I asked, “Who has been in the cabin since we left?” “Just the maid,” she said, completely unconcerned. “Why?” “Did she go into my room?” I asked, ignoring her question. “She took some towels in there,” was her reply. “Did she take something? Is anything missing?” “How long was she in my room?” I persisted. “Just a few moments, I think,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I don’t know for sure because I was changing when she let herself in. All I did was peek out the door and she told me that you had requested more towels.” “I didn’t request towels,” I said in a stern voice. Mrs. Denkler went back to her needlework. “I guess she must have confused our cabin with somebody else’s.” Chapter 11 Colette As the spring weather began to warm the ground, I found an excuse to visit the construction site every couple of days. The castle was magically growing before my eyes. The exterior of the building was complete. As the stonemasons departed for parts unknown, electricians, carpenters and gardeners arrived. It was rumored that a whole crew of Italian craftsmen had been brought in just lay down the parquet floors. This meant that there was less activity outside the castle, but I could hear hammering inside the building, and men calling out to each other in various languages. “Why do you always want to go look at that dreary old fortress?” Lilly asked me one afternoon as I was heading off on my bicycle for another visit. “I think it’s going to end up looking surprisingly ugly. And just so drab. Don’t you?” “Oh, no,” I told her. “I think it’s romantic. I mean, just imagine, a couple of hundred years ago knights in armor would have ridden right up to the castle door. Ladies in Waiting would have woven tapestries to cover the walls.” I wondered if any of the original furniture from the castle had survived and if the Vanderlind family still owned any of it. Now that was something I would have loved to see. “So that’s why you like it? For the history lesson.” Lilly smiled and shook her head. “You’re a funny kind of girl.” I didn’t correct my sister, but she hadn’t exactly gotten it right. I did love history, but that wasn’t why I was so captivated by the castle. It was more about the feeling I had in my chest whenever I was near the building; a kind of tickling or buzzing that I couldn’t explain. There was something magical about the castle that I felt deep in my soul, but I didn’t know how to put into words. And maybe part of me didn’t want to put into words. There are some things a girl wants to keep to herself, thoughts not even to be shared with a dearly loved sister. My father also found himself drawn to the castle, but his interest was for professional reasons. He was the best builder in town, but he’d never been offered once day’s work at the castle. That hurt his pride, but it didn’t prevent him from being curious about the construction. Whenever he had a little free time, we would ride out in our car together to see the progress that had been made. Lilly and Mama rarely went, but I was always happy to accompany him. My father was a cordial man and people were usually happy to speak with him. If he found a worker who understood English, he could usually strike up a conversation. I was always eager to listen in. I felt almost a mania to glean as many details as I could about the castle. One afternoon my father discovered that the men who were putting in the rose garden were all from Great Britain. “You’re not from Hungary?” he asked, somewhat surprised. “Wasn’t the garden part of the original house? I thought the family had the shrubs and topiary shipped over as well.” “No. You’ve been misinformed,” a man with thin legs and a round belly told him while leaning on the end of his shovel. I got the impression he wanted a break from his labor. “This place never had a proper English rose garden. But I guess the lady of the house always wanted one.” “And what better way to get a proper English garden than to have one planted by proper Englishmen,” my father said with a smile. “That’s right.” The man smiled in return, exposing a large set of yellow teeth. “The lads and I thought it might be a bit of an adventure. Plus the money was right. We brought the rose bushes with us and everything. Most of them fared the voyage without complaint.” Then he added in an aside, “The roses, not the lads. We had a bit of rough weather.” “It must be nice to be able to order the creation of an entire formal garden on a whim,” my father observed, half to himself. “Yes, there must be more money than Midas behind those walls,” the gardener agreed, eyeing the castle. “Imagine wanting to move to this tiny town in the middle of nowhere.” Then he realized we were more than likely inhabitants of Tiburon, so he quickly added, “Not that the town doesn’t have its charms.” His face went rather pink. “But you always think of rich people as living in London, or Paris. New York, even. Not a small town in the middle of Iowa.” “Ohio,” my father said, correcting him, but keeping his voice genial. “I supposed they want a bit of privacy,” the man said, taking off a heavy work glove and scratching beneath his nose. “I hear that they pretty much like to keep to themselves.” “I guess they won’t be attending any town hall meetings,” Papa joked. “But I suppose the very rich don’t like to dirty their hands.” “Not like me and the lads,” the gardener said, slipping on his glove again as if he’d just remembered he had work to do. “Still, it’d be nice to get a peek inside, when the old gal is done,” he said, eyeing the castle once more. “I don’t suppose they’ll be holding tours.” “If they do, I’ll be the first in line,” my father assured him. “Is the family going to be arriving soon?” I asked. The castle was pretty much devoid of windows, so it was impossible to get a sense of the comings and goings of anyone inside. “Not that I know of, Miss,” he told me, his face rather serious. “Although, from what I’ve heard from some of the I-talian fellows, the family isn’t very nice. In fact, there were one or two stories that could stand a grown man’s hair on end, if anyone was to believe them.” Papa cleared his throat. “I’m not sure it’s right to start rumors about a family before they’ve even driven into town,” he said with a note a censure. The man shrugged. “It’s hard to have a big house like this, and all the money that goes with it, and not at least stir up a few rumors.” Turning his attention back to me, he leaned forward a little and gave me a stern look. “I hope you aren’t expecting a prince charming to go along with the castle as a matched set.” I immediately felt my face go red and I placed a hand to my cheek. My father stepped slightly in front of me, as if to shield me from the gardener’s impertinence. “My daughter enjoys studying history,” he informed the man. “I think she’s just hoping for some more facts about the castle’s past.” The man nodded, his expression growing sober. “Just as long as she remembers that sometimes where there’s smoke, there’s fire.” His eyes became thoughtful. “Or blood, as the I-talians tell it.” I was grateful for my father’s protection, and I did enjoy history, but I still felt the humiliation of being thought of as some silly school girl longing for a prince to move into the neighborhood and notice her. I probably felt doubly embarrassed because maybe the man’s assessment of me hinted at the truth. I couldn’t help but wonder about the stories being spread by the Italian workers. And what expression did they have in Italy about blood? I glanced around, wondering when the Italians took their coffee break and if there was any way I could speaking with one of them. When we returned home that evening, Lilly was sitting on the front steps waiting for us. “Hello Papa,” she said, springing up to give our father a kiss as he climbed the stairs. “Hello, Lettie,” she said, giving me a squeeze, her face all smiles. “What’s going on?” I asked, returning her smile with a suspicious glance. She usually wasn’t quite that much of a welcoming committee. “Oh, it’s nothing,” she said, but she could hardly suppress her smile. “It’s just that Lev Wilson bought a new car. From the White Motor Company. He and Walter just drove it all the way down from Cleveland.” I had to admit, I was impressed that Lev could afford a car. Especially a new one. It made me wonder where he got his money. “How can he afford that?” I had to ask. “From his work, of course,” Lilly said, giving me a small frown. “Oh,” I said with a nod. It was too embarrassing to admit that I had no idea what Lev did for a living. I was sure he had told me, I just hadn’t bothered to listen. “Did he buy it on credit or something?” I asked. He was still a young man and didn’t have a college education, so I doubted he made that much money. Lilly frowned again and shrugged as she trailed me into the house. “That really isn’t something I could ask.” “And just why, exactly, are you bringing all this up?” our father asked as he shrugged out of his jacket. “Well…” Lilly paused for a moment as she gathered her nerve. “Lev and Walter invited Lettie and me to go for a drive after dinner tomorrow,” she blurted. “Just to see the new car, of course.” Papa frowned. “Haven’t you been seeing an awful lot of Walter?” “Not really,” Lilly insisted. “Not an awful lot. In fact, not very much at all.” Mama had walked into the room while we were talking. “Another date with Walter,” she exclaimed. “I hope you two aren’t getting too serious.” “Well, I like him very much, if that’s what you mean,” Lilly said. And then her face flushed a little, “But just so you know, Walter has always been a gentleman.” “I’m glad to hear it,” Mama said, taking our father’s coat and folding it over her arm. “That’s just how a young man should behave.” “That’s how any man should behave,” Papa felt the need to add. “So can we go?” Lilly asked, her eyes shining with excitement. “Just a short drive.” Glancing over at me, she added, “Maybe out to see the castle. I know Colette likes that kind of stuff.” “Your sister was just at the castle with me,” Papa informed her. “Oh, but I’m sure she wouldn't mind going again tomorrow.” She looked eagerly in my direction. “Would you, Lettie?” I had no desire to see Lev Wilson again, but I was already itching to get back to the castle. “I guess I wouldn’t mind,” I said. “As long as it’s just for an hour.” I thought I could put up with anyone’s company for an hour. Lilly bounced up and down and then gave me a hug. “I hope you realize that your mother and I haven’t given our approval yet,” Papa said, his voice stern. Lilly stopped bouncing. “Oh, please,” she said, sounding as if she was Cinderella about to be denied admission to the ball. “I promise it will only be for a half an hour. Maybe an hour at the most.” Our mother and father exchanged looks. “I’m not sure I approve of you riding around in cars with boys,” Mama said. “But if Walter is the gentleman that you claim, then I suppose it’s alright by me, if it’s alright with your father.” Lilly clasped her hands together and turned to look at Papa. “It’s fine, as long as your sister’s with you,” Papa said. “But I want those boys to come inside so I can look them both in the eye again. Most young men remember to mind their p’s and q’s when they know that a father is keeping a close eye on his daughters.” “Well of course they’ll come in,” Lilly said. “Walter would insist on that, anyway.” Lilly hurried off to call her beau and I started setting the table for dinner. I was reluctant to see Lev again, but I could probably just block out his words while gazing at the castle. Plus I desperately wanted to speak to one of the Italian carpenters about the Vanderlinds. What were the hair-raising stories about the new family moving into town? Chapter 12 Jessie Mrs. Denkler went with Emily to the dining room for dinner, but I ordered a meal to be delivered to my room. I intended to try to show up for a few meals with the general public, if only to please my sister and to give the appearance of being mortal, but I was too riled up from my encounter on deck to attempt a meal that night. I ordered a steak, extra rare, along with roasted potatoes, greens and a bottle of wine. I didn’t go overboard on the wine. I knew I had to order a good vintage to keep up appearances, but I saw no reason to spend a lot of money, when all I was going to do was pour it down the drain. I did think for a moment to offer the bottle to Mrs. Denkler, but then changed my mind. She was in charge of my little sister, after all. I didn’t want to give her an excuse to get tipsy. After Emily and her temporary governess had returned from their meal and gone to bed, I sat up reading. I was still unused to my new hours of existence. I didn’t know how to give up my days and find ways to fill my nights. As the hour dragged on past midnight and most of the ship’s passengers had gone to bed, I went up on deck to have a look around. The night was mild and the skies were very clear. The Milky Way was on full display and I took a moment to marvel at the beauty of the heavens. “Are you having trouble sleeping too?” I heard a familiar voice ask me. I looked up to see that my mother had also decided upon a late-night stroll. “Oh…” I stammered for a moment before I realized that we weren’t supposed to know each other. “Yes,” I managed. “I know many people find the gentle rocking of a boat sleep-inducing, but it has the opposite effect on me.” Mother gave a gentle laugh. “I suffer from the same malady, I’m afraid.” Then she turned her head slightly, just enough to let me know that she had heard something or sensed someone else on deck. Taking a moment to focus, I had to agree with her. I could definitely smell the hormonal-laced musk of an adolescent male close at hand. “Did you enjoy the ship’s departure?” I asked, just for something to say so it wouldn’t look awkward with us both just standing there. “I found it quite exhilarating,” she told me with a gentle smile. “Begging your pardon,” a voice said. We both turned to see a young cabin boy who had stepped out of the shadows. His hair was a crown of golden ringlets and his eyes were wide and a brilliant shade of blue. By any standard, he was remarkably beautiful, even though his eyes were crusted slightly with sleep. “Would either of you fine people be needing anything?” I saw my mother suppress a smirk. The boy had obviously been asleep somewhere in a dark corner and was concerned that he might have been discovered shirking his duties. “I am perfectly comfortable,” my mother told him. “Thank you for asking.” Turning to me, she added, “Anything for you, Mr.…?” She let her words hang in the air, seeing that ostensibly we had not been introduced. “Vanderlind,” I told her, suppressing a smile of my own. “Jessie Vanderlind.” My mother provided her false names and we exchanged how-do-you-dos. Then mother turned to the cabin boy and said, “And what is your name, young man?” The cabin boy looked startled for a moment and then said, “I am Christian Franzen, Ma’am. How do you do?” “How do you do?” Mother replied. Christian Franzen stood there for a moment, feeling awkward and unsure of what to do next. “It was nice meeting both of you,” he told us, “but I suppose I’d better be getting back to work.” After he’d hurried off, my mother remarked in a low voice, “What a beautiful young man. His features are quite striking. Did you see the color of his eyes?” “There was no missing them,” I had to admit. The boy’s beauty was hard to ignore. “Blue,” Mother said, a bit wistfully. “A clear blue, like the sky on a perfect day.” Then in a voice that was hardly audible she whispered, “I do hope your grandfather doesn’t catch a glimpse of him. That could only lead to trouble.” “It is a rather lovely night,” I said, making a show of looking at the stars in the sky. There was the gentle sound of footsteps approaching and I meant to give my mother warning in case she hadn’t heard them. “I should probably return to my cabin now or my husband will wonder where I’ve got off to,” Mother said. “It’s was very nice speaking with you. I hope you have a good night.” As she turned and left, an elderly couple approached, walking slowly, arm-in-arm. Part of me wondered why they were up at such an hour. And another part of me mourned that I would never have the chance to grow old with someone that I loved. The little French maid continued to be persistent in her quest to be of service to Mrs. Denkler, my sister and me. Emily reported that she had knocked on our door twice the next day. She even had the temerity to ask if she could check with me directly to see if I needed anything, even though Denkie had told her I was resting. Resting was not an accurate description of what I was doing in my oversized trunk. I couldn’t lie down completely straight and that made it a challenge to get comfortable. I tried not to thrash around too much because I didn’t know if there happened to be anyone lurking in my cabin. I didn’t want a maid or cabin boy to wonder about the rustling in Mr. Vanderlind’s enormous trunk. Emily tried reading to me to pass the time for both of us. After the initial excitement, she found life aboard ship too sedentary. I could have just as easily taken a book into the trunk with me, but it hadn’t occurred to me when I’d climbed in for the day. Turning my mind off was the problem. We vampires didn’t exactly sleep; we went into a state of repose that was supposed to be similar to deep meditation. At least that was what I had been told. So far I hadn’t been able to find any type of repose, sleep, meditation or otherwise. Eventually my sister became restless. “Would you mind if I went up on deck?” she asked, her voice apologetic. “Just for a little while. There’s shuffleboard up there and…” Her voice faded. I could tell she was trying to decide if she was being selfish. “Emily, don’t worry about me,” I told her. “I’ll be fine. You go and enjoy yourself. It’s what I want you to do. And take old Denkie with you. She could use some fresh air.” Emily giggled. She loved when I referred to Mrs. Denkler in this way. “I won’t be long,” she assured me and I could hear her getting to her feet. “Take as long as you like,” I insisted. “It’s not like I’ll be up and about until nightfall.” After Emily and Mrs. Denkler went out, I tried to turn my thoughts off and just focus on nothing. But my life had gone through so many changes in the last week that it made it almost an impossible thing to do. Even so, after an extended period of frustration, I eventually found myself starting slip into the void. That was until I heard somebody in my room. I was immediately jerked into consciousness by the slight creak of hinges being opened. Who was out there? I couldn’t begin to imagine. It wasn’t Emily or Mrs. Denkler. Of that I was convinced. Neither one of them had any cause to sneak into my cabin. Perhaps one them was looking for something and trying not to disturb me. I gave that idea some thought. But then I heard the light clinking of bottles and I was filled with rage. The only bottles I had in my room were my food supply. Why was someone rifling through my trunk? Was it the same person who had dumped the first bottle? Was he back to finish the job? I felt an impotent rage. I wanted to burst from my trunk and confront the scoundrel, but that was a bad idea for numerous reasons. There was nothing I could do but sit there, not making a sound, and hope the person was not doing what I suspected he might be doing. The bottles eventually stopped rattling, but then a more alarming sound reached my ears. It was someone trying to open the very trunk that contained me. He was fiddling with the lock. I froze, afraid even the slightest movement might give me away. The thief struggled with the lock for several minutes. Then there was the sound of a door opening and closing. I could hear the voices of Mrs. Denkler and my sister. The person standing outside my sleeping trunk instantly grew very quiet. And then I could hear him walking lightly across the room. I made a vow that if whoever was out there tried to hurt Emily or Denkie in any way, I would burst from my makeshift coffin and dispatch the thief to the great beyond. I thought I could probably cause their demise before the sun burnt me to cinders. Even with this resolve, I understood that even the smallest bit of sunlight was excruciatingly painful to a member of the undead. But it was a horror I would have to face in order to protect my family. Emily and Mrs. Denkler must have gone into their cabin for a moment because their voices grew more muffled, but they didn’t sound agitated in any way. I strained my ears in my custom-made prison for any sound that might indicate a struggle. All I heard was soft footsteps crossing the floor and the sound of a door being quietly pulled open and then shut again. With the click of the latch, I felt myself relax slightly. Whoever had been snooping meant my family no harm. The person was probably just a petty thief looking for easily concealable items. Several hours later, I felt the ease that comes over all vampires with the setting of the sun. While I waited a few minutes for the last rays of the day to dwindle, I listened for sounds of anyone being in the cabin that shouldn’t have been there. And then, feeling reasonably sure I had taken all necessary precautions, I popped the interior locks on my trunk and opened the lid. No one was in my cabin. That gave me some relief. I peeked out the door to glimpse Denkie and my sister reading books in our shared living space. They both looked perfectly fine. Then I turned to see what was missing from my room. A watch and chain, a pair of gold nail scissors, and a pearl lapel pin had all disappeared off of my bureau. These were annoying losses, but nothing to cause me great regret. I had shipped anything of real value when the contents of the castle were sent over. Taking a fortifying breath, I turned my attentions to my true concern; the trunk holding my food for the next few days. The lid was closed and I was reluctant to open it. But whatever had happened, I had to face it. Flipping open the lid, I surveyed the eleven bottles that had been so carefully packed. They were all empty. Someone had snuck into my cabin and drained every single one. Chapter 13 Colette “Good evening, Mr. Gibson,” Walter Bennett said. I could tell he was using his very best manners. “Mrs. Gibson.” There was a big smile on his face and he couldn’t stop from looking in Lilly’s direction. It struck me for the first time that my sister and Walter might be in love. It was more than likely what older people referred to as “young love” but that probably didn’t keep it from feeling any less real to them. “Good evening, Sir,” Lev said, shaking Papa’s hand. He was obviously part of the good-manner’s club. “Mrs. Gibson,” he said with a nod to our mother. “Good evening, boys,” Mama said. “That’s quite a bruise you’ve got there,” Papa said, referencing a purple discoloration and a small plaster high on Lev’s left cheek. Lev’s hand self-consciously flew up to gingerly touch his injury. “Nothing much,” he said rather quickly. “I was roughhousing with some friends and there was a little accident.” “Was anyone else hurt?” our mother asked, immediately concerned. “Oh. No, it was nothing like that,” Lev assured her. “A couple of us were wrestling where we shouldn’t have been and my face got banged on the corner of a table.” He touched his cheek again and then forced his hand back down to his side. “It looks a lot worse than it is.” The four of us piled into Lev’s new car. It was shiny black and showroom new. Lilly and Walter claimed the back seat, so that left me to sit up front with Lev. “What do you think of her?” Lev asked as he started the car up. “Isn’t she a beauty?” I was a little surprised that Lev had bothered to ask me a question. But seeing that he was really fishing for a compliment, it wasn’t too much of a shock. The sun was just starting to set, so there was still a lot of daylight left. I couldn’t help but notice as Lev gripped the wheel that his right hand was purpled and slightly swollen. “Did that happen while you were roughhousing, too?” I asked, nodding toward his hand. Lev glanced at his bruises and then shot me a rueful grin. “You could say something like that.” I wasn’t sure what to make of his comment, but I didn’t feel the urge to dig for details. If Lev had gotten into a fight with one of his friends, then that had nothing to do with me. And if afterward, they had decided to patch things up and just call it roughhousing, then that was their business, not mine. All I was obligated to do was be polite and go see the castle. Lev drove his car with surprising caution, keeping under the speed limit and being considerate of other motorists. He even showed remarkable patience when a farmer pulled his tractor out onto the road ahead of us and we had to inch along for several minutes until the man turned off the main road and onto a dirt one. I began to wonder if I’d misjudged Lev. Maybe he was just nervous during our first date. Male animals in the jungle were known to show off colorful plumage or magnificent manes to attract a mate. Maybe Lev’s constant bragging was just his ill-judged attempted to impress me. I decided I should at least try to give him another chance. When we reached the dirt road turnoff that led to the castle, Lev used additional caution, moving the car forward at a pace that was even slower than the tractor that had blocked our way. “Don’t want to scratch her,” Lev told me. “Her paint’s barely dry.” “Gee!” Lilly exclaimed when the castle finally came into view. “It’s just so massive.” I turned in my seat to look at her. It occurred to me that my sister probably hadn’t seen the castle much since the first day when the family had headed down to watch the barges come in. Or, if she’d gone with Papa, she’d been too busy daydreaming about Walter to notice any progress the workers had made. She wrinkled her nose. “It’s not very pretty, though.” “Most castles weren’t built to be beautiful,” Lev told her. “They were built to withstand a siege.” And then he added, “There are some pretty castles in Bavaria, though. My uncle travelled there when I was a kid and he sent me a lot of postcards. Really magical stuff. Straight out of the fairytales.” Thinking it over for a few seconds, he added, “I’d like to travel there one day.” My opinion of Lev was growing by leaps and bounds. But then he had to go and ruin it all by saying, “I’m descended from royal blood, of course.” No one in the car made a response to his comment. It just sounded like such a ridiculous exaggeration that I thought it would be better to ignore it. “If I showed my face in Europe, they’d probably try to clap a crown on my head,” Lev told us, just to make matters worse. “Is that what they did to your uncle?” Walter asked, causing my sister to giggle. “Well, he was invited to visit many of the royal houses,” Lev snapped, unwilling to just let it go. “Royalty recognizes royalty, even if it’s a distant connection.” I had promised myself to just sit there and bide my time through the date, but it was just too much. I really couldn’t let Lev keep bragging like he was next in line for the throne of England. “So what’s your lineage?” I asked him. “What?” Lev gave me a sharp look. “What is your heritage?” I wanted to know. “Which royal families are you descended from and how did you end up here, in America?” “That’s right, Lev,” Walter jeered. “Tell us your family tree.” The sunlight was almost gone, but I could see Lev growing pink under the collar. “I’ll have to ask my grandfather,” he said in a clenched voice. “He’s the family historian.” “Let’s get out and walk around a little before the sun goes completely down,” I suggested, in part to end the conversation and in part because I wanted to see if any of the Italian workmen were still lingering around the castle. “Sure,” Walter agreed. “Lev, why don’t you knock on the door? Introduce yourself. Let them know who you are.” “Alright, cut out the smart talk,” Lev growled, flashing his friend a menacing look. The smile quickly faded from Walter’s face. “Yeah. Sorry,” he said. “I was just joshing you.”",

      "content": "Prologue Jessie I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. Chapter 1 Colette “But it’s not fair,” Lilly insisted, her face a little flushed from trying to make her point. “How am I supposed to find a husband, if I can’t even go out on one date?” “Well,” Papa said, letting his voice drag a little as if he was giving the whole thing a lot of thought, “there’s what’s fair and there’s what’s right. I’m choosing to raise you girls with what’s right.” Lilly was not to be so easily defeated. “Tons of girls get married right out of high school and you won’t even let me go out on a date. Dorothy Smiley is engaged and she’s Lettie’s age,” she pointed out. “She’s only sixteen.” Mama and Papa were quiet for a moment, both frowning to themselves. Papa’s eyes shifted toward his wife. Mama cleared her throat. “Those are special circumstances,” she said, looking at the table instead of her daughter. “I don’t think Dorothy Smiley is a good example of how I want to raise my children.” I could tell by the way Mama folded her hands that she wasn’t going to speak any more about that topic, although I wasn’t sure why. Dorothy was a local girl who was always very popular with the boys. I think she’d been dating since she was fourteen. Whenever I saw her about town, she was always laughing and chatting with a bunch of boys clustered around her. They were drawn to her like bees to a flower. “But I’m graduating in just a few months. Don’t you think that most girls should have gone out on at least one date before they graduate from high school?” Papa gave her a stern look. “I’m never thought of my daughters as ‘most girls’ and I doubt I ever will.” “But Walter Bennett is really nice,” Lilly said, persisting in her cause. “He’s stopped by Zucker’s a bunch of times now and he’s always been perfectly polite.” My sister worked a few afternoons a week at the local five and dime. I knew that her prospective beau had come in several times under the excuse of needing one thing or another. He never spent much money, but he sure did take his time about shopping for whatever he needed. “How a boy behaves when he’s out in public and how he behaves when he’s alone with a girl can be two very different things,” Mama insisted. “But…” Lilly drew breath to continue her argument. Papa’s hand came down flat on the table. He didn’t bang it down like when he was angry about a client trying not to pay his bill, but I could tell his temper was starting to rise. “In my day, no nice girl would be seen out with a boy, unless she had a proper chaperone,” Mama said, trying to head-off Papa’s growing annoyance. A thought occurred to her. “Maybe that’s the solution?” “A chaperone?” Lilly all but wailed. “Mother, no one has a chaperone these days.” “Well I’m not letting this young pup come a courting without one,” Papa growled. I had to fight not to smile. No one said, “come a courting” anymore, as far as I knew. “No dear, that’s not what I meant,” Mama said, putting a gentle hand on her husband’s forearm. “I meant that my real objection to Lilly going out with this Walter fellow is that I don’t want her to be on her own with a boy she only knows from the five and dime.” Then Mama directed her gaze across the table toward me. “Maybe if Lettie was to accompany them. And they didn’t go anywhere in a car. They could always walk down to the diner for a soda.” Oh, great. Now I was being dragged into the mix. The last thing I wanted was to be a third wheel on my sister’s first official date with a boy. Lilly immediately turned to look at me, hope glowing in her eyes. “That could work,” she said, all too eagerly. “I’m sorry, but I think I’d feel very awkward,” I told them. I could just imagine sitting at the counter, reading a book and feeling like the whole town was pitying me as the poor, dateless sister of Lillian Gibson. “It wouldn’t be awkward,” Lilly insisted. “We’d include you in everything, I promise.” I knew my sister had every intention of making me feel comfortable and included on this hypothetical date, but I’d seen her flirting with Walter across the counter top. When he was around, she didn’t have eyes for anyone else. I even knew that Mr. Zucker had scolded her more than once for taking too long with only one customer while other people were waiting. “Well, what if it were to be a double date?” Mama suggested. “No,” Papa said, flatly. “Lilly is only sixteen.” “She’ll be seventeen soon enough,” Mama reminded him. “And we can’t keep our girls locked in the house forever. Even if we tried, the young men would eventually start crawling up the drainpipes to flirt with them.” I began to get nervous that both my parents were warming to the idea. “I’m afraid I don’t know anyone who would want to come along,” I hurriedly told them all. I didn’t have any particular boy who was a friend and it would be too embarrassing to ask a boy from school. I put my hand to my cheek, blushing at the mere thought of it. “Oh, I’m sure Walter has lots of nice friends,” Lilly said, practically bouncing in her chair. “I know there are tons of boys who would be happy to come along.” Then she added as an afterthought, “We could always do something to fix your hair,” My hands immediately flew to my hair. Had it already struggled out of its bun? My hair was a raucous gathering of curls and it never behaved the way I intended. “I meant we could tame it with hair tonic or something,” Lilly quickly added. I could tell she hadn’t meant to be unkind. “I…” I stammered. I knew Lilly desperately wanted to go on her date, and I hated to disappoint her, but the thought of being fixed up with a boy who had no desire to be out with me in the first place made me cringe. “I’m sorry, but I really don’t want to go,” I said, pushing my chair away from the dining room table. “And I have some homework to do before going to bed,” I told them before hurrying away, grateful that the dishes had already been cleared. I knew that if I sat there any longer then Lilly would persuade me into going. And that was the very last thing I wanted to do. I hurried upstairs, but not before I caught more of my father’s conversation. “I think your mother has a very good point,” he said to his eldest daughter. “No matter how much I dislike it, you girls are growing up. So you can go on your date…” “Oh Papa,” Lilly exclaimed, clapping her hands with excitement. “Wait, let me finish,” father said in his sternest voice. “You can only go if your sister accompanies you.” “Oh,” Lilly said, sounding more than a little forlorn. I hurried up the stairs before I could hear any more. It’s not that I didn’t want to see my sister happy. There was actually nothing I wouldn’t do for her. But I was pretty sure that she’d be able to convince our mother and father that she would be just as safe with one of her friends on a double date as she would with me. I probably should have been excited about the prospect of a double date, but I wasn’t. I liked boys well enough, I just didn’t happen to have a crush on any particular boy. Truth be told, I probably spent too much time reading Austen and the Brontes. I daydreamed of a love much bigger and more passionate that anything I imagined a local boy could provide. I closed the door to the room I shared with Lilly and then went over to perch on the cream colored dressing chair that I kept by the window. The window faced the backyard and I liked to pull open the curtains and sit there, gazing over the open fields behind our property. There had been quite a bit of construction in our little town of Tiburon, Ohio before the market crashed. But when the stocks all dropped, so did the building trade. At least it kept our home from being crowded by too many neighbors. Many of my free hours were spent looking out that window and thinking of my future. Where would I be in ten years? Would I still be in Tiburon, happily married and raising a family? Or did the world have more in store for me? The way the tree branches in our backyard swayed and waved let me know that the evening had turned quite breezy. The warm weather would find us eventually, but it wouldn’t be for another few weeks at the least. I heard Lilly coming up the stairs. She wasn’t exactly stomping her feet, — that’s something Papa would never allow — but I could tell she was unhappy. She said nothing as she came into our room. As a matter of fact, she took great pains to close the door very quietly. I turned toward her as she came in, but she wouldn’t look at me. “I’m sorry,” I said as she began brushing her hair in front of the vanity table that we shared. “I’m sure Mama and Papa would let you go on a double date with Betty Schaffer. Or maybe cousin Irene.” Our cousin was older and had been on lots of dates, so that felt like a safe bet. Lilly stopped her brushing and looked at me through the mirror’s reflection. “I already asked and Papa said no. He’s convinced that the only girl who will truly look out for my well being is you.” I had to wonder why our father was being so cautious. Neither of us girls had ever done anything to cause him any concern. We were conscientious at school and we did as we were told when home. Lilly even had a part time job and I one set up for over the summer. But I guess it was hard for him to accept that we were turning from girls into young women. At least that’s what Mama usually said. Walking across the room, I pulled my flannel nightgown off the hook on the back of the door. It was an evening to wear wool socks to bed. I thought I might get in a bit of reading before turning out the light. I still had some math problems to solve and a chapter of American history to go over, but I figured I could do that in the morning before school. “Won’t you please agree to come on a double date with me?” Lilly asked rather abruptly as I was climbing into bed with a book tucked under my arm. “You can borrow any of my things that you want. Anytime, without even asking. And I promise that Walter will fix you up with one of his really handsome friends. And I’ll help fix your hair and I’ll do the dishes all by myself for a month, you won’t even have to help me.” She was promising so much, I couldn’t help but giggle. It was obvious that she wanted this date with Walter more than she cared about me borrowing her tortoise shell combs or snagging her only pair of silk stockings. “Oh, alright,” I finally said, completely capitulating. “If it means that much to you.” “Really?” Lilly leapt to her feet. “You’ll really go?” “Yes, I’ll really go,” I told her, no matter how much I didn’t want to. “Oh, Colette,” Lilly exclaimed, rushing over to my bed and throwing her arms around me. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she said, kissing my cheek. “You’re the best sister ever.” In a burst of joy she did a twirl while crossing the room to snatch her nightgown off the hook. “I can’t wait to tell Walter.” Chapter 2 Jessie “You can’t be serious,” Daniel exclaimed, rising abruptly from his chair and nearly tipping it over in the process. “Ship the whole damn thing to America? Really, Grandfather, I think you’ve gone a bit mad.” “I assure you, my sanity is as sound as it’s ever been,” our grandfather growled, glaring across the table at my older brother. “And I am quite serious. I’ve made up my mind.” Doing his best to suppress his outrage, my brother dropped back into his chair and tried to compose himself. “Don’t you think the mortals might notice if a medieval castle suddenly sprang up in the middle of Manhattan? It might lead to a few questions, you know.” “That’s why we’re not moving to Manhattan,” our grandfather informed the family in general. My mother, Daniel, my younger sister Emily, and I were all sitting with him around our dining room table. “We’re staying out of New York altogether,” Grandfather announced. “You have to be joking.” Daniel was incredulous. “Are we moving to the wild to live with the savages? I guess we’d better remember to ship the moat. We’re going to need it.” “There’s more to America than just New York and the great plains,” our mother said in a calm voice that I knew she hoped was soothing. I suspected she had anticipated her father’s announcement to leave Budapest, so it didn’t come as much of a shock. “I’ve read that spots in the Midwest of America are quite developed now and can be remarkably lovely.” Daniel flashed Mother a look. “You don’t always have to take his side.” It wasn’t Mother’s habit to take her father’s side, but she did know how to pick her battles. This was one she probably knew she would lose, so she didn’t intend to fight. That or she had something else in mind and she was waiting to see how things played out. “But there isn’t even any society in America.” Daniel was not giving up so easily. “At least not our kind of society.” “There are more of our kind in America than you realize,” Grandfather informed him. “And there are more moving there every day. With Hitler grabbing for power, I think a great many of our kind will be leaving Europe in the next year or two.” “Oh.” Daniel appeared mollified. “You didn’t say we were going to be moving to an undead enclave. If we have our friends around us, then that will be different.” “I will not make our family a target by moving to an undead enclave,” Grandfather said flatly. “In fact, we’re moving to where no mortal would ever think to look for vampires.” “You can’t be serious!” Daniel said again, even though our grandfather was not a man who tended to make jokes. Laying both hands flat on the table, Grandfather looked Daniel square in the eye. “You are welcome to stay here,” he said. “But let me be clear about one thing. If you choose to stay, you will be cut off from the family without a cent.” His threat did the trick. There was no way in the world Daniel would be willing to give up his share of the Vanderlind fortune. That wasn’t in his nature. There was nothing he loved more than wealth and the power it brought. I knew this without a doubt. Daniel had been married once, not so many years ago, but when he was still mortal. His wife, Anna, had been a lovely girl who seemed to sincerely love him, for whatever reason. But she accidentally discovered our grandfather’s dark secret; the disease which he had methodically spread to his own children, accidentally killing one of his daughters in the process. Anna had wanted to flee the castle with her husband. She was convinced it was better to live a life of poverty than to make a deal with the devil. But Daniel had other ideas. He’d only been persuaded to marry her in order to procreate while he was still a mortal. Grandfather put great stock in not letting the Vanderlind line dwindle. But instead of escaping from evil with his wife, Daniel dragged Anna before our grandfather. I was barely sixteen, but I was convinced Grandfather would kill my sister-in-law. I went to confront him and did my best to save Anna, only to receive his disdain. “You’ve always been soft on mortals,” Grandfather told me, obviously disgusted by my compassion. “I happen to be a mortal,” I informed him, with all the bravery and ignorance that a sixteen year old boy could muster. “For the moment,” he informed me. “But your time will come, so enjoy your foolish mortal emotions while you can.” I knew that transforming into the undead could easily twist a human from a being filled with compassion to a creature filled with hate. I sincerely hoped that fate would not befall me when my time came to be transformed. Grandfather became a creature of the night at the age of twenty-four and he decided it was the ideal age for any vampire. So when each of his children turned twenty-four, he turned them, whether they wanted to be vampires or not. And he intended to do the same for his grandchildren; an event that Daniel looked forward to with great anticipation, but one that I dreaded. Grandfather arranged for all of his children to marry into wealth in order to expand our already sizeable family fortune, but the spouses of his offspring were not considered worthy enough to be transformed into the undead. My uncle’s wife and my own father had both mysteriously disappeared soon after my mother and uncle were made. The spouse of my aunt who had died during transformation also disappeared under mysterious circumstances, but he took his luggage and quite a bit of my aunt’s jewelry with him. After Daniel betrayed his wife, Grandfather decided to temporarily spare Anna’s life, although she essentially became a prisoner in the castle. She was to bare Daniel a few children before Grandfather would decide it was time for her demise. But Anna denied her husband any offspring by hanging herself from a chandelier a few months after her discovery of our family’s dark secret. Daniel was furious, but I admired her for her convictions. My brother never took another wife. When his maker’s day came, he was still childless. This greatly displeased Grandfather, but he turned Daniel anyway, deciding it would be up to Emily and me to keep the Vanderlind line alive. “Will our Uncle be moving with us?” my little sister screwed up the courage to ask as we all sat around the dining table, glaring at one another. She was madly devoted to our cousin Dorian, with that unique fervor of little girls. “Your Uncle will finish up business here before coming over. That should only take a year or two,” was Grandfather’s reply. But that didn’t exactly provide an answer to Emily’s real question. “What about Dorian?” I asked, deciding to help her out. “Will he be making the voyage with us or will he stay here and cross with his father?” Grandfather made a small, guttural sound in the back of his throat. “I haven’t decided yet on the safest place to keep your cousin.” Cousin Dorian was only a little older than I was, but he already had a keen eye for the ladies. It was all Grandfather could do to keep him from causing a scandal. “I still say this is all nonsense,” Daniel grumbled. “This is a big decision and I think it should be open to family discussion.” “You can think whatever you want,” Grandfather informed him. “But I’ve already purchased the land in America and the workmen will be arriving tomorrow to start dismantling the castle. I’ve already instructed Mrs. Denkler to oversee the servants while they pack up the household.” “Where are we going?” Mother asked. “Where is it in America that we are all moving to?” Grandfather leaned back in his chair, folded his hands, and smiled with some satisfaction. He was handsome, in a brutish short of way, and he appeared no older than his daughter, who appeared no older than her eldest son. “A nice little town in Ohio,” he assured us. “Right on the shore of the Tiburon River.” Chapter 3 Colette “They’re using only workers they’re bringing over from Europe,” my father grumbled from behind his newspaper as I sat down to breakfast the next morning. “I can’t believe that not one man from Tiburon is going to earn an honest day’s pay for that monstrosity they’re building on the edge of town.” “I’m not sure that warrants calling it a monstrosity,” mother said, trying her best to coax him back into a good mood as she served eggs and toast. “I hear that it’s an entire castle they’re moving from Hungary stone by stone. That sounds very exciting to me. I’ve always wanted to see a castle.” “I wonder why they’re moving here.” I couldn’t help but say aloud. “Europe is getting to be a real mess,” my father informed me. “That Hitler fellow is starting to cause all sorts of problems. I wouldn’t be surprised if that had something to do with it.” I was sure my father was right, but that wasn’t exactly what I meant. My question had more to do with why a wealthy family living in a cosmopolitan city like Budapest would then decide to move to the outskirts of a small town in the middle of Ohio. It wasn’t the first place I would choose to live if I had enough money to ship an entire castle all the way over from Europe. Lilly came hurrying into the breakfast room and slipped into her seat. Papa glanced at his watch. “Cutting it a bit close, aren’t you?” he asked. “I had trouble sleeping last night so it was hard to get up this morning,” she told him. That may have been true. I’d slept like a stone, so I couldn’t say for sure. But I also knew that Lilly had spent extra time in front of the mirror this morning, making sure her hair was perfect. She was going straight to her job at Zucker’s after school and I was sure she had plans for Walter to meet her there. “You’re not coming down with anything, I hope,” Mama said, reaching across the table to lay a hand on Lilly’s cheek. “You’re not warm, but you look a little flushed.” “I’m just excited,” Lilly told her. “Lettie’s agreed to go, so I’m going to have my first date with Walter.” Papa gave me surprised look. “Is that true, Colette?” “Yes,” I admitted. “Lilly talked me into it.” “Oh,” Papa said with a frown. I got the feeling he had been counting on me not giving in and so his plan of keeping his daughters from dating had backfired. “That’s very nice of you,” Mama told me, not glancing in her husband’s direction. “But we are expecting both of you to behave very responsibly on this date and not let it go to your heads.” “We won’t, Mama,” Lilly quickly assured her. As far as I knew, the date was just to be Walter and a friend escorting us to the diner for a soda and then home again. I couldn’t see how drinking a soda while sitting at the counter of Top’s Diner could go to anyone’s head. Lilly had to hurry through breakfast or we were going to be late. Tiburon didn’t have anything as fancy as a school bus, so Lilly and I had to walk to the high school when the weather was fine. Papa would give us a lift if it was too cold or wet to walk, but it had to be awfully cold or very, very wet for that to be deemed necessary. As we headed toward school, Lilly was practically dancing on air. She linked her arm through mine and skipped along. “Lettie, have I told you how much I love you?” she asked. “You’re the best sister ever.” I had to laugh. “Would you be saying that if I hadn’t agreed to chaperone your date?” My sister pretended to think it over. “Well, I would still love you, I suppose, but you’d probably lose the title of best sister.” By the time Lilly came home from her job that evening and we’d all sat down for supper, things were practically settled with Walter. “He’s going to ask his friend Lev Wilson,” she told the family as we ate. “And if Lev is free, we’re going out on Friday night.” I felt my stomach drop a little. It was already Wednesday. I didn’t think my first date with a boy would be thrust upon me so quickly. “Lev Wilson,” Papa repeated, mulling the name over. “Didn’t he used to be on the football team for Tiburon High?” “Yes, I think he was the quarterback or something a few years ago,” Lilly told him. “Walter said that he was offered a scholarship to Notre Dame, but that his father had a heart attack the summer before he was going to start so he couldn’t go.” “I remember hearing something about that,” Papa said as he cut his meat. “Sounds like he’s a boy with good values; not abandoning his family like that.” “I’m sure all of Walter’s friends are very nice,” Lilly was quick to assure him. I wondered if that was because things weren’t confirmed with Lev and Lilly didn’t want to jeopardize the date, if I should have to be escorted by another boy. “The boat for the castle is arriving early tomorrow morning,” Papa said, abruptly changing the topic. He probably didn’t want to linger over thoughts of his daughters actually going out on a double date. “I just found out Bill Galler out of Akron is going to oversee the day laborers that were hired to help out.” “We should all drive over early and take a look,” Mama suggested. “And then we could drop the girls at school.” Papa rubbed his chin. “I would like to see what they’re up to,” he mused. “Bill says the pay is pretty good. Men are driving in from as far as Columbus.” “Good,” Mama said, a small smirk playing across her lips that her husband was now interested in seeing the monstrosity. “It’s settled then.” Our father had a professional interest in the assembling of the castle. He ran a small construction company and had built several of the larger houses and a few of the businesses around town. When the market crashed, his business shrunk down to building garages and assembling houses that people had order from the Sears & Roebuck catalog. But he’d built our lovely home himself, and the property was paid for, so we were better off than most, although we did have to keep our day-to-day living lean. There were butterflies in my belly as I climbed into bed that evening and they weren’t about the fast approaching double date. I was excited about the castle. It just sounded so romantic; I couldn’t help but wonder who would live there. Did they have any children? And if yes, would those children attend Tiburon High? It seemed incongruous for someone who lived in a real European castle to simply go to the local high school. I was pretty sure if there were any children living at the castle, they would probably have tutors or attend boarding school. When it was time to get up extra early the next morning, I did not want to leave my bed. Not because I wasn’t excited about my day, but because I was having the most wonderful dream and I didn’t want to let it go. There was a boy who was tall and handsome with dark hair and pale skin. He had me wrapped in his arms and he was trying to say something to me, something wonderful. But then there was Lilly, shaking my arm. “It’s time to get up,” she told me. “If you want to miss seeing the boats bringing in the stones for the castle, then go right on sleeping.” I scrambled out of bed and hurried to get ready. But as I dressed for the day, I tried to cling to the fragments that I could remember from my dream. It was just too wonderful not to savor. But it quickly faded, as dreams usually do, and I was left with just a vague yearning for a boy who I would probably never meet. The Tiburon River ran to the south of the town and the castle was to be reassembled on its northern bank. It was officially a river, but not a very mighty one. There was no way for a cargo ship massive enough to make a transatlantic voyage to sail down the waterway. So the stones of the castle were offloaded from the ship somewhere out east and loaded onto railcars. At some point they were then loaded onto shallow-bottomed barges that usually traversed the Ohio River and wended their way to the Tiburon River. And eventually the pieces and parts of the castle reached Tiburon. Papa drove the car down a dirt road. Eventually the road petered out so we had to walk about a quarter of a mile after that to get to the river. The barges had already arrived and were lined up along the bank ten deep. Working the barges were dozens of men, covered in grime, with dark, ruddy faces and fierce bright eyes shouting to each other in a language that was unrecognizable to me. Local men swarmed the landing where the stones were being offloaded. A couple of large platforms with winches had been erected on the land to transfer the large stones, some of which were as small as a child’s Radio Flyer red wagon. Other stones were as large as large as a Model T. The stones were a uniform dark gray in color and each was tagged with a number in bright red paint. I assumed that was so the workers would know how to put the castle back together again. A massive foundation had already been dug into the ground about thirty yards from where the barges were being unloaded. Men were standing in a long line, passing stones about the size of a pound of flour hand-over-hand into the foundation like firemen passing buckets to quench a fire. My father’s friend, Bill Galler, was standing near the edge of the foundation, so Papa strode over to speak to him. Mama, Lilly and I followed in his wake. We knew nothing about the workings of a construction site beyond to stay out of the way. That was a lesson our father had made clear since we were very little girls. “How’s it going, Bill?” Papa asks, shaking the other man’s hand with a firm grip. “Seems like half of Columbus must have come up here today. Where’s everybody sleeping.?” “There’s a small tent city on the other side of the woods,” Bill told him. “A couple of tents for Americans and then another one for the foreigners.” “Why didn’t they hire more local men from here in Tiburon, if you don’t mind me asking?” Papa inquired, not sounding pleased, but not sounding angry either. “Don’t know,” Mr. Galler said, taking off his hat and wiping his brow, even though it was a chilly morning. “I was as surprised as anyone when I got the call offering me the job.” After thinking it over he said, “It might be my name. Galler is Hungarian, you know. My family came over about fifty years ago. We don’t think much about the connection anymore, but that might be it. Or maybe I just got lucky.” Clapping my father on the shoulder, he said, “Either way, I’m sure it wasn’t an intentional snub on you. Or anyone in Tiburon,” he added. “Sure looks like you have your work cut out for you,” Papa said, surveying the line of men moving the smaller stones. “What’s going on with this foundation?” “It’s a dungeon, if you can believe it,” Mr. Galler told him, causing Lilly and I to exchange quick looks. “It’s a real honest-to-goodness medieval castle and those things usually came with a dungeon back in the day. At least that’s my understanding.” “I hope they don’t intend to use it as one now,” Papa said, taking a few steps closer to the massive hole and peering around. “Not that I know of,” Mr. Galler told him. “There’s not a lot of communication on this end, but my understanding is that it’s to be used for storage.” He put his hat back on his head. “That or as guests bedrooms.” When my father gave him a questioning look, he cracked into a smile. His comment made Papa chuckle. “Well, I suppose if they’re trying to keep things historically accurate then they have to put in the dungeon.” He rubbed his chin. “As a matter of fact, I may have a use for it.” When Mr. Galler gave him a curious look, he added, “A couple of young fellows are taking out my daughters on Friday night.” “Well I don’t blame them boys,” Mr. Galler said, shooting us a smile over his shoulder and tipping his hat to our mother. “Your girls have turned out quite pretty. I’m sure there are many young men here about who would like to have that honor.” “Speaking of our girls, I believe we’d better get going,” Mama said, interjecting herself into the conversation. “We don't want them to be late for school.” Papa looked reluctant to leave the bustle of the worksite. “Would you mind taking them over there on your own, Lillian?” he asked. My older sister had been name after our mother. “I’d sure like to stick around awhile.” He looked at Mr. Galler. “If you don’t mind, Bill.” “Be happy to have you,” Mr. Galler said. “I’ve never worked on anything this big before. I guess this is the closest I’ll ever get to erecting a skyscraper in New York City.” “Fine with me,” Mama said, trying to keep the glee from her voice. She loved any reason to drive the car when our father wasn’t around. And, with things being so slow for his work, Papa was around more often than not. “Should I swing back to pick you up before lunch?” Papa cast a questioning eye in Mr. Galler’s direction. “My wife came down with me to stay a few weeks,” was the man’s reply. “She always packs my pail with enough food for three men.” “How about I just swing by before I get super started?” Mama asked, smiling at the two men. Papa was downplaying it all, but it was obvious he was as excited about the construction of the castle as some men get about a new car. “That’ll be fine, Lillian,” Papa said. “Come along, girls,” Mama said, putting an arm around Lilly and the other around me. “We’d better hurry or you’ll be tardy.” We turned to start heading back to the car. I really would have rather stayed and watched the men work, than sit staring at the blackboard while Mr. Wilmore droned on about the quadratic formula, but I knew I would never be allowed to stay. Still, as we left, I felt a great longing to know more about the castle and its future inhabitance. “Please, Mr. Galler,” I said, quickly ducking back around. “What is the name of the family who is going to live here?” Mr. Galler smiled. He seemed like a very genial man. “Vanderlind, I believe,” he told me. As far as I know, the family’s name is Vanderlind.” “Vanderlind,” I said to myself as I turned to catch up with my mother and sister. The name had a dashing quality to it, like a character written by Sir Walter Scott. I couldn’t help but glance back over my shoulder again to catch another glimpse of the massive stones being moved ashore for the construction of the Vanderlind Castle. Chapter 4 Jessie “I want you to glean as much information as you can about this move from your grandfather,” Mother said in a low voice as she pretended to straighten my tie. “Don’t make it obvious, but listen whenever you can.” It was the night after Grandfather had dropped his bombshell about the move. One of the other vampire families was throwing a ball and we had dressed accordingly. “What kind of information?” I asked her, also keeping my voice low. My tie was already perfect; the adjustment of it was just a pretense. My mother gave just the hint of a shrug. “Anything.” she said. “Where is it? That would be good for a start. I can’t even find Tiburon, Ohio on a map. And who is in charge of the construction? Any details about the town or the voyage would be helpful. Just tell me anything you hear.” “I think Mrs. Denkler will probably know more about that than anyone,” I told her. Mrs. Denkler was the castle house keeper and seemed to know more about our family than was normally healthy for a mortal. Grandfather trusted her implicitly, which was saying a lot. He’d even offered to turn her a few times, but she’d refused. “If you’d only made me the offer when I was still young and beautiful,” she would always tell him, “then I would have jumped at the chance.” There seemed to be a steady supply of mortals in Europe who were willing to work for the undead — I didn’t know if that was because they were hoping to become undead themselves or because vampires usually paid a little better — but Mrs. Denkler showed a devotion to our family that was above and beyond ordinary mortal loyalty. “You know that Denkie has always been my father’s agent,” Mother said, ruining the shape of the tie just so she would have to wrap it again. I nodded. She was right. “I’ll keep my ears open,” I assured her. “And…” Mother hesitated for a moment. “No words about this to your brother or Emily. Let’s just keep this conversation between us.” “Understood,” I said with a nod. “Now you look extra handsome,” Mother said in a brighter voice, stepping back to admire her handy work. “I can only imagine how well you’ll look once you’ve been turned. There won’t be a girl in the New World who can resist your charms.” I always felt awkward when anyone made a joke about me chasing after girls. I was old enough to find the opposite sex very appealing, but I wasn’t exactly “girl crazy”. Or at least that was how my cousin Dorian was frequently described. What I truly wanted — and wasn’t willing to ever admit aloud — was someone to love and cherish with every fiber of my heart. And to know in my soul that the girl felt the same way about me. But, given the circumstances of my family, I doubted I would ever have the opportunity to fall in love. Unless I could find a way to escape my grandfather’s clutches and elude the family curse. I was only seventeen, so at least I still had a few years to try. As we planned our transatlantic voyage, Mother was adamant that Mrs. Denkler book everyone separate cabins, using different names for each member of the family. Grandfather was reluctant. “That would be like saying we’re ashamed to be Vanderlinds,” he insisted. I assumed that Grandfather was only being stubborn because using separate cabins was someone else’s idea. “But just think, Father,” our mother implored him. “If one of us was to be accidentally discovered, the whole family could be wiped out.” Shaking her head and frowning, she added, “No. The more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that we must take separate cabins. I wouldn’t even be opposed to separate ships.” But on this point, Grandfather was firm. He could see the sense in the family having separate cabins and traveling under assumed names — travel documents were easy enough to have forged — but he would not hear of separate ships. Eventually Mother had to concede. I said nothing to anyone, but I had the strong suspicion that all our mother really wanted was the separate cabins. She brought up the separate ships so that her father would have something to rail against and feel satisfied. It was finally settled that Emily and I, being the only two family members who still remained mortal, would travel together under the Vanderlind name. The rest of the family would travel under different assumed names. We would not associate with each other except by the most casual of meetings. My uncle and cousin would follow later, once all the business of the Vanderlind estate was settled. Arranging for the boat was actually the easiest things to organize when compared to the numerous tasks necessary for our move to America. It was all well and good for my grandfather to announce that we were leaving for America, but orchestrating the move was a monumental task. First we Vandlerinds had to decide on the necessities we needed for the next several months. Our essentials were packed and transported to a large estate that Grandfather had rented. Then the servants had to pack their own possessions and join us. After that the entire contents of the castle was packed and stored in a warehouse. That made room for several architects, carpenters and electricians to come in and take apart the rooms that had been modernized with wood floors, also removing the doors, woodwork and light fixtures. After that the stone masons came in, numbering every single stone that comprised the castle so it could be disassembled. The top stones of the castle were sent to a warehouse while the bottom stones of the structure were loaded onto numerous freight trains. They crossed several countries before being loaded onto a massive cargo ship that headed out across the Adriatic and on its way to America. It was unsettling to see the hole where the castle had sat for the last couple of centuries, like viewing the gap left after a tooth has been ripped from the mouth of a giant. But there was hardly time to reflect upon our departure due to an absurd number of bon voyage parties that were thrown in our honor. There were parties in the country with horseback riding and polo. There were parties in the city on rooftops that could only be accessed by the air. All mortals had to be carried up by the undead. There was even an elaborate banquet in the catacombs under Buda Castle followed by dancing. Each of our undead hosts did his or her best to outshine the previous party. I began to feel that the parties had started to spiral out of control in terms of ostentation. The entire experience of having our friends wish us farewell was rather exhausting. Especially for a mortal like me, because the parties usually ran until just before dawn. As one of the guests of honor, it would have been considered the height of bad manners for me not to stay until the bitter end. The months of constant bacchanal probably explained why, when an outbreak of scarlet fever ravaged through the streets of Budapest, I was quick to be overpowered by the malady. Chapter 5 Colette It turned out that Lev Wilson was available Friday night and the double date was arranged. Lilly was behind the moon. My feelings were more reserved. I just couldn’t imagine what I would have to talk about with a young man of twenty who worked doing… I couldn’t even remember what he did for a living. That’s how little I was interested in the date. “You don’t actually have to say that much,” Lilly told me as we were getting ready and I expressed my concerns. “All you really have to do is smile, be pleasant and listen when he talks. You can do that much, can’t you?” “I’m sure I can,” I assured her, but the very idea of just smiling and nodding at a young man made me dread the date even more. I knew there were plenty of girls at school who would laugh their heads off whenever a boy said anything even remotely funny, but I couldn’t bring myself to be so mindless. Why should I pretend a boy is interesting or charming or intelligent when he’s not? It seemed to me that just gave the male half of the species a false sense of superiority. Of course this wasn’t something I could say to most girls or they would stare at me like I’d lost my mind. “Questioning a boy’s intelligence is no way to land a husband,” a friend’s older sister once told me when a few of us had been invited to their house for a sleep-over and I had brought up my thoughts on the subject. The only person I could really share my feelings about wanting more out of life than to be a wife and mother was my friend Lois. She was top in our class. She even had her father petition the school so that she could enroll in some of the advanced science and early engineering classes that girls were usually discouraged from taking. She’d already been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and they barely accepted any women. We’d talked about me moving with her to Cambridge and getting an apartment together when she started college. I was sure I could probably find work as a secretary somewhere. My typing skills were quite good. But Lois was also madly in love with a fellow student, Laurence, who was nearly as smart as her. I had a feeling they would get married after graduation and start their collegiate careers as husband and wife. Lilly spent almost as much time taming my hair for our double date than she did fixing her own. Most women tried to get a wave into their hair while I was constantly battling my waves for fear they would upset a ship or two. “You’re just so very pretty,” Lilly said, once she was finished styling my hair and was gazing over my shoulder at our reflections in our dressing table mirror. “I think I’m half afraid to introduce you to Walter. He might like you best.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her, knowing that she was teasing. “I’m sure your beau won’t even notice me.” Lilly broke into a smile. “I hope you’re right.” I decided to wear my favorite green dress with the little white flowers on it. The cotton fabric was too light for the chilly evenings we were still experiencing, but I’d outgrown my heavier plum-colored dress and didn’t have much else to wear. Lilly was dressed quite smartly and I felt I should at least try to match her appearance. It would look odd if she was in a dress and I was just wearing a wool skirt and sweater. At the last minute, Lilly misplaced one of her favorite gloves and you would have thought she’s lost a diamond ring, the way she savaged our room looking for it. I finally discovered that it was still in the pocket of her coat. She’d overlooked it in her haste. Walter and Lev arrived promptly at six thirty, their skin well scrubbed and their hair filled with so much oil that I knew mother was afraid to ask them to sit down for fear they’d leave two matching stains on back of the couch. Many women tatted doilies for their couches just to protect them from such a menace. My sister was telling the truth when she said Lev was handsome. He had a strong chin and a defined brow. He looked just like a fictional football hero, which was what he had actually been only a few years earlier. I had no interest in sports, but I could see he was a very muscular young man and I thought I remembered seeing him around town, usually followed by a swarm of giggling girls. In a way, that made me feel better. If Lev had the attention of a lot of females, then there was no fear of him becoming interested in me as a potential sweetheart. I was sure he was probably perfectly nice, but a sporty-type of beau didn’t interest me in the least. I did notice that a few of the knuckles on Lev’s hands had plasters on them. He kept his hands clasped discretely behind his back most of the time. I scanned my memory again for what kind of work he did, but came up with nothing. Whatever it was, a few abrasions would probably teach him to remember his work gloves. March had come in like a lion and stayed that way. I could tell Lilly was reluctant to bundle up and run the risk of wrinkling her immaculately ironed dress, but she did it without voicing a complaint under the watchful eye of our mother. I layered a sweater over my green dress before adding my coat. I saw no reason to come down with a cold just because my sister had a crush. Finally we were out the door and heading toward town. The Gibson house wasn’t exactly in the country, but we were definitely on the outskirts of town so we had a bit of a walk ahead of us. That didn’t matter; Lilly and I were used to the exercise. Lilly and Walter took the lead, walking side-by-side and rather close together. Lev kept his pace even with mine and began talking, so I did my part to try to listen. His conversation seemed to focus mostly on football, which made listening more of a challenge. I had no idea why anyone would be so interested in a bunch of grown men running up and down a field chasing after a ball. It’s seemed oddly childish to me, as if Lev still enjoyed playing with blocks or flying paper airplanes. But he didn’t ask me any questions, so it was easy enough to pretend to be interested. All I had to do was nod every few sentences and to smile whenever he paused to look in my direction. But I did find it remarkably rude that Lev had not taken the trouble to ask me one question about myself. I knew I was just a girl in high school, so chances were good I didn’t have too much to say that a man of twenty would find interesting, but good manners seemed to dictate that he at least try to ask me about myself. Seated at the counter at Top’s, everyone seemed to be having a good time. Everyone but me, of course. Lilly and Walter were laughing and chatting and generally making themselves cozy. Lev stopped yammering at one point and took a long pull on his soda. I could easily imagine that his throat was dry. I felt it was probably my turn to say something, but I really hadn’t been paying enough attention to keep our current thread of conversation going. So I decided I might as well bring up something I found interesting for a change. “Who are some of your favorite authors?” I was bold enough to inquire. “Authors?” Lev all but sputtered on his drink. “Yes,” I said, not sure why my question was being treated as so shocking; I hadn’t ask him the brand of briefs he preferred. “Who do you like to read?” “I don’t,” he told me, wrinkling his nose in disgust, as if I’d just asked him what dress he liked to wear. “I read the paper and maybe an owner’s manual now and then, but I never read for pleasure.” He pulled another face. “Why would I?” That was it. I wanted to go home. Lev may have been handsome and well-built, but reading was one of my favorite things in the whole world and I could never be interested in a boy who not only did not read, but ridiculed me for taking enjoyment in it. I immediately gave up all attempts at trying to pay attention to the words coming out of Lev’s mouth and started covertly watching the clock behind the counter. We had to be home by nine, so that meant leaving Top’s by eight-forty at the latest. The end of my first official date with a boy couldn’t come soon enough. Chapter 6 Jessie “Stick out your tongue, young man,” the doctor instructed and I did as I was told. “Yes, it’s as I expected,” the doctor said after taking several moments to examine my mouth and throat. “It’s definitely scarlet fever. Quite a bad case, I’m afraid.” “How soon will he be able to travel?” my grandfather asked. After months of packing, shipping and attending farewell parties, we were to leave Budapest in five days and I didn’t even feel like I could get out of bed. My head ached fiercely and my throat was so sore I could barely even swallow a little broth. There was a red rash covering most of my body. It itched something fierce, but I was usually too tired to scratch. The doctor gave Grandfather an astonished look. “I’m not sure you understand the current health of this young man,” he said in a low, yet serious voice. “He will not be able to do anything but rest for at least a month.” Then, glancing at my mother, he added, “I do not wish to alarm you, but there is a chance that he might not recover if he isn’t treated with great care.” “What are you on about?” Grandfather thundered. “Of course he’ll recover. Don’t be absurd. I’m just trying to decide if we can still set sail for America at the end of the week.” I was sure there was more to the conversation, but I was too tired to listen. I felt both clammy and chilled. My throat was on fire, yet I couldn’t manage to swallow much water whenever it was brought to my lips, even though I was parched. I must have slipped into the throws of the fever for some time because the next thing I remember I could hear Mother and Grandfather talking as they stood to one side of my bed. I held very still and just listened, keeping my eyes closed. I knew if I gave any indication I was awake, my mother would turn all of her attentions to me and I wanted to hear what they had to say. “I don’t understand why you can’t just set sail with Daniel,” my mother was saying. I could tell from the tone of her voice that she was trying to keep her emotions under control. “When Jessie regains his strength, the three of us will join you.” “I suppose you intend to keep Emily here with you?” Grandfather snarled. “Of course,” Mother said, as if any other option was simply absurd. “She’s still a little girl. She needs to be with her mother. I’m not sending her off with the likes of you and Daniel. Young girls need kindness, not to be toyed with like a cat toys with a mouse.” “I would not toy with my grandchild,” Grandfather exclaimed, his voice starting to sound like thunder. “I didn’t mean you,” Mother informed him. “Now I love all of my children equally,” she said, “but I think I also understand the nature of each of my children. I’m afraid that Daniel would not be able to resist tormenting a mortal child, even if she is his own sister.” This silenced Grandfather for a moment. He knew Mother was right. But he also probably suspected she had ulterior motives. My mother did not want her children to be members of the undead. “I don’t see why we don’t just turn him now and save ourselves the trouble,” Grandfather said, his voice conveying that my illness was causing him to feel put upon. “No!” Mother said, rather sharply. “He’s only seventeen. He’s too young to be turned.” “He’s not that young,” Grandfather insisted. “He’s almost a man.” “Being almost a man and being a man are two very different things,” Mother insisted. “You wouldn’t want to leave him stuck on the edge of manhood for eternity.” “I suppose not,” Grandfather muttered, pulling on his bottom lip. My fever must have started to rise again because after that I didn’t remember much else beyond the doctor’s concerned face hovering over my bed. He looked very grave and I remember thinking that he was about to tell Mother I was going to die. I should have been so lucky. Later that night, I remember hearing a noise and opened my eyes to see my grandfather looming over my bed. “What is it, Grandfather?” I asked in a hushed voice, not wanting to make too much noise, my head ached so badly. “The doctor has his doubts that you will survive,” Grandfather said, his voice cold and emotionless. “And we’ve already booked our tickets for America.” My eyelids felt heavy, but I tried to peer through the dark. Was Grandfather actually angry that my illness was ruining his plans? “I’m sorry,” I said. It didn’t really make sense to me to apologize, but I had no idea what he wanted from me and I couldn’t think of anything else to say. “I will not have your weakness prevent this move,” he informed me. “Your mother has offered to stay behind with Emily to nurse you, but we both know that means I would never see any of you again.” I said nothing. I was too weak to put up a fight. It was clear that he had made up his mind and nothing I could do would stop him. “So I am to be seventeen forever?” Grandfather bent over me, pushing my head to one side. “You’re going to be a Vanderlind forever.” Then I felt a hot sting on my neck like two hornets had synchronized their attack. Grandfather had his mouth pressed against my flesh and I knew he was feeding from me, draining me of all my blood at a rapid rate. I wanted to fight him, but the fever had left me as weak as a kitten. I could barely raise my hands in protest. And when I did try to defend myself, he immediately pinned me to the bed. As I lay there, I could feel the blood draining from my body. First my feet went numb. It was like standing outside too long in the snow. Then I could no longer feel my hands. Shortly after that I could feel my heart struggling to beat in my chest. I must have cried out as I struggled to cling to my last moments of life because suddenly my mother burst through the door. “Father! What are you doing?” she shrieked. Then she raced across the room and wrenched him away from my shuddering form. “He was going to die anyway,” Grandfather insisted. “I’m just facing the inevitable.” “But he’s just a boy.” Mother was weeping with rage and grief. “You should at least give him the chance to become a man.” “It’s too late now,” Grandfather informed her. “I’ve drunk too much. He’s going to die now, either way. The only question you have to answer is whether I bring him back.” “No!” Mother dropped to her knees, clutching my hand. “Oh, my darling Jessie. I should have known. I should have known he would try to do this to you,” she said between sobs. I opened my mouth to try to speak. I wanted to tell her to just let me die. My body was already feeling much warmer. I felt like I was floating in a lake on a sunny day. The pain of my illness had been washed away. I was ready to face the afterlife. Chapter 7 Colette “I’m sorry, Lilly, but I honestly don’t want to go.” “What are you talking about?” my sister exclaimed. We were in the backyard the next morning, clearing out the weeds that had survived the winter, and turning over the soil in Mama’s vegetable patch. “Lev said he had a wonderful time. He wants to see you again.” “I just don’t think we have very much in common,” I told her as I tugged at a dead thistle, its little stingers piercing my worn work gloves in a few spots. “Men and women never have much in common,” she told me. “You shouldn’t let that bother you.” “He doesn’t even like to read,” I grunted, still battling the plant. “Not at all.” “You put too much stock in reading,” Lilly said. “I think you’ll find most men don’t care for it.” “Papa likes to read,” I pointed out. The thistle finally gave up the fight and I tumbled a little to one side as it released its grip on the soil. “He reads all the time.” “Yes, but Papa is an educated man,” Lilly pointed out. “I think I would prefer an educated man,” was my response. “Yes, but it’s not Lev’s fault he’s not educated. He was going to go to college,” my sister insisted. I really couldn’t imagine Lev in a collegiate atmosphere. He just didn’t appear that bright. I wondered if this was something I should mention to Lilly. “Please, Lettie,” Lilly pleaded. “You know Walter and I can’t go out again unless you go with us. And I really, really like him.” “I’d be happy to meet another one of Walter’s friends,” I told her. “You said he knew a lot of nice boys.” Lilly let her shoulders slump. “But what about Lev? Don’t you think that would hurt his feelings?” “Lilly,” I couldn’t help but say, “we went out on one date for a soda. It’s not as if we were going steady or anything. Besides, I doubt Lev is desperate for female attention. I’m sure there are a lot of girls who would be happy to listen to him talk about football.” Lilly widened her eyes a little, believing she had figured something out. “Is that why you don’t want to see him again? Because he talked too much about football?” “It’s not the only reason,” I told her. “Then what is?” Sighing, I pulled at a few more shriveled weeds. “He never asked me about myself,” I said, feeling a little foolish for no reason. “Not one thing.” “Oh, is that all?” Lilly said, dusting some soil from her gloved hands. “You don’t understand,” I told her. “If there had been just a photograph of me there in my place, it would have been the same to Lev. And when he finally stopped speaking for a moment, and I asked him a question, he ridiculed me.” Standing up, I brushed some dried grass from my legs. “I’m sorry,” I told her, picking up my hoe. “I don’t want to prevent you from seeing your beau, but I will not go out on another date with Lev Wilson.” “But…” Lilly started to protest. “I don’t see why I have to be miserable, just so you can be happy,” I told her chopping vigorously at the soil with the hoe. “Just explain to Walter that Lev and I didn’t hit it off and have him fix me up with another boy. Or none at all, for all I care. I’ll just bring a book on your next date and be a third wheel.” “No, that’s alright,” Lilly hastened to say. “I’ll just tell Walter you need someone who is a little more intellectual. He should understand that.” That afternoon was the first time I rode my bike out to the castle. It hadn’t been my intention. My original destination was the library to hunt for a new book to read, but somehow I found the wheels of my bike rolling toward the shores of the Tiburon River. And the next thing I knew, I was admiring the progress that had been made on reconstructing the castle. I knew better than to get too close to the work in progress. I didn’t want to be in the way. But even from a distance, I could see the walls of the castle starting to rise. The dungeon must have already been finished and the stones for the ground floor in place. I had somehow thought they would build the exterior walls first and then fill in the middle, but they appeared to be building everything up, layer by layer. All of the stones from the barges had been off-loaded onto the shore. The boats themselves had disappeared; probably they were headed back down to the Ohio River. There was still a massive pile of rocks on the shore, but I had heard a second round of barges would arrive with more stones once the first pile had been cleared. It was amazing the amount of progress the stone masons had done in only a few days. But the sheer number of people reconstructing the castle probably made the whole thing go quicker than expected. There didn’t seem to be very many windows to the castle. None at all, as far as I could tell. I thought about the drawings and photographs of castles I’d seen in books. There never were any windows. That made sense, especially if a castle’s primary purpose was to defend its inhabitants against a siege. There was no sign of the Vanderlind family. It seemed unlikely that they would arrive before the castle was completely finished. Wealthy people probably hated being inconvenienced even more than us regular folks. I knew it was foolish, but I couldn’t wait for the Vanderlinds’ arrival. I didn’t think the family would actually socialize with people from Tiburon, but it would be exciting to see a few of them as they drove through town, or maybe catch a glimpse of them as they entered the policemen’s ball, or stopped by to pay a call on the mayor. I imagined it would be like catching a glimpse of royalty. I had read how the English who owned grand houses would have a day each month when their homes were open to the public. That way regular folks could come in and admire the art and finery. I sincerely hoped that the Vanderlinds would adhere to that sort of tradition, so that I would have a chance to see inside the castle. It was something I wanted very much and I just knew there had to be a way. That night I dreamt of the Vanderlind Castle. Or at least I had a dream about a castle and decided it was how the castle being built on the other side of town should look. In my dream there was a fine family with a mother and father, an aging dowager, and several children of varying ages. My dark haired boy was the middle child. He was there, playing croquet on the lawn with his brothers and sisters. I wasn’t sure why I was there. Things were vague, as they sometimes are in dreams. But as the dark haired boy was lining up a shot, he looked up and smiled at me, his dark eyes twinkling in the sunlight. When I woke up the next morning, I took several minutes to luxuriate in my bed. I knew the memories of my dark haired boy would slip away soon enough, so I wanted to savor them while I could. It probably wasn’t healthy to pine for a boy who was only a product of my imagination, but for a few moments I decided to just indulge in my secret fantasies. My sister’s desire to spend time with Walter would brook no opposition. When, after a few days of constant pressure, pleading, and offered bribes yielded no results, Lilly realized that Walter really would have to wrangle another of his friends. I hoped for one with a smaller head, but with a bit more going on upstairs. And that’s exactly what Walter did. He must have combed through every boy he’d ever met to fix me up with a very studious fellow named Herschel Tuft. He was a grade above me at school and he had won the Tiburon High School mathematics prize three years running. It turned out that Walter and Herschel were second or third cousins — I wasn’t exactly sure of their family connection — but it sounded reassuring enough for Papa to agree to the date. This time it was more than just a soda at Top’s. We were actually going to walk into town to see a movie. I loved movies so I felt this date wasn’t going to be as much of an imposition on me. I recognized Herschel from school, of course, as soon as he walked in our front door. I distinctly remembered him accepting his math award the previous year. There was a peculiar angle to the way he held his head when he was nervous and it had stuck in my brain. Herschel was a pale boy, tall and slender with sandy blond hair that was straight as a pin. He didn’t have his hair loaded up with any kind of hair tonic, which I knew met with our mother’s approval. I’d never previously spoken to Herschel, or had any classes with him, but I immediately felt more comfortable being around him than I had Lev. At least he was closer to me in age. In contrast to Lev, Herschel said as little as possible while the four of us walked into town. I didn’t mind the silence. In fact, I preferred it to stories about football games. But I did think we should have a little conversation so I tried with, “What do you intend to do after graduation?” Herschel gave me a started look, as if I was a pet cat that had suddenly started speaking one day. “College,” he eventually answered. I nodded, waiting for more than a one word reply. When I realized nothing else was coming, I tried, “What do you think you’ll study?” “Mathematics,” he told me, this time without as much hesitation. I figured that was about as much as I was going to get out of him, so I let things go at that. There was a bit of problem when we were buying our tickets. Herschel headed up to the gal at the ticket window and purchased a single ticket. I guess that was his way of letting me know he had no interest in me romantically. Fortunately, the feeling was mutual. Unfortunately, it did lead to some awkwardness. I got in line with every intention of buying my own ticket, but then Walter insisted on treating me. I tried to argue with him, but he insisted. It was somehow more humiliating having my sister’s beau purchase my ticket than it would have been if I’d bought my own. Fortunately the film we saw was rather entertaining and I found myself laughing off the whole situation. Herschel, on the other hand, did not appear to enjoy the show. He did not laugh once during the entire movie and frequently looked quite bored. On the walk home, I took the lead, trailing Herschel in my wake. I’d actually enjoyed myself more than on my date with Lev. But I didn’t want to prolong Herschel’s agony, so that speeded my steps. Lilly and Walter were walking at a leisurely pace, of course. They obviously did not want their date to end. When I got to our front porch, I took a seat on the step. The weather was warming up a little, but the flagstones still chilled my bottom. I couldn’t exactly go inside without my sister, and Papa hadn’t put the porch swing back up since taking it down in the fall, so there was no other place to wait. Herschel eventually wandered up and sat beside me. He said nothing, so I said nothing. I did steal a glance at my watch. If my sister and her beau did not step lively, then we would be late getting home and that would be the end of Walter Bennett. “I apologize for not purchasing your ticket,” Herschel eventually said, breaking the silence. “I must save every penny I have for college next fall, And Walter said this wouldn’t really be a date, so I saw no reason to incur the expenditure.” “That’s alright,” I told him. “I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy the picture.” “I enjoyed it,” Herschel told me. “Really?” I was surprised. “I don’t think I heard you laugh once during the whole film.” Herschel chewed over this observation. “I don’t…” he began and then he thought it over some more. “I don’t believe guffawing loudly in a public place is an accurate assessment of enjoyment.” Guffawing? I thought to myself. Herschel was certainly more intellectual than Lev, but he wasn’t exactly a pleasant person to be around. Fortunately for me, Lilly and Walter came into view at that exact moment, walking arm-in-arm. It was a relief because I knew Papa would scold both of us if we were late, and I really didn’t want to spend any more time speaking with Herschel Tuft. Chapter 8 Jessie I woke to a hunger that I never imagined was possible. The urge to feed was overwhelming. It literally crippled any other thought that entered my head. I could smell odors that would have never registered in my mortal nose. I knew the chambermaid had been in the room recently to change my linen. My mother must have sent her away immediately because the smell of her was very faint, but my urge to rip out the girl’s throat and feast on her red juices was overwhelming. Fortunately, Mother was right there with a large jug of blood. “It’s alright, my darling. Everything is going to be alright,” she said, handing me cup after cup of the red nectar until I just grabbed the entire jug and gulped it down. It was the most delicious thing I had ever tasted. It was ambrosia in my mouth. I could feel the blood coursing through my body, making every part of me tingle with satisfaction. There was only a small part of my brain that wondered how the liquid I was drinking had been acquired. Did some poor soul sacrifice his life for the precious elixir? I was ashamed to admit it, but a large portion of me didn’t care. All I wanted was more. After the jug was gone, I was a little better. I felt saner. I still had horrible pangs of hunger, but not the kind of pangs that drove a person to do depraved things. I took notice of my hands. The red rash from my illness was gone and my skin looked extraordinarily pale. A small scar that I had been at the base of my thumb for as long as I could remember had vanished. “Are you better now?” Mother asked, clasping my hands and pulling them to her cheek. “Do you feel under control?” I looked at her, but suddenly I couldn’t speak. There was bile filling my throat. I felt like beetles and slugs were trying to crawl out of my mouth. I hated everyone and everything. I wanted to set the world on fire. I wanted to cause pain. I wanted to see mortals quaking with terror so that I could delight in their agony. “Jessie?” My mother stared at me, her eyes wide with fear. I’d always loved Mother dearly and I didn’t want to frighten her. I didn’t want to cause her any more pain than she’d already suffered with a monster for a father. And it was that conviction that centered me. The plague that I was tempted to let spill from my lips abated. I felt my old self again. “Yes,” I finally managed to say.”Yes, I think I’m…” I could not even think of the words to describe how I was feeling. “Calm,” was what I ended up saying. “I’m so sorry.” Mother burst into tears. “I should have known my father would try something like this. I should have guarded the door.” She hung her head and released a deep sob. “I should have taken you all away years ago.” “I think we both know Grandfather would have never allowed that to happen,” I said, sitting up a little in my bed and stuffing a pillow behind my head and shoulders. “He would have pursued us to the ends of the earth.” Grandfather was a very controlling man. He did not like the idea of anyone disobeying him, especially his own flesh-and-blood. His word was law. “That’s true,” Mother said with a large sniff, her eyes glistening. She always looked beautiful, even when she cried. That was one of the things I remembered about her, even before she was turned. Her beauty had been enhanced by becoming a member of the undead, but it wasn’t created by it. “But still…” she said. “I should have tried. I should have thought of something.” I put my arms around her. “Please don’t cry.” She suddenly straightened up, pulling away from me and looking into my eyes. “You haven’t changed. Have you?” she exclaim. “I thought for a moment there…” She brushed at her tears. “But it’s not true. Is it? You’re still my wonderful boy.” Running my hand through my hair a couple of times, I thought things over. I didn’t feel any different. Not really. Not deep inside. There had been a moment where I’d felt like I could have let the world tumble into the darkest pit of human misery, but that moment had passed. Yes, my sense of smell was better than a bloodhounds and I could see clearly without there being a light in the room. Yes, I craved human blood. I could already feel I would need more of the red nectar before much longer. But no, I did not feel innately different. I no longer felt hate in my heart. That moment was gone. I had no desire to kill or torture mortals. If anything, I felt sad for the life I would never live. I mourned for the girl I would never marry and the children I would never cradle in my arms. “I think I’m the same,” I finally told my mother. “I don’t feel any cruelty in here,” I said, tapping on my chest. “Thank God,” Mother said, wrapping me in her arms. “Thank God.” I held her for a few minutes and let her cry in my arms. Then she pulled away from me and dried her eyes. “Now I only have Emily left.” My poor little sister. She was a dear girl. The weight of continuing the family line would fall upon her shoulders. “We must find a way to protect her,” I said. “We must get her away somehow.” Mother thought about it for quite some time before saying, “No, there is no way to take her away from my father.” She turned to look me in the eye, her face quite solemn. “If Emily is to be saved from the curse of eternal life, then it is Grandfather who must be removed from us.” Chapter 9 Colette “You didn’t like Herschel either?” my sister exclaimed as I walked my bike along side of her. “You’re impossible.” It was Sunday and I had ridden out to the castle after church to see how things were progressing. I had expected the building site to be quiet, but there was still at least fifty men working, positioning stones and moving lumber into the castle. The second battalion of barges had already arrived and been offloaded. I understood there was to be a third and fourth round of boats on the way, the final of which would contain the castle furniture and family possessions. I stood at the edge of the worksite, not wanting to be in the way, but still wanting a glimpse of what was happening. Most of the men who had been hired to help with the offloading of the larger stones had completed their work and been sent on their way. Of the men who remained, most must have been from Hungary. None of the conversations I overheard were in English. The exterior of the castle was looking close to complete, as far as my untrained eye could tell. The structure was much more massive than I had ever imagined. I guessed maybe it was six or eight stories tall. I couldn’t exactly estimate by windows because there weren’t any and I didn’t know how high the ceilings were on each level. The exterior was entirely composed of the large gray stones that we’d seen being unloaded that first day. The castle wasn’t exactly an inviting structure, but historically speaking, I suppose it wasn’t meant to be. I still found the whole idea of a family moving their ancestral home across an ocean and rebuilding it in our small Ohio town incredibly romantic and I longed to know more about the people who were going to live there. Several of the workers were standing in a cluster close at hand and I noticed that some of the men were glancing in my direction. They were rough-looking and dirty from their labors, but they weren’t regarding me in a way that felt menacing. Still, I thought it was a good idea to be on my way. As I was turning my bicycle around, I heard someone call out, “You there.” I didn’t stop. There was no possible reason someone at the worksite would be addressing me. “Hello! Young lady,” the man called out again. This time I knew he had to be addressing me because there were no other females around. “Yes?” I asked, while mounting my bicycle and rolling a few feet down the dirt road. I saw no reason to be within grabbing distance, even if my behavior came off as a little rude. A young man stepped forward. He was covered with grime, but had piercing blue eyes that looked intelligent. “You are from this town?” he asked, waving a hand in the direction of Tiburon. “You live nearby?” He had an accent, but I could understand him easily enough. “Yes,” I said, rather hesitantly, unsure why he was asking. “I have seen you here before. You are curious about the castle.” He said it as a statement, rather than a question. “I’ve never seen a real castle before,” I told him. I wasn’t sure what answer he was expecting. “It is fine that you look now,” the young man told me, “but when the family is here, you must never come to this place. You must stay away.” At first I thought he was trying to tease me in some foreign way that I didn’t understand. But his face was so grave; I quickly realized that wasn’t the case. “Why?” I asked. What need could there be for anyone to avoid the castle, beyond annoying the occupants? “The family, they are…” he said a foreign word that I did not understand. “They are?” I repeated. The young man turned to the group of workers he had been chatting with before approaching me. They were all observing our conversation rather closely. My new friend asked them something in whatever language they were all speaking. I assumed it was Hungarian. The men shook their heads. A few called out more words that I could not understand. Turning back to me, the young man tried again. “They are a cursed family,” he said. “They are…” and then he tried pantomiming out the word he could not translate into English. He began bearing his teeth, which were straight, but yellow. Then he made the action of biting down. “You understand?” he asked. After that he slapped his lean belly a few times. “They must feed.” “Oh,” I said, doing my best to suppress a laugh. Was he really trying to warn me that the Vanderlind family was gluttons? But he was looking at me with such a serious face. Maybe he meant that vicious dogs guarded the castle and they would bite any trespassers. Yes, that made more sense. He probably thought I might try to sneak onto the castle grounds and would get a bad mauling for my curiosity. “Thank you for telling me,” I said, trying to match his grave manner. “I will be careful. I promise.” A look of relief spread across the young man’s face. “I am glad you understand,” he told me. “You will tell other people? They will not come here?” “Yes, I’ll do that,” I assured him, even though I had no intention of doing so. It didn’t seem appropriate for me to wander the streets of Tiburon warning people of the new family’s angry dogs before they’d even set foot in America. Besides, I was quite sure the local police would make the family post a sign or something, if they had animals that were dangerous. I pondered the young man’s’ warning as I rode my bike home. That’s when I ran across Lilly, walking along the road, so I stopped to walk with her. She immediately brought up my date with Herschel, of course. “You didn’t like Lev because he talked too much and now you say you don’t like Herschel because he didn’t talk at all. Seriously, Lettie. I can’t figure you out.” “That’s not exactly true,” I said in my defense. “I didn’t like Lev because…” What could I say? I didn’t like him because he was so very full of himself that there didn’t seem to be any room left for him to care about anyone else. He just didn’t seem like a kind person to me. But I couldn’t exactly say that because he was a good friend of Walter’s. “Because I just didn’t feel we had a connection,” I said, although it sounded like a poor excuse, even to my own ears. “He thought you had a connection,” my sister observed. “Yes, but don’t both people have to mutually feel the connection for there to actually be one?” I asked. “If he felt anything, it was probably just hormones.” “Lettie,” Lilly exclaimed, and then she covered her face with her hands and laughed with embarrassment. “Don’t let Mama and Papa hear you talking like that. They’ll never let you out of the house again.” Chapter 10 Jessie It was not ideal for a fledgling vampire to be shunted onto an ocean liner only a few days after being turned. But Grandfather was a man of little compassion for other people’s suffering. Besides, the ship on which we’d booked our passage had all the requirements for a family of vampires to make a successful voyage. The boat didn’t launch until the evening, so if we waited to board until the last minute, then we could go under the cover of darkness. The ship also docked in New York in the late afternoon. We would all have to find excuses for lingering in our cabins, but that obstacle wasn’t insurmountable. Most stewards would be happy to let an ailing passenger spend a few more hours in his bunk if the right amount of currency was exchanged. We had to make sure that we all had a safe place to spend the daylight hours. Coffins could not be accommodated. — Even a steward on the make would grow suspicious after seeing a coffin in several different cabins. — But overly large steamer trunks were not out of the question. Grandfather had one made for each of the family who was a member of the undead. Steamer trunks were usually put in storage and not left in first class cabins, but it wasn’t such an oddity that it would be remarked upon with any interest. My mother suggested that each trunk be made by a separate craftsman, so they would all have a distinctive look and not be thought of as purchased together. She was adamant about everyone keeping a separate identity and my grandfather eventually saw the wisdom of this plan, even if he was unwilling to compliment her for such forethought. In the last decade, crossing the Atlantic had gone from a thirty day ordeal to just a four day voyage. It was a boon for vampires looking to travel to America because it meant no more trying to bring live animals aboard the ship or surviving on rats. Jars of blood, properly sealed, were easily palatable for up to a week, if kept out of the sun. Our grandfather had always fed traditionally, preferring the blood of beautiful young boys or virile young men. He had enough money and Budapest had enough members of the underclass, that these poor souls could be acquired and disposed of without too much trouble. Every once in awhile, a mother would raise a ruckus, searching for her missing child. But the Vanderlind wealth shielded Grandfather from any real concern about prosecution. There were rumors about our family, but there would always be rumors about us no matter where we lived. After my mother was turned, she couldn’t stomach the idea of causing another human pain to satisfy her own appetite. She said she’d rather starve than to harm an innocent mortal. So she came up with a plan to keep our family in good supply of the sustenance we needed while actually helping the mortals of the human race. Mother invented another son, Arthur. Poor Arthur was a sickly boy, suffering from a rare blood disease. His malady meant he was in need of multiple blood transfusions each day. Mortals interested in selling their blood were provided with a meal and a generous payment. Soon the castle had more blood than was needed. Other like-minded vampire families began contributing funds so that they too could feed without causing harm. It wasn’t too long before clinics were set up in four neighborhoods of Budapest so that blood could be collected without a direct connection to the Vanderlind family. Many vampires agreed that the voluntary collection of blood was the humane thing to do, but it did little to ease a vampire’s natural instinct to hunt. As I struggled to control my appetite and adjust to the new life that had been thrust upon me, there was another worry that plagued my mind. It was too late for a change in our cabin arrangements. My sister and I would have cabins that were adjoined by a stateroom. Before I had been transformed, that seemed an ideal pairing. I could keep an eye on her and shield her from any shipboard Romeos or unscrupulous travelers who were toying with the idea of relieving a first class young girl of her purse. But as a vampire, the whole situation made me uneasy. I was too new to the world of the undead to trust myself alone with any mortal. I loved my sister dearly and would have rather walked out into the blazing sun of high noon than harm her, but that didn’t mean my predatory instincts wouldn’t take over in a moment of weakness. Fortunately, my mother thought of a solution to ease my mind. Mrs. Denkler was crossing on the same ship as us, only her cabin was in third class. Our housekeeper would pose as Emily’s governess and simply stay in the cabin with her. Denkie had nerves of steel and I was convinced she could face down a vampire much more powerful than the likes of me. It felt good to know that my sister would be protected from the evil that lurked in her own home. That would make the crossing less of an ordeal. We travelled by private train cars to the port city of Drubrovnik on the Adriatic Sea, where the ship that would take us to America was anchored. Our boarding was planned with precision. We family members climbed in our custom steamer trunks while it was only late afternoon and then we were driven to the docks in separate vehicles. That way we could start boarding the boat, one-by-one, immediately after sunset. My sister and Mrs. Denkler came in the car with me. At first I felt claustrophobic in my substitute coffin. Although the trunk was quite large, I felt cramped and had to tuck my legs to fit inside. For several seconds I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Then I remembered that I didn’t have to breathe and I was just being foolish. “Mama is getting out of her trunk now,” Emily said, tapping on my trunk. She had a pair of opera glasses with her so she could watch the activities of the other family members while remaining inconspicuous. “They’re driving toward the ship now, so I think it’s okay for you to get out,” she said a few minutes later. All of the trunks had been ingeniously designed so that they could be locked and unlocked from the inside. The visible lock on the outside was really just a decoy to deceive any curious maids or light fingered crewmen. That way there was no chance of someone thrusting open the lid at an inappropriate hour and getting the surprise of his life as a vampire burst into flames and quickly shriveled into a pile of ash. That would have definitely been a story a man could tell his grandchildren from the insane asylum. I jiggled the lock, was unable to open it, and felt a flash of frustration. Then I realized I had my eyes closed, which was silly because as a member of the undead, I could see perfectly in the dark. With my eyes open, I easily popped the lock and flipped open the lid. Slipping out of the trunk, I crawled into the back seat next to my sister. She gave me a smile, then reached over and straightened my tie. Even though it was no longer necessary for me to breath, I still took a few moments to gulp in some of the night air. Mortal habits were hard to break. And it was always good to give the impression of breathing. It was smart for a vampire to try to appear as alive as possible. “Grandfather’s going now,” Emily said, glancing at me and then returning to her opera glasses. Under normal circumstances, Grandfather would have insisted upon going first. But like most bullies, he was a coward at heart. He wanted to make sure that no one tried to stop my mother before he put himself at risk. I wasn’t sure why anyone would stop Mother. She was simply a beautiful young woman travelling first class to the New World. “Are you sad about leaving Hungary?” Emily asked as we watched the others move closer and closer to the ship. There had been so many parties in the last few months, and then I had been gravely ill, and then I was abruptly transformed into the undead. With all that going on, I’d hardly had time to reflect on our moving. If I took a moment to think about it, then yes, there was some sadness at leaving the country we had always called home. I had school friends whom I was to be parted from forever. But I would have been parted from them anyway after being turned immortal. And yet there was another emotion brimming in my chest. It was much more powerful than my sadness, but I concealed it from everyone. In truth, I felt oddly compelled to go to America. My feelings were hard to describe, but I almost felt like my real life was waiting for me there. I didn’t exactly know how to explain it, but part of me was looking forward to the move with eager anticipation. “Jessie?” Emily prompted me and I realized I had not spoken in several seconds. Her face looked both sad and hopeful. I knew it must have been hard on her to have me turned so young. Neither of us had wanted to follow the family tradition that Grandfather was hell-bent to inflict upon us. We’d sometimes spoken of running away once we were both a little older. Those childhood plans were now gone. If Emily was to run, it would have to be on her own. I could no longer go with her. I forced a smile to my lips and said, “I think it’s going to be a grand adventure.” “You know what I think?” she asked, almost shyly. “What’s that, my little love?” I asked, slipping my arm around her and giving her a squeeze. She was not yet thirteen, so she still sometimes let me cuddle and squeeze her. “I think it’s going to be like Dorothy.” “Dorothy?” I asked, giving her a puzzled look. “From The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” she explained. It was her favorite book from when she was very little. “Don’t you remember? Dorothy’s whole house is swept up by a cyclone and crashes down in a place that’s filled with magic.” Her eyes were shining with the romance of it. “Why do you talk such nonsense?” Mrs. Denkler felt the need to interject. She’d been sitting in the front seat next to the driver, glowering at us the whole time. “The castle wasn’t swept up in a cyclone. It was dismantled and moved by hundreds of workmen and at great expense. And America is not a land filled with magic. Far from it. The east coast is supposed to be quite civilized, but the whole middle of the country is filled with savages and Irishmen.” “Don’t listen to Denkie,” I said, giving Emily another squeeze and shooting our housekeeper a warning look over my sister’s shoulder. “She’s still pouting that we’re not moving to the North Pole.” “The North Pole?” Emily gave her temporary governess a surprised look. “Yes, I heard her talking to Grandfather about it. She’s always wanted to move to the North Pole so that she can look for Father Christmas.” “She never said such a thing,” Emily said with a giggle. “You’re making that up.” “I might be,” I said, frowning a bit while nodding my head. “But I think you’re right about Dorothy. Maybe our house will land in a magical place.” Chapter 30 Jessie Emily peeked through her opera glasses again, directing them at the docks. “Daniel’s in line to go through customs,” she said. “And there are a couple of people behind him.” We had our chauffeur pull down to the dock so we could unload and prepare to board the ship. By the time we got all of our baggage out of the car, Daniel was already through the line. First class passengers were treated as above reproach. Beyond glancing at our tickets, no one stopped us as we made our way onto the ship. It was that easy, but only because of our Grandfather’s fortune. And our mother’s forethought. A steward showed us to our cabins. We each had sleeping quarters, and then there was a small stateroom that was set between our cabins. It was actually very charming with wood paneling and brass framed portholes. And the rooms were not nearly as cramped as I’d anticipated. That was another benefit to traveling first class. It afforded a person a lot more breathing room. There was a tap at the door while we were all settling in for our four day journey. “Bonjour,” a young woman in a maid’s uniform said as she let herself into our shared accommodations. “Oh,” she exclaimed, as if she hadn’t expected anyone to be in the rooms. “You must forgive me,” she said, her cheeks turning quite red. “I had expected that everyone would be on deck for the launch of the boat. I am just here to turn down your beds for the night.” Seeing the young woman’s blush reflex made my stomach contract with hunger. She was a beautiful, petite thing with bobbed hair and painted lips. I forced my mind to think of my luggage, which contained a dozen bottles of blood, all neatly tucked between ample padding. “You want I should come back later?” she asked. I placed her accent as French, but probably not from Paris. I glanced over at Emily, who shook her head just the tiniest bit. I was grateful to her. I think she understood that I was struggling with my newly acquired dietary restrictions and she didn’t want temptation to stumble in my path in the form of a shapely servant. “We won’t need bed service during our voyage,” I told the maid. “Is there anything I can get you?” she asked, looking from me to my sister and then back again. “Some water? Or ice, perhaps?” “Just solitude, I think,” I told her. We really didn’t need one of those forward maids who was always barging in to see if anything was needed. “We’ve both had a bout of scarlet fever so we’re looking for an uneventful voyage with plenty of peace and quiet.” “You poor things,” she clucked. “Then I shall bring you some broth to strengthen your blood.” The maid was remarkably persistent and she kept peeking at me, shyly, in a way that let me know that she was probably new to her job and desperate to make a good impression. “No thank you. We are in need of nothing.” I assured her. “And besides, if we do happen to have some urgent need, then there’s always my sister’s governess to take care of us both.” “Very good,” said the maid, glancing briefly in Mrs. Denkler’s direction. “Then I shall leave you to have a pleasant journey.” Once the maid had gone, Emily walked over to me and took my hand. “Are you feeling well enough to go up on deck? I would love to be there when we launch.” She gave me a hesitant smile. “And maybe toss some of those paper streamers into the air.” I knew Emily was worried about me mingling with the mortal crowd up on deck. She was such a little doll to be so concerned for me. She had always been quite the considerate child. And I didn’t want to deny her the enjoyment of our grand departure. “Just give me a moment in my cabin and we can head right up,” I told her. “Now that you mention it, I think I’d like to toss some paper streamers myself.” In my cabin, I opened the small trunk that held most of the food I would use on our voyage. There were twelve quart bottles to last me four days. It seemed like an excessive amount, but I had the keen hunger common to most fledglings and there was also always the risk of bad weather while we were at sea. We didn’t want a delay of a day or two leading to disaster. I kept another two small pint bottles in a valise in case of emergencies, but I hoped I wouldn’t need them. Unsealing the wax around one of the quart bottles, I pulled the cork and took a long pull. “Oh...” I couldn’t help but sigh and close my eyes, savoring the moment. It tasted so good. “Hurry up,” Emily called, rapping on my cabin door. “The boat’s about to leave.” “Coming!” I called, setting the bottle down and searching for the cork. I thought I’d put it on the table, but it was nowhere to be found. “Go ahead with Mrs. Denkler,” I called out as I searched. “I’ll catch up with you.” “She doesn’t want to go,” my sister informed me. “She says she has too much unpacking to do.” Where was that blasted cork? I hated to leave the bottle just sitting open. “Jessie,” my little sister called. “We’ve got to go now or we’ll miss everything.” “I’ll be right there,” I told her, setting the bottle down on the sink of the small bathroom that was part of my cabin. As I was striding toward the door, the trunk holding my food supply caught my eye. I’d told the maid we didn’t need anything, so we weren’t expecting anyone in the rooms, but just to be on the safe side, I snapped the trunk closed and locked it. Better safe than sorry. I didn’t want to end up eyeing every mortal passenger on the ship like they were sides of beef. Our departure was actually quite enjoyable. There was the excitement in the air that always seems to accompany the start of a journey. People cheered and waved to their loved ones standing on the shore. There were paper streamers, just like in the movies, and Emily had a delightful time letting them tumble from her fingers and trail over the side of the ship. I was doing well. Even though the ship’s deck was crowded, I felt I had control over my hunger. I caught a glimpse of my mother and grandfather out of the corner of my eye, standing separately and observing the festivities. Daniel was nowhere to be found, but he never was one to mingle with mortals, even when he was a mortal. There was a shift in the crowd as some noisy young men roughly surged through it. I could smell the beer on their breath, which explained their heightened jocularity. People were being jostled and a few of them even stumbled. I instinctively put my arm around my little sister to protect her from the high spirited youths. Emily looked up at me and smiled. “You’re a little old for her, aren’t ya?” one of the young men asked. He couldn’t have been older than nineteen or twenty. His face was a ruddy pink from alcohol. I gave the fellow a sharp look, but decided the best course of action was to ignore him. Emily, being on the verge of young womanhood, felt embarrassed by his comment. “He’s my brother,” she told him. The young man smiled. “Does that mean you’re free?” he said, his mouth spreading into a lascivious grin. “This is my lucky day.” “She is a child,” I told him. “And your comments are not appreciated.” “I think she’s old enough to make up her own mind.” The man reached out to touch Emily’s cheek. “Aren’t you, pretty girl?” Before I even thought of what I was doing, my hand shot out and I’d grabbed the young man firmly by the wrist. I wasn’t used to my undead strength and I held him quite tightly. There was a surprised look in his eyes, backed by a little pain. But the surprise quickly turned to alcohol-fueled fury. He took a swing at me, but I blocked his blow as easily as if he’d been moving through water. Then he went to call out for some help from his friends, but I gave him a sharp shake, glared into his eyes, and said, “I wouldn’t if I were you.” “Let’s go look at the moon on the other side of the ship,” Emily said, placing her small hand on my arm. “Come on, Lucas. I think we should go.” I was confused for a moment as to why Emily had referred to me as Lucas. But then I realized that she didn’t want the young man to know my real name. Emily had obviously inherited my mother’s good head, along with her beauty. Knowing it was the smart thing to do; I released the young man and allowed my sister to lead me away, her arm looped through mine. Having her next to me was more helpful than she could have ever realized. All I wanted to do was go back to the young man and tear out his throat. “I think we should go back to our cabin,” Emily said in a subdued voice, once we were away from the crowd. “That’s probably a good idea,” I told her, my teeth clenched together. As soon as we’d crossed the threshold to the stateroom, I rushed to my cabin to have another few gulps of blood. I felt like I could barely contain myself and I knew I desperately needed to calm down. But when I checked the sink in my tiny bathroom, the quart bottle had been emptied, rinsed and set out on the counter. I stared at the empty bottle for several seconds. Who would do such a thing? “Mrs. Denkler,” I called rushing back to our shared room. I had seen her sitting on a small couch as we’d entered our quarters. When she looked up from her needlework I asked, “Who has been in the cabin since we left?” “Just the maid,” she said, completely unconcerned. “Why?” “Did she go into my room?” I asked, ignoring her question. “She took some towels in there,” was her reply. “Did she take something? Is anything missing?” “How long was she in my room?” I persisted. “Just a few moments, I think,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I don’t know for sure because I was changing when she let herself in. All I did was peek out the door and she told me that you had requested more towels.” “I didn’t request towels,” I said in a stern voice. Mrs. Denkler went back to her needlework. “I guess she must have confused our cabin with somebody else’s.” Chapter 11 Colette As the spring weather began to warm the ground, I found an excuse to visit the construction site every couple of days. The castle was magically growing before my eyes. The exterior of the building was complete. As the stonemasons departed for parts unknown, electricians, carpenters and gardeners arrived. It was rumored that a whole crew of Italian craftsmen had been brought in just lay down the parquet floors. This meant that there was less activity outside the castle, but I could hear hammering inside the building, and men calling out to each other in various languages. “Why do you always want to go look at that dreary old fortress?” Lilly asked me one afternoon as I was heading off on my bicycle for another visit. “I think it’s going to end up looking surprisingly ugly. And just so drab. Don’t you?” “Oh, no,” I told her. “I think it’s romantic. I mean, just imagine, a couple of hundred years ago knights in armor would have ridden right up to the castle door. Ladies in Waiting would have woven tapestries to cover the walls.” I wondered if any of the original furniture from the castle had survived and if the Vanderlind family still owned any of it. Now that was something I would have loved to see. “So that’s why you like it? For the history lesson.” Lilly smiled and shook her head. “You’re a funny kind of girl.” I didn’t correct my sister, but she hadn’t exactly gotten it right. I did love history, but that wasn’t why I was so captivated by the castle. It was more about the feeling I had in my chest whenever I was near the building; a kind of tickling or buzzing that I couldn’t explain. There was something magical about the castle that I felt deep in my soul, but I didn’t know how to put into words. And maybe part of me didn’t want to put into words. There are some things a girl wants to keep to herself, thoughts not even to be shared with a dearly loved sister. My father also found himself drawn to the castle, but his interest was for professional reasons. He was the best builder in town, but he’d never been offered once day’s work at the castle. That hurt his pride, but it didn’t prevent him from being curious about the construction. Whenever he had a little free time, we would ride out in our car together to see the progress that had been made. Lilly and Mama rarely went, but I was always happy to accompany him. My father was a cordial man and people were usually happy to speak with him. If he found a worker who understood English, he could usually strike up a conversation. I was always eager to listen in. I felt almost a mania to glean as many details as I could about the castle. One afternoon my father discovered that the men who were putting in the rose garden were all from Great Britain. “You’re not from Hungary?” he asked, somewhat surprised. “Wasn’t the garden part of the original house? I thought the family had the shrubs and topiary shipped over as well.” “No. You’ve been misinformed,” a man with thin legs and a round belly told him while leaning on the end of his shovel. I got the impression he wanted a break from his labor. “This place never had a proper English rose garden. But I guess the lady of the house always wanted one.” “And what better way to get a proper English garden than to have one planted by proper Englishmen,” my father said with a smile. “That’s right.” The man smiled in return, exposing a large set of yellow teeth. “The lads and I thought it might be a bit of an adventure. Plus the money was right. We brought the rose bushes with us and everything. Most of them fared the voyage without complaint.” Then he added in an aside, “The roses, not the lads. We had a bit of rough weather.” “It must be nice to be able to order the creation of an entire formal garden on a whim,” my father observed, half to himself. “Yes, there must be more money than Midas behind those walls,” the gardener agreed, eyeing the castle. “Imagine wanting to move to this tiny town in the middle of nowhere.” Then he realized we were more than likely inhabitants of Tiburon, so he quickly added, “Not that the town doesn’t have its charms.” His face went rather pink. “But you always think of rich people as living in London, or Paris. New York, even. Not a small town in the middle of Iowa.” “Ohio,” my father said, correcting him, but keeping his voice genial. “I supposed they want a bit of privacy,” the man said, taking off a heavy work glove and scratching beneath his nose. “I hear that they pretty much like to keep to themselves.” “I guess they won’t be attending any town hall meetings,” Papa joked. “But I suppose the very rich don’t like to dirty their hands.” “Not like me and the lads,” the gardener said, slipping on his glove again as if he’d just remembered he had work to do. “Still, it’d be nice to get a peek inside, when the old gal is done,” he said, eyeing the castle once more. “I don’t suppose they’ll be holding tours.” “If they do, I’ll be the first in line,” my father assured him. “Is the family going to be arriving soon?” I asked. The castle was pretty much devoid of windows, so it was impossible to get a sense of the comings and goings of anyone inside. “Not that I know of, Miss,” he told me, his face rather serious. “Although, from what I’ve heard from some of the I-talian fellows, the family isn’t very nice. In fact, there were one or two stories that could stand a grown man’s hair on end, if anyone was to believe them.” Papa cleared his throat. “I’m not sure it’s right to start rumors about a family before they’ve even driven into town,” he said with a note a censure. The man shrugged. “It’s hard to have a big house like this, and all the money that goes with it, and not at least stir up a few rumors.” Turning his attention back to me, he leaned forward a little and gave me a stern look. “I hope you aren’t expecting a prince charming to go along with the castle as a matched set.” I immediately felt my face go red and I placed a hand to my cheek. My father stepped slightly in front of me, as if to shield me from the gardener’s impertinence. “My daughter enjoys studying history,” he informed the man. “I think she’s just hoping for some more facts about the castle’s past.” The man nodded, his expression growing sober. “Just as long as she remembers that sometimes where there’s smoke, there’s fire.” His eyes became thoughtful. “Or blood, as the I-talians tell it.” I was grateful for my father’s protection, and I did enjoy history, but I still felt the humiliation of being thought of as some silly school girl longing for a prince to move into the neighborhood and notice her. I probably felt doubly embarrassed because maybe the man’s assessment of me hinted at the truth. I couldn’t help but wonder about the stories being spread by the Italian workers. And what expression did they have in Italy about blood? I glanced around, wondering when the Italians took their coffee break and if there was any way I could speaking with one of them. When we returned home that evening, Lilly was sitting on the front steps waiting for us. “Hello Papa,” she said, springing up to give our father a kiss as he climbed the stairs. “Hello, Lettie,” she said, giving me a squeeze, her face all smiles. “What’s going on?” I asked, returning her smile with a suspicious glance. She usually wasn’t quite that much of a welcoming committee. “Oh, it’s nothing,” she said, but she could hardly suppress her smile. “It’s just that Lev Wilson bought a new car. From the White Motor Company. He and Walter just drove it all the way down from Cleveland.” I had to admit, I was impressed that Lev could afford a car. Especially a new one. It made me wonder where he got his money. “How can he afford that?” I had to ask. “From his work, of course,” Lilly said, giving me a small frown. “Oh,” I said with a nod. It was too embarrassing to admit that I had no idea what Lev did for a living. I was sure he had told me, I just hadn’t bothered to listen. “Did he buy it on credit or something?” I asked. He was still a young man and didn’t have a college education, so I doubted he made that much money. Lilly frowned again and shrugged as she trailed me into the house. “That really isn’t something I could ask.” “And just why, exactly, are you bringing all this up?” our father asked as he shrugged out of his jacket. “Well…” Lilly paused for a moment as she gathered her nerve. “Lev and Walter invited Lettie and me to go for a drive after dinner tomorrow,” she blurted. “Just to see the new car, of course.” Papa frowned. “Haven’t you been seeing an awful lot of Walter?” “Not really,” Lilly insisted. “Not an awful lot. In fact, not very much at all.” Mama had walked into the room while we were talking. “Another date with Walter,” she exclaimed. “I hope you two aren’t getting too serious.” “Well, I like him very much, if that’s what you mean,” Lilly said. And then her face flushed a little, “But just so you know, Walter has always been a gentleman.” “I’m glad to hear it,” Mama said, taking our father’s coat and folding it over her arm. “That’s just how a young man should behave.” “That’s how any man should behave,” Papa felt the need to add. “So can we go?” Lilly asked, her eyes shining with excitement. “Just a short drive.” Glancing over at me, she added, “Maybe out to see the castle. I know Colette likes that kind of stuff.” “Your sister was just at the castle with me,” Papa informed her. “Oh, but I’m sure she wouldn't mind going again tomorrow.” She looked eagerly in my direction. “Would you, Lettie?” I had no desire to see Lev Wilson again, but I was already itching to get back to the castle. “I guess I wouldn’t mind,” I said. “As long as it’s just for an hour.” I thought I could put up with anyone’s company for an hour. Lilly bounced up and down and then gave me a hug. “I hope you realize that your mother and I haven’t given our approval yet,” Papa said, his voice stern. Lilly stopped bouncing. “Oh, please,” she said, sounding as if she was Cinderella about to be denied admission to the ball. “I promise it will only be for a half an hour. Maybe an hour at the most.” Our mother and father exchanged looks. “I’m not sure I approve of you riding around in cars with boys,” Mama said. “But if Walter is the gentleman that you claim, then I suppose it’s alright by me, if it’s alright with your father.” Lilly clasped her hands together and turned to look at Papa. “It’s fine, as long as your sister’s with you,” Papa said. “But I want those boys to come inside so I can look them both in the eye again. Most young men remember to mind their p’s and q’s when they know that a father is keeping a close eye on his daughters.” “Well of course they’ll come in,” Lilly said. “Walter would insist on that, anyway.” Lilly hurried off to call her beau and I started setting the table for dinner. I was reluctant to see Lev again, but I could probably just block out his words while gazing at the castle. Plus I desperately wanted to speak to one of the Italian carpenters about the Vanderlinds. What were the hair-raising stories about the new family moving into town? Chapter 12 Jessie Mrs. Denkler went with Emily to the dining room for dinner, but I ordered a meal to be delivered to my room. I intended to try to show up for a few meals with the general public, if only to please my sister and to give the appearance of being mortal, but I was too riled up from my encounter on deck to attempt a meal that night. I ordered a steak, extra rare, along with roasted potatoes, greens and a bottle of wine. I didn’t go overboard on the wine. I knew I had to order a good vintage to keep up appearances, but I saw no reason to spend a lot of money, when all I was going to do was pour it down the drain. I did think for a moment to offer the bottle to Mrs. Denkler, but then changed my mind. She was in charge of my little sister, after all. I didn’t want to give her an excuse to get tipsy. After Emily and her temporary governess had returned from their meal and gone to bed, I sat up reading. I was still unused to my new hours of existence. I didn’t know how to give up my days and find ways to fill my nights. As the hour dragged on past midnight and most of the ship’s passengers had gone to bed, I went up on deck to have a look around. The night was mild and the skies were very clear. The Milky Way was on full display and I took a moment to marvel at the beauty of the heavens. “Are you having trouble sleeping too?” I heard a familiar voice ask me. I looked up to see that my mother had also decided upon a late-night stroll. “Oh…” I stammered for a moment before I realized that we weren’t supposed to know each other. “Yes,” I managed. “I know many people find the gentle rocking of a boat sleep-inducing, but it has the opposite effect on me.” Mother gave a gentle laugh. “I suffer from the same malady, I’m afraid.” Then she turned her head slightly, just enough to let me know that she had heard something or sensed someone else on deck. Taking a moment to focus, I had to agree with her. I could definitely smell the hormonal-laced musk of an adolescent male close at hand. “Did you enjoy the ship’s departure?” I asked, just for something to say so it wouldn’t look awkward with us both just standing there. “I found it quite exhilarating,” she told me with a gentle smile. “Begging your pardon,” a voice said. We both turned to see a young cabin boy who had stepped out of the shadows. His hair was a crown of golden ringlets and his eyes were wide and a brilliant shade of blue. By any standard, he was remarkably beautiful, even though his eyes were crusted slightly with sleep. “Would either of you fine people be needing anything?” I saw my mother suppress a smirk. The boy had obviously been asleep somewhere in a dark corner and was concerned that he might have been discovered shirking his duties. “I am perfectly comfortable,” my mother told him. “Thank you for asking.” Turning to me, she added, “Anything for you, Mr.…?” She let her words hang in the air, seeing that ostensibly we had not been introduced. “Vanderlind,” I told her, suppressing a smile of my own. “Jessie Vanderlind.” My mother provided her false names and we exchanged how-do-you-dos. Then mother turned to the cabin boy and said, “And what is your name, young man?” The cabin boy looked startled for a moment and then said, “I am Christian Franzen, Ma’am. How do you do?” “How do you do?” Mother replied. Christian Franzen stood there for a moment, feeling awkward and unsure of what to do next. “It was nice meeting both of you,” he told us, “but I suppose I’d better be getting back to work.” After he’d hurried off, my mother remarked in a low voice, “What a beautiful young man. His features are quite striking. Did you see the color of his eyes?” “There was no missing them,” I had to admit. The boy’s beauty was hard to ignore. “Blue,” Mother said, a bit wistfully. “A clear blue, like the sky on a perfect day.” Then in a voice that was hardly audible she whispered, “I do hope your grandfather doesn’t catch a glimpse of him. That could only lead to trouble.” “It is a rather lovely night,” I said, making a show of looking at the stars in the sky. There was the gentle sound of footsteps approaching and I meant to give my mother warning in case she hadn’t heard them. “I should probably return to my cabin now or my husband will wonder where I’ve got off to,” Mother said. “It’s was very nice speaking with you. I hope you have a good night.” As she turned and left, an elderly couple approached, walking slowly, arm-in-arm. Part of me wondered why they were up at such an hour. And another part of me mourned that I would never have the chance to grow old with someone that I loved. The little French maid continued to be persistent in her quest to be of service to Mrs. Denkler, my sister and me. Emily reported that she had knocked on our door twice the next day. She even had the temerity to ask if she could check with me directly to see if I needed anything, even though Denkie had told her I was resting. Resting was not an accurate description of what I was doing in my oversized trunk. I couldn’t lie down completely straight and that made it a challenge to get comfortable. I tried not to thrash around too much because I didn’t know if there happened to be anyone lurking in my cabin. I didn’t want a maid or cabin boy to wonder about the rustling in Mr. Vanderlind’s enormous trunk. Emily tried reading to me to pass the time for both of us. After the initial excitement, she found life aboard ship too sedentary. I could have just as easily taken a book into the trunk with me, but it hadn’t occurred to me when I’d climbed in for the day. Turning my mind off was the problem. We vampires didn’t exactly sleep; we went into a state of repose that was supposed to be similar to deep meditation. At least that was what I had been told. So far I hadn’t been able to find any type of repose, sleep, meditation or otherwise. Eventually my sister became restless. “Would you mind if I went up on deck?” she asked, her voice apologetic. “Just for a little while. There’s shuffleboard up there and…” Her voice faded. I could tell she was trying to decide if she was being selfish. “Emily, don’t worry about me,” I told her. “I’ll be fine. You go and enjoy yourself. It’s what I want you to do. And take old Denkie with you. She could use some fresh air.” Emily giggled. She loved when I referred to Mrs. Denkler in this way. “I won’t be long,” she assured me and I could hear her getting to her feet. “Take as long as you like,” I insisted. “It’s not like I’ll be up and about until nightfall.” After Emily and Mrs. Denkler went out, I tried to turn my thoughts off and just focus on nothing. But my life had gone through so many changes in the last week that it made it almost an impossible thing to do. Even so, after an extended period of frustration, I eventually found myself starting slip into the void. That was until I heard somebody in my room. I was immediately jerked into consciousness by the slight creak of hinges being opened. Who was out there? I couldn’t begin to imagine. It wasn’t Emily or Mrs. Denkler. Of that I was convinced. Neither one of them had any cause to sneak into my cabin. Perhaps one them was looking for something and trying not to disturb me. I gave that idea some thought. But then I heard the light clinking of bottles and I was filled with rage. The only bottles I had in my room were my food supply. Why was someone rifling through my trunk? Was it the same person who had dumped the first bottle? Was he back to finish the job? I felt an impotent rage. I wanted to burst from my trunk and confront the scoundrel, but that was a bad idea for numerous reasons. There was nothing I could do but sit there, not making a sound, and hope the person was not doing what I suspected he might be doing. The bottles eventually stopped rattling, but then a more alarming sound reached my ears. It was someone trying to open the very trunk that contained me. He was fiddling with the lock. I froze, afraid even the slightest movement might give me away. The thief struggled with the lock for several minutes. Then there was the sound of a door opening and closing. I could hear the voices of Mrs. Denkler and my sister. The person standing outside my sleeping trunk instantly grew very quiet. And then I could hear him walking lightly across the room. I made a vow that if whoever was out there tried to hurt Emily or Denkie in any way, I would burst from my makeshift coffin and dispatch the thief to the great beyond. I thought I could probably cause their demise before the sun burnt me to cinders. Even with this resolve, I understood that even the smallest bit of sunlight was excruciatingly painful to a member of the undead. But it was a horror I would have to face in order to protect my family. Emily and Mrs. Denkler must have gone into their cabin for a moment because their voices grew more muffled, but they didn’t sound agitated in any way. I strained my ears in my custom-made prison for any sound that might indicate a struggle. All I heard was soft footsteps crossing the floor and the sound of a door being quietly pulled open and then shut again. With the click of the latch, I felt myself relax slightly. Whoever had been snooping meant my family no harm. The person was probably just a petty thief looking for easily concealable items. Several hours later, I felt the ease that comes over all vampires with the setting of the sun. While I waited a few minutes for the last rays of the day to dwindle, I listened for sounds of anyone being in the cabin that shouldn’t have been there. And then, feeling reasonably sure I had taken all necessary precautions, I popped the interior locks on my trunk and opened the lid. No one was in my cabin. That gave me some relief. I peeked out the door to glimpse Denkie and my sister reading books in our shared living space. They both looked perfectly fine. Then I turned to see what was missing from my room. A watch and chain, a pair of gold nail scissors, and a pearl lapel pin had all disappeared off of my bureau. These were annoying losses, but nothing to cause me great regret. I had shipped anything of real value when the contents of the castle were sent over. Taking a fortifying breath, I turned my attentions to my true concern; the trunk holding my food for the next few days. The lid was closed and I was reluctant to open it. But whatever had happened, I had to face it. Flipping open the lid, I surveyed the eleven bottles that had been so carefully packed. They were all empty. Someone had snuck into my cabin and drained every single one. Chapter 13 Colette “Good evening, Mr. Gibson,” Walter Bennett said. I could tell he was using his very best manners. “Mrs. Gibson.” There was a big smile on his face and he couldn’t stop from looking in Lilly’s direction. It struck me for the first time that my sister and Walter might be in love. It was more than likely what older people referred to as “young love” but that probably didn’t keep it from feeling any less real to them. “Good evening, Sir,” Lev said, shaking Papa’s hand. He was obviously part of the good-manner’s club. “Mrs. Gibson,” he said with a nod to our mother. “Good evening, boys,” Mama said. “That’s quite a bruise you’ve got there,” Papa said, referencing a purple discoloration and a small plaster high on Lev’s left cheek. Lev’s hand self-consciously flew up to gingerly touch his injury. “Nothing much,” he said rather quickly. “I was roughhousing with some friends and there was a little accident.” “Was anyone else hurt?” our mother asked, immediately concerned. “Oh. No, it was nothing like that,” Lev assured her. “A couple of us were wrestling where we shouldn’t have been and my face got banged on the corner of a table.” He touched his cheek again and then forced his hand back down to his side. “It looks a lot worse than it is.” The four of us piled into Lev’s new car. It was shiny black and showroom new. Lilly and Walter claimed the back seat, so that left me to sit up front with Lev. “What do you think of her?” Lev asked as he started the car up. “Isn’t she a beauty?” I was a little surprised that Lev had bothered to ask me a question. But seeing that he was really fishing for a compliment, it wasn’t too much of a shock. The sun was just starting to set, so there was still a lot of daylight left. I couldn’t help but notice as Lev gripped the wheel that his right hand was purpled and slightly swollen. “Did that happen while you were roughhousing, too?” I asked, nodding toward his hand. Lev glanced at his bruises and then shot me a rueful grin. “You could say something like that.” I wasn’t sure what to make of his comment, but I didn’t feel the urge to dig for details. If Lev had gotten into a fight with one of his friends, then that had nothing to do with me. And if afterward, they had decided to patch things up and just call it roughhousing, then that was their business, not mine. All I was obligated to do was be polite and go see the castle. Lev drove his car with surprising caution, keeping under the speed limit and being considerate of other motorists. He even showed remarkable patience when a farmer pulled his tractor out onto the road ahead of us and we had to inch along for several minutes until the man turned off the main road and onto a dirt one. I began to wonder if I’d misjudged Lev. Maybe he was just nervous during our first date. Male animals in the jungle were known to show off colorful plumage or magnificent manes to attract a mate. Maybe Lev’s constant bragging was just his ill-judged attempted to impress me. I decided I should at least try to give him another chance. When we reached the dirt road turnoff that led to the castle, Lev used additional caution, moving the car forward at a pace that was even slower than the tractor that had blocked our way. “Don’t want to scratch her,” Lev told me. “Her paint’s barely dry.” “Gee!” Lilly exclaimed when the castle finally came into view. “It’s just so massive.” I turned in my seat to look at her. It occurred to me that my sister probably hadn’t seen the castle much since the first day when the family had headed down to watch the barges come in. Or, if she’d gone with Papa, she’d been too busy daydreaming about Walter to notice any progress the workers had made. She wrinkled her nose. “It’s not very pretty, though.” “Most castles weren’t built to be beautiful,” Lev told her. “They were built to withstand a siege.” And then he added, “There are some pretty castles in Bavaria, though. My uncle travelled there when I was a kid and he sent me a lot of postcards. Really magical stuff. Straight out of the fairytales.” Thinking it over for a few seconds, he added, “I’d like to travel there one day.” My opinion of Lev was growing by leaps and bounds. But then he had to go and ruin it all by saying, “I’m descended from royal blood, of course.” No one in the car made a response to his comment. It just sounded like such a ridiculous exaggeration that I thought it would be better to ignore it. “If I showed my face in Europe, they’d probably try to clap a crown on my head,” Lev told us, just to make matters worse. “Is that what they did to your uncle?” Walter asked, causing my sister to giggle. “Well, he was invited to visit many of the royal houses,” Lev snapped, unwilling to just let it go. “Royalty recognizes royalty, even if it’s a distant connection.” I had promised myself to just sit there and bide my time through the date, but it was just too much. I really couldn’t let Lev keep bragging like he was next in line for the throne of England. “So what’s your lineage?” I asked him. “What?” Lev gave me a sharp look. “What is your heritage?” I wanted to know. “Which royal families are you descended from and how did you end up here, in America?” “That’s right, Lev,” Walter jeered. “Tell us your family tree.” The sunlight was almost gone, but I could see Lev growing pink under the collar. “I’ll have to ask my grandfather,” he said in a clenched voice. “He’s the family historian.” “Let’s get out and walk around a little before the sun goes completely down,” I suggested, in part to end the conversation and in part because I wanted to see if any of the Italian workmen were still lingering around the castle. “Sure,” Walter agreed. “Lev, why don’t you knock on the door? Introduce yourself. Let them know who you are.” “Alright, cut out the smart talk,” Lev growled, flashing his friend a menacing look. The smile quickly faded from Walter’s face. “Yeah. Sorry,” he said. “I was just joshing you.”",

      "content": "We walked for a little while in silence, skirting around the unfinished areas that were still mostly mud. The rose garden was nearing completion, with neat, short hedges making squares and rectangles around each bush. “Our father was speaking with one of the gardeners yesterday,” I said to whoever cared to listen. “Both the plants and the gardeners were shipped over from England.” “I thought this pile of bricks was supposed to be Hungarian or something,” Walter said, trying to revive the jovial mood. “It is. But just not the garden,” I said, glancing over my shoulder at him. That’s when I realized that Walter and my sister had their arms around each other. In an instant I knew that suggesting we all get out of the car was a mistake. Walter and Lilly were just looking for an excuse to find a cozy, dark corner where they could canoodle. Besides going against everything Lilly had told our folks, it would leave me alone with Lev. And who knew where his ideas might lead? I didn’t want to inadvertently put Lev in a situation where he thought kissing me was a good idea. I had to get out of there, and fast. Lev Wilson was not going to be my first kiss, if I had anything to say about it. “Oh, we’d better get going,” I said after pretending to check the time. “Don’t want to be late.” “You don’t need to hurry off that quickly, do you?” Lev said, trying to catch my hand. He must have also been aware of Walter and my sister’s intentions. “We do if we don’t want to get grounded,” I insisted, eluding him by taking a few quick steps. “Our father won’t tolerate any kind of nonsense,” I said, hoping he would catch my double meaning. “Come on, Lettie,” Lilly said, her voice carrying a bit of a whine. “We can stay a few more minutes.” “No, we can’t,” I said, allowing my own voice to carry the firmness of my convictions. I had been foolish to agree to an evening drive to an isolated area, even if my sister was with me. “We need to start heading back to the car,” I told her. “Now.” I loved my sister dearly, but enough was enough. “She’s probably right,” I could hear Walter say as I started walking rather briskly. “It’s time to go. I wouldn’t want your father to dislike me.” Then I heard Lev give a scoffing laugh. Chapter 14 Jessie I couldn’t stop staring at the empty bottles of blood. Who would do such a thing? I couldn’t conceive of what would have motivated a thief to such mischief. Whoever had done it must have known that I was a member of the undead. What other possible reason would they have to break into my cabin and dispose of my only food supply? Getting to New York would be a tremendous test of my self-control and I wasn’t sure if I was up to the challenge. The word “test” made me think of my grandfather. This was just the kind of thing he would set up in order to help me “build character”. He felt that Daniel and I were too soft; that our mother coddled us. He also felt that I was ungrateful for my undead transformation. I looked upon being turned into a vampire as a hardship, but he viewed it as the greatest gift he could bestow on another human. After giving it a bit of thought, I decided that disposing of the blood was probably Grandfather’s way of punishing me for my ingratitude. I quickly became convinced that he had hired someone to break into my cabin and get rid of my food. He probably told the criminal to rob me as well, as a measly cover story. Or maybe that was just something the thief thought up on his own, since he was already in my cabin and pawing through my things. Grandfather apparently did not warn the thief not to open the oversized trunk. Or, knowing my grandfather, he had instructed his minion to search the trunk for some nonexistent item. That would serve the dual purpose of forcing me to take a mortal life and probably save Grandfather the couple of coins he’d promised in payment. Thankfully that last part of the plan was foiled. Hurriedly, I checked my valise and was relieved to find that the two pints I had stashed in there had not been disturbed. That was a small blessing. I was already feeling edgy from not having eaten and I needed to slake my appetite before I attempted to send word to my mother about what had happened. I knew she had packed enough blood so that sharing wouldn’t cause her any hardship. Emily tapped at my door and then let herself in. “We’re going up to dinner soon, if you’d like to join us,” she told me. And then stopped short, catching sight of all the empty bottles. “What happened?” “I don’t know,” I told her. “Someone broke into my room while I was resting and this is what they did.” “But who would do such a thing?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She had walked into my cabin behind my sister. If I had been speaking to my mother, I would have voiced my suspicions. But Denkie was loyal to our family’s patriarch and I knew any words that passed from my lips would go straight to my grandfather’s ears. “I have no idea,” I said. “Someone who didn’t understand that they were putting everyone on this ship in mortal danger, I suppose.” Mrs. Denkler’s mouth twitched. “It will be a test of your fortitude,” she told me. “Would you like me to check the ship’s passenger list to see who is likely to be traveling alone?” Emily gave our housekeeper a startled look. “That won’t be necessary,” I assured her. “I’ll have to think things over, but I might just ask you to get a message to my mother.” I looked between the two of them. “For the moment, let’s just keep this incident to ourselves.” Frowning, Mrs. Denkler said, “Of course.” Was the Vanderlind housekeeper aware of my grandfather’s plan? It seemed very unlikely. I knew Grandfather confided in her about many things, but he was too wily to share this type of plans with a mortal. I took a few, careful pulls of blood from one of the pint bottles. It allowed me to focus on solving my predicament rather than thinking about my hunger or allowing my anger to take control of me. I didn’t want to upset my mother unnecessarily. I knew she would come to the same conclusion I had about the disposed of blood. And she already had an adversarial relationship with her father as it was. None of the passengers would benefit from witnessing two vampires battling on the deck of the ship. Plus, my grandfather was much more powerful. If he truly lost control of his temper, then he might actually stake my mother in the heat of battle. No, the best thing I could do for the health of my family was not mention the loss of my food supply. Vampires could go for days without eating, as long as they were careful. I just had to keep myself away from mortals and ration the blood I had left. It would be necessary for me to not leave my cabin for the rest of the trip, day or night. That would keep me away from temptation and the rest of the ship’s passengers safe from me. At first things went smoothly, I had several good books to keep me occupied. When my sister and Mrs. Denkler came back from dinner, I explained that I definitely did not wish for either of them to communicate my troubles to anyone else in the family. Emily was upset by my decision, but Denkie said, “That’s probably for the best.” Things became more of a struggle once the two of them went to bed. My cabin began to feel claustrophobic, so I moved into our shared room, just for a change of scenery. Even with this transition, I felt almost an irresistible urge to go up on deck. But I knew people were still out and about, plus my hunger was increasing. The last time I had a sip from the open pint, I realized that half the contents was already gone. I knew I had to be more conservative when I fed or I would end up having to tell Mrs. Denkler to chain me in my trunk for the remainder of the voyage. As the hour drew close to midnight, I heard someone tapping at the door. Out of habit, my first impulse was to answer it. But then I remembered the state I was in and immediately withdrew into my cabin. Before I knew what was happening, the little French maid who had been such a charming nuisance the previous evening was letting herself into my room. “Hello?” she said, her cheeks aglow. “You called for more towels?” “No, I didn’t call for towels,” I told her in a tight voice. “And I think it advisable that you leave. Right now.” “Do you really want me to go?” she asked, tucking her chin and looking up at me with large blue eyes that had been rimmed in charcoal. “Yes,” I told her firmly. “That’s why I said it.” “But what about your towels?” she asked, stepping further into my cabin. “I never asked for any damn towels,” I insisted, inching past her and heading for the door. I could smell every fragrance of her body in such a confined space and it was making me drool. “But Monsieur,” she said, reluctantly following me as I led her into the main cabin. “I brought them especially for you.” She stepped very close to me and tilted her head back to look up into my eyes. I wanted to show her to the door, but I couldn’t. She was so young and beautiful, and she smelled so good. Her eyes were wide and innocent, but no one was that naive. She obviously wanted me to kiss her. But kissing wasn’t what I had in mind. At least not a mortal kiss. It would have been so easy just to bend her head to the side and expose the tender flesh of her neck. I felt my stomach give a painful growl at the mere thought of it. “Is there nothing else you want from me, Monsieur?” she asked, blinking her wide blue eyes very slowly. “Nothing at all that I can do for you?” “No,” I told her, and my voice came out like a creaking door. “I’m fine. I appreciate your…” I couldn’t even think of what to say. I cleared my throat. “I appreciate your concern for my comfort, but I think I would… I mean, I think you should just leave. Now. Please,” I gulped. “You do not like me?” she said with a hint of a pout. “No, that’s not it at all,” I assured her. “It’s just…” I was clinging to my humanity by the skin of my teeth. “Maybe you would like to get to know me a little bit better?” she suggested. Her voice turned sultry and her French accent faded away. “That is something that could be arranged.” She glanced down at her bosom and then looked back up at me. “No…” I began to say. And then the French maid did something to seal her fate. She reached forward and placed one of her hands on my chest. “Why not?” That’s when I grabbed her. I couldn’t control myself. A small part of my brain was shouting at her, “No! Get out of here! Run for your very life.” But it was too late for that. The evil that was brewing inside of me took over. I had meant to be so strong, but I was lost. Rather than struggling, the maid melted into my arms. “Oh, Monsieur,” she said with a sigh, her accent suddenly returning. “I do not think I can resist you. I have never done anything like this before. But if I give way to you, I trust that you will take care of me. Yes?” But I wasn’t thinking about anything that warranted her trusting me. In fact, I was thinking the exact opposite. Every fiber of my being wanted to drain her and toss the husk of her body over the side of the ship, never to be heard from again. “I’ll take care of you,” I whispered, pulling some tendrils of her hair to one side and fully exposing her neck. That’s when the cabin door burst open. Several burly men charged into the cabin. One of them looked me directly in the face and shouted, “Vampire!” Chapter 15 Colette “I’m mad at you,” Lilly said, thrusting her chin into the air and turning away from me. I already knew she was mad at me. It was obvious from the way she had been storming around our room all evening, picking up books, slamming them down again, and sighing quite dramatically. It wasn’t behavior she could exhibit in front of our mother and father at dinner, but just the two of us in the room we shared was a different story. “Yes, I know that,” I told her. That caught her up for a moment. “Well don’t you want to know why?” “I think I probably already know,” I said, although mostly to myself. “It’s because of the way you’re treating Lev,” she said without really hearing me. “No it’s not,” was my reply. We’d gone driving with the boys the evening before and I was still irritated. If anything, I was the one who should have been mad at her. “It’s because you wanted to stay and canoodle in the moonlight with Walter and I wanted to go home.” I sat down at the dressing table we shared, picked up a brush and started trying to tame my hair. “Well…” she stammered, “that too, but I also think you’re also being very rude to Lev.” “No I’m not,” I said quietly. “He really likes you,” she insisted. “No he doesn’t,” I told her, giving up on the brush and combing my hair with my fingers. “He doesn’t know me. I think he’s just interested in me because I’m a challenge. If I was all gah-gah for him, I’m sure he’d suddenly find that he likes a different girl.” “That’s still no reason to be rude to him,” Lilly grumbled. “It’s no reason to kiss him either,” I told her. “I could see where things were going and I didn’t want any part of it. You know, you don’t always have to do what a boy wants you to,” I told her. She shrugged. “I know. But Lev is so handsome,” she said, sinking onto her bed. “Don’t you think he’s very good looking?” “I’m sure if I saw his picture in a magazine, I might think that,” I told her. “But he’s not very nice and I really think he’s a bit of a bully.” I remembered the menacing look he had given Lilly’s date after just a slight ribbing. “I’m surprised Walter would want to be his friend.” “They’ve know each other forever,” Lilly said. “Walter thinks of him more like a brother.” “How do you think he got that bruise on his cheek?” I asked. It was a question that had been tugging at the back of my mind. Frowning, Lilly said, “Didn’t he say he was roughhousing with some friends and banged into a table?” “Sure, but that must have been some very rough roughhousing. His knuckles were all bruised and his hands were swollen.” “Really?” Lilly said, absentmindedly. “I hadn’t noticed.” “I bet.” My sister only had eyes for Walter. When he was around, a falling star could land at her feet and she probably wouldn’t even notice. “So I think you should go out with him again, just to make it up to him,” Lilly blurted rather quickly. “What?” She’d caught me off guard with that one. “You know, so he doesn’t think you dislike him or anything.” “But I do dislike him,” I told her. “As a matter of fact, I dislike him very much. I’d be perfectly happy if I never see him again.” Lilly got up to stand behind me so that we were both reflected in the mirror. “Isn’t that was Elizabeth says about Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice right before she falls in love with him?” “Lev Wilson is no Mr. Darcy,” I informed her. To me that was abundantly clear. “But you’re Elizabeth,” she said, gathering my hair in her hands. “You’re definitely the beauty of the family. That’s why Lev likes you so much, I guess.” “Jane was the beauty of the family,” I corrected her. “Elizabeth was the one who made the pert remarks.” That made Lilly smile. “So the analogy still holds,” she said with a laugh. I turned in my chair to look at her directly. “But seriously, Lilly, I really do not enjoy Lev Wilson’s company. I’m sorry if it makes things more challenging for Walter and you, but I will never agree to go on another date with his majesty again.” Lilly flopped back on her bed. “Do you really think he’s related to royalty?” she asked. This made me laugh. “Sure, in the same way that we’re all related to Adam and Eve.” “Oh.” Lilly frowned. “I really don’t think he’d lie about something like that. Do you?” I wanted to say that I though Lev Wilson would say it was day when it was pitch black outside, but instead I replied, “I think that Lev is maybe prone to exaggerations.” Gross exaggerations, to be more exact, but I didn’t say that part out loud. “I still don’t know why you don’t like him.” Lilly went back to her bed to have another moment to sulk. “Lilly, I’m afraid I just don’t.” I got up from my chair and walked over to her. “Please respect my feelings and stopped trying to fix us up. You’ll only make everyone miserable.” “Okay,” she finally relented. “How about another date with Herschel?” When I gave her a flat look, she quickly added, “Or maybe Walter could introduce you to another one of his friends.” I sighed. “Lilly, the next time you want to go out with Walter, I’ll go as your chaperone and just read a book. But please stop trying to fix me up with one of his friends.” Shaking her head, Lilly said, “You’re a funny kind of girl. You’re so pretty you could date any boy in town, but instead you spend all of your time with your nose in a book.” I couldn’t help but shrug. “I guess that’s just who I am. And probably who I’ll always be.” Chapter 16 Jessie The French maid let out a shriek and I thrust her from my arms as more men came barreling into the room. They were brandishing makeshift wooden stakes that they’d procured by breaking the legs off of tables and chairs. I was trapped with nowhere to run. There was only one door and that was filled by a dozen armed men. Even if I took out of few of the angry mob, there was no way I was getting out of there without a stake through my heart. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. My life as a member of the undead would be even briefer than my life as a mortal. “What are you doing here?” the maid screeched. “Get out! Get out!” I made the decision that I would not fight them. I would allow them to kill me without a struggle. There would be no blood on my hands as I went to meet the world’s maker. “Grab a stake or anything you have made out of wood,” one of the young men shouted at me. I recognized him immediately as the ruddy faced youth who had been impertinent to my sister. “There’s a vampire aboard the ship,” he said. “He’s lured one of the crew to his cabin and is feeding off the poor soul right now.” I just stood there, frozen to the spot, trying to take it all in. “A vampire?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes!” the man shouted. “They exist. And there’s one aboard this ship. Arm yourself and hurry up. I doubt the creature will go down without a fight.” “I…” I stammered. “I’m with you.” “Good,” the young man told me. “We need every able bodied man we can find. And we don’t have a minute to lose.” Then, turning to the rest of the mob, he shouted, “Let’s go!” The crowd turned as a unit and surged away from the door. I stumbled after them, absentmindedly grabbing a corkscrew on my way out the door. It wasn’t made out of wood. I’m not even sure why I grabbed it beyond the fact that the ruddy faced young man had instructed me to grab a weapon. “What’s going on?” Emily asked. The noise from the mob had woken her and she looked sleep-tousled, her eyes wide with fright. “Everything is fine,” I assured her, even though it was obviously a lie. One of our family had been discovered and was about to face a horrible death. But there was no reason to drag poor Emily into it. I didn’t want her to see one of us getting staked. Especially if the hapless individual happened to be our mother. “Just stay in your cabin,” I told her. “Lock the door.” As I hurried behind the mob, I called over my shoulder. “And keep the maid with you!” There was no reason for any young woman to get caught up in a bloodthirsty crowd, even a female of questionable virtue. “I’ll be fine. You can’t keep me locked in here,” the maid insisted, all remnants of her French accent giving way to something that sounded more like she hailed from Yorkshire. “Do as I say!” I shouted as I ran down the hall, on the heels of the angry mob. Which one of my family had been discovered? And would there be any way for me to save them without putting everyone’s life in danger? As we charged passed door after door of the first class cabins, I saw the face of my brother Daniel peeking out. At least I knew he wasn’t going to be the one to face the business end of a stake. That narrowed things down to either my grandfather or my mother; fifty-fifty odds for both of them. I knew I would fight to death for my mother. I couldn’t say what I would do for her father, especially if my suspicions were true about him hiring someone to dispose of my blood. My grandfather was a difficult man to love. In fact, if I was being honest, I hated him. But he was my maker and that tied me to him for eternity. The angry mob stopped outside a state room door. I had no idea if the room belonged to my mother. They banged on the door, but there was no response. Individuals yelled for a ship’s steward to open the door, but the mob was too impatient to wait. A couple of brawny young men began putting their shoulders to the door. It was well made and held out against the assault for several moments, before eventually bursting open. I had expected the crowd to surge forward, but instead they pulled back. An audible gasp was heard from most of the men who could see through the door. Everyone was so transfixed, either looking through the door or trying to look through the door, that I took a little risk and levitated several inches into the air to see over the crowd. I covered for this trick by pretending I was boosting myself up on the handle of the door across the way, but it would have been an almost impossible test of strength for a mortal. From my elevated position, I was able to see over the heads of the crowd. There was my grandfather, in the corner of the room, hunkered down like a rabid dog that had been cornered by the local sheriff. Blood dripped from the corners of his mouth, his fangs on full display. And there, slumped on the floor, was the half naked body of a boy. I recognized him immediately. It was Christian Franzen, the beautiful cabin boy who had spoken with Mother and me on the deck of the ship the previous evening. Blood was oozing from his neck and he looked very pale. He was making a faint mewing sound, like a hungry kitten. I could tell from the boy’s deathly white complexion and the deep wounds on his neck that Grandfather had intended to drain him dry. The mob had arrived just in time. “You animal,” someone shouted from the crowd. Grandfather jerked his head up. His eyes looked heavy, like those of a drunkard deep in his cups. “You peons,” he snarled, doing his best to pull himself up to his full height. “There’s nothing you can do to me. You cannot touch me.” “Get him!” several people shouted at once and the crowd surged forward. If it had been just a few men, Grandfather could have fought them, and probably won, even in his inebriated state. But the mob was too much for him. They began beating him with their makeshift stakes, the splinters from the broken table and chair legs piercing his flesh. He began to shriek in agony, but that only fueled the crowd. Quickly, I shoved my way through the masses to the limp body of Christian Franzen. People were so outraged by the assault on him, that they were willing to trample him in order to punish his molester. I pulled the cabin boy to the far corner of the room. There was the heavy scent of gin on his breath, which explained why Grandfather was acting so sluggish. The boy’s head lolled, his eyes were glassy, but he was able to focus on me for a brief moment. “Vampire,” he whispered and then he lost consciousness. The mob had seized Grandfather and was dragging him out of the cabin, all the while beating him and making him howl. I needed to save him. But Mr. Franzen was about to expire in my arms. Discretely, I punctured my fingertip with one of my fang. Once there was a bit of blood dripping from it, I stuck my finger in the cabin boy’s mouth. It only took a few moments for his eyelids to start fluttering. A few seconds after that and his eyes began to focus. He looked at me and let out a shriek, which I quickly stifled, clamping a hand over his mouth. “You’re safe,” I told him as he struggled against me, his body still weak from blood loss. “There is no reason to fear.” I forced a few more drops of blood into his mouth and his pallor began to improve. “You were attacked,” I told him. “But your assailant has been captured so there’s nothing more he can do to harm you.” The crowd had cleared the room by that point and I knew I had to follow them as quickly as possible to try to save my grandfather. “You must rest here,” I told him, gently lowering him to the rug. “Be still. No more harm will come to you.” I stood up. “I’ll send the ship’s physician just as soon as I can.” The cabin boy made an attempt to say something. He reached a trembling hand toward me and tried to force words to come out of his mouth. But I had already wasted too much time. I felt I couldn’t spare another moment. I pulled away from him. “Just stay there,” I shouted over my shoulder as I rushed out the door. The corridor was empty, but I followed the sound of angry voices to the deck of the ship. There was the mob, pummeling and kicking at a prostrate figure on the deck, which I knew to be the heartless creature who was my grandfather. What was I to do for him? Was there anything I could say that would stop the crazed mob from tearing him to pieces? I had to try something. He was my maker. “Wait!” I shouted, rushing forward and thrusting myself between the mob and my grandfather. “Stop!” I held my hands up to keep them back. “Why should we?” one of the men asked, his eye appearing crazed with bloodlust. “He’s a human,” I pointed out. “Doesn’t he at least deserve a trial?” “He’s not a human,” the man told me. “He’s a creature of the night. He gave up his right to a trial when he sold his soul to the devil.” Another man began to view me with suspicion. “Why are you so eager to defend him?” he asked, poking me on the chest with a brawny finger. “What’s this creature to you?” “Nothing,” I insisted. “I’m just studying the law.” “The law is only for humans,” a woman’s voice called from the back of the throng. “I wouldn’t give that creature the same consideration I’d give a dog.” Most people in the crowd seemed to heartily agree with her. I felt a hand close tightly around my ankle. Looking down, I made eye contact with my grandfather. “Save me,” he said in words so soft that no mortal ears could have heard them. “I am your maker. You owe me your immortal soul. You must save me.” “How?” I asked, mostly with my eyes. “I am your maker,” he whispered again. “You must save me, even if it means sacrificing yourself.” I knew at that moment that I truly hated my grandfather. I hated him to the very core of my being. But he was also my maker. I had to obey him. I felt obliged to try to preserve his life. Turning back to the crowd, I looked at all their mortal faces. I was just a fledgling vampire, but I knew that I had the ability to compel mortals to do my bidding. I didn’t have much experience using my influence over anyone and it seemed an insurmountable challenge to sway a rabid mob. But I felt Grandfather’s grip around my ankle. I could hear him whispering, “Save me. You must save me.” I had no choice. I had to either compel the crowd to leave him alone or fight them. “Please, listen to me,” I said, raising my hands in the air again to gather their attention. “No,” a woman shouted from the crowd. “Shove the boy out of the way and dispatch the beast.” And then the mob closed in, poking at me with their makeshift stakes to get me out of the way. Each scratch of the wood was like someone had set my skin on fire. I wanted to shriek in pain, but I knew if anyone took notice of the agony a few slivers were causing me, then I would be in the same position as my grandfather. “Come here, boy,” I heard a woman’s gruff voice command me. I was about to protest, but the lady got a firm hold of me and began dragging me away from Grandfather. “There’s no need for you to be caught up in this nonsense.” The woman was elderly and her voice was ragged, but she had a grip on me as strong as a vice. In a softer voice, she added, “We’re almost clear of him.” I did a double take and realized that the elderly woman was my mother in disguise. “What are you doing?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “Saving what’s left of my family,” she said in a low voice. “But Grandfather…” I stammered. “You’re death isn’t going to save him,” she said. I don’t know where Grandfather got the strength, but he’d climbed to his feet and started fighting the crowd. It seemed like some of the frenzy had left the mob. Instead of being swept up with outrage and moving with one mind and one will, they were all standing back, waiting for someone else to take the lead. If he’d played things right, maybe Grandfather could have gained control of the mob. Or at least temporarily escaped the crowd and hidden somewhere on the ship while regaining his strength. Then he could have waited until we were closer to New York and escaped by air, flying the rest of the way. But Grandfather was angry and used to being obeyed by mortals. He grabbed one of the men that was taunting him, lifted him into the air, and then flung him over the side of the ship. “Who wants to die next?” Grandfather shouted, glaring at the crowd. The people moved in a giant mass, slashing and stabbing at Grandfather with their stakes. They had him pinned against the rail. “We have to do something,” I said, pulling against my mother’s tight embrace. “No,” Mother said, shoving me back. “He’ll be gone in another moment. I think we’ve already done enough. We’re better off saving that poor soul who went over the side.” Then she released me and ran for a life preserver. I knew she was right, but I still felt compelled by my maker. Grandfather had commanded me to save him. I had to do something to save the evil fiend. I had to try. Almost against my will, I found myself taking a few steps toward the crowd. “Jessie!” Mother shouted, jolting my out of my trance. “Help me with the man overboard.” “Yes,” I said to her. “Yes, you’re right.” I hurried to the railing, took the life preserver from her and flung it to the man bobbing up and down in the waves. I could see him just as easily as if it had been high noon. The preserver had a rope attached to it. Only a few moments later and we were hauling the man back onto the deck of the ship. Grandfather was losing his battle. The best thing he could have done was take flight, but he was in such a weakened condition from all the stake wounds, that was no longer a possibility. Still, he wouldn’t give up the battle. He lunged for another man, but received a stake to the hand for his efforts. Jerking back in pain, he found himself pinned against the railing. Another moment of struggle and he was pushed over the side. My impulse was to catch him as he fell. I didn’t have much experience flying, but I knew the basics. Mother held me back, gripping my shirt with both her hands. “Let him go, Jessie,” she told me. “But…” I struggled against her grasp. “Jessie,” she said. “Look at me.” After I wrench my gaze away from where Grandfather had plunged in the water, she said, “I didn’t go through all this trouble to arrange your grandfather’s discovery, just to have you put yourself at risk to save him.” I stared at her, too stunned to think for several seconds. “You?” I couldn’t help but ask. And then I added, “Why?” Mother released me and then did her best to straighten out the wrinkles in my shirt. “That son-of-a-bitch already killed my sons,” she said. “I wasn’t going to let him get my daughter.” I let this new information sink into my brain. My mother had set the whole thing up. She’d found the perfect cabin boy and probably even gotten him drunk in the hopes that his blood would intoxicate her father, slowing his reflexes. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything to the rest of the family,” Mother said, scanning the people on the deck for any family members who might have come to see what all the noise was about. “Of course,” I assured her. “But…” My thoughts were all a jumble. Grandfather was Mother’s maker, too. How had she acted against him? It seemed impossible. “How did you do it?” I was finally able to ask. “How could you betray your maker? Even if he was a man like Grandfather?” “It wasn’t easy,” she told me, running her hands over her clothes to smooth nonexistent wrinkles in her dress. “But there’s one thing most makers don’t seem to understand.” “What?” I couldn’t help but ask. She turned to head back to her cabin, but then paused to look at me over her shoulder. “A mother’s love is stronger than any obligation she might feel toward her maker.” Chapter 17 Colette “You’re losing weight,” Mama observed, running an appraising eye over my figure. “Do you think?” I brushed my hands over my hips. I’d never been heavy, but I was rather curvy, which I knew Papa disliked. I’d overheard him talking with Mama once and he’d said flat out that I was too young to have such a womanly figure. “It must be all that bicycling you’ve been doing. It’s great exercise,” Mama said, turning back to the dishes. “I swear you must have ridden across half the state in the last month.” “Probably,” I agreed with her, picking up a clean plate and starting to dry it with a towel. What my mother didn’t know was that, even though I had been riding my bicycle a lot lately, it was always to the same place. It felt almost as if I had a magnet inside my belly that was always pulling me toward the castle. “It looks good on you,” Mama said as she drained the sink and started to wipe down the counter. “I think it’s healthy. You should keep it up.” She wouldn’t have thought it was healthy if she’d known about my visit to the castle that afternoon. I’d ridden my bike over there after school. I wanted to speak with the Italian workers before they finished the floors and were sent back to Italy. After the rose garden was finished, the English workers disappeared like they had evaporated into the air. There was only one caretaker left to make sure the roses stayed beautiful. He looked about a million years old and lived in a tiny house that was tucked out of sight of the castle. The problem was that the Italians were always working inside the castle and I wasn’t bold enough to stroll inside the building just to ask impertinent questions. Still, that afternoon, luck was on my side. As the wheels of my bicycle rolled to a halt just outside the castle, I noticed a young man with an immense crop of shiny black hair leaning against a tree. He was smoking a cigarette and had his eyes closed as he tilted his face toward the sun. The heavy layer of sawdust covering him from head to toe led me to believe that he might be one of the Italian workers. I was trying to think of a possible reason to strike up a conversation with him, when he said, “I am glad for this day. I have missed the sunshine.” He’d kept his eyes closed when speaking so I wasn’t quite sure he was addressing me, but there was nobody else around. “It another few months it will be quite warm,” I answered him, still staying astride my bicycle. “Yes, but by then I will be gone.” He opened his eyes to look at me and I was surprised to realize that they were green when I had been expecting brown. “You are from Italy?” I asked. I was feeling rather shy to be standing there by myself, speaking to a young man I didn’t know, but I forced myself to be bold. “Si,” he said, closing his eyes again like a cat enjoying a nap in a sunbeam. He tilted his head back to rest it against the tree. “You are one of the men laying the floors in the castle?” “Si,” he said again. Climbing off my bike, I put down the kickstand. Taking a deep breath, I blurted, “Have you ever met the family who will live here?” My question caused the young man to lift his head and look directly at me. After staring at me for several seconds, he said, “No,” rather curtly. “I have never met the people who will live here. But I hear of them and it is never good things.” “What have you heard about them?” I asked, fully realizing that I sounded like the town gossip. The young man shifted his weight from one foot to the other. My question had made him uncomfortable. “It is stories that are not nice to hear,” he said. “They are not for the young girl like you.” I felt the sting of disappointment. What was the age where people stopped saying things like, “You’re too young to hear things like that,” or, “I’ll tell you when you’re older,”? This young man couldn’t have been much older than me and he knew the stories. I started getting back on my bicycle. There didn’t seem much point in haranguing him if he was reluctant to talk. But my leaving somehow loosened his tongue. “I will tell you this thing,” he said. “I would not like for such a family to move to my town.” “Why not?” I ask, not bothering to climb off my bike. His face darkened and I couldn’t tell if he was getting angry or just struggling for the right words. “They are not like the people,” he said. “They make the bite.” “Oh.” I was beginning to understand him. “You mean their dogs?” “No.” He shook his head adamantly. “They are not the mannaro.” “Pardon?” I said, bending my ear toward him. His English was good, but I didn’t quite catch the last word. “They’re not the what?” “Mannaro,” he said again, more slowly. “I do not know this word in English, but that is not the family.” He looked at the space between us for a couple of seconds, his lips moving slightly as he tried to work something out in his head. “They are not the lupo.” Then his eyes widened a little. “They are not the wolf, but they bite. They bite very badly. You must stay away.” The Vanderlinds apparently had some kind of weird pets that were especially vicious, was all I could conclude. Some type of dog or wolf or something. Maybe these animals had a habit of escaping their kennels and attacking the locals. That was the only thing I could guess. But would the family really ship such beasts across an ocean? Especially after they’d already made such trouble? I was just about to mention this possibility to the young man, when another worker, middle aged and also covered in sawdust, came out of the castle. He immediately yelled at my new friend in a foreign language. I assumed it was Italian. The young man said something in reply, also in a heated voice. He gestured at me several times. The only word I understood between them was the name Vanderlind. The older man swung around to glare at me and then a string of words came out of his mouth very rapidly. I had no idea what he was saying. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I don’t speak Italian.” This apparently made the man even more furious. He took a deep breath and then said, “You go out of here! You leave this! You do not come here!” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I was just asking about the Vanderlind family. I didn’t mean to keep anyone from their work.” That was the only thing I could think of that would make him so red in the face. “Go!” the man shouted. “You go now!” He waved his hands at me as if trying to chase me off. “You not come back here.” “I really didn’t mean to get anyone in trouble.” I gave the young man an apologetic look. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “He wants that you should go,” said the young man. “He wants that you leave because there is danger.” “You no come back here!” the older man roared. He picked up a pebble from the ground and threw it in my general direction. “Ora!Ora!” he shouted, reaching for another pebble. I had a feeling that this time he wouldn’t miss. Turning my bike fully around, I started pedaling hard and didn’t stop until I was safe in the garage back at my house. The whole things was very strange, and frightening, and a little humiliating somehow. I didn’t appreciate being chased off like a sheep that had strayed into the wrong pasture. The man didn’t have to throw stones at me. There was still some time before dinner, so I went to my room to think. Why were all the workmen warning me about the Vanderlinds? There must have been some terrible incident back in Hungary. Something to do with some type of vicious dogs. Maybe the dogs had killed a person. Maybe even a few people. Was that why the Vanderlinds had decided to move away? To escape the shame of their pets having killed or maimed some people. That seemed rather strange, but it was the only thing I could thinking of, given what I had been told. I decided that it was probably best for me to stay away from the caste, at least until the floors were finished and the Italian carpenters were gone. I was drawn to the castle, but that didn’t mean I had to be foolish. If there really were rabid dogs that were going to be housed on the estate, then I would have to fight my nature and avoid the place as much as possible. I didn’t mind a well behaved dog that was happy just to sit on a porch or fetch a stick, but I was not overly comfortable with dogs that liked to jump and bark. A vicious dog would probably be able to sense my fear and target me for its next attack. I was sad that I wouldn’t be able to ride over to the castle anymore, but I wasn’t a stupid girl. Those men were warning me for a reason. Just then Lilly came into the room and immediately flung herself on her bed. “What’s wrong?” I asked her. “They’re letting me go from Zucker’s,” she said, tearfully. “Why?” I exclaimed, coming over to sit next to her on the bed. “What happened?” “Oh… Mrs. Zucker’s cousin in moving to Tiburon,” Lilly said, wiping her eyes and giving a loud sniff. “She’s going to start working there, so they won’t have any space left for me,” she explained. “And there’s not a job for you, either,” Lilly said. “Mr. Zucker asked me to tell you.” “Oh, no.” I let my shoulders slump. The Zuckers had told me that I could work at their store over the summer. I was hoping to start at the end of the month, when school let out. Lilly and I had planned to work there as much as we could to bring in extra money for Mama and Papa. And Lilly had thought she might keep working there for a few years, at least until she got married or found another job. “Now I’m never going to get to see Walter,” Lilly said, morosely as she flopped onto her stomach. “Have you told Mama and Papa?” I asked. “No,” Lilly told me, her voice slightly muffled by her pillow. “Well don’t say anything yet,” I told her. “Let’s try to find some other work first so they don’t have to worry.” The other evening, Lilly had overheard Mama and Papa talking about paying the bills. Things were getting very tight. Papa was worried that if he didn’t find more work then we might have to sell the house and move in with his brother. All of us loved our house. Papa had crafted it with his own two hands and it really was a thing of beauty. Lilly and I were determined to contribute whatever we could to keep us in our home. “Alright,” Lilly agreed. The jobs at Zucker’s had sounded too good to be true. There were plenty of people out of work and willing to do just about anything to earn a couple of dollars. “I’m sure we could maybe get something on one of the farms.” “There’s got to something,” I agreed with her, but we both knew it was going to be a challenge. “It’s just a shame they didn’t hire Papa to work building the castle,” I said. Lilly gave a small laugh, even though there were still tears in her eyes. “You’re just saying that because then you would get to look inside.” “Well, that too.” I couldn’t help but join her in giggling a little. “But I mean, it would have been nice for him to have the work.” Sighing, Lilly murmured, “I guess it’s too bad our last name doesn’t sound Hungarian.” Chapter 18 Jessie The person who took Grandfather’s death the hardest was Mrs. Denkler. I told her when I returned to the cabin, after checking that someone was attending to the cabin boy’s injuries. I hoped to everything holy and unholy that Grandfather had not left any clues behind connecting him to the Vanderlind family. I knew his cabin would be thoroughly searched. “No, no, no,” Mrs. Denkler wailed once I’d told her of her employer’s demise. She immediately began tearing at her hair with grief. I wrapped my arms around her and held her firmly to stop her from doing further injury to herself. “He’s gone,” was all I could tell her. “I tried to save him, but it was impossible. The crowd wouldn’t stop until they were sure he was dead.” Emily was standing behind Mrs. Denkler. I could see her over the shoulder of the grieving housekeeper. Tears were pouring down her face. She looked at me, her entire body trembling. “You mean,” she gasped. “You mean that I won’t have too…” she couldn’t finish her words. “You mean I’ll never…” I nodded, and tried to summon a smile. “That’s right,” I told her. “You’re going to live to be an old lady.” Our mother had seen to that. Emily covered her face with her hands and ran to her cabin, slamming the door behind her. I was glad for her. I knew she had dreaded becoming a member of the undead. But her actions did leave me with an inconsolable Mrs. Denkler in my arms. “What will become of me now?” the housekeeper wailed. “What will become of me?” “Everything will be just fine,” I said, half carrying her across the room to lie her down on the couch. “You’ll come with us to America. You’ll be the Vanderlind housekeeper. Nothing has changed,” I assured her. I rang to have some liquor brought to the cabin and ordered it to be brought on the double. The steward arrived with a bottle of bourbon and a bottle of soda. He wanted to come in and set the drinks up for me on the bar, but I refused to let him enter the cabin. Instead, I asked him to just pass everything over the threshold. Mrs. Denkler was so distraught, I didn’t know what she might let slip with a stranger in the room. At first the steward seemed a little offended, but I was able to smooth things over with a rueful smile and a generous tip. “Here, Denkie, drink this,” I instructed, handing her a brimming glass. “It’ll calm you,” I assured her. I had expected our housekeeper to just sip daintily at the straight bourbon I had handed her, but she downed half the glass in just one gulp. Her body shivered and pitched a little as the liquor ran through her, but it did interrupt her wailing. After that she sat there for several minutes, just staring at the wall opposite her, not moving or making a sound. I wasn’t sure what I could do for her or what I could offer her to make her feel better. My mother had suspected Denkie would take the news hard. She had taken it upon herself to somehow get the news to Daniel, if he didn’t already know. My brother had been eager to become a member of the undead and he had more respect for our grandfather than the rest of us. Still, as long as the Vanderlind name was untarnished and our fortune was still intact, I doubted Daniel would mind too horribly much. Without warning, Mrs. Denkler rose to her feet. “If you’ll excuse me,” she said in a quiet voice. “I think I need to lie down for a few minutes. “Please,” I said, hurrying over to her in case she should be unsteady. But that was not the case. She crossed the room to the cabin she shared with my sister without a tremble, her head high and her eyes hard. “I think you should just turn in for the night,” I told her, seeing her to her door. Her eyes shifted in my direction, but I could tell she wasn’t really looking at me. Her movements gave the impression that she was more automaton than human. “Thank you,” she said. “You’ve always been a kind boy.” When Mrs. Denkler had turned the lock inside the cabin, I hurried to my private quarters and dug into my valise. I drained the remaining contents of the first pint in one large gulp and had downed half of the second bottle before I really knew what I was really doing. It took great self-restraint for me to cork the remaining blood and tuck it away. I had to force myself out of the room; the urge to finish the pint was so strong. After the light went out in Emily and Mrs. Denkler’s cabin, I felt truly alone with only my thoughts to keep me company. Sinking onto the couch, I cupped my head in my hands. Grandfather’s demise was too horrible to think about. If I closed my eyes, I could still see the image of him going over the side. He hadn’t cried out as he fell; no wail of fear, no words of farewell. He must have been too weak to fly. I had to wonder if he suspected any of his family of treachery. Did he know my mother had set him up to be discovered? And was Grandfather truly gone? That was another thought that would keep me awake in my coffin. He was in a weakened state and had been slashed at by many shards of wood, but had he actually been staked? Was he still of this world, just floating in the ocean somewhere? We were in the middle of the Atlantic. There wasn’t even the smallest bit of land for a thousand miles, but that didn’t mean that Grandfather wasn’t still alive. Had he somehow kept pace with the ship and was, even now, climbing aboard, hell-bent on revenge? That thought compelled me to my feet. I found myself on deck a moment later without jacket nor any memory if I had locked the state room door. I began hurrying down flights of stairs to the lower decks. Surely there would be wet footprints if he’d managed to save himself. I scanned the polished floorboards and hung over the railing, trying to glimpse if there was a figure bobbing in the ocean. At the stern of the ship, I caught sight of a shadowy figure, leaning against the rail. He was the same size as my grandfather and had the same demeanor. I stutter-stepped with surprise, but a moment later I understood that the figure was my brother. “He’s not here,” Daniel said, his voice a low growl. “I’ve been looking since I got word, but there’s not a sign of him.” “So he’s really gone, then?” I had to wonder. “He’s out there.” We both took a moment to examine the vastness of the ocean. “He was a foolish old bugger,” Daniel felt the need to observe. “Feasting on a cabin boy… I should have thought Grandfather had better self control.” I shrugged. “Maybe the temptation was too great.” Daniel laughed. “I suppose we should be grateful Mother insisted we travel under false names,” he observed, using a voice that was loud enough to draw attention. I jerked my head slightly to let him know he should be silent. It was stupid of him to assume that we were the only beings out and about, even though it was the middle of the night. “Don’t be such a prig,” my brother muttered. “There’s no one around to hear us.” I could see that Daniel had inherited the arrogance that had been our grandfather’s undoing. But it would do me no good to point that out. Daniel seemed satisfied that Grandfather had not made it back onto the ship and I had no reason to doubt him. “Have a good night,” I told my brother as I turned to stroll away. It never even occurred to me to ask him to share some of his blood. I would let the last misdeed of our Grandfather go unknown to the rest of the family. He’d done enough evil things in his life. I didn’t need to add one final black-mark against him. When I opened the door to our quarters again, the first thing I saw was Mrs. Denkler’s hard eyes glittering in the darkness. I could see her clear as day, but there was something about the darkness that may her eyes glow in a different way. “Oh,” I said, rather surprised. “I thought you’d gone to bed.” “No,” she told me. “I just needed to rest for a minute.” I wasn’t sure what to say. “I hope you’re not unwell.” “No, I am well,” she insisted. “The loss of your grandfather was quite a shock, but I’m sure the family feels it more than I do.” I nodded, unwilling to commit words to the topic. “I greatly appreciate your understanding when I…” Mrs. Denkler waved a thin hand through the air. “When I became upset. I was very fond of your grandfather.” “Yes, of course,” was all I could think to say. “And I appreciate your assurance that your family stills values my services,” she said. I tried to smile. “I don’t think we could run the castle without you.” “Do you mind if I turn on a light?” she asked. “It makes things easier for me.” “Yes, of course,” I said. “Don’t get up. Let me do it for you.” I quickly found the switch. “I have something for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, holding out a small cup covered with a cloth. I asked, “What is it?” but my nose had already told me. It’s was blood. “Where did you get it?” I exclaimed. Then I noticed that her left arm was bandaged at the wrist. “Denkie, you didn’t!” “Of course I did,” she said, still offering me the cup of nectar. “I know you’re trying to be brave and not say anything to your family, but it’s going to be hard for you to make it another two full days without feeding. Better to have some of my blood, given voluntarily, than to have you lose control and…” Her voice cracked a little. “And get caught the way your grandfather was.” “I couldn’t,” I told her, although my eyes were glued to the cup in her hand. “Of course you can,” she said, sounding a little cross. “And besides, what do you think will happen if you slip up and the passengers discover another vampire aboard this ship?” She was right. If I did make a mistake, then she and Emily would also be held responsible. And it wouldn’t stop there. They crew would probably search the boat, cabin by cabin, until my mother and brother were also discovered. If I lost control, then my whole family would more than likely be killed. I took the blood, noticing how, when I reached for it, my hand trembled. It seemed somehow obscene to drink Mrs. Denkler’s blood in front of her, so I hurried to my private cabin before gulping down the red nectar. It was still warm from when she’d drained it from her arm. After the cup was empty, I was lost in a confusing swirl of ecstasy and revulsion. Mrs. Denkler had been our housekeeper my entire life. I had never thought of her in any sort of intimate terms beyond her being an older woman who felt at liberty to scold me if I acted up. But drinking her blood, even if it was from a cup, was somehow so intimate. It made me feel uneasy, like I had accidentally stumbled across her in her bath. Once I fought passed all the confusing sensations, I felt much better. I was in control of my appetite again. I could face being with mortals and not break out into a sweat, visualizing them with their necks’ laid bare. I felt an extreme amount of gratitude toward Mrs. Denkler. She was more than just a good housekeeper and a loyal servant. She really was part of the Vanderlind family. I wouldn’t forget the gift she had given me. Chapter 19 Colette I stayed away from the castle for as long as I could. Not going there had me so distracted that it was a challenge to concentrate on my school work or even carry on a simple conversation. Our final exams for the year were quickly approaching and I wondered how I would ever get through them with my thoughts always straying to the massive gray structure on the other side of town. I couldn’t help but daydream about who would be living there and how they would spend their days. I wondered if they had any children, and if yes, how old were they? I knew it was silly to believe that anyone so wealthy would send their offspring to Tiburon High, but I wasted hours daydreaming about it. I didn’t dare include myself in the world I was creating in my mind. I knew that there were thousands of novels where a young man from a wealthy family falls in love with the lowly shop girl, but I knew better than to believe something so magical would ever happen to someone like me. Still, I found the longer I stayed away from the castle, the more it consumed me. After two weeks, I decided I would have to visit the site again or my grades would start to suffer. That afternoon, I set out on my bicycle immediately after school. I hoped that the Italian workers had finished their tasks by then and were on a boat back to Italy. I didn’t relish the idea of having more stones thrown at me while men scolded me in a language I did not understand. As I coasted my bike down the recently paved road, I was stunned to see how complete the castle appeared. If I didn’t know differently, I would have assumed that the Vanderlind Castle had been standing on the shores of the Tiburon since the crusades. Then I caught sight of more barges on the river. The family’s furniture and personal effects had arrived. Giant crates were being used to unloaded the cargo onto the shore. Men wielding claw hammers and pry bars were opening large crates and carefully removing the contents. Everything had been packed in straw, so there were a dozen women efficiently wiping down each item. Then the contents were being moved into the castle by dozens of men. From a distance it looked like a line of ants hefting away the remnants of a picnic. The entire process was being orchestrated by an older woman wearing a long gray dress with a high collar. Her dark gray hair was pulled back in an elaborate coil and her hands never stopped moving as she gave orders to each man as he entered the building. I was amazed that she could look at a lamp or a dressing table and know exactly where it belonged. She wasn’t even consulting a clip board. She apparently had the entire contents of the castle memorized. I stood there for several minutes, just watching the progress and admiring the beautiful furnishings of the Vanderlinds’ home. It was probably the only opportunity I would have to see anything so fine, outside of a museum, so I was doing my best to soak it all in. The workmen unloaded a very large crate that contained several smaller crates. They were all shaped the same, like long, squat rectangles. When one of the workmen started to apply his pry bar to the contents, the older woman in gray rushed over. I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she directed the workmen to carrying those specific crates into the house unopened. I couldn’t figure out what their contents could be. They weren’t the right shape or weight to be safes. And even if they were strongboxes of some type, filled with valuables, it wasn’t likely the workmen would have been able to crack them open with all the other people swarming around. I stared after the peculiar crates with keen interest. When I turned my eyes back to the general crowd of workers, I noticed that the lady in charge of the unpacking was looking directly at me. She had sharp eyes and wore a frown on her lips. I felt immediately embarrassed for being caught gawking. I was being frightfully rude. After all, how would I feel if we moved houses and the new neighbors turned up on the sidewalk to look over all our furnishing? I began to turn my bike around. It seemed like my days of gazing at the castle were over. Once the Vanderlinds moved in, I couldn’t exactly show up and stare at their house, no matter how much I felt drawn to it. If I did, the family would probably call the sheriff on me. As I placed a foot on the pedal and began to push down, I heard a voice call out, “Wait there, young lady.” Turning my head, I saw the woman in charge, marching straight toward me. She did not look pleased. “I’m sorry,” I blurted, unconsciously rolling the bike a little with my foot to keep some distance between us. “I just liked coming by to watch while they were building the castle. I won’t come by anymore,” I assured her. “Do you live in this town?” the woman asked, stopping several yards away from me and waving a hand through the air toward the general direction of Tiburon. “Yes,” I told her, rather hesitantly. “I live in Tiburon.” I wondered if she even knew our town’s name. Something told me she hadn’t bothered to commit it to memory. “Do you like it here?” she asked. From her appearance and her association with the Hungarian castle, I had expected her to speak with a foreign accent, but besides sounding a little formal, she had none. “Um... “It wasn’t a question I had given any great consideration. “Yes. I do like it here,” I said, inching my bike a bit further down the recently paved road. I wasn’t comfortable under the woman’s intense gaze. “And the castle interests you?” she asked, continuing in her questioning. “Yes,” I admitted. “I think it’s fascinating. But, you don’t have to worry. I won’t come by anymore, now that the family is about to arrive. I promise.” I put a hand to my cheek, my face feeling hot under her scrutiny. A tight smile curled the corners of the woman’s mouth. “Would you like to work in the castle?” she asked. “Pardon?” Now she had really caught my attention. “I asked if you would like to work at the castle,” she said, the smile quickly fading and an edge of impatience creeping into her voice. After thinking about it a moment, I said, “Yes, I would like to work at the castle. But I’m not sure what I’m qualified to do.” The woman looked me over from head to toe. “You are very much the kind of young lady I would like to have working at Vanderlind Castle.” “Thank you,” I told her. “And as it happens, I am looking for work as soon as school lets out for the summer. But I’m not sure of what kind of workers you are hoping to find.” “You could work as a housemaid,” she said, “I would have to train you, of course. But I’m sure you’ve cleaned house for your mother, or perhaps an elderly neighbor who was ill. Of course, at the castle we have very exacting standards.” I nodded, my stomach doing a flip. Did this dour-looking woman really mean to offer me a job at the castle that I’d been obsessing over for months? Did she really mean I would get to go inside and look at all the pretty things as I dusted and scrubbed them? I couldn’t imagine any kind of work that I would like better. Trying not to squirm with excitement, I said, “Of course.” “My name is Mrs. Denkler,” the lady told me. “I’m the housekeeper for the castle and I do all the staff hiring.” “How do you do?” I said in reply. “I am Colette Gibson. It’s very nice to meet you.” Mrs. Denkler tilted her head to one side and looked me over some more. “Do you know any other young ladies like you, who might be looking for work as a housemaid?” “My sister is also looking for a job,” I told her, sounding way too eager. “She was just let go from Zucker’s.” I immediately wished I hadn’t mentioned the general store, so I hastily added, “But that was because Mrs. Zucker’s cousin is taking the job. Not because Lilly isn’t a good worker.” The castle’s housekeeper raised her eyebrows slightly. “Your sister?” she asked. “Does she look anything like you?” “Oh, yes,” I told her. “People can always tell we’re sisters. Although she has nicer hair,” I felt the need to say for no good reason, self consciously sliding a hand over my own unruly locks. “Your hair is lovely,” Mrs. Denkler said. The sun was starting to set and it made her eyes glitter. “You remind me of the Empress Elisabeth, poor child.” For a moment, I thought she pitied me for my wild mane, but then she added, “She was stabbed to death by an anarchist, you know.” “Oh,” I exclaimed, but then I could think of nothing else to say. I didn’t know who she meant and I wasn’t quite sure what an anarchist was. “Come by tomorrow,” Mrs. Denkler told me. “You may knock at the door around to the right, closest to the river. Tell whoever lets you in that you have an appointment to see me.” “It will have to be after school,” I told her. “We haven’t been let out for the summer yet.” “That’s fine,” Mrs. Denkler said, turning to return to her duties. “Just come by as early as you can. And be sure to bring your sister.” I practically flew home, I was so excited. After I walked in the door and gave Mama a kiss, she told me that Lilly was in our room. I took the stairs two at a time. I wanted to tell the news to my sister first before we surprised Mama and Papa. “Lettie!” Lilly exclaimed, leaping up from her bed as soon as I entered the room. “I have wonderful news.” “You do?” I asked, momentarily thrown off. I was so caught up in my own news it was hard to change gears. “Well, I have news first, and you’re never going to believe it.” “Let me tell first,” Lilly said. “I’ve been waiting for hours for you to get home.” She was bubbling with excitement and so was I. I gripped her hands and we both started to giggle. “Okay, you first,” I told her, “but tell it quick because I’m about to burst.” “We’ve been invited to a dance in Mansfield,” she blurted. “And there’s going to be a swing band and everything.” “Oh.” I wasn’t exactly sure what she meant by “we’ve” been invited. She was grinning from ear to ear. I didn’t want pour cold water on her excitement, so I hedged for more information by saying, “Walter invited you?” “No, not exactly,” she said, looking a little sly. “It’s Lev who can get the tickets. But he’s allowed to have four, so he thought it would be fun for the four of us to go.” “You mean you’re going on a double date with Lev and another girl,” I insisted. Lilly’s face fell. “Don’t you want to hear a swing band?” “Sure,” I said with a shrug. “But I can do that on the radio.” “I mean don’t you want to see and hear a swing band? Lev is a great dancer,” she assured me. “Right.” I shook my head a little. “I suppose he told you that himself.” “Come on, Lettie,” she said. “You know Mama and Papa won’t let me go unless you’re with me. Please?” My sister’s face was aglow with excitement, probably at the thought of Walter holding her in his arms under the guise of dancing. But the thought of Lev Wilson having his arms around me made me cringe. I didn’t care if he was a good dancer; there was just something about him that made me want to run a mile in the opposite direction. “You have to let me know now,” Lilly insisted, “because Lev needs to know if he should take the tickets.” It sounded like an evening to dread. “When is it?” I asked. “Next month,” she told me, beaming with anticipation. “Doesn’t that leave plenty of time for Lev to find a date with another girl?” I asked. “I mean, aren’t there dozens of young women lining up just hoping he’ll give them the time of day?” My sister put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “Do you really expect me to be excited by your good news when you act this way?” “But my news is actually good news,” I insisted. Chapter 20 Jessie “Stop being such a prig,” Daniel said. “This will be our last glimpse of culture before we’re lost in the jungles of Borneo.” I looked at the line of girls, all in various stages of undress with their negligees showing. “I’m not sure I’d refer to a brothel in New York as culture,” I told him in a low voice, so that the girls couldn’t hear. I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. “At least it’s a Manhattan brothel,” was my brother’s reply. “Just imagine the state of the girls in small town Ohio.” He gave an affected shudder. “I don’t know what Grandfather was thinking. If he was still around, I’d probably try to stake him myself.” We’d arrived in New York with no more trouble. Mrs. Denkler was sent on ahead to oversee the preparations of the house while the family stayed in New York for a few extra weeks. One evening Daniel asked me to head out to see the sights. I hadn’t realized that by “sights” my brother had meant the seedy underbelly of the city. In his defense, vice was often the only mortal activities that went on in the middle of the night. “Just choose one, for pity sake,” Daniel snarled. “You don’t have to feed off of her if you don’t want to.” I didn’t want to feed off of any of the girls. Or, more truthfully, I desperately wanted to suck the life out of every single one of them, but openly admitting that urge was appalling to me. As expected, New York was infested with vampires. The Vanderlind name carried some weight in undead circles, so we were welcomed to the city with open arms. Everyone was appalled to hear of the fate of our patriarch. There was even some discussion of setting up a search party, or taking revenge on the mortals who had thrown him overboard. But mother insisted that she had seen him with a stake in his chest as he fell over the side. “Otherwise he would have simply flown away,” she pointed out. And to those vampires hot for revenge, she settled them by saying, “I knew my father best and he wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to put his immortality at risk to avenge his own foolishness. He knew the risk he was taking when he let that young man into his cabin.” There was ample blood available for us to consume, which brought me great relief. I had barely been clinging to the threads of sanity when a porter finally summoned up the nerve to tell me that I must vacate my cabin and leave the ship. Mrs. Denkler’s generosity had enabled me to save most of the second pint of blood I had concealed in my valise. Before disembarking the ship, I downed the entire bottle so that I would have enough fortitude to make it through customs. When we were offered refreshment at the house where we were to stay, I didn’t ask how the blood had been obtained. I just gulped it down, feeling grateful that I hadn’t done anyone an injury during the crossing. And that I hadn’t ended up alongside Grandfather at the bottom of the Atlantic. “You’re stalling,” Daniel said, jolting me out of my reverie. “If I’d known you were going to be such a prude, I would have come by myself and left you to rot with Mother’s stuffy friends.” It was true, our host and hostess were not the most modern of people. But they had been members of the undead for over two hundred years, so I found it excusable that they hadn’t exactly stayed current with the times. Spending another evening listening to stories about the death of Casanova was quickly losing its appeal. But I would have preferred that to a whore house. I’d never lain with a woman, even though I was as eager as the next seventeen years old fellow. Somehow the thought of a prostitute threw cold water on my desire. They all looked so world weary, even though some of the young women couldn’t have been much older than me. There was a dullness in their eyes that spoke of a numbing of the soul. As a mortal, I had dreamed that my first time would be with my wife, whoever she might be. But I had also dreamed that I would be allowed to marry for love and not to increase the family fortune. Or extend our bloodline. “Oh, for crying out loud,” Daniel grumbled. Striding over to the group of young women who were putting their wares on display, he plucked a girl out of the line. “Here,” he said, grabbing her by the arm. “She looks about your speed,” he said, shoving her in my direction. The girl took a few stumbling steps and then fell into my arms. She looked up at me with large, luminous blue eyes and said, “I’m sorry. Pardon me.” I helped her to her feet, unable to avoid noticing that she was quite lovely, like a pale flower in the moonlight. “It’s not a problem,” I assured her. “Are you alright?” “Yes,” she said, in a half whisper, blinking rapidly. “And I am happy to go with you. I’m happy to do whatever you ask. But you’ll have to be patient with me, sir, because…” She turned her head away from me to conceal her embarrassment and shame. “This is my first time,” she said in a voice that carried a small tremble. My first impulse was to protect her. I wanted to take her in my arms and fly away from there to someplace safe and clean. But then she leaned into me, as if a little unsure on her feet, placing a hand on my chest. I could smell the men on her. And not just from a night of customers, but days and days of sweaty sailors and straying husbands climbing on top of her and partaking of the service she provided. The main room of the bordello was illuminated by only one lamp and that light was covered with a red scarf. It was intended to look like part of the atmosphere, but I suspected it was mostly to make the girls appear a little younger and a little less worn than they would in the daylight. “I’m ready,” the girl told me, tentatively taking my hand. “As long as you promise to be gentle.” Using my night vision, I could see that she wasn’t actually a young girl at all. She wore her hair in a girlish style and she had a petite figure, but I would have placed her age closer to twenty-seven than seventeen. Sensing my hesitation, the young woman tugged on my arm again. “Don’t be bashful,” she told me. “We can experience this new adventure together.” “No, that’s okay,” I told her, gently disengaging my arm. “I wouldn’t want to turn anyone from a fresh flower to a soiled dove. Although I appreciate your willingness.” “You don’t want to share your first time with me?” she asked, somewhat surprised. Her innocence routine had obviously not been questioned too many times before. “No thank you,” I told her and then pressed a half-dollar into her palm. “I think you should probably leave this place while you still have your health.” “Oh, if only I could,” she said, allowing tears to fill her eyes. “But I have nowhere else to go. And no one to be kind to me.” “I’m sorry to hear of your troubles,” I told her, pressing another half dollar into her palm, “but I am not the right man for you.” I sensed she was about to continue to give me her damsel in distress routine, so I fixed her with my eyes and said, “Trust me when I tell you that I am not a person whom you would want to know more intimately. Now please leave me alone.” She stared at me for several seconds, not moving or even blinking, before saying, “I understand. And wish you an enjoyable evening.” Then she turned and quickly hurried out of the room. Daniel made a sound of disgust. “I don’t have all night to dawdle while you act fussy,” he told me. Grabbing a voluptuous red head by the wrist, he began towing her down the hall. “Wait for me, once you’re finished,” he called over his shoulder. “I might go back for seconds.” “I’m sorry about Crystal,” the Madame said, stepping forward. The older lady had her hair piled high on her head and she had painted a red circle on each cheek as a substitute for any kind of blush reflex. “She’s new to our establishment and maybe a little too untested for your liking. But I’m sure we have plenty of girls who can please you,” she said, indicating the females like a butcher displaying a case full of meat. Glancing down the line of women and girls, I spied one female who had withdrawn into the corner, furthest away from the lamp. She was older than the others and standing at a peculiar angle that spoke of suppressed pain. I could tell just from looking at her that she was unwell. She’d done her best to cover her malady with plenty of rouge and powder, but I could detect her sallow skin underneath. Noticing my glance, the Madame perked up. “Has someone caught your eye?” she asked. “Yes,” I told her. “I’d be happy to get to know the young woman in the corner a little better.” The Madame frowned. “Are you sure?” she asked, arching an eyebrow in my direction. “Bernadette has been unwell lately, so maybe you might be happier with a different girl.” “No,” I told her with a polite smile. “Bernadette will suit me just fine.” The older woman shrugged. “You know your own mind, young man,” she said, then snapped her fingers at the female in the corner. “Bernadette,” she called. “Somebody give her a shove.” Another girl goosed her and Bernadette’s eyes fluttered. “Bernadette, you have a customer.” “Oh,” the woman said. “Oh, good. And such a handsome man to take an interest in me.” I could tell by the way she moved across the room that she was in immense pain, but she tried to carry it off as if she wasn’t. Bernadette did her best not to hobble as she led me down a dark passageway to the rooms where the girls plied their trade. Someone, presumably the Madame, had been burning incense to cover the stench of unwashed sheets and human misery. I had to wonder, if this was a high-class whorehouse, what were the low-class whorehouses like? The thought made me shudder. Mistaking my actions for trembling, Bernadette squeezed my arm. “Don’t worry, sweetie,” she said. “I’m not going to judge you. You can be as quick as you like.” Chapter 21 Colette Our mother picked us up from school the next afternoon and drove us out to the castle. “It doesn’t seem right for you girls to arrive on bicycles,” she said, “when applying for work in such a fancy home.” Lilly and I did our best to clean up in the back of the car while Mama drove. I was so nervous I was practically shaking. We were going to go inside the castle. Sure, it was only the servants’ entrance, but still, we would be inside. I should have been tired because I kept waking up all night with crazy, and wonderful, and frightening dreams, but I was too excited to feel tired. In fact, all day at school I was practically bouncing off the walls. As we drove up to the castle, I was surprised to see a gate was being erected around the building. I guess that was probably to keep the family’s vicious dogs from running wild. I hadn’t said anything to my family about the dogs. I didn’t want to risk that my parents would refuse to let us work at the castle, just because of some unruly pets. The Vanderlind family must have recently moved in because there was already a guard in purple livery attending the area where I assumed they would eventually erect the gate. “Yes?” he asked. He had a heavy accent that I couldn’t identify, so the word came out more like, “Ves?” My mother stared at him for a moment, not sure what to say and then eventually found her tongue. “My daughters were asked to come by today to apply for positions as maids,” she said. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was feeling a little intimidated. “Mrs. Denkler,” I called from the back seat. “We were invited here by a Mrs. Denkler.” The guard’s face registered immediate recognition of the name. “Drive through,” he told Mama in a somber voice. “Go to the right. Knock on the door for deliveries.” Once Mama had parked the car, Lilly and I climbed out and straightened our skirts. “Just remember to be polite,” Mama instructed us. “And be honest about your work experience. I’m sure they would appreciate honesty above anything else.” We both assured her that we would. As we approached the door with the deliveries sign posted on it, Lilly suddenly turned around and took a few quick steps back toward the car. “Mama, aren’t you going in with us?” Her voice had gone up an octave and she suddenly sounded about ten years old. “No,” our mother said, shaking her head a little. “You’re both old enough to apply for a job without me standing over you like a mother hen.” But then she looked at Lilly’s anxious face and added. “It’ll be okay, Lilly. I’m sure everything is going to be fine.” “Why did I let you talk me into this?” Lilly said in a low voice as we both stood in front of the door. “Aren’t you excited?” I asked, confused by her behavior. I was practically jumping up and down. “No,” she said, emphasizing the word by shaking her head rather adamantly. “I was a little excited, when we told Mama and Papa, but I don’t know…” she said, her words trailing off. “It’s just… I just have this horrible feeling of dread. Like we’re going to go into this ugly old building and never come out again.” “Oh, come on, Lilly.” I silently thanked my lucky stars that I hadn’t mention the dogs or I would have never gotten her out of the car. “Mama’s waiting for us right outside the door. I think she’d call the police if we didn’t show up after a couple of hours.” “I know,” Lilly said. “But…” “But what?” I asked, extending my hand to ring the bell. “Wait,” she said, grabbing my arm. “I’m sorry, Colette, but I really don’t want to do this.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her. “Of course we’re going to do this. We need the work. And I hear the castle pay is better than we could get anywhere else. I’m sure it’s much better than what you were getting at Zucker’s.” “I know, but…” I had never known my sister to be a shrinking violet, but there was a tremble in her voice. For whatever reason, she was extremely reluctant to go inside. “Come on, Lilly,” I said, putting my arms around her and giving her a squeeze. “I’m sure it’ll be fine. And if it’s weird, or creepy, or scary at all, we’ll turn right around and leave. I promise.” Lilly didn’t say anything. It was almost as if her feet where frozen to the ground. “Tell you what,” I said, desperate to get her moving. “If you do this for me, then I’ll agree to go to the dance with Lev next month.” My promise caught her attention. “Really?” she said, shifting her eyes in my direction. “Promise?” “Yes,” I assured her. “If you go inside with me and apply for the job, I promise I will chaperone you and Walter under the guise of being Lev’s date.” Some color came back to Lilly’s cheeks. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll go inside. But I don’t promise I’ll take the job.” I reached over and rang the bell. A few moments later the door was opened by a young woman with a friendly face and fair hair that was pulled back into a bun. She was wearing a black dress and a frilly white apron. “Yes?” she asked with a smile. “Hello,” I said. “Mrs. Denkler is expecting us.” “Oh.” She smiled some more. “Are you here about the housemaid positions?” “Yes?” I returned her smile and nodded my head several times. She opened the door wider. “Come on in,” she told us. “I’m Millie. I just started working here, so if you have any questions, don’t ask me,” she said with a laugh. I felt a shiver run through me as I stepped over the threshold and into the castle. I don’t know why, we were simply entering a dark hallway which led to a mudroom, but something about just being inside the building, filled me with a tingling anticipation. As we followed the young maid through the mudroom and down another hall. I tried to keep a little ahead of Lilly, in case we were set upon by a pack of unruly dogs. But we were not assaulted. We simply entered a modest room that contained a small couch, a desk and a few chairs. “Wait here,” the young woman told us. “I’ll go and find Mrs. Denkler.” Neither of us felt comfortable enough to sit down. So we stood there, feeling awkward. “She seems nice,” Lilly eventually said, probably only to break the silence. “Very,” I said, just to say something in reply. “Sorry about being so silly outside. I just felt such a wave of dread. It was like nothing I’d ever experienced before,” my sister told me. “It’s okay.” I reached over and squeezed her arm. “Maybe your lunch didn’t agree with you.” This made her giggle, which made me giggle. We tried to suppress our mirth, but then we’d look at each other and start snickering again. I knew it wouldn’t be a good idea for us to titter our way through a job interview, but I was just so nervous that I couldn’t help myself. Just then the door opened and Mrs. Denkler entered the room. We both stopped giggling immediately. In my excitement to see the inside of the castle, I’d forgotten how intimidating the housekeep actually was. “I was expecting you earlier,” was the first thing Mrs. Denkler said. “We were at school,” I told her. “But classes end after next week.” “And will both of you be returning to school in the fall?” she wanted to know. “My sister, Lillian, is graduating,” I said, gesturing to her by way of introduction, “but I have one year left.” “I suppose if you had a job that paid you well enough, you wouldn’t feel the need to return,” Mrs. Denkler said. It was more of a statement than a question, so I said nothing, even though I had every intention of returning to school in the fall for my senior year. The housekeeper looked me over from head to toe. “It’s so very important when running a great house like the Vanderlind household to hire the right kind of staff,” she said. “Some housekeepers advise to only hire plain girls. Especially when the family has sons to consider.” I couldn’t tell if she was trying to insult me or pay me a compliment. “And yet still I am tempted,” she said, putting a finger to her lips and staring at me intently. “I can’t help but noticed the resemblance” she murmured, half to herself. “It’s quite striking. Especially the hair.” She made a gesture as if she was about to reach over and touch my head, but then she thought better of it and retracted her hand. Lilly glanced over at me and I tried not to return her look. I so very desperately wanted to see the entire interior of the castle and working there seemed like the very best way to accomplish that dream. “I wonder if anyone will notice but me,” Mrs. Denkler said, biting the side of her lower lip and then immediately releasing it. “If the master was still alive, I am sure he would see it in an instant. But we were of that age.” She looked very sad for a moment and I thought I saw tears brimming in hers eyes. But then she cleared her throat and said, “I doubt anyone else will notice.” And then she asked me, “I don’t suppose you have any Hungarian blood?” I wanted the job so desperately that I almost blurted, “Yes, we have,” but then I remembered how our mother had instructed us to be honest, so instead I said, “Not that I know of.” “It’s a pity,” Mrs. Denkler said with another sniff. “That would have at least explained it.” I still had no idea what she was talking about so I just smiled and gave her a nod. And then the housekeeper thought of something. She looked deeply into my eyes. “Do you ever have dreams that are not your own?” she asked. “Do you have glimpsed memories that don’t seem to belong to you?” “Uh… No,” I replied, truthfully. Her line of questioning was starting to make me feel unsettled. Turning her sharp eyes on my sister, the housekeeper said, “Your name is Lillian Gibson, I presume. The resemblance is not as strong in you.” “I’m Lilly Gibson,” my sister managed to say. “How do you do?” “I’m Mrs. Denkler,” was the housekeeper’s response. “You will be issued two uniforms and four aprons each. You are expected to take care of your own uniforms and your appearance should always be flawless,” she informed us. “Now, if you don’t have any questions, “I’ll summon Millicent to show you your duties.” My stomach did a flip. “You mean you’re hiring us?” I stammered. “You can start the Monday after your school ends next week,” the housekeeper said. “But don’t you want to ask us any questions?” Lilly wanted to know. “About our past work experience or… anything?” That’s what we had been expecting, at least. “I’m sure your duties will not be too much for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, her lips drawn into a tight, flat line. “If they are, you’ll be discharged without a reference.” She pulled a small watch on a chain out of her dress pocket and glanced at it. “I really don’t have time for any more questions. Wait here and Millicent will look after you,” she said, before abruptly turning to leave the room. “Will any of our duties involve caring for the dogs?” I asked, before Mrs. Denkler had a chance to disappear. I desperately wanted the job, but I wasn’t a fool. All of the workers had been so adamant about some type of dangerous animal. I couldn’t expose my sister and myself to the risk of being mauled. The housekeeper gave me a sharp look over her shoulder. “What dogs?” she asked. “I hope you are not the kind of girl who is always asking ridiculous questions.” And then she left before I could assure her that I wasn’t. Lilly and I stared at the door for several seconds after she left and then turned to exchange looks. “I guess we’re hired,” my sister said, appearing as mystified as I felt. “I guess.” It seemed a very odd way to hire someone. “Do you think Millicent is the same Millie that answered the door?” Lilly shrugged. “We’re about to find out.” A few moments later and Millie rushed into the room. “Congratulations,” she exclaimed. “I knew Mrs. Denkler was going to hire you, just as soon as I saw you. I just knew it.” “Thank you,” we said in unison. “Oh, I’m so happy.” She really was beaming. “It will be so nice to have other servants around here who can actually speak English.” Chapter 22 Jessie The room itself was small, but not miniscule. There was a fringed shawl hanging over the window and another across the bed in an attempt to make the place look a little less down-at-the-heels. Another red scarf festooned the globe shade of a lamp which sat on the bedside table. The lamp was electric, but had obviously been converted from oil at some point in the last few decades. Bernadette took the shawl from the bed and draped it over the back of a chair with great care. I could tell at a glance that it had been hand embroidered. Then she eased herself onto the bed. “Is there anything you’d like in particular?” she asked, patting the open spot next to her on the mattress. “Any fantasy you have for your first time?” “Actually,” I said, taking a seat on the room’s only chair, but being careful not to disturb the shawl, “I won’t be joining you. Although I greatly appreciate the offer.” “Oh.” A look crossed Bernadette’s face that I couldn’t interpret. It was either surprise or relief. Possibly both. “Do you like to watch?” she asked, leaning back on the bed slightly and letting one of her hands drift over to her thigh. “Is that what you want?” “Actually, what I really wanted was someone to talk with while I wait for my brother,” I told her. “But please don’t be concerned; I’ll pay you for your time.” “Oh,” she said, sitting up a little. “You’re one of those.” “One of what?” I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral, although feeling slightly offended. “You want my life story, I suppose,” she said, her eyes growing a little angry. “You want to know how I managed to become such a downtrodden whore.” “Not particularly,” I told her. “We don’t have to talk at all, if you don’t want to. We could always play cards for awhile, if you have a pack.” Bernadette gave me half a smile and turned her head to view me out of the corner of her eye. “Cards?” she said. “You want to play cards? That’s a new one.” “We don’t have to play cards,” I told her. “But you said you’d rather not talk and I was trying to think of a way to fill the time.” “You’re too good looking to be in a place like this,” she told me. “I’m sure plenty of girls would give you a tumble for free.” “My brother wanted to come here,” I informed her. “If I’d known what he had in mind, I don’t think I would have joined him. “You a funny fellow?” she asked. “You prefer roughhousing with the boys. Is that it?” “No, I prefer girls,” I assured her, taking in her meaning. “But…” I was about to say too much, then decided I would anyway. “But I’d like to wait for someone special.” This made her smile. And this time it was a full, genuine smile. “You’re a romantic,” she said. “I thought all of your kind had died out defeating the Kaiser.” I smiled back at her, a genuine smile of my own. “I guess there are a few of us left.” Bernadette tried to sit up on the bed in order to speak with me more easily, but something must have twinged in her back because she grimaced and then quickly tried to cover it with another smile. “What’s wrong with your back?” I asked her. “Nothing,” she insisted, sitting up a little taller. I lowered my chin and gave her a steady look, so she shrugged. “Okay, there was this fellow who came in a couple of weeks ago. He got a little rough and now I can’t walk straight.” “Have you seen a doctor?” I asked, rising from the chair and walking over to her. “There’s only one kind of doctor that comes to a whore house,” she told me. “And bad backs aren’t his specialty.” “Would you like to stop working here?” I asked. “I mean, if you could.” She gazed up at me, but still managed to keep her eyelids heavy. “You’re going to save me?” she said, and then suppressed a laugh. “That’s Crystal’s racket, not mine. She’s been saved by not-so-virtuous men a dozen times since she started working here. Although she’s getting a little old for that scam now.” “I can’t save you,” I told her, in all honesty. “I could possibly provide you with the means, but you’d have to save yourself.” She thought this over for a minute. “I wonder…’ she said, half dreamily. But then her eyes cleared. “Nah,” she told me. “It’s a nice thought, but I’m too busted and worn out at this point to even try.” Then, with a sigh, she added, “But you’re a sweet boy for offering.” “I could at least try to fix your back,” I offered. “If you’ll let me.” Bernadette looked me over. “You’re too young to be a doctor. And don’t tell me you’ve got a magic willie.” I couldn’t help but laugh at her crassness. “No, it’s not magic,” I told her. “At least I don’t think it is.” This earned me a laugh in return. “But my grandfather was a scientist of sorts and he made a kind of tincture that I think might help you.” “Tincture?” she repeated. I could tell she was beginning to grow suspicious. “What kind of tincture?” “It’s for pain,” I told her. “And it’ll help you relax so that all your bones and joints can settle back into place.” I was standing quite close to her at this point and suddenly Bernadette looked alarmed. “Thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I need any kind of tincture,” she told me. “In fact, I don’t think I’m your kind of girl at all. You’d probably like Sally. She’s real pretty and I’m sure she’d drink whatever tincture you had in mind.” She tried to get to her feet. \"Why don’t I call for Bruno? He can get her for you.” “Sit down, Bernadette,” I commanded, looking her straight in the eyes. “There’s no need for you to be frightened,” I told her, gazing at her intently. “I’m not going to hurt you.” She smiled with relief, her body instantly relaxing. “That’s good. You frightened me there for a moment. You never know what some men are about.” “Close your eyes and open your mouth,” I instructed her. “Oh. This game,” she said. “I guess there are no true gentlemen left.” But she did as I instructed. Quickly I bared a fang and pierced the tip of my finger. Once a few drops of blood had formed, I placed them on her tongue. “Swallow that.” “What is it?” she asked, even as she was swallowing. A few seconds later she opened her eyes. “How do you feel?” I asked. Bernadette shifted from side to side, and then turned her head right and left a few times. There was a popping sound and then a few, quieter crunching noises. “Oh,” she exclaimed. “Something just shifted.” She placed a hand on the back of her neck. “Something’s different. I can feel it.” I stepped back, allowing her room to stand up. She moved cautiously at first and then with greater freedom. “I haven’t felt this good in years,” she said, giving me an amazed look. “What’s that stuff your grandfather made? He was a genius. You could sell that stuff and make a mint.” “Grandfather had his moments,” I assured her. “But I’m afraid his formula died with him. And that was the last of my supply. There isn’t anymore.” “Oh.” Bernadette looked at me with disbelief. “And you wasted the last of it on me?” “I didn’t waste it,” I assured her. “I shared it with a friend.” She moved around a bit more, testing her back for any residual pain. “That stuff is amazing,” she said. “I thought I was on my way to the grave, but now I feel like I might actually want to live.” “Do you want to live here?” I asked. “Not particularly,” she said with a shrug. “But what’s a working girl to do?” “You could get a little shop and live out of the back,” I suggested. “Maybe you embroider shawls. Maybe you raise chickens and sell the eggs. I bet there are a lot of things you can do.” Bernadette thought it over. “I guess I could give it a try,” she said. “The girls always want me to sew them some fancy flowers and things. And I’ve got a little money saved. Not much, but maybe I could rent a place and get some supplies.” I reached into my pocket and pulled out my billfold. Pulling out several bills, I folded them in half and handed them to her. “Hide this somewhere,” I told her. “Don’t let anyone know I gave it to you or I’m sure someone will try to take it away.” Bernadette gaped at the money for a moment and then concealed it in her clothing. “So you really are trying to save me.” “No,” I shook my head. “I told you before, I can’t save you. I can give you a bit of money to help you get started, but you have to save yourself.” Then I looked deeply into her eyes and held her gaze. “I believe in you, Bernadette.” “I’m glad,” she said, giving me a shy smile. “I think I’m starting to believe in me, too.” Sitting in the lobby again, the Madame came over to see if I was satisfied with Bernadette’s services. “Very satisfied,” I told her. “She’s quite a remarkable person.” The Madame sniffed. “She’s as good as any other whore, I reckon,” I engaged the woman with my eyes. “Bernadette might consider leaving here soon,” I told her. “If she decides to leave, then you will not impede her in any fashion. As a matter of fact, you’ll do whatever is within your power to help her. As you would with any of your girls.” “Of course,” the madam assured me. “I would do that for any of my girls.” I sat waiting for another three-quarters of an hour before Daniel reappeared. He looked smug, like the cat that had just swallowed a dozen canaries, and there was the faint smell of blood about him. Sitting down heavily next to me, he turned to look in my direction and said with a lascivious smile, “Now that was a bit of fun.” I shrugged, not sure what kind of reply he would expect from me. “Have you really never been to a bordello before?” he asked, tilting his head a little to get a better look at me. “No,” I said, in all honesty. I’d never even thought about going to a bordello. “You mean Grandfather never took you to one? Not even when you were mortal?” He seemed very surprised. When it was obvious my answer was still no, Daniel added, “That surprises me. He took me to my first whore house when I was sixteen.” I shrugged again. “Grandfather always did like you more than me,” I pointed out. “True,” Daniel said, and then he closed his eyes, emitting a contented sigh. After a quiet moment, he said, “Do you think Mother had anything to do with it?” “To do with what?” I asked. “Grandfather’s cabin boy.” “To do… how?” I asked, keeping my voice steady, even though inside I felt alarmed. I did not know how Daniel would react if he knew our mother had set up our maker to be discovered and tossed into the ocean. “To do with tempting him with a beautiful cabin boy and then arranging it so he was caught in the act.” I frowned and brought my eyebrows together. “Why would you think that?” “Because when we disembarked, Mother went through customs first,” he said. “And while I was waiting in line, I could see her talking to a wily looking fellow in a checkered suit. So naturally I was curious to know who he was.” I kept my face completely neutral while he spoke, as if listening to any ordinary story. Daniel went on with, “So as I was standing by myself, waiting for you and Emily, I saw that same fellow approach one of the ship’s stewards, and he was obviously looking for someone. A few minutes later, the steward brings forth a cabin boy. The same cabin boy that Grandfather was caught feasting upon.” “What did the man want?” I asked, trying not to sound too curious, but as someone who was simply interested in the story. “He told the boy that some long lost relative of his had died, leaving him a bit of money,” Daniel said with a frown. “You’re kidding,” I exclaimed. “Well… good for him. I’m glad something good happened to him after what he went through.” Daniel frowned some more. “But don’t you think that’s just a bit too much of a coincidence?” he asked. “I mean, he gets bitten on the neck by Grandfather and then magically inherits some money. The whole thing smells of Mother, to me.” “You’re probably right,” I told him. “She’s always had a soft heart. There’s a chance she felt sorry for the boy and set the whole thing up. I can ask her, if you like.” “Don’t worry about it,” Daniel said with a sniff. “Maybe she did and maybe she didn’t. My bet is she had a hand in it, but as long as she only gave him a few thousand, I guess it doesn’t really matter to me.” “Are you ready to go?” I asked, making motions like I was ready to get out of my chair. “Are you really ready to be off this early?” Daniel had to wonder. “I thought you’d probably be up for a second round and here you are, eager to go.” I was eager to go. I wanted to leave in a rather desperate way. And I didn’t just mean the brothel. I wanted out of New York as well. It wasn’t that I was tired of the sights, sounds and smells of a new city, but I wanted to be on my way to Tiburon, Ohio. I had been thinking about it pretty much incessantly since we’d arrived in America, when I could stop thinking about my belly. It wasn’t even homesickness for the castle, as far as I could tell. Something was calling me to that small Ohio town and I couldn’t wait to get there. Chapter 23 Colette “I’m so proud of you girls,” Papa exclaimed, gathering us both in a big bear hug. “Or should I call you young ladies now that you both have jobs and uniforms and everything?” And then he hugged us again. I loved the pipe-tobacco smell of him, although Mama only permitted him to smoke on the porch. “You should see the ballroom,” Lilly said to him. She’d been brimming with excitement, ever since Millie gave us a tour of the castle’s ground floor. “There are cherubs and goddesses painted everywhere, even on the ceiling. I’ve never seen anything so fancy.” Papa nodded, listening intently and beaming at us. “Now that’s something I wish I could see.” “They might have a family day,” Lilly told him, squeezing his hand and then swinging it back and forth. “So that the families of all the local staff can see where they work. At least that’s what Millie said.” Our father chuckled. That was the third time Lilly had mentioned the other maid since we’d told him the news of our new employment. “Sounds like Millie is your new best friend.” “You should see the library,” Lilly went on. “It’s a huge room with all this gold trim. And books stacked as high as the sky. I think the Vanderlinds probably have more books than the Tiburon Library and I’m not exaggerating. Lettie was over the moon.” “They might let you borrow some,” our father said, stroking my hair. “I’ve heard that the great houses of Europe frequently encourage their staff to borrow books from their libraries, if they have any interest.” Our tour of the castle had been so wonderful, it was almost dizzying. Every room was grander than the last. And we’d only toured the ground floor. “Downstairs maids are never allowed upstairs,” Millie informed us. “Mrs. Denkler is very strict about it.” “Are any of the upstairs maids allowed downstairs?” Lilly asked, half jokingly. “They can come down for meals and stuff,” was the reply. “But they all came over from Hungary and don’t really speak any English, so it’s not all that fun when they do.” “Maybe we can learn to speak some Hungarian,” I suggested. “I actually know a few words,” Millie told us. “My grandfather emigrated from there. That’s how I got this job. He walked over to the castle, knocked on the door, and introduced himself.” “What words do you know?” Lilly asked. Millie’s cheeks turned a little red. “Actually, most of the words I know aren’t appropriate for polite company,” she said in a low voice, and then giggled. “I guess by the time you get to the third generation, that’s all anyone remembers.” Lilly and Millie got on like a house on fire, but I was too busy thinking to pay attention to most of the chatter. Mrs. Denkler was such a peculiar lady and the way she looked at me made me uncomfortable. “Papa, who was Empress Elisabeth?” I asked when Lilly paused for breath. “I’m not sure.” Our father frowned a little and then smiled. “That seems a question out of the blue.” “It’s the reason we got the jobs,” Lilly told him. “The housekeeper thinks that Lettie looks like some royal lady who was stabbed by an anarchist.” “Oh.” Papa’s eyebrows rose high on his forehead. And then he laughed. “Well.. that is one of the more peculiar reasons I’ve ever heard for someone being offered a job.” Lilly bounced up and down, clapping her hands. “I can’t wait to tell Walter,” she exclaimed before dashing out of the room. “You don’t seem as excited as your sister,” Papa said, turning his full attention to me. “I’m excited,” I assured him. “Just in a different way.” If I was being honest, Mrs. Denkler’s comments about how I looked like an Empress who had been stabbed to death unsettled me a little. I’d never found the whole idea of reincarnation very appealing. I was me. I never liked the idea of being anyone but me. Or that I could possibly be just a recycled version of someone who had lived before my time. Chapter 24 Jessie Tiburon was a small town in the middle of Ohio, just like any other small town in America, I had to imagine. But there was something about it that felt so right to me. There was an indefinable magic that hung in the air like pollen on a spring day. Ever since I’d been transformed into a vampire, I found it hard to breathe. — Not that I actually needed to breathe anymore, but I felt a figurative tightness in my chest. — But as we arrived in Tiburon, in a motorcade of black sedans, I felt that tightness begin to dissipate. To my mind, becoming a member of the undead meant the end of my life. But being in Tiburon somehow made me feel like I had the chance to live again. I couldn’t have an ordinary life, but I started to feel that maybe I could somehow find happiness. Or maybe it was just the absence of Grandfather that lifted my spirits. He’d been a black cloud hovering over the family for my entire life. I hated to be the kind of ugly person who was made happier by another person’s demise, but Grandfather was an incredibly difficult man to be around. Plus the knowledge that my beloved sister would not face the same curse of immortality as the rest of us put joy in my heart. When my grandfather was a young man, the Vanderlind Castle was in the country. As he grew into a young man, Budapest also grew, expanding to the point that the castle was on the outskirts of town. By the time I was born, the city had swallowed up the open fields that had always surrounded the castle. Our home had become part of the metropolis. Even though Budapest was a city with many architectural beauties, the castle always looked out of place there. It wasn’t meant to be crowded on all sides by the bustle of urban living. That’s why, when I first caught sight of the castle as we made our midnight arrival in Tiburon, it really resonated with me. The castle appeared at home; more so than it ever had in Budapest. It felt like the structure was meant to be there, majestically standing on the shores of the Tiburon River. It felt like home. “My God,” Daniel exclaimed as we exited the cars. “Grandfather must have really been losing his marbles if he thought putting the castle here was a good idea. I’m surprised he didn’t relocate us to a swamp.” “Stop being such a sourpuss, Daniel,” our mother gently chided him. “You might find that you grow to appreciate country living.” My brother made a little snorting sound through his nose. “I know I’m immortal, but I doubt I’ll ever live that long.” Mrs. Denkler was there to greet us bearing three glasses of refreshment on a tray. I don’t know how she managed to arrange for the blood already. I hoped it wasn’t through anything unsavory. But the Vanderlind housekeeper was as fastidious as she was well-mannered. I somehow doubted that she would do anything illegal. “The house is almost completely ready,” she informed us, once we exchanged the most minimal of greetings. “Except for the chandeliers in the great hall. There have been some challenges there and I’m afraid they have yet to be hung.” “That’s quite alright, Mrs. Denkler,” our mother told her. “I have the foreman’s promise that they’ll be in place by tomorrow afternoon,” the housekeeper insisted. “That’s fine,” Mother said, trying to reassure her. “We’re just excited to be home.” Mrs. Denkler stepped out of the way so that she could gesture toward the front door. “Welcome back to your home.” It was so strange to wander the rooms of the castle, seeing each thing exactly in its place, as it had been back in Budapest. Mrs. Denkler must have had a photographic memory to been so exact. I only found the smallest of indiscretions as far as replicating the exact setup of our home. A few shirts that I liked to keep in a drawer had been hung up in the closet, and my cufflinks and shirt studs were in the wrong box. But that was all I could find. It was remarkable. Was Mrs. Denkler really that familiar with the intimacies of my room? That surprised me. Or maybe she was just incredibly intuitive. As dawn broke over Tiburon, I lay down on my bed, hoping to lose myself to a few hours of oblivion,— I had not yet accustomed myself to sleeping in a coffin — but rest did not come to me. I felt a great anticipation deep in my belly and the sensation prevented me from being able to lie quietly. I rolled around on the bed for a few hours, even attempting the first chapter of several books, before getting up and dressing. One of the benefits of the castle was its noticeable lack of windows. A member of the undead could climb from his coffin at midnight or at high noon and still have no fear of shriveling in the sun. I could hear a bit of commotion coming from downstairs, so I wandered down to see what was causing the hubbub. It was a dozen workmen in the great hall trying to suspend one of the enormous chandeliers that some relative had seen fit to purchase for the castle. Each chandelier was bedecked with over a thousand leaded crystals, which made the fixtures enormously heavy. The men had assembled scaffolding and a pulley system to hoist the chandelier up, inch-by-inch, to the vaulted ceiling. I didn’t envy them their task, but it was a marvel to watch. Many members of the castle’s staff were standing around the edges of the room in order to take in the spectacle. I strolled across the polished stone floor with my eyes glued to the dangling crystals of the chandelier. They were all singing as they swayed and clinked together. Their music caused me a pang of sadness. I would never again see the scores of rainbows created by the prisms when they were caught in direct sunlight. I heard a small gasp. It was like a whisper being carried by the wind. I turned my eyes to see a beautiful young woman with tresses of dark hair spilling around her shoulder. And then my world fell away. I could see nothing and no one but her. It was as if my world had been blank and this girl appeared to fill it. She was dressed in black with a white apron. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew her clothing was significant, but somehow that didn’t matter. Somehow, deep inside of me, I knew we were meant to be together. And she was looking at me too. Her eyes were glued to me and she wore the most astonished expression on her face. She opened her mouth and I thought she might speak to me, but then she looked up and started to scream. I had been so captivated by the beautiful creature standing before me that I didn’t realize the workmen had somehow lost control of the massive chandelier. It was crashing toward the ground, heading for the very spot on which I stood. If it hadn’t been for my lightning fast undead reflexes and my incredible ability to heal, I would have been squashed like a bug under a barman’s boot. Even still, I was knocked to the ground. The young woman came running toward me. “Somebody call a doctor!” Pointing toward one of the footmen, she commanded, “Call a doctor this instant,” as if she was the mistress of the castle. Kneeling down, she took my hand. The mere touch of her skin made me feel like my heart had started beating again. “Don’t move,” she said, in a voice that was so lovely it made me shiver. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” I told her, unable to tear my eyes away from her face. “You’re not fine,” she insisted. “You just had a massive chandelier nearly crush you. You’re lucky to still be alive.” “Very lucky,” I whispered, looking deep into her eyes of emerald green. “Because it allowed me to meet you.” She laid her hand to her cheek and shook her head a little. “Oh, how can you flirt at a time like this? I think you must be in shock.” She scanned my body with an assessing eye. “I hope you don’t have any internal injuries.” “I’m fine,” I insisted, trying to untangle myself from the giant arms of the chandelier. “Perhaps a twisted ankle, but that’s all.” My ankle felt fine, but I thought it would be too peculiar if I suffered no injuries at all. “I don’t think you should try to get up,” she told me, pressing her hands gently against my chest to try to coax me back onto the floor. “The doctor will be here soon, I’m sure.” I lay back for a moment, toying with the idea of allowing her to tend to me for a little while longer. But I knew that plan was ungentlemanly, so I decided it was better to get to my feet. “I promise you I am not injured,” I told her. “But perhaps you could be good enough to assist me to a chair.” “Yes, of course,” she said. As she said, put an arm around me to help me to my feet, I felt a moment of sheer happiness. “What is your name?” I asked as she helped me to a small loveseat. Once I was seated, she tried to pull away, but I held onto her hands so that she was forced to take the seat next to me. “Colette Gibson,” she told me. “But most people call me Lettie.” “Colette Gibson,” I said, tasting the words in my mouth. “It’s a great pleasure to meet you, Miss Colette Gibson,” I told her. “I’m Jessie Vanderlind.” “Vander…” The girl gulped. “It’s very nice to meet you, Mr. Jessie Vanderlind.” Then she added, “But I’m horribly concerned that you’re injured. Are you sure you’re not feeling any discomfort?” she asked, her lovely brow furrowing slightly. “I feel wonderful,” I assured her. “If I wanted to, I’m sure I could fly.” Chapter 25 Colette The week before school let out was excruciatingly long for me. I wasn’t even sure how I got through my final exams. In between studying, I looked up the Empress Elisabeth in an encyclopedia at the school library. It took a little research, but I finally managed to find a photograph of the Empress of Austria, who was also the Queen of Hungary. It was a snapshot of her on her coronation day, back in 1867. She was a beautiful young woman with a curvy figure. Her neck and hands were dripping with pearls and other extravagant jewelry. Her hair appeared to be dark brown in color and she had an abundant amount of it. But beyond the hair, I wasn’t sure how much the Empress and I shared in appearance. She was very beautiful, but she also looked a little forlorn as she gazed into the lens of the camera. Her eyes appeared plaintiff and solemn. It wasn’t how I imagined a person would look after just having a crown of diamonds and pearls placed on her head. I thought I might be a little happier about it. But then the encyclopedia went on to explain that she didn’t have a very happy life. And it turned out that the anarchist stabbed her simply because he had missed the opportunity to stab a Duke who claimed to be an heir to the French throne. He vowed to stab the next royal he encountered. Elisabeth was that unfortunately soul. Even staring at her photograph, I felt no connection to her. At least not in the way that Mrs. Denkler had implied. If anything, I felt a little sorry for her, as much as a cat can feel sorry for a king. No, I was positive there was no connection beyond that. I had to conclude that the whole concept of reincarnation was simply hogwash. Finally, after what felt like an excruciatingly long week, it was Lily and my first day as housemaids at the castle. We’d each been issued two black dressed as our uniforms. Mama had pinned and tucked them until they fit us perfectly. Lilly spent an extensive amount of time trying to tame my wild hair. The Empress probably was able to afford a personal hairstylist because her excessively long and quite curly hair had looked perfect for her coronation day. Mine just ended up barely staying piled on my head with a few dozen hairpins. Both Papa and Mama drove us out to the castle to drop us off for our first day at the castle. Papa brought along his camera and stopped the car on the long driveway, just outside the gate. “I want you to know I’m very proud of you girls,” he said as he positioned us so that he could make a photo with the castle in the background. “I’m sure this Mrs. Denkler has hired many a young woman to work at the castle in her day. And with the way the economy is, I’m sure there was more than one woman with experience who applied for the position.” Lilly and I stood still, and very close to each other, so he could make the photograph. “She must have seen something in the two of you,” Papa went on. “She must have sensed that you are proper young ladies and that you will do the Vanderlind Castle justice.” He cleared his throat. “And I hope you remember…’ “Okay, I think that’s enough, dear,” Mama said, touching him gently on the arm. “We don’t want the girls to be late. Especially on their first day.” Millie answered the door again when I rang the bell. “You don’t have to ring, sillies,” she said. “You work here now. You can just let yourselves in.” “I guess I just assumed the door would be locked,” I explained, fussing with my hair. Several of the bobby pins were already trying to make their escape. I think their plan was made easier by the excessive amount of hair lotion Lilly had applied. That made it simple for them to slide free. Millie frowned at the door and then looked back at us. “It hasn’t been locked since I started working here.” First thing we did was report to Mrs. Denkler. We found her in the hallway, just outside the kitchen. She looked us both over while fishing her watch from her pocket. Once she was satisfied that we were on time, she snapped the cover closed on the watch and said, “A housemaid’s hair should always be neat and tidy.” “I’m sorry,” I blurted, knowing her comment was aimed at me. “I seem to have put too much lotion in my hair and now it’s decided to rebel. I promise I’ll get it to behave better tomorrow.” Mrs. Denkler eyed my hair one more time before saying, “There are several things you need to know about the Vanderlind family.” She started walking and snapped her fingers at us to let us know we needed to keep pace. “The family keeps late hours,” she said. “They all suffer, to varying degrees, from a rare condition that makes them very vulnerable to the sun.” She glanced back at both of us to make sure that we were being attentive. “Because of this malady, they usually adjust their schedules to sleep most of the day and only get up when the sun is low in the sky or has already set.” That explained why we were told to arrive for work at ten o’clock. It had seemed a late hour to begin the work day. “You may be asked to work later in the evening on some occasions. This is to accommodate the family and we expect you to adjust your personal schedule accordingly.” Lilly and I exchanged glances. Millie mentioned nothing about odd work hours when she showed us around. I had to wonder what Mama and Papa would think. We’d planned on riding our bicycles to work in good weather, but I was sure they wouldn’t let us ride home alone after dark. “There is illness in the family,” Mrs. Denkler went on. “One of the sons, Arthur, suffers from hemophilia. It’s a rare blood disease and he needs blood transfusions several times a day.” “Isn’t that the same disease that the last czar’s little boy suffered from?” I asked. “The son from the Russian royal family who were assassinated during the revolution.” Mrs. Denkler spent a few moments assessing me with her stern eyes. “Yes, I know perfectly well of whom you are speaking and I believe it is similar,” she finally said. “Not much is known about the disease.” She continued walking. “As I was saying, Arthur suffers from hemophilia. Therefore the family is in constant need of blood to keep him alive. We have set up a small clinic in the back of the castle,” she informed us. “You can tell your friends and family, that if any of them care to donate a pint of blood, they will receive two dollars, a sandwich and some apple juice or coffee for their troubles.” Lilly and I exchanged another look. Two dollars was a full day’s pay for many people. We would both be earning just over three dollars for a full day’s work at the castle and those were considered excellent wages for untrained labor. “I’m sure we know a lot of people who would be happy to help out,” Lilly said, speaking up. “Unless...” She stammered a little. “I mean, is it very painful? Donating blood?” “Not in the least,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “And even if it was, with two dollars in your pocket, I should think most people would be willing to put up with a little pain.” We both nodded, not wanting to annoy her. “Arthur Vanderlind is not to be disturbed under any circumstances,” Mrs. Denkler said, eyeing us both. “Even entering his room is cause for immediate dismissal.” We crossed a large room where several men were hammering together a large piece of scaffolding. “Don’t bother the family at any time, but especially when they are resting. You are never to go upstairs unless directly ordered to do so by me. And you are never to address any member of the Vanderlind family, unless they address you first. Do I make myself clear?” Mrs. Denkler glared at us again. “Yes,” we both said in timid voices. The lady had to be close to seventy, but she was still very formidable. I wouldn’t have crossed her for ten silver dollars. “Besides, it’s not part of your duties to be in the bedrooms,” she said, leading us down a large hallway. “Your work is solely downstairs.” She opened a door and ushered us in. “Oh,” I said with a gasp of excitement. We were back in the library. The wonderful smell of books filled my nostrils. “You’ll get started in here,” she said, producing two feather dusters, seemingly out of nowhere. “Start at one end and work your way to the other. And don’t forget the top shelves, because I’ll check.” She turned to leave, but then paused. “I almost forgot,” she said. “It’s against the rules of the castle for the staff to wear any kind of personal adornment. That means no rings, no bracelets, no pedants, no jewelry of any kind. If I catch you wearing so much as a christening pendant, it’s grounds for immediate dismissal.” I had a silver and crystal pendant that I always wore. It was only about the size of a nickel and not very flashy in any way, but it was the prettiest thing I owned and I loved it. “So you mean something like this...” I began, indicating the pendant. “Is completely unacceptable,” the housekeeper told me. “If I see it around your neck tomorrow, you’ll be fired on the spot.” Then she left the room without another word. We both stood, gazing at the enormous room. It held more books than even a voracious reader could go through in a lifetime. “You must be in heaven,” Lilly murmured. “How are we are going to dust all of these?” I murmured back. Lilly smoothed her apron. “I guess we’ll start in one corner and work our way around,” she said. “It will probably only take seven or eight years.” “Yes,” I agreed with her, “but then the first books will be dusty again.” We both giggled. Then Lilly squared her shoulders and said, “Alright, I guess we’re housemaids now. Let’s get started.” We decided to make a game of it, with Lilly working along one wall and me working along another. They had those rolling ladders like in the Tiburon library, so it was easier to reach the books on the highest shelves. Lilly was much faster at dusting than I was because I wasted a lot of time browsing. I couldn’t help myself; there were so many intriguing titles luring me away from my task. My hair was in open revolt, expelling bobby pins whenever it saw the opportunity. I tried to collect them when they fell, hoping I’d have a chance to pin my tresses back up when we were given a break for lunch. I knew having my hair hanging down would not please Mrs. Denkler, but there was nothing I could do about it for the time being. After we’d been working for a couple of hours, the door to the library opened and Millie came in. “There you are,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere, but this castle is just so big that I kept getting lost.” “What is it?” Lilly asked, climbing down from her ladder. “Are we needed somewhere else? We’re not even half way through in here.” “No, it’s just that they’re hanging the chandeliers in the great hall and I thought you might like to see it,” the other maid told her. This news perked me right up and I descended my ladder immediately. “That’s definitely something I would like to see.” Lilly wasn’t so sure. “Are we allowed to stop working?” she asked. “I’d hate to get in trouble for shirking our duties on the very first day.” “Oh, the Vanderlinds won’t mind,” Millie insisted. “They’re all asleep, anyway. And I’m sure Mrs. Denkler won’t have a problem with it. She’s in there herself.” “Well…” Lilly thought it over. “Oh, come on,” Millie urged. “You have to see how massive these chandeliers are. They’re like the size of a car, with a million prisms hanging off of each one. They’re amazing.” The temptation was too much, so the three of us hurried back to the great hall. I could not believe the amount of scaffolding the men had built in order to raise the chandeliers. Taking into consideration the amount of ropes and pulleys they were using, I wouldn’t have been surprised if someone told me the giant fixtures weighed a thousand pounds each. I guess that was one of the benefits of living in a building constructed out of stone, you could hang heavy things off the ceiling. Millie was right about the chandeliers being magnificent. Even without sunshine lighting up the room, the prisms still practically glowed on their own. They made a delicate music bumping into each other as they swayed back and forth, each suspended from its own small hook. They were so beautiful; I couldn’t imagine owning just one of the little jewels, let alone having an enormous chandelier festooned with them. It looked like the entire staff of the castle was there, mesmerized while watching the first chandelier slowly inching higher and higher toward the vaulted ceiling. That’s why everyone was caught by surprise when one of the Vanderlinds appeared from above stairs and walked to the center of the room, craning his neck so he could take in the show. There was something about the back of the young man’s head that drew my attention. He was tall and well-formed with dark hair that was ruffled on top, as if he’d just gotten up after tossing and turning in bed for a few hours. He was dressed in a crisp white shirt and gray flannel pants that were obviously tailor made to fit him perfectly. One of the workmen hit a snag in the rope he was using to help hoist the chandelier. He called out a few words in a language that I didn’t understand. Some of the men stopped pulling on their ropes and others began pulling rather frantically. The chandelier began to sway harder and it tilted to the side. “Oh,” I exclaimed. I didn’t know what they were going to do to straighten it out. And I didn’t know how they were going to clean the chandeliers once they attached them to the vaulted ceiling. I glanced back down again and got the surprise of my life. The young man was looking directly at me. Suddenly I found it hard to breathe. His face was just so beautiful, with stormy gray eyes, pale skin and full lips. I felt like he wasn’t just looking at me, but that he was seeing into my very soul. Thousands of little shivers ran up my spine as I finally put a face to the young man who had been haunting my dreams. When I realized this, my mouth popped open. I wanted to speak to him. I wanted to just be with him, to stand by his side. It was like he was the only man in the world and I was the only woman. My fixation with the castle suddenly all made sense. I somehow knew that he would live there. It felt like his heart had called me to him and I was powerless to resist. In another instant I was screaming. The chandelier had somehow broken free from the ropes and pulleys. It was crashing toward the ground. And the young man who had just stolen my heart was standing underneath it. My piercing shriek startled him. He looked up and was only able to throw his arms over his head before the massive chandelier crushed him. Chapter 30 Colette People just stood there. It was as if everyone was waiting for someone else to do something. I had a moment of that myself. I kept thinking, I’m just a maid and this is my first day. Surely someone else will come to his aid. Someone in charge will take command of the crisis. But everyone was acting like they were frozen to the ground. And I couldn’t bear the thought of the poor young man suffering. So I hurried forward, shouting as I ran, “Call a doctor. Somebody call a doctor.” Dropping to my knees, I reached out to clutch his hand. Merely touching him sent a charge through me like I had grabbed a live wire. I’d finally met the man of my dreams and he was probably hemorrhaging internally. The thought made me want to shriek and burst into tears. But I had to be brave for him. If he was going to die, then I had to be there to comfort him during his last moments on earth. He’d stolen my heart and we’d never even have the chance to say hello. “Don’t move,” I said, trying to keep a tremor out of my voice. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” he told me, sitting up. “You can’t be fine,” I insisted. “You just have a giant chandelier drop on your head.” This made him smile. “No, I really am fine,” he assured me. “I think maybe I just wrenched my ankle.” And shockingly, he was fine. I kept expecting him to collapse from internal bleeding, but somehow he’d only twisted his ankle. It was a miracle. My heart sang with joy. I helped him to a loveseat and we both sat there, holding each other’s hand. He introduced himself as Jessie Vanderlind. It was a name I knew I would be whispering in my dreams for the rest of my life. “Mr. Vanderlind,” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed, hurrying over. “I do hope you’re alright.” “Fine,” he said, only glancing briefly in her direction before returning his gaze to me. “Better than fine, in fact.” His eyes were shimmering gray clouds before a sudden spring shower. “I’m so glad to hear that,” the housekeeper said. “It’s quite the relief. I’m afraid in all the commotion, our new housemaid has forgotten her place.” “Her place?” Jessie mused, frowning at where I was sitting, as if he couldn’t quite make out the words Mrs. Denkler was saying to him. “She’s perfectly fine, I should think.” And then he asked me, “Are you comfortable? You’ve had quite a shock. Would you maybe like a glass of water?” I couldn’t believe he was asking about my well being. Of course I was alright. Besides the shock of almost seeing a man crushed to death by a thousand pounds of leaded crystal. And the fact that, in the few seconds between when I’d had first laid eyes on Jessie Vanderlind and when the chandelier had knocked him to the ground, I had fallen in love with him. “Get up, girl,” Mrs. Denkler snapped, grabbing me by the arm and hauling me to my feet. “You should be working, not lounging on a couch, harassing Mr. Vanderlind.” “She wasn’t harassing me,” Jessie insisted. “In fact, I was very much enjoying her company.” Mrs. Denkler pursed her lips together, giving me a fierce look. “Miss Gibson, I think it’s time you got back to work.” She raised her head and looked around the room. “Everyone who wants to keep their job should get back to work immediately.” People started hurrying out of the room. “Come with me, young lady,” the housekeeper snarled, still holding my arm in a vice-like grip. I was marched back to the library, where Lilly was already ensconced, furiously dusting, pretending that she’d been there the entire time. Mrs. Denkler released me, practically thrusting me from her side. “I knew it was a mistake to hire such a pretty girl,” she said. “It always is.” “Please don’t fire me, Mrs. Denkler,” I said. It would have been so humiliating. I didn’t know how I would face my parents. “I promise I won’t goof off ever again. I’m a good worker, I swear.” “I’m not so much worried about your work ethic as I’m worried about you making eyes at the Vanderlind boys. I know they’re rich and handsome, but trust me when I say that boys like that aren’t for the likes of you.” I looked down, feeling like I might burst into tears. She was right. I was being an idiot. Someone like Jessie Vanderlind would never even consider someone like me. He lived in a castle and I worked at the castle. Even when we were in the same room, we were still a million worlds apart. “I know,” I told her, unable to raise my voice much louder than a whisper. “I’m not going to let you go,” Mrs. Denkler said, after giving it some serious thought. “You remind me too much of…” She shook her head. “Well, that is neither here nor there. But I will say this; you are not to speak with Jessie Vanderlind. You are not to flirt with him. You are not to even gaze at him from a distance. If you are cleaning a room and he steps inside it, then you must immediately vacate that room and report directly to me. Do you understand?” “Yes.” “I’m just telling you this for your own good,” she informed me. “You’d think a girl your age would have more sense than you do.” “I understand,” I said, doing my best to keep my voice steady. Mama and Papa hadn’t said anything directly to us, but I’d overheard them talking a few nights ago while they were both drying the dishes. Papa hadn’t had any real work in over two months. The extra money we would be bringing home was really going to help. “I’m lucky to have this job,” I told her. “Yes,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I suppose you are. And I’m happy to let you keep it, just as long as you remember your place. Jessie Vanderlind is a very engaging young man when he wants to be, but just remember what I told you. He is to be left alone. Even if another giant chandelier comes crashing down on his head.” Chapter 26 Jessie I went back to my room and sat down on the bed. It felt like someone had just socked me in the stomach. The world was not fair. That much was obvious. If the world was fair, then I would still be human. That way I would be at liberty to fall in love with Miss Colette Gibson. I could woo her, and win her, and marry her. Then I could take her in my arms and kiss her and not fear that I would lose control and rip out her throat. But the world wasn’t fair. And I could not allow myself to fall in love. I thought about instructing Mrs. Denkler to let the girl go. There would be some kind of compensation, of course, but the smart thing to do would be to bar Colette from the castle. But I somehow couldn’t bring myself to do it. And why should the young woman lose her position just because I found her attractive? But it was more than finding her physically beautiful. The way she rushed to my aid when everyone else was standing and staring spoke of a kind heart, a brave heart. And when she’d clasped my hand, the sensation I’d felt was like nothing I’d ever experienced. It was like nothing I’d ever read about in books. Love at first sight always sounded so foolish to me. You couldn’t fall in love with someone after just looking at them. Love was built on knowing someone and having shared experiences and finding out you had a million little things in common. Love at first sight was just an expression perpetuated by novelists and palm readers. But all of my strongly held convictions about love melted away with the knowledge that a girl like Colette Gibson existed in the world. I said her name over and over again and it was ambrosia in my mouth. I kept playing the few brief moments we had spent together over and over again in my head. It felt like I would never be able to stop thinking about her. I rose from my bed several times to find her and then sat back down again. Seeking Miss Gibson would not be a good idea, but it was as if my body had a mind of its own. Any practical decisions I made were quickly overruled. When would Colette be done working for the day? I was half tempted to ring for Mrs. Denkler to find out. But I instantly knew that was a bad idea. Denkie was very protective of the family. If she sensed that I was unduly attracted to the girl, she would fire her on the spot. No, I had to keep my feelings to myself. I had to find a way to deny them. There was no one in which I could confide. I had to find a way to deny my love all on my own. After an hour of just staring at the wall, there was a gentle knock at my door. “Come in,” I called. In walked my sister. “Hello, brother,” she said, hurrying over and bestowing my cheek with a kiss. “I heard what happened with the chandelier and I wanted to check on you. Are you hurt?” I gave her a quick squeeze, trying not to think about how I had yet to eat that day. “I’m fine,” I assured her. “But I guess it’s fortunate that Grandfather turned me when he did or I would have been squashed like a bug under the heel of a boot.”",

      "content": "We walked for a little while in silence, skirting around the unfinished areas that were still mostly mud. The rose garden was nearing completion, with neat, short hedges making squares and rectangles around each bush. “Our father was speaking with one of the gardeners yesterday,” I said to whoever cared to listen. “Both the plants and the gardeners were shipped over from England.” “I thought this pile of bricks was supposed to be Hungarian or something,” Walter said, trying to revive the jovial mood. “It is. But just not the garden,” I said, glancing over my shoulder at him. That’s when I realized that Walter and my sister had their arms around each other. In an instant I knew that suggesting we all get out of the car was a mistake. Walter and Lilly were just looking for an excuse to find a cozy, dark corner where they could canoodle. Besides going against everything Lilly had told our folks, it would leave me alone with Lev. And who knew where his ideas might lead? I didn’t want to inadvertently put Lev in a situation where he thought kissing me was a good idea. I had to get out of there, and fast. Lev Wilson was not going to be my first kiss, if I had anything to say about it. “Oh, we’d better get going,” I said after pretending to check the time. “Don’t want to be late.” “You don’t need to hurry off that quickly, do you?” Lev said, trying to catch my hand. He must have also been aware of Walter and my sister’s intentions. “We do if we don’t want to get grounded,” I insisted, eluding him by taking a few quick steps. “Our father won’t tolerate any kind of nonsense,” I said, hoping he would catch my double meaning. “Come on, Lettie,” Lilly said, her voice carrying a bit of a whine. “We can stay a few more minutes.” “No, we can’t,” I said, allowing my own voice to carry the firmness of my convictions. I had been foolish to agree to an evening drive to an isolated area, even if my sister was with me. “We need to start heading back to the car,” I told her. “Now.” I loved my sister dearly, but enough was enough. “She’s probably right,” I could hear Walter say as I started walking rather briskly. “It’s time to go. I wouldn’t want your father to dislike me.” Then I heard Lev give a scoffing laugh. Chapter 14 Jessie I couldn’t stop staring at the empty bottles of blood. Who would do such a thing? I couldn’t conceive of what would have motivated a thief to such mischief. Whoever had done it must have known that I was a member of the undead. What other possible reason would they have to break into my cabin and dispose of my only food supply? Getting to New York would be a tremendous test of my self-control and I wasn’t sure if I was up to the challenge. The word “test” made me think of my grandfather. This was just the kind of thing he would set up in order to help me “build character”. He felt that Daniel and I were too soft; that our mother coddled us. He also felt that I was ungrateful for my undead transformation. I looked upon being turned into a vampire as a hardship, but he viewed it as the greatest gift he could bestow on another human. After giving it a bit of thought, I decided that disposing of the blood was probably Grandfather’s way of punishing me for my ingratitude. I quickly became convinced that he had hired someone to break into my cabin and get rid of my food. He probably told the criminal to rob me as well, as a measly cover story. Or maybe that was just something the thief thought up on his own, since he was already in my cabin and pawing through my things. Grandfather apparently did not warn the thief not to open the oversized trunk. Or, knowing my grandfather, he had instructed his minion to search the trunk for some nonexistent item. That would serve the dual purpose of forcing me to take a mortal life and probably save Grandfather the couple of coins he’d promised in payment. Thankfully that last part of the plan was foiled. Hurriedly, I checked my valise and was relieved to find that the two pints I had stashed in there had not been disturbed. That was a small blessing. I was already feeling edgy from not having eaten and I needed to slake my appetite before I attempted to send word to my mother about what had happened. I knew she had packed enough blood so that sharing wouldn’t cause her any hardship. Emily tapped at my door and then let herself in. “We’re going up to dinner soon, if you’d like to join us,” she told me. And then stopped short, catching sight of all the empty bottles. “What happened?” “I don’t know,” I told her. “Someone broke into my room while I was resting and this is what they did.” “But who would do such a thing?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She had walked into my cabin behind my sister. If I had been speaking to my mother, I would have voiced my suspicions. But Denkie was loyal to our family’s patriarch and I knew any words that passed from my lips would go straight to my grandfather’s ears. “I have no idea,” I said. “Someone who didn’t understand that they were putting everyone on this ship in mortal danger, I suppose.” Mrs. Denkler’s mouth twitched. “It will be a test of your fortitude,” she told me. “Would you like me to check the ship’s passenger list to see who is likely to be traveling alone?” Emily gave our housekeeper a startled look. “That won’t be necessary,” I assured her. “I’ll have to think things over, but I might just ask you to get a message to my mother.” I looked between the two of them. “For the moment, let’s just keep this incident to ourselves.” Frowning, Mrs. Denkler said, “Of course.” Was the Vanderlind housekeeper aware of my grandfather’s plan? It seemed very unlikely. I knew Grandfather confided in her about many things, but he was too wily to share this type of plans with a mortal. I took a few, careful pulls of blood from one of the pint bottles. It allowed me to focus on solving my predicament rather than thinking about my hunger or allowing my anger to take control of me. I didn’t want to upset my mother unnecessarily. I knew she would come to the same conclusion I had about the disposed of blood. And she already had an adversarial relationship with her father as it was. None of the passengers would benefit from witnessing two vampires battling on the deck of the ship. Plus, my grandfather was much more powerful. If he truly lost control of his temper, then he might actually stake my mother in the heat of battle. No, the best thing I could do for the health of my family was not mention the loss of my food supply. Vampires could go for days without eating, as long as they were careful. I just had to keep myself away from mortals and ration the blood I had left. It would be necessary for me to not leave my cabin for the rest of the trip, day or night. That would keep me away from temptation and the rest of the ship’s passengers safe from me. At first things went smoothly, I had several good books to keep me occupied. When my sister and Mrs. Denkler came back from dinner, I explained that I definitely did not wish for either of them to communicate my troubles to anyone else in the family. Emily was upset by my decision, but Denkie said, “That’s probably for the best.” Things became more of a struggle once the two of them went to bed. My cabin began to feel claustrophobic, so I moved into our shared room, just for a change of scenery. Even with this transition, I felt almost an irresistible urge to go up on deck. But I knew people were still out and about, plus my hunger was increasing. The last time I had a sip from the open pint, I realized that half the contents was already gone. I knew I had to be more conservative when I fed or I would end up having to tell Mrs. Denkler to chain me in my trunk for the remainder of the voyage. As the hour drew close to midnight, I heard someone tapping at the door. Out of habit, my first impulse was to answer it. But then I remembered the state I was in and immediately withdrew into my cabin. Before I knew what was happening, the little French maid who had been such a charming nuisance the previous evening was letting herself into my room. “Hello?” she said, her cheeks aglow. “You called for more towels?” “No, I didn’t call for towels,” I told her in a tight voice. “And I think it advisable that you leave. Right now.” “Do you really want me to go?” she asked, tucking her chin and looking up at me with large blue eyes that had been rimmed in charcoal. “Yes,” I told her firmly. “That’s why I said it.” “But what about your towels?” she asked, stepping further into my cabin. “I never asked for any damn towels,” I insisted, inching past her and heading for the door. I could smell every fragrance of her body in such a confined space and it was making me drool. “But Monsieur,” she said, reluctantly following me as I led her into the main cabin. “I brought them especially for you.” She stepped very close to me and tilted her head back to look up into my eyes. I wanted to show her to the door, but I couldn’t. She was so young and beautiful, and she smelled so good. Her eyes were wide and innocent, but no one was that naive. She obviously wanted me to kiss her. But kissing wasn’t what I had in mind. At least not a mortal kiss. It would have been so easy just to bend her head to the side and expose the tender flesh of her neck. I felt my stomach give a painful growl at the mere thought of it. “Is there nothing else you want from me, Monsieur?” she asked, blinking her wide blue eyes very slowly. “Nothing at all that I can do for you?” “No,” I told her, and my voice came out like a creaking door. “I’m fine. I appreciate your…” I couldn’t even think of what to say. I cleared my throat. “I appreciate your concern for my comfort, but I think I would… I mean, I think you should just leave. Now. Please,” I gulped. “You do not like me?” she said with a hint of a pout. “No, that’s not it at all,” I assured her. “It’s just…” I was clinging to my humanity by the skin of my teeth. “Maybe you would like to get to know me a little bit better?” she suggested. Her voice turned sultry and her French accent faded away. “That is something that could be arranged.” She glanced down at her bosom and then looked back up at me. “No…” I began to say. And then the French maid did something to seal her fate. She reached forward and placed one of her hands on my chest. “Why not?” That’s when I grabbed her. I couldn’t control myself. A small part of my brain was shouting at her, “No! Get out of here! Run for your very life.” But it was too late for that. The evil that was brewing inside of me took over. I had meant to be so strong, but I was lost. Rather than struggling, the maid melted into my arms. “Oh, Monsieur,” she said with a sigh, her accent suddenly returning. “I do not think I can resist you. I have never done anything like this before. But if I give way to you, I trust that you will take care of me. Yes?” But I wasn’t thinking about anything that warranted her trusting me. In fact, I was thinking the exact opposite. Every fiber of my being wanted to drain her and toss the husk of her body over the side of the ship, never to be heard from again. “I’ll take care of you,” I whispered, pulling some tendrils of her hair to one side and fully exposing her neck. That’s when the cabin door burst open. Several burly men charged into the cabin. One of them looked me directly in the face and shouted, “Vampire!” Chapter 15 Colette “I’m mad at you,” Lilly said, thrusting her chin into the air and turning away from me. I already knew she was mad at me. It was obvious from the way she had been storming around our room all evening, picking up books, slamming them down again, and sighing quite dramatically. It wasn’t behavior she could exhibit in front of our mother and father at dinner, but just the two of us in the room we shared was a different story. “Yes, I know that,” I told her. That caught her up for a moment. “Well don’t you want to know why?” “I think I probably already know,” I said, although mostly to myself. “It’s because of the way you’re treating Lev,” she said without really hearing me. “No it’s not,” was my reply. We’d gone driving with the boys the evening before and I was still irritated. If anything, I was the one who should have been mad at her. “It’s because you wanted to stay and canoodle in the moonlight with Walter and I wanted to go home.” I sat down at the dressing table we shared, picked up a brush and started trying to tame my hair. “Well…” she stammered, “that too, but I also think you’re also being very rude to Lev.” “No I’m not,” I said quietly. “He really likes you,” she insisted. “No he doesn’t,” I told her, giving up on the brush and combing my hair with my fingers. “He doesn’t know me. I think he’s just interested in me because I’m a challenge. If I was all gah-gah for him, I’m sure he’d suddenly find that he likes a different girl.” “That’s still no reason to be rude to him,” Lilly grumbled. “It’s no reason to kiss him either,” I told her. “I could see where things were going and I didn’t want any part of it. You know, you don’t always have to do what a boy wants you to,” I told her. She shrugged. “I know. But Lev is so handsome,” she said, sinking onto her bed. “Don’t you think he’s very good looking?” “I’m sure if I saw his picture in a magazine, I might think that,” I told her. “But he’s not very nice and I really think he’s a bit of a bully.” I remembered the menacing look he had given Lilly’s date after just a slight ribbing. “I’m surprised Walter would want to be his friend.” “They’ve know each other forever,” Lilly said. “Walter thinks of him more like a brother.” “How do you think he got that bruise on his cheek?” I asked. It was a question that had been tugging at the back of my mind. Frowning, Lilly said, “Didn’t he say he was roughhousing with some friends and banged into a table?” “Sure, but that must have been some very rough roughhousing. His knuckles were all bruised and his hands were swollen.” “Really?” Lilly said, absentmindedly. “I hadn’t noticed.” “I bet.” My sister only had eyes for Walter. When he was around, a falling star could land at her feet and she probably wouldn’t even notice. “So I think you should go out with him again, just to make it up to him,” Lilly blurted rather quickly. “What?” She’d caught me off guard with that one. “You know, so he doesn’t think you dislike him or anything.” “But I do dislike him,” I told her. “As a matter of fact, I dislike him very much. I’d be perfectly happy if I never see him again.” Lilly got up to stand behind me so that we were both reflected in the mirror. “Isn’t that was Elizabeth says about Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice right before she falls in love with him?” “Lev Wilson is no Mr. Darcy,” I informed her. To me that was abundantly clear. “But you’re Elizabeth,” she said, gathering my hair in her hands. “You’re definitely the beauty of the family. That’s why Lev likes you so much, I guess.” “Jane was the beauty of the family,” I corrected her. “Elizabeth was the one who made the pert remarks.” That made Lilly smile. “So the analogy still holds,” she said with a laugh. I turned in my chair to look at her directly. “But seriously, Lilly, I really do not enjoy Lev Wilson’s company. I’m sorry if it makes things more challenging for Walter and you, but I will never agree to go on another date with his majesty again.” Lilly flopped back on her bed. “Do you really think he’s related to royalty?” she asked. This made me laugh. “Sure, in the same way that we’re all related to Adam and Eve.” “Oh.” Lilly frowned. “I really don’t think he’d lie about something like that. Do you?” I wanted to say that I though Lev Wilson would say it was day when it was pitch black outside, but instead I replied, “I think that Lev is maybe prone to exaggerations.” Gross exaggerations, to be more exact, but I didn’t say that part out loud. “I still don’t know why you don’t like him.” Lilly went back to her bed to have another moment to sulk. “Lilly, I’m afraid I just don’t.” I got up from my chair and walked over to her. “Please respect my feelings and stopped trying to fix us up. You’ll only make everyone miserable.” “Okay,” she finally relented. “How about another date with Herschel?” When I gave her a flat look, she quickly added, “Or maybe Walter could introduce you to another one of his friends.” I sighed. “Lilly, the next time you want to go out with Walter, I’ll go as your chaperone and just read a book. But please stop trying to fix me up with one of his friends.” Shaking her head, Lilly said, “You’re a funny kind of girl. You’re so pretty you could date any boy in town, but instead you spend all of your time with your nose in a book.” I couldn’t help but shrug. “I guess that’s just who I am. And probably who I’ll always be.” Chapter 16 Jessie The French maid let out a shriek and I thrust her from my arms as more men came barreling into the room. They were brandishing makeshift wooden stakes that they’d procured by breaking the legs off of tables and chairs. I was trapped with nowhere to run. There was only one door and that was filled by a dozen armed men. Even if I took out of few of the angry mob, there was no way I was getting out of there without a stake through my heart. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. My life as a member of the undead would be even briefer than my life as a mortal. “What are you doing here?” the maid screeched. “Get out! Get out!” I made the decision that I would not fight them. I would allow them to kill me without a struggle. There would be no blood on my hands as I went to meet the world’s maker. “Grab a stake or anything you have made out of wood,” one of the young men shouted at me. I recognized him immediately as the ruddy faced youth who had been impertinent to my sister. “There’s a vampire aboard the ship,” he said. “He’s lured one of the crew to his cabin and is feeding off the poor soul right now.” I just stood there, frozen to the spot, trying to take it all in. “A vampire?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes!” the man shouted. “They exist. And there’s one aboard this ship. Arm yourself and hurry up. I doubt the creature will go down without a fight.” “I…” I stammered. “I’m with you.” “Good,” the young man told me. “We need every able bodied man we can find. And we don’t have a minute to lose.” Then, turning to the rest of the mob, he shouted, “Let’s go!” The crowd turned as a unit and surged away from the door. I stumbled after them, absentmindedly grabbing a corkscrew on my way out the door. It wasn’t made out of wood. I’m not even sure why I grabbed it beyond the fact that the ruddy faced young man had instructed me to grab a weapon. “What’s going on?” Emily asked. The noise from the mob had woken her and she looked sleep-tousled, her eyes wide with fright. “Everything is fine,” I assured her, even though it was obviously a lie. One of our family had been discovered and was about to face a horrible death. But there was no reason to drag poor Emily into it. I didn’t want her to see one of us getting staked. Especially if the hapless individual happened to be our mother. “Just stay in your cabin,” I told her. “Lock the door.” As I hurried behind the mob, I called over my shoulder. “And keep the maid with you!” There was no reason for any young woman to get caught up in a bloodthirsty crowd, even a female of questionable virtue. “I’ll be fine. You can’t keep me locked in here,” the maid insisted, all remnants of her French accent giving way to something that sounded more like she hailed from Yorkshire. “Do as I say!” I shouted as I ran down the hall, on the heels of the angry mob. Which one of my family had been discovered? And would there be any way for me to save them without putting everyone’s life in danger? As we charged passed door after door of the first class cabins, I saw the face of my brother Daniel peeking out. At least I knew he wasn’t going to be the one to face the business end of a stake. That narrowed things down to either my grandfather or my mother; fifty-fifty odds for both of them. I knew I would fight to death for my mother. I couldn’t say what I would do for her father, especially if my suspicions were true about him hiring someone to dispose of my blood. My grandfather was a difficult man to love. In fact, if I was being honest, I hated him. But he was my maker and that tied me to him for eternity. The angry mob stopped outside a state room door. I had no idea if the room belonged to my mother. They banged on the door, but there was no response. Individuals yelled for a ship’s steward to open the door, but the mob was too impatient to wait. A couple of brawny young men began putting their shoulders to the door. It was well made and held out against the assault for several moments, before eventually bursting open. I had expected the crowd to surge forward, but instead they pulled back. An audible gasp was heard from most of the men who could see through the door. Everyone was so transfixed, either looking through the door or trying to look through the door, that I took a little risk and levitated several inches into the air to see over the crowd. I covered for this trick by pretending I was boosting myself up on the handle of the door across the way, but it would have been an almost impossible test of strength for a mortal. From my elevated position, I was able to see over the heads of the crowd. There was my grandfather, in the corner of the room, hunkered down like a rabid dog that had been cornered by the local sheriff. Blood dripped from the corners of his mouth, his fangs on full display. And there, slumped on the floor, was the half naked body of a boy. I recognized him immediately. It was Christian Franzen, the beautiful cabin boy who had spoken with Mother and me on the deck of the ship the previous evening. Blood was oozing from his neck and he looked very pale. He was making a faint mewing sound, like a hungry kitten. I could tell from the boy’s deathly white complexion and the deep wounds on his neck that Grandfather had intended to drain him dry. The mob had arrived just in time. “You animal,” someone shouted from the crowd. Grandfather jerked his head up. His eyes looked heavy, like those of a drunkard deep in his cups. “You peons,” he snarled, doing his best to pull himself up to his full height. “There’s nothing you can do to me. You cannot touch me.” “Get him!” several people shouted at once and the crowd surged forward. If it had been just a few men, Grandfather could have fought them, and probably won, even in his inebriated state. But the mob was too much for him. They began beating him with their makeshift stakes, the splinters from the broken table and chair legs piercing his flesh. He began to shriek in agony, but that only fueled the crowd. Quickly, I shoved my way through the masses to the limp body of Christian Franzen. People were so outraged by the assault on him, that they were willing to trample him in order to punish his molester. I pulled the cabin boy to the far corner of the room. There was the heavy scent of gin on his breath, which explained why Grandfather was acting so sluggish. The boy’s head lolled, his eyes were glassy, but he was able to focus on me for a brief moment. “Vampire,” he whispered and then he lost consciousness. The mob had seized Grandfather and was dragging him out of the cabin, all the while beating him and making him howl. I needed to save him. But Mr. Franzen was about to expire in my arms. Discretely, I punctured my fingertip with one of my fang. Once there was a bit of blood dripping from it, I stuck my finger in the cabin boy’s mouth. It only took a few moments for his eyelids to start fluttering. A few seconds after that and his eyes began to focus. He looked at me and let out a shriek, which I quickly stifled, clamping a hand over his mouth. “You’re safe,” I told him as he struggled against me, his body still weak from blood loss. “There is no reason to fear.” I forced a few more drops of blood into his mouth and his pallor began to improve. “You were attacked,” I told him. “But your assailant has been captured so there’s nothing more he can do to harm you.” The crowd had cleared the room by that point and I knew I had to follow them as quickly as possible to try to save my grandfather. “You must rest here,” I told him, gently lowering him to the rug. “Be still. No more harm will come to you.” I stood up. “I’ll send the ship’s physician just as soon as I can.” The cabin boy made an attempt to say something. He reached a trembling hand toward me and tried to force words to come out of his mouth. But I had already wasted too much time. I felt I couldn’t spare another moment. I pulled away from him. “Just stay there,” I shouted over my shoulder as I rushed out the door. The corridor was empty, but I followed the sound of angry voices to the deck of the ship. There was the mob, pummeling and kicking at a prostrate figure on the deck, which I knew to be the heartless creature who was my grandfather. What was I to do for him? Was there anything I could say that would stop the crazed mob from tearing him to pieces? I had to try something. He was my maker. “Wait!” I shouted, rushing forward and thrusting myself between the mob and my grandfather. “Stop!” I held my hands up to keep them back. “Why should we?” one of the men asked, his eye appearing crazed with bloodlust. “He’s a human,” I pointed out. “Doesn’t he at least deserve a trial?” “He’s not a human,” the man told me. “He’s a creature of the night. He gave up his right to a trial when he sold his soul to the devil.” Another man began to view me with suspicion. “Why are you so eager to defend him?” he asked, poking me on the chest with a brawny finger. “What’s this creature to you?” “Nothing,” I insisted. “I’m just studying the law.” “The law is only for humans,” a woman’s voice called from the back of the throng. “I wouldn’t give that creature the same consideration I’d give a dog.” Most people in the crowd seemed to heartily agree with her. I felt a hand close tightly around my ankle. Looking down, I made eye contact with my grandfather. “Save me,” he said in words so soft that no mortal ears could have heard them. “I am your maker. You owe me your immortal soul. You must save me.” “How?” I asked, mostly with my eyes. “I am your maker,” he whispered again. “You must save me, even if it means sacrificing yourself.” I knew at that moment that I truly hated my grandfather. I hated him to the very core of my being. But he was also my maker. I had to obey him. I felt obliged to try to preserve his life. Turning back to the crowd, I looked at all their mortal faces. I was just a fledgling vampire, but I knew that I had the ability to compel mortals to do my bidding. I didn’t have much experience using my influence over anyone and it seemed an insurmountable challenge to sway a rabid mob. But I felt Grandfather’s grip around my ankle. I could hear him whispering, “Save me. You must save me.” I had no choice. I had to either compel the crowd to leave him alone or fight them. “Please, listen to me,” I said, raising my hands in the air again to gather their attention. “No,” a woman shouted from the crowd. “Shove the boy out of the way and dispatch the beast.” And then the mob closed in, poking at me with their makeshift stakes to get me out of the way. Each scratch of the wood was like someone had set my skin on fire. I wanted to shriek in pain, but I knew if anyone took notice of the agony a few slivers were causing me, then I would be in the same position as my grandfather. “Come here, boy,” I heard a woman’s gruff voice command me. I was about to protest, but the lady got a firm hold of me and began dragging me away from Grandfather. “There’s no need for you to be caught up in this nonsense.” The woman was elderly and her voice was ragged, but she had a grip on me as strong as a vice. In a softer voice, she added, “We’re almost clear of him.” I did a double take and realized that the elderly woman was my mother in disguise. “What are you doing?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “Saving what’s left of my family,” she said in a low voice. “But Grandfather…” I stammered. “You’re death isn’t going to save him,” she said. I don’t know where Grandfather got the strength, but he’d climbed to his feet and started fighting the crowd. It seemed like some of the frenzy had left the mob. Instead of being swept up with outrage and moving with one mind and one will, they were all standing back, waiting for someone else to take the lead. If he’d played things right, maybe Grandfather could have gained control of the mob. Or at least temporarily escaped the crowd and hidden somewhere on the ship while regaining his strength. Then he could have waited until we were closer to New York and escaped by air, flying the rest of the way. But Grandfather was angry and used to being obeyed by mortals. He grabbed one of the men that was taunting him, lifted him into the air, and then flung him over the side of the ship. “Who wants to die next?” Grandfather shouted, glaring at the crowd. The people moved in a giant mass, slashing and stabbing at Grandfather with their stakes. They had him pinned against the rail. “We have to do something,” I said, pulling against my mother’s tight embrace. “No,” Mother said, shoving me back. “He’ll be gone in another moment. I think we’ve already done enough. We’re better off saving that poor soul who went over the side.” Then she released me and ran for a life preserver. I knew she was right, but I still felt compelled by my maker. Grandfather had commanded me to save him. I had to do something to save the evil fiend. I had to try. Almost against my will, I found myself taking a few steps toward the crowd. “Jessie!” Mother shouted, jolting my out of my trance. “Help me with the man overboard.” “Yes,” I said to her. “Yes, you’re right.” I hurried to the railing, took the life preserver from her and flung it to the man bobbing up and down in the waves. I could see him just as easily as if it had been high noon. The preserver had a rope attached to it. Only a few moments later and we were hauling the man back onto the deck of the ship. Grandfather was losing his battle. The best thing he could have done was take flight, but he was in such a weakened condition from all the stake wounds, that was no longer a possibility. Still, he wouldn’t give up the battle. He lunged for another man, but received a stake to the hand for his efforts. Jerking back in pain, he found himself pinned against the railing. Another moment of struggle and he was pushed over the side. My impulse was to catch him as he fell. I didn’t have much experience flying, but I knew the basics. Mother held me back, gripping my shirt with both her hands. “Let him go, Jessie,” she told me. “But…” I struggled against her grasp. “Jessie,” she said. “Look at me.” After I wrench my gaze away from where Grandfather had plunged in the water, she said, “I didn’t go through all this trouble to arrange your grandfather’s discovery, just to have you put yourself at risk to save him.” I stared at her, too stunned to think for several seconds. “You?” I couldn’t help but ask. And then I added, “Why?” Mother released me and then did her best to straighten out the wrinkles in my shirt. “That son-of-a-bitch already killed my sons,” she said. “I wasn’t going to let him get my daughter.” I let this new information sink into my brain. My mother had set the whole thing up. She’d found the perfect cabin boy and probably even gotten him drunk in the hopes that his blood would intoxicate her father, slowing his reflexes. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything to the rest of the family,” Mother said, scanning the people on the deck for any family members who might have come to see what all the noise was about. “Of course,” I assured her. “But…” My thoughts were all a jumble. Grandfather was Mother’s maker, too. How had she acted against him? It seemed impossible. “How did you do it?” I was finally able to ask. “How could you betray your maker? Even if he was a man like Grandfather?” “It wasn’t easy,” she told me, running her hands over her clothes to smooth nonexistent wrinkles in her dress. “But there’s one thing most makers don’t seem to understand.” “What?” I couldn’t help but ask. She turned to head back to her cabin, but then paused to look at me over her shoulder. “A mother’s love is stronger than any obligation she might feel toward her maker.” Chapter 17 Colette “You’re losing weight,” Mama observed, running an appraising eye over my figure. “Do you think?” I brushed my hands over my hips. I’d never been heavy, but I was rather curvy, which I knew Papa disliked. I’d overheard him talking with Mama once and he’d said flat out that I was too young to have such a womanly figure. “It must be all that bicycling you’ve been doing. It’s great exercise,” Mama said, turning back to the dishes. “I swear you must have ridden across half the state in the last month.” “Probably,” I agreed with her, picking up a clean plate and starting to dry it with a towel. What my mother didn’t know was that, even though I had been riding my bicycle a lot lately, it was always to the same place. It felt almost as if I had a magnet inside my belly that was always pulling me toward the castle. “It looks good on you,” Mama said as she drained the sink and started to wipe down the counter. “I think it’s healthy. You should keep it up.” She wouldn’t have thought it was healthy if she’d known about my visit to the castle that afternoon. I’d ridden my bike over there after school. I wanted to speak with the Italian workers before they finished the floors and were sent back to Italy. After the rose garden was finished, the English workers disappeared like they had evaporated into the air. There was only one caretaker left to make sure the roses stayed beautiful. He looked about a million years old and lived in a tiny house that was tucked out of sight of the castle. The problem was that the Italians were always working inside the castle and I wasn’t bold enough to stroll inside the building just to ask impertinent questions. Still, that afternoon, luck was on my side. As the wheels of my bicycle rolled to a halt just outside the castle, I noticed a young man with an immense crop of shiny black hair leaning against a tree. He was smoking a cigarette and had his eyes closed as he tilted his face toward the sun. The heavy layer of sawdust covering him from head to toe led me to believe that he might be one of the Italian workers. I was trying to think of a possible reason to strike up a conversation with him, when he said, “I am glad for this day. I have missed the sunshine.” He’d kept his eyes closed when speaking so I wasn’t quite sure he was addressing me, but there was nobody else around. “It another few months it will be quite warm,” I answered him, still staying astride my bicycle. “Yes, but by then I will be gone.” He opened his eyes to look at me and I was surprised to realize that they were green when I had been expecting brown. “You are from Italy?” I asked. I was feeling rather shy to be standing there by myself, speaking to a young man I didn’t know, but I forced myself to be bold. “Si,” he said, closing his eyes again like a cat enjoying a nap in a sunbeam. He tilted his head back to rest it against the tree. “You are one of the men laying the floors in the castle?” “Si,” he said again. Climbing off my bike, I put down the kickstand. Taking a deep breath, I blurted, “Have you ever met the family who will live here?” My question caused the young man to lift his head and look directly at me. After staring at me for several seconds, he said, “No,” rather curtly. “I have never met the people who will live here. But I hear of them and it is never good things.” “What have you heard about them?” I asked, fully realizing that I sounded like the town gossip. The young man shifted his weight from one foot to the other. My question had made him uncomfortable. “It is stories that are not nice to hear,” he said. “They are not for the young girl like you.” I felt the sting of disappointment. What was the age where people stopped saying things like, “You’re too young to hear things like that,” or, “I’ll tell you when you’re older,”? This young man couldn’t have been much older than me and he knew the stories. I started getting back on my bicycle. There didn’t seem much point in haranguing him if he was reluctant to talk. But my leaving somehow loosened his tongue. “I will tell you this thing,” he said. “I would not like for such a family to move to my town.” “Why not?” I ask, not bothering to climb off my bike. His face darkened and I couldn’t tell if he was getting angry or just struggling for the right words. “They are not like the people,” he said. “They make the bite.” “Oh.” I was beginning to understand him. “You mean their dogs?” “No.” He shook his head adamantly. “They are not the mannaro.” “Pardon?” I said, bending my ear toward him. His English was good, but I didn’t quite catch the last word. “They’re not the what?” “Mannaro,” he said again, more slowly. “I do not know this word in English, but that is not the family.” He looked at the space between us for a couple of seconds, his lips moving slightly as he tried to work something out in his head. “They are not the lupo.” Then his eyes widened a little. “They are not the wolf, but they bite. They bite very badly. You must stay away.” The Vanderlinds apparently had some kind of weird pets that were especially vicious, was all I could conclude. Some type of dog or wolf or something. Maybe these animals had a habit of escaping their kennels and attacking the locals. That was the only thing I could guess. But would the family really ship such beasts across an ocean? Especially after they’d already made such trouble? I was just about to mention this possibility to the young man, when another worker, middle aged and also covered in sawdust, came out of the castle. He immediately yelled at my new friend in a foreign language. I assumed it was Italian. The young man said something in reply, also in a heated voice. He gestured at me several times. The only word I understood between them was the name Vanderlind. The older man swung around to glare at me and then a string of words came out of his mouth very rapidly. I had no idea what he was saying. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I don’t speak Italian.” This apparently made the man even more furious. He took a deep breath and then said, “You go out of here! You leave this! You do not come here!” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I was just asking about the Vanderlind family. I didn’t mean to keep anyone from their work.” That was the only thing I could think of that would make him so red in the face. “Go!” the man shouted. “You go now!” He waved his hands at me as if trying to chase me off. “You not come back here.” “I really didn’t mean to get anyone in trouble.” I gave the young man an apologetic look. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “He wants that you should go,” said the young man. “He wants that you leave because there is danger.” “You no come back here!” the older man roared. He picked up a pebble from the ground and threw it in my general direction. “Ora!Ora!” he shouted, reaching for another pebble. I had a feeling that this time he wouldn’t miss. Turning my bike fully around, I started pedaling hard and didn’t stop until I was safe in the garage back at my house. The whole things was very strange, and frightening, and a little humiliating somehow. I didn’t appreciate being chased off like a sheep that had strayed into the wrong pasture. The man didn’t have to throw stones at me. There was still some time before dinner, so I went to my room to think. Why were all the workmen warning me about the Vanderlinds? There must have been some terrible incident back in Hungary. Something to do with some type of vicious dogs. Maybe the dogs had killed a person. Maybe even a few people. Was that why the Vanderlinds had decided to move away? To escape the shame of their pets having killed or maimed some people. That seemed rather strange, but it was the only thing I could thinking of, given what I had been told. I decided that it was probably best for me to stay away from the caste, at least until the floors were finished and the Italian carpenters were gone. I was drawn to the castle, but that didn’t mean I had to be foolish. If there really were rabid dogs that were going to be housed on the estate, then I would have to fight my nature and avoid the place as much as possible. I didn’t mind a well behaved dog that was happy just to sit on a porch or fetch a stick, but I was not overly comfortable with dogs that liked to jump and bark. A vicious dog would probably be able to sense my fear and target me for its next attack. I was sad that I wouldn’t be able to ride over to the castle anymore, but I wasn’t a stupid girl. Those men were warning me for a reason. Just then Lilly came into the room and immediately flung herself on her bed. “What’s wrong?” I asked her. “They’re letting me go from Zucker’s,” she said, tearfully. “Why?” I exclaimed, coming over to sit next to her on the bed. “What happened?” “Oh… Mrs. Zucker’s cousin in moving to Tiburon,” Lilly said, wiping her eyes and giving a loud sniff. “She’s going to start working there, so they won’t have any space left for me,” she explained. “And there’s not a job for you, either,” Lilly said. “Mr. Zucker asked me to tell you.” “Oh, no.” I let my shoulders slump. The Zuckers had told me that I could work at their store over the summer. I was hoping to start at the end of the month, when school let out. Lilly and I had planned to work there as much as we could to bring in extra money for Mama and Papa. And Lilly had thought she might keep working there for a few years, at least until she got married or found another job. “Now I’m never going to get to see Walter,” Lilly said, morosely as she flopped onto her stomach. “Have you told Mama and Papa?” I asked. “No,” Lilly told me, her voice slightly muffled by her pillow. “Well don’t say anything yet,” I told her. “Let’s try to find some other work first so they don’t have to worry.” The other evening, Lilly had overheard Mama and Papa talking about paying the bills. Things were getting very tight. Papa was worried that if he didn’t find more work then we might have to sell the house and move in with his brother. All of us loved our house. Papa had crafted it with his own two hands and it really was a thing of beauty. Lilly and I were determined to contribute whatever we could to keep us in our home. “Alright,” Lilly agreed. The jobs at Zucker’s had sounded too good to be true. There were plenty of people out of work and willing to do just about anything to earn a couple of dollars. “I’m sure we could maybe get something on one of the farms.” “There’s got to something,” I agreed with her, but we both knew it was going to be a challenge. “It’s just a shame they didn’t hire Papa to work building the castle,” I said. Lilly gave a small laugh, even though there were still tears in her eyes. “You’re just saying that because then you would get to look inside.” “Well, that too.” I couldn’t help but join her in giggling a little. “But I mean, it would have been nice for him to have the work.” Sighing, Lilly murmured, “I guess it’s too bad our last name doesn’t sound Hungarian.” Chapter 18 Jessie The person who took Grandfather’s death the hardest was Mrs. Denkler. I told her when I returned to the cabin, after checking that someone was attending to the cabin boy’s injuries. I hoped to everything holy and unholy that Grandfather had not left any clues behind connecting him to the Vanderlind family. I knew his cabin would be thoroughly searched. “No, no, no,” Mrs. Denkler wailed once I’d told her of her employer’s demise. She immediately began tearing at her hair with grief. I wrapped my arms around her and held her firmly to stop her from doing further injury to herself. “He’s gone,” was all I could tell her. “I tried to save him, but it was impossible. The crowd wouldn’t stop until they were sure he was dead.” Emily was standing behind Mrs. Denkler. I could see her over the shoulder of the grieving housekeeper. Tears were pouring down her face. She looked at me, her entire body trembling. “You mean,” she gasped. “You mean that I won’t have too…” she couldn’t finish her words. “You mean I’ll never…” I nodded, and tried to summon a smile. “That’s right,” I told her. “You’re going to live to be an old lady.” Our mother had seen to that. Emily covered her face with her hands and ran to her cabin, slamming the door behind her. I was glad for her. I knew she had dreaded becoming a member of the undead. But her actions did leave me with an inconsolable Mrs. Denkler in my arms. “What will become of me now?” the housekeeper wailed. “What will become of me?” “Everything will be just fine,” I said, half carrying her across the room to lie her down on the couch. “You’ll come with us to America. You’ll be the Vanderlind housekeeper. Nothing has changed,” I assured her. I rang to have some liquor brought to the cabin and ordered it to be brought on the double. The steward arrived with a bottle of bourbon and a bottle of soda. He wanted to come in and set the drinks up for me on the bar, but I refused to let him enter the cabin. Instead, I asked him to just pass everything over the threshold. Mrs. Denkler was so distraught, I didn’t know what she might let slip with a stranger in the room. At first the steward seemed a little offended, but I was able to smooth things over with a rueful smile and a generous tip. “Here, Denkie, drink this,” I instructed, handing her a brimming glass. “It’ll calm you,” I assured her. I had expected our housekeeper to just sip daintily at the straight bourbon I had handed her, but she downed half the glass in just one gulp. Her body shivered and pitched a little as the liquor ran through her, but it did interrupt her wailing. After that she sat there for several minutes, just staring at the wall opposite her, not moving or making a sound. I wasn’t sure what I could do for her or what I could offer her to make her feel better. My mother had suspected Denkie would take the news hard. She had taken it upon herself to somehow get the news to Daniel, if he didn’t already know. My brother had been eager to become a member of the undead and he had more respect for our grandfather than the rest of us. Still, as long as the Vanderlind name was untarnished and our fortune was still intact, I doubted Daniel would mind too horribly much. Without warning, Mrs. Denkler rose to her feet. “If you’ll excuse me,” she said in a quiet voice. “I think I need to lie down for a few minutes. “Please,” I said, hurrying over to her in case she should be unsteady. But that was not the case. She crossed the room to the cabin she shared with my sister without a tremble, her head high and her eyes hard. “I think you should just turn in for the night,” I told her, seeing her to her door. Her eyes shifted in my direction, but I could tell she wasn’t really looking at me. Her movements gave the impression that she was more automaton than human. “Thank you,” she said. “You’ve always been a kind boy.” When Mrs. Denkler had turned the lock inside the cabin, I hurried to my private quarters and dug into my valise. I drained the remaining contents of the first pint in one large gulp and had downed half of the second bottle before I really knew what I was really doing. It took great self-restraint for me to cork the remaining blood and tuck it away. I had to force myself out of the room; the urge to finish the pint was so strong. After the light went out in Emily and Mrs. Denkler’s cabin, I felt truly alone with only my thoughts to keep me company. Sinking onto the couch, I cupped my head in my hands. Grandfather’s demise was too horrible to think about. If I closed my eyes, I could still see the image of him going over the side. He hadn’t cried out as he fell; no wail of fear, no words of farewell. He must have been too weak to fly. I had to wonder if he suspected any of his family of treachery. Did he know my mother had set him up to be discovered? And was Grandfather truly gone? That was another thought that would keep me awake in my coffin. He was in a weakened state and had been slashed at by many shards of wood, but had he actually been staked? Was he still of this world, just floating in the ocean somewhere? We were in the middle of the Atlantic. There wasn’t even the smallest bit of land for a thousand miles, but that didn’t mean that Grandfather wasn’t still alive. Had he somehow kept pace with the ship and was, even now, climbing aboard, hell-bent on revenge? That thought compelled me to my feet. I found myself on deck a moment later without jacket nor any memory if I had locked the state room door. I began hurrying down flights of stairs to the lower decks. Surely there would be wet footprints if he’d managed to save himself. I scanned the polished floorboards and hung over the railing, trying to glimpse if there was a figure bobbing in the ocean. At the stern of the ship, I caught sight of a shadowy figure, leaning against the rail. He was the same size as my grandfather and had the same demeanor. I stutter-stepped with surprise, but a moment later I understood that the figure was my brother. “He’s not here,” Daniel said, his voice a low growl. “I’ve been looking since I got word, but there’s not a sign of him.” “So he’s really gone, then?” I had to wonder. “He’s out there.” We both took a moment to examine the vastness of the ocean. “He was a foolish old bugger,” Daniel felt the need to observe. “Feasting on a cabin boy… I should have thought Grandfather had better self control.” I shrugged. “Maybe the temptation was too great.” Daniel laughed. “I suppose we should be grateful Mother insisted we travel under false names,” he observed, using a voice that was loud enough to draw attention. I jerked my head slightly to let him know he should be silent. It was stupid of him to assume that we were the only beings out and about, even though it was the middle of the night. “Don’t be such a prig,” my brother muttered. “There’s no one around to hear us.” I could see that Daniel had inherited the arrogance that had been our grandfather’s undoing. But it would do me no good to point that out. Daniel seemed satisfied that Grandfather had not made it back onto the ship and I had no reason to doubt him. “Have a good night,” I told my brother as I turned to stroll away. It never even occurred to me to ask him to share some of his blood. I would let the last misdeed of our Grandfather go unknown to the rest of the family. He’d done enough evil things in his life. I didn’t need to add one final black-mark against him. When I opened the door to our quarters again, the first thing I saw was Mrs. Denkler’s hard eyes glittering in the darkness. I could see her clear as day, but there was something about the darkness that may her eyes glow in a different way. “Oh,” I said, rather surprised. “I thought you’d gone to bed.” “No,” she told me. “I just needed to rest for a minute.” I wasn’t sure what to say. “I hope you’re not unwell.” “No, I am well,” she insisted. “The loss of your grandfather was quite a shock, but I’m sure the family feels it more than I do.” I nodded, unwilling to commit words to the topic. “I greatly appreciate your understanding when I…” Mrs. Denkler waved a thin hand through the air. “When I became upset. I was very fond of your grandfather.” “Yes, of course,” was all I could think to say. “And I appreciate your assurance that your family stills values my services,” she said. I tried to smile. “I don’t think we could run the castle without you.” “Do you mind if I turn on a light?” she asked. “It makes things easier for me.” “Yes, of course,” I said. “Don’t get up. Let me do it for you.” I quickly found the switch. “I have something for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, holding out a small cup covered with a cloth. I asked, “What is it?” but my nose had already told me. It’s was blood. “Where did you get it?” I exclaimed. Then I noticed that her left arm was bandaged at the wrist. “Denkie, you didn’t!” “Of course I did,” she said, still offering me the cup of nectar. “I know you’re trying to be brave and not say anything to your family, but it’s going to be hard for you to make it another two full days without feeding. Better to have some of my blood, given voluntarily, than to have you lose control and…” Her voice cracked a little. “And get caught the way your grandfather was.” “I couldn’t,” I told her, although my eyes were glued to the cup in her hand. “Of course you can,” she said, sounding a little cross. “And besides, what do you think will happen if you slip up and the passengers discover another vampire aboard this ship?” She was right. If I did make a mistake, then she and Emily would also be held responsible. And it wouldn’t stop there. They crew would probably search the boat, cabin by cabin, until my mother and brother were also discovered. If I lost control, then my whole family would more than likely be killed. I took the blood, noticing how, when I reached for it, my hand trembled. It seemed somehow obscene to drink Mrs. Denkler’s blood in front of her, so I hurried to my private cabin before gulping down the red nectar. It was still warm from when she’d drained it from her arm. After the cup was empty, I was lost in a confusing swirl of ecstasy and revulsion. Mrs. Denkler had been our housekeeper my entire life. I had never thought of her in any sort of intimate terms beyond her being an older woman who felt at liberty to scold me if I acted up. But drinking her blood, even if it was from a cup, was somehow so intimate. It made me feel uneasy, like I had accidentally stumbled across her in her bath. Once I fought passed all the confusing sensations, I felt much better. I was in control of my appetite again. I could face being with mortals and not break out into a sweat, visualizing them with their necks’ laid bare. I felt an extreme amount of gratitude toward Mrs. Denkler. She was more than just a good housekeeper and a loyal servant. She really was part of the Vanderlind family. I wouldn’t forget the gift she had given me. Chapter 19 Colette I stayed away from the castle for as long as I could. Not going there had me so distracted that it was a challenge to concentrate on my school work or even carry on a simple conversation. Our final exams for the year were quickly approaching and I wondered how I would ever get through them with my thoughts always straying to the massive gray structure on the other side of town. I couldn’t help but daydream about who would be living there and how they would spend their days. I wondered if they had any children, and if yes, how old were they? I knew it was silly to believe that anyone so wealthy would send their offspring to Tiburon High, but I wasted hours daydreaming about it. I didn’t dare include myself in the world I was creating in my mind. I knew that there were thousands of novels where a young man from a wealthy family falls in love with the lowly shop girl, but I knew better than to believe something so magical would ever happen to someone like me. Still, I found the longer I stayed away from the castle, the more it consumed me. After two weeks, I decided I would have to visit the site again or my grades would start to suffer. That afternoon, I set out on my bicycle immediately after school. I hoped that the Italian workers had finished their tasks by then and were on a boat back to Italy. I didn’t relish the idea of having more stones thrown at me while men scolded me in a language I did not understand. As I coasted my bike down the recently paved road, I was stunned to see how complete the castle appeared. If I didn’t know differently, I would have assumed that the Vanderlind Castle had been standing on the shores of the Tiburon since the crusades. Then I caught sight of more barges on the river. The family’s furniture and personal effects had arrived. Giant crates were being used to unloaded the cargo onto the shore. Men wielding claw hammers and pry bars were opening large crates and carefully removing the contents. Everything had been packed in straw, so there were a dozen women efficiently wiping down each item. Then the contents were being moved into the castle by dozens of men. From a distance it looked like a line of ants hefting away the remnants of a picnic. The entire process was being orchestrated by an older woman wearing a long gray dress with a high collar. Her dark gray hair was pulled back in an elaborate coil and her hands never stopped moving as she gave orders to each man as he entered the building. I was amazed that she could look at a lamp or a dressing table and know exactly where it belonged. She wasn’t even consulting a clip board. She apparently had the entire contents of the castle memorized. I stood there for several minutes, just watching the progress and admiring the beautiful furnishings of the Vanderlinds’ home. It was probably the only opportunity I would have to see anything so fine, outside of a museum, so I was doing my best to soak it all in. The workmen unloaded a very large crate that contained several smaller crates. They were all shaped the same, like long, squat rectangles. When one of the workmen started to apply his pry bar to the contents, the older woman in gray rushed over. I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she directed the workmen to carrying those specific crates into the house unopened. I couldn’t figure out what their contents could be. They weren’t the right shape or weight to be safes. And even if they were strongboxes of some type, filled with valuables, it wasn’t likely the workmen would have been able to crack them open with all the other people swarming around. I stared after the peculiar crates with keen interest. When I turned my eyes back to the general crowd of workers, I noticed that the lady in charge of the unpacking was looking directly at me. She had sharp eyes and wore a frown on her lips. I felt immediately embarrassed for being caught gawking. I was being frightfully rude. After all, how would I feel if we moved houses and the new neighbors turned up on the sidewalk to look over all our furnishing? I began to turn my bike around. It seemed like my days of gazing at the castle were over. Once the Vanderlinds moved in, I couldn’t exactly show up and stare at their house, no matter how much I felt drawn to it. If I did, the family would probably call the sheriff on me. As I placed a foot on the pedal and began to push down, I heard a voice call out, “Wait there, young lady.” Turning my head, I saw the woman in charge, marching straight toward me. She did not look pleased. “I’m sorry,” I blurted, unconsciously rolling the bike a little with my foot to keep some distance between us. “I just liked coming by to watch while they were building the castle. I won’t come by anymore,” I assured her. “Do you live in this town?” the woman asked, stopping several yards away from me and waving a hand through the air toward the general direction of Tiburon. “Yes,” I told her, rather hesitantly. “I live in Tiburon.” I wondered if she even knew our town’s name. Something told me she hadn’t bothered to commit it to memory. “Do you like it here?” she asked. From her appearance and her association with the Hungarian castle, I had expected her to speak with a foreign accent, but besides sounding a little formal, she had none. “Um... “It wasn’t a question I had given any great consideration. “Yes. I do like it here,” I said, inching my bike a bit further down the recently paved road. I wasn’t comfortable under the woman’s intense gaze. “And the castle interests you?” she asked, continuing in her questioning. “Yes,” I admitted. “I think it’s fascinating. But, you don’t have to worry. I won’t come by anymore, now that the family is about to arrive. I promise.” I put a hand to my cheek, my face feeling hot under her scrutiny. A tight smile curled the corners of the woman’s mouth. “Would you like to work in the castle?” she asked. “Pardon?” Now she had really caught my attention. “I asked if you would like to work at the castle,” she said, the smile quickly fading and an edge of impatience creeping into her voice. After thinking about it a moment, I said, “Yes, I would like to work at the castle. But I’m not sure what I’m qualified to do.” The woman looked me over from head to toe. “You are very much the kind of young lady I would like to have working at Vanderlind Castle.” “Thank you,” I told her. “And as it happens, I am looking for work as soon as school lets out for the summer. But I’m not sure of what kind of workers you are hoping to find.” “You could work as a housemaid,” she said, “I would have to train you, of course. But I’m sure you’ve cleaned house for your mother, or perhaps an elderly neighbor who was ill. Of course, at the castle we have very exacting standards.” I nodded, my stomach doing a flip. Did this dour-looking woman really mean to offer me a job at the castle that I’d been obsessing over for months? Did she really mean I would get to go inside and look at all the pretty things as I dusted and scrubbed them? I couldn’t imagine any kind of work that I would like better. Trying not to squirm with excitement, I said, “Of course.” “My name is Mrs. Denkler,” the lady told me. “I’m the housekeeper for the castle and I do all the staff hiring.” “How do you do?” I said in reply. “I am Colette Gibson. It’s very nice to meet you.” Mrs. Denkler tilted her head to one side and looked me over some more. “Do you know any other young ladies like you, who might be looking for work as a housemaid?” “My sister is also looking for a job,” I told her, sounding way too eager. “She was just let go from Zucker’s.” I immediately wished I hadn’t mentioned the general store, so I hastily added, “But that was because Mrs. Zucker’s cousin is taking the job. Not because Lilly isn’t a good worker.” The castle’s housekeeper raised her eyebrows slightly. “Your sister?” she asked. “Does she look anything like you?” “Oh, yes,” I told her. “People can always tell we’re sisters. Although she has nicer hair,” I felt the need to say for no good reason, self consciously sliding a hand over my own unruly locks. “Your hair is lovely,” Mrs. Denkler said. The sun was starting to set and it made her eyes glitter. “You remind me of the Empress Elisabeth, poor child.” For a moment, I thought she pitied me for my wild mane, but then she added, “She was stabbed to death by an anarchist, you know.” “Oh,” I exclaimed, but then I could think of nothing else to say. I didn’t know who she meant and I wasn’t quite sure what an anarchist was. “Come by tomorrow,” Mrs. Denkler told me. “You may knock at the door around to the right, closest to the river. Tell whoever lets you in that you have an appointment to see me.” “It will have to be after school,” I told her. “We haven’t been let out for the summer yet.” “That’s fine,” Mrs. Denkler said, turning to return to her duties. “Just come by as early as you can. And be sure to bring your sister.” I practically flew home, I was so excited. After I walked in the door and gave Mama a kiss, she told me that Lilly was in our room. I took the stairs two at a time. I wanted to tell the news to my sister first before we surprised Mama and Papa. “Lettie!” Lilly exclaimed, leaping up from her bed as soon as I entered the room. “I have wonderful news.” “You do?” I asked, momentarily thrown off. I was so caught up in my own news it was hard to change gears. “Well, I have news first, and you’re never going to believe it.” “Let me tell first,” Lilly said. “I’ve been waiting for hours for you to get home.” She was bubbling with excitement and so was I. I gripped her hands and we both started to giggle. “Okay, you first,” I told her, “but tell it quick because I’m about to burst.” “We’ve been invited to a dance in Mansfield,” she blurted. “And there’s going to be a swing band and everything.” “Oh.” I wasn’t exactly sure what she meant by “we’ve” been invited. She was grinning from ear to ear. I didn’t want pour cold water on her excitement, so I hedged for more information by saying, “Walter invited you?” “No, not exactly,” she said, looking a little sly. “It’s Lev who can get the tickets. But he’s allowed to have four, so he thought it would be fun for the four of us to go.” “You mean you’re going on a double date with Lev and another girl,” I insisted. Lilly’s face fell. “Don’t you want to hear a swing band?” “Sure,” I said with a shrug. “But I can do that on the radio.” “I mean don’t you want to see and hear a swing band? Lev is a great dancer,” she assured me. “Right.” I shook my head a little. “I suppose he told you that himself.” “Come on, Lettie,” she said. “You know Mama and Papa won’t let me go unless you’re with me. Please?” My sister’s face was aglow with excitement, probably at the thought of Walter holding her in his arms under the guise of dancing. But the thought of Lev Wilson having his arms around me made me cringe. I didn’t care if he was a good dancer; there was just something about him that made me want to run a mile in the opposite direction. “You have to let me know now,” Lilly insisted, “because Lev needs to know if he should take the tickets.” It sounded like an evening to dread. “When is it?” I asked. “Next month,” she told me, beaming with anticipation. “Doesn’t that leave plenty of time for Lev to find a date with another girl?” I asked. “I mean, aren’t there dozens of young women lining up just hoping he’ll give them the time of day?” My sister put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “Do you really expect me to be excited by your good news when you act this way?” “But my news is actually good news,” I insisted. Chapter 20 Jessie “Stop being such a prig,” Daniel said. “This will be our last glimpse of culture before we’re lost in the jungles of Borneo.” I looked at the line of girls, all in various stages of undress with their negligees showing. “I’m not sure I’d refer to a brothel in New York as culture,” I told him in a low voice, so that the girls couldn’t hear. I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. “At least it’s a Manhattan brothel,” was my brother’s reply. “Just imagine the state of the girls in small town Ohio.” He gave an affected shudder. “I don’t know what Grandfather was thinking. If he was still around, I’d probably try to stake him myself.” We’d arrived in New York with no more trouble. Mrs. Denkler was sent on ahead to oversee the preparations of the house while the family stayed in New York for a few extra weeks. One evening Daniel asked me to head out to see the sights. I hadn’t realized that by “sights” my brother had meant the seedy underbelly of the city. In his defense, vice was often the only mortal activities that went on in the middle of the night. “Just choose one, for pity sake,” Daniel snarled. “You don’t have to feed off of her if you don’t want to.” I didn’t want to feed off of any of the girls. Or, more truthfully, I desperately wanted to suck the life out of every single one of them, but openly admitting that urge was appalling to me. As expected, New York was infested with vampires. The Vanderlind name carried some weight in undead circles, so we were welcomed to the city with open arms. Everyone was appalled to hear of the fate of our patriarch. There was even some discussion of setting up a search party, or taking revenge on the mortals who had thrown him overboard. But mother insisted that she had seen him with a stake in his chest as he fell over the side. “Otherwise he would have simply flown away,” she pointed out. And to those vampires hot for revenge, she settled them by saying, “I knew my father best and he wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to put his immortality at risk to avenge his own foolishness. He knew the risk he was taking when he let that young man into his cabin.” There was ample blood available for us to consume, which brought me great relief. I had barely been clinging to the threads of sanity when a porter finally summoned up the nerve to tell me that I must vacate my cabin and leave the ship. Mrs. Denkler’s generosity had enabled me to save most of the second pint of blood I had concealed in my valise. Before disembarking the ship, I downed the entire bottle so that I would have enough fortitude to make it through customs. When we were offered refreshment at the house where we were to stay, I didn’t ask how the blood had been obtained. I just gulped it down, feeling grateful that I hadn’t done anyone an injury during the crossing. And that I hadn’t ended up alongside Grandfather at the bottom of the Atlantic. “You’re stalling,” Daniel said, jolting me out of my reverie. “If I’d known you were going to be such a prude, I would have come by myself and left you to rot with Mother’s stuffy friends.” It was true, our host and hostess were not the most modern of people. But they had been members of the undead for over two hundred years, so I found it excusable that they hadn’t exactly stayed current with the times. Spending another evening listening to stories about the death of Casanova was quickly losing its appeal. But I would have preferred that to a whore house. I’d never lain with a woman, even though I was as eager as the next seventeen years old fellow. Somehow the thought of a prostitute threw cold water on my desire. They all looked so world weary, even though some of the young women couldn’t have been much older than me. There was a dullness in their eyes that spoke of a numbing of the soul. As a mortal, I had dreamed that my first time would be with my wife, whoever she might be. But I had also dreamed that I would be allowed to marry for love and not to increase the family fortune. Or extend our bloodline. “Oh, for crying out loud,” Daniel grumbled. Striding over to the group of young women who were putting their wares on display, he plucked a girl out of the line. “Here,” he said, grabbing her by the arm. “She looks about your speed,” he said, shoving her in my direction. The girl took a few stumbling steps and then fell into my arms. She looked up at me with large, luminous blue eyes and said, “I’m sorry. Pardon me.” I helped her to her feet, unable to avoid noticing that she was quite lovely, like a pale flower in the moonlight. “It’s not a problem,” I assured her. “Are you alright?” “Yes,” she said, in a half whisper, blinking rapidly. “And I am happy to go with you. I’m happy to do whatever you ask. But you’ll have to be patient with me, sir, because…” She turned her head away from me to conceal her embarrassment and shame. “This is my first time,” she said in a voice that carried a small tremble. My first impulse was to protect her. I wanted to take her in my arms and fly away from there to someplace safe and clean. But then she leaned into me, as if a little unsure on her feet, placing a hand on my chest. I could smell the men on her. And not just from a night of customers, but days and days of sweaty sailors and straying husbands climbing on top of her and partaking of the service she provided. The main room of the bordello was illuminated by only one lamp and that light was covered with a red scarf. It was intended to look like part of the atmosphere, but I suspected it was mostly to make the girls appear a little younger and a little less worn than they would in the daylight. “I’m ready,” the girl told me, tentatively taking my hand. “As long as you promise to be gentle.” Using my night vision, I could see that she wasn’t actually a young girl at all. She wore her hair in a girlish style and she had a petite figure, but I would have placed her age closer to twenty-seven than seventeen. Sensing my hesitation, the young woman tugged on my arm again. “Don’t be bashful,” she told me. “We can experience this new adventure together.” “No, that’s okay,” I told her, gently disengaging my arm. “I wouldn’t want to turn anyone from a fresh flower to a soiled dove. Although I appreciate your willingness.” “You don’t want to share your first time with me?” she asked, somewhat surprised. Her innocence routine had obviously not been questioned too many times before. “No thank you,” I told her and then pressed a half-dollar into her palm. “I think you should probably leave this place while you still have your health.” “Oh, if only I could,” she said, allowing tears to fill her eyes. “But I have nowhere else to go. And no one to be kind to me.” “I’m sorry to hear of your troubles,” I told her, pressing another half dollar into her palm, “but I am not the right man for you.” I sensed she was about to continue to give me her damsel in distress routine, so I fixed her with my eyes and said, “Trust me when I tell you that I am not a person whom you would want to know more intimately. Now please leave me alone.” She stared at me for several seconds, not moving or even blinking, before saying, “I understand. And wish you an enjoyable evening.” Then she turned and quickly hurried out of the room. Daniel made a sound of disgust. “I don’t have all night to dawdle while you act fussy,” he told me. Grabbing a voluptuous red head by the wrist, he began towing her down the hall. “Wait for me, once you’re finished,” he called over his shoulder. “I might go back for seconds.” “I’m sorry about Crystal,” the Madame said, stepping forward. The older lady had her hair piled high on her head and she had painted a red circle on each cheek as a substitute for any kind of blush reflex. “She’s new to our establishment and maybe a little too untested for your liking. But I’m sure we have plenty of girls who can please you,” she said, indicating the females like a butcher displaying a case full of meat. Glancing down the line of women and girls, I spied one female who had withdrawn into the corner, furthest away from the lamp. She was older than the others and standing at a peculiar angle that spoke of suppressed pain. I could tell just from looking at her that she was unwell. She’d done her best to cover her malady with plenty of rouge and powder, but I could detect her sallow skin underneath. Noticing my glance, the Madame perked up. “Has someone caught your eye?” she asked. “Yes,” I told her. “I’d be happy to get to know the young woman in the corner a little better.” The Madame frowned. “Are you sure?” she asked, arching an eyebrow in my direction. “Bernadette has been unwell lately, so maybe you might be happier with a different girl.” “No,” I told her with a polite smile. “Bernadette will suit me just fine.” The older woman shrugged. “You know your own mind, young man,” she said, then snapped her fingers at the female in the corner. “Bernadette,” she called. “Somebody give her a shove.” Another girl goosed her and Bernadette’s eyes fluttered. “Bernadette, you have a customer.” “Oh,” the woman said. “Oh, good. And such a handsome man to take an interest in me.” I could tell by the way she moved across the room that she was in immense pain, but she tried to carry it off as if she wasn’t. Bernadette did her best not to hobble as she led me down a dark passageway to the rooms where the girls plied their trade. Someone, presumably the Madame, had been burning incense to cover the stench of unwashed sheets and human misery. I had to wonder, if this was a high-class whorehouse, what were the low-class whorehouses like? The thought made me shudder. Mistaking my actions for trembling, Bernadette squeezed my arm. “Don’t worry, sweetie,” she said. “I’m not going to judge you. You can be as quick as you like.” Chapter 21 Colette Our mother picked us up from school the next afternoon and drove us out to the castle. “It doesn’t seem right for you girls to arrive on bicycles,” she said, “when applying for work in such a fancy home.” Lilly and I did our best to clean up in the back of the car while Mama drove. I was so nervous I was practically shaking. We were going to go inside the castle. Sure, it was only the servants’ entrance, but still, we would be inside. I should have been tired because I kept waking up all night with crazy, and wonderful, and frightening dreams, but I was too excited to feel tired. In fact, all day at school I was practically bouncing off the walls. As we drove up to the castle, I was surprised to see a gate was being erected around the building. I guess that was probably to keep the family’s vicious dogs from running wild. I hadn’t said anything to my family about the dogs. I didn’t want to risk that my parents would refuse to let us work at the castle, just because of some unruly pets. The Vanderlind family must have recently moved in because there was already a guard in purple livery attending the area where I assumed they would eventually erect the gate. “Yes?” he asked. He had a heavy accent that I couldn’t identify, so the word came out more like, “Ves?” My mother stared at him for a moment, not sure what to say and then eventually found her tongue. “My daughters were asked to come by today to apply for positions as maids,” she said. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was feeling a little intimidated. “Mrs. Denkler,” I called from the back seat. “We were invited here by a Mrs. Denkler.” The guard’s face registered immediate recognition of the name. “Drive through,” he told Mama in a somber voice. “Go to the right. Knock on the door for deliveries.” Once Mama had parked the car, Lilly and I climbed out and straightened our skirts. “Just remember to be polite,” Mama instructed us. “And be honest about your work experience. I’m sure they would appreciate honesty above anything else.” We both assured her that we would. As we approached the door with the deliveries sign posted on it, Lilly suddenly turned around and took a few quick steps back toward the car. “Mama, aren’t you going in with us?” Her voice had gone up an octave and she suddenly sounded about ten years old. “No,” our mother said, shaking her head a little. “You’re both old enough to apply for a job without me standing over you like a mother hen.” But then she looked at Lilly’s anxious face and added. “It’ll be okay, Lilly. I’m sure everything is going to be fine.” “Why did I let you talk me into this?” Lilly said in a low voice as we both stood in front of the door. “Aren’t you excited?” I asked, confused by her behavior. I was practically jumping up and down. “No,” she said, emphasizing the word by shaking her head rather adamantly. “I was a little excited, when we told Mama and Papa, but I don’t know…” she said, her words trailing off. “It’s just… I just have this horrible feeling of dread. Like we’re going to go into this ugly old building and never come out again.” “Oh, come on, Lilly.” I silently thanked my lucky stars that I hadn’t mention the dogs or I would have never gotten her out of the car. “Mama’s waiting for us right outside the door. I think she’d call the police if we didn’t show up after a couple of hours.” “I know,” Lilly said. “But…” “But what?” I asked, extending my hand to ring the bell. “Wait,” she said, grabbing my arm. “I’m sorry, Colette, but I really don’t want to do this.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her. “Of course we’re going to do this. We need the work. And I hear the castle pay is better than we could get anywhere else. I’m sure it’s much better than what you were getting at Zucker’s.” “I know, but…” I had never known my sister to be a shrinking violet, but there was a tremble in her voice. For whatever reason, she was extremely reluctant to go inside. “Come on, Lilly,” I said, putting my arms around her and giving her a squeeze. “I’m sure it’ll be fine. And if it’s weird, or creepy, or scary at all, we’ll turn right around and leave. I promise.” Lilly didn’t say anything. It was almost as if her feet where frozen to the ground. “Tell you what,” I said, desperate to get her moving. “If you do this for me, then I’ll agree to go to the dance with Lev next month.” My promise caught her attention. “Really?” she said, shifting her eyes in my direction. “Promise?” “Yes,” I assured her. “If you go inside with me and apply for the job, I promise I will chaperone you and Walter under the guise of being Lev’s date.” Some color came back to Lilly’s cheeks. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll go inside. But I don’t promise I’ll take the job.” I reached over and rang the bell. A few moments later the door was opened by a young woman with a friendly face and fair hair that was pulled back into a bun. She was wearing a black dress and a frilly white apron. “Yes?” she asked with a smile. “Hello,” I said. “Mrs. Denkler is expecting us.” “Oh.” She smiled some more. “Are you here about the housemaid positions?” “Yes?” I returned her smile and nodded my head several times. She opened the door wider. “Come on in,” she told us. “I’m Millie. I just started working here, so if you have any questions, don’t ask me,” she said with a laugh. I felt a shiver run through me as I stepped over the threshold and into the castle. I don’t know why, we were simply entering a dark hallway which led to a mudroom, but something about just being inside the building, filled me with a tingling anticipation. As we followed the young maid through the mudroom and down another hall. I tried to keep a little ahead of Lilly, in case we were set upon by a pack of unruly dogs. But we were not assaulted. We simply entered a modest room that contained a small couch, a desk and a few chairs. “Wait here,” the young woman told us. “I’ll go and find Mrs. Denkler.” Neither of us felt comfortable enough to sit down. So we stood there, feeling awkward. “She seems nice,” Lilly eventually said, probably only to break the silence. “Very,” I said, just to say something in reply. “Sorry about being so silly outside. I just felt such a wave of dread. It was like nothing I’d ever experienced before,” my sister told me. “It’s okay.” I reached over and squeezed her arm. “Maybe your lunch didn’t agree with you.” This made her giggle, which made me giggle. We tried to suppress our mirth, but then we’d look at each other and start snickering again. I knew it wouldn’t be a good idea for us to titter our way through a job interview, but I was just so nervous that I couldn’t help myself. Just then the door opened and Mrs. Denkler entered the room. We both stopped giggling immediately. In my excitement to see the inside of the castle, I’d forgotten how intimidating the housekeep actually was. “I was expecting you earlier,” was the first thing Mrs. Denkler said. “We were at school,” I told her. “But classes end after next week.” “And will both of you be returning to school in the fall?” she wanted to know. “My sister, Lillian, is graduating,” I said, gesturing to her by way of introduction, “but I have one year left.” “I suppose if you had a job that paid you well enough, you wouldn’t feel the need to return,” Mrs. Denkler said. It was more of a statement than a question, so I said nothing, even though I had every intention of returning to school in the fall for my senior year. The housekeeper looked me over from head to toe. “It’s so very important when running a great house like the Vanderlind household to hire the right kind of staff,” she said. “Some housekeepers advise to only hire plain girls. Especially when the family has sons to consider.” I couldn’t tell if she was trying to insult me or pay me a compliment. “And yet still I am tempted,” she said, putting a finger to her lips and staring at me intently. “I can’t help but noticed the resemblance” she murmured, half to herself. “It’s quite striking. Especially the hair.” She made a gesture as if she was about to reach over and touch my head, but then she thought better of it and retracted her hand. Lilly glanced over at me and I tried not to return her look. I so very desperately wanted to see the entire interior of the castle and working there seemed like the very best way to accomplish that dream. “I wonder if anyone will notice but me,” Mrs. Denkler said, biting the side of her lower lip and then immediately releasing it. “If the master was still alive, I am sure he would see it in an instant. But we were of that age.” She looked very sad for a moment and I thought I saw tears brimming in hers eyes. But then she cleared her throat and said, “I doubt anyone else will notice.” And then she asked me, “I don’t suppose you have any Hungarian blood?” I wanted the job so desperately that I almost blurted, “Yes, we have,” but then I remembered how our mother had instructed us to be honest, so instead I said, “Not that I know of.” “It’s a pity,” Mrs. Denkler said with another sniff. “That would have at least explained it.” I still had no idea what she was talking about so I just smiled and gave her a nod. And then the housekeeper thought of something. She looked deeply into my eyes. “Do you ever have dreams that are not your own?” she asked. “Do you have glimpsed memories that don’t seem to belong to you?” “Uh… No,” I replied, truthfully. Her line of questioning was starting to make me feel unsettled. Turning her sharp eyes on my sister, the housekeeper said, “Your name is Lillian Gibson, I presume. The resemblance is not as strong in you.” “I’m Lilly Gibson,” my sister managed to say. “How do you do?” “I’m Mrs. Denkler,” was the housekeeper’s response. “You will be issued two uniforms and four aprons each. You are expected to take care of your own uniforms and your appearance should always be flawless,” she informed us. “Now, if you don’t have any questions, “I’ll summon Millicent to show you your duties.” My stomach did a flip. “You mean you’re hiring us?” I stammered. “You can start the Monday after your school ends next week,” the housekeeper said. “But don’t you want to ask us any questions?” Lilly wanted to know. “About our past work experience or… anything?” That’s what we had been expecting, at least. “I’m sure your duties will not be too much for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, her lips drawn into a tight, flat line. “If they are, you’ll be discharged without a reference.” She pulled a small watch on a chain out of her dress pocket and glanced at it. “I really don’t have time for any more questions. Wait here and Millicent will look after you,” she said, before abruptly turning to leave the room. “Will any of our duties involve caring for the dogs?” I asked, before Mrs. Denkler had a chance to disappear. I desperately wanted the job, but I wasn’t a fool. All of the workers had been so adamant about some type of dangerous animal. I couldn’t expose my sister and myself to the risk of being mauled. The housekeeper gave me a sharp look over her shoulder. “What dogs?” she asked. “I hope you are not the kind of girl who is always asking ridiculous questions.” And then she left before I could assure her that I wasn’t. Lilly and I stared at the door for several seconds after she left and then turned to exchange looks. “I guess we’re hired,” my sister said, appearing as mystified as I felt. “I guess.” It seemed a very odd way to hire someone. “Do you think Millicent is the same Millie that answered the door?” Lilly shrugged. “We’re about to find out.” A few moments later and Millie rushed into the room. “Congratulations,” she exclaimed. “I knew Mrs. Denkler was going to hire you, just as soon as I saw you. I just knew it.” “Thank you,” we said in unison. “Oh, I’m so happy.” She really was beaming. “It will be so nice to have other servants around here who can actually speak English.” Chapter 22 Jessie The room itself was small, but not miniscule. There was a fringed shawl hanging over the window and another across the bed in an attempt to make the place look a little less down-at-the-heels. Another red scarf festooned the globe shade of a lamp which sat on the bedside table. The lamp was electric, but had obviously been converted from oil at some point in the last few decades. Bernadette took the shawl from the bed and draped it over the back of a chair with great care. I could tell at a glance that it had been hand embroidered. Then she eased herself onto the bed. “Is there anything you’d like in particular?” she asked, patting the open spot next to her on the mattress. “Any fantasy you have for your first time?” “Actually,” I said, taking a seat on the room’s only chair, but being careful not to disturb the shawl, “I won’t be joining you. Although I greatly appreciate the offer.” “Oh.” A look crossed Bernadette’s face that I couldn’t interpret. It was either surprise or relief. Possibly both. “Do you like to watch?” she asked, leaning back on the bed slightly and letting one of her hands drift over to her thigh. “Is that what you want?” “Actually, what I really wanted was someone to talk with while I wait for my brother,” I told her. “But please don’t be concerned; I’ll pay you for your time.” “Oh,” she said, sitting up a little. “You’re one of those.” “One of what?” I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral, although feeling slightly offended. “You want my life story, I suppose,” she said, her eyes growing a little angry. “You want to know how I managed to become such a downtrodden whore.” “Not particularly,” I told her. “We don’t have to talk at all, if you don’t want to. We could always play cards for awhile, if you have a pack.” Bernadette gave me half a smile and turned her head to view me out of the corner of her eye. “Cards?” she said. “You want to play cards? That’s a new one.” “We don’t have to play cards,” I told her. “But you said you’d rather not talk and I was trying to think of a way to fill the time.” “You’re too good looking to be in a place like this,” she told me. “I’m sure plenty of girls would give you a tumble for free.” “My brother wanted to come here,” I informed her. “If I’d known what he had in mind, I don’t think I would have joined him. “You a funny fellow?” she asked. “You prefer roughhousing with the boys. Is that it?” “No, I prefer girls,” I assured her, taking in her meaning. “But…” I was about to say too much, then decided I would anyway. “But I’d like to wait for someone special.” This made her smile. And this time it was a full, genuine smile. “You’re a romantic,” she said. “I thought all of your kind had died out defeating the Kaiser.” I smiled back at her, a genuine smile of my own. “I guess there are a few of us left.” Bernadette tried to sit up on the bed in order to speak with me more easily, but something must have twinged in her back because she grimaced and then quickly tried to cover it with another smile. “What’s wrong with your back?” I asked her. “Nothing,” she insisted, sitting up a little taller. I lowered my chin and gave her a steady look, so she shrugged. “Okay, there was this fellow who came in a couple of weeks ago. He got a little rough and now I can’t walk straight.” “Have you seen a doctor?” I asked, rising from the chair and walking over to her. “There’s only one kind of doctor that comes to a whore house,” she told me. “And bad backs aren’t his specialty.” “Would you like to stop working here?” I asked. “I mean, if you could.” She gazed up at me, but still managed to keep her eyelids heavy. “You’re going to save me?” she said, and then suppressed a laugh. “That’s Crystal’s racket, not mine. She’s been saved by not-so-virtuous men a dozen times since she started working here. Although she’s getting a little old for that scam now.” “I can’t save you,” I told her, in all honesty. “I could possibly provide you with the means, but you’d have to save yourself.” She thought this over for a minute. “I wonder…’ she said, half dreamily. But then her eyes cleared. “Nah,” she told me. “It’s a nice thought, but I’m too busted and worn out at this point to even try.” Then, with a sigh, she added, “But you’re a sweet boy for offering.” “I could at least try to fix your back,” I offered. “If you’ll let me.” Bernadette looked me over. “You’re too young to be a doctor. And don’t tell me you’ve got a magic willie.” I couldn’t help but laugh at her crassness. “No, it’s not magic,” I told her. “At least I don’t think it is.” This earned me a laugh in return. “But my grandfather was a scientist of sorts and he made a kind of tincture that I think might help you.” “Tincture?” she repeated. I could tell she was beginning to grow suspicious. “What kind of tincture?” “It’s for pain,” I told her. “And it’ll help you relax so that all your bones and joints can settle back into place.” I was standing quite close to her at this point and suddenly Bernadette looked alarmed. “Thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I need any kind of tincture,” she told me. “In fact, I don’t think I’m your kind of girl at all. You’d probably like Sally. She’s real pretty and I’m sure she’d drink whatever tincture you had in mind.” She tried to get to her feet. \"Why don’t I call for Bruno? He can get her for you.” “Sit down, Bernadette,” I commanded, looking her straight in the eyes. “There’s no need for you to be frightened,” I told her, gazing at her intently. “I’m not going to hurt you.” She smiled with relief, her body instantly relaxing. “That’s good. You frightened me there for a moment. You never know what some men are about.” “Close your eyes and open your mouth,” I instructed her. “Oh. This game,” she said. “I guess there are no true gentlemen left.” But she did as I instructed. Quickly I bared a fang and pierced the tip of my finger. Once a few drops of blood had formed, I placed them on her tongue. “Swallow that.” “What is it?” she asked, even as she was swallowing. A few seconds later she opened her eyes. “How do you feel?” I asked. Bernadette shifted from side to side, and then turned her head right and left a few times. There was a popping sound and then a few, quieter crunching noises. “Oh,” she exclaimed. “Something just shifted.” She placed a hand on the back of her neck. “Something’s different. I can feel it.” I stepped back, allowing her room to stand up. She moved cautiously at first and then with greater freedom. “I haven’t felt this good in years,” she said, giving me an amazed look. “What’s that stuff your grandfather made? He was a genius. You could sell that stuff and make a mint.” “Grandfather had his moments,” I assured her. “But I’m afraid his formula died with him. And that was the last of my supply. There isn’t anymore.” “Oh.” Bernadette looked at me with disbelief. “And you wasted the last of it on me?” “I didn’t waste it,” I assured her. “I shared it with a friend.” She moved around a bit more, testing her back for any residual pain. “That stuff is amazing,” she said. “I thought I was on my way to the grave, but now I feel like I might actually want to live.” “Do you want to live here?” I asked. “Not particularly,” she said with a shrug. “But what’s a working girl to do?” “You could get a little shop and live out of the back,” I suggested. “Maybe you embroider shawls. Maybe you raise chickens and sell the eggs. I bet there are a lot of things you can do.” Bernadette thought it over. “I guess I could give it a try,” she said. “The girls always want me to sew them some fancy flowers and things. And I’ve got a little money saved. Not much, but maybe I could rent a place and get some supplies.” I reached into my pocket and pulled out my billfold. Pulling out several bills, I folded them in half and handed them to her. “Hide this somewhere,” I told her. “Don’t let anyone know I gave it to you or I’m sure someone will try to take it away.” Bernadette gaped at the money for a moment and then concealed it in her clothing. “So you really are trying to save me.” “No,” I shook my head. “I told you before, I can’t save you. I can give you a bit of money to help you get started, but you have to save yourself.” Then I looked deeply into her eyes and held her gaze. “I believe in you, Bernadette.” “I’m glad,” she said, giving me a shy smile. “I think I’m starting to believe in me, too.” Sitting in the lobby again, the Madame came over to see if I was satisfied with Bernadette’s services. “Very satisfied,” I told her. “She’s quite a remarkable person.” The Madame sniffed. “She’s as good as any other whore, I reckon,” I engaged the woman with my eyes. “Bernadette might consider leaving here soon,” I told her. “If she decides to leave, then you will not impede her in any fashion. As a matter of fact, you’ll do whatever is within your power to help her. As you would with any of your girls.” “Of course,” the madam assured me. “I would do that for any of my girls.” I sat waiting for another three-quarters of an hour before Daniel reappeared. He looked smug, like the cat that had just swallowed a dozen canaries, and there was the faint smell of blood about him. Sitting down heavily next to me, he turned to look in my direction and said with a lascivious smile, “Now that was a bit of fun.” I shrugged, not sure what kind of reply he would expect from me. “Have you really never been to a bordello before?” he asked, tilting his head a little to get a better look at me. “No,” I said, in all honesty. I’d never even thought about going to a bordello. “You mean Grandfather never took you to one? Not even when you were mortal?” He seemed very surprised. When it was obvious my answer was still no, Daniel added, “That surprises me. He took me to my first whore house when I was sixteen.” I shrugged again. “Grandfather always did like you more than me,” I pointed out. “True,” Daniel said, and then he closed his eyes, emitting a contented sigh. After a quiet moment, he said, “Do you think Mother had anything to do with it?” “To do with what?” I asked. “Grandfather’s cabin boy.” “To do… how?” I asked, keeping my voice steady, even though inside I felt alarmed. I did not know how Daniel would react if he knew our mother had set up our maker to be discovered and tossed into the ocean. “To do with tempting him with a beautiful cabin boy and then arranging it so he was caught in the act.” I frowned and brought my eyebrows together. “Why would you think that?” “Because when we disembarked, Mother went through customs first,” he said. “And while I was waiting in line, I could see her talking to a wily looking fellow in a checkered suit. So naturally I was curious to know who he was.” I kept my face completely neutral while he spoke, as if listening to any ordinary story. Daniel went on with, “So as I was standing by myself, waiting for you and Emily, I saw that same fellow approach one of the ship’s stewards, and he was obviously looking for someone. A few minutes later, the steward brings forth a cabin boy. The same cabin boy that Grandfather was caught feasting upon.” “What did the man want?” I asked, trying not to sound too curious, but as someone who was simply interested in the story. “He told the boy that some long lost relative of his had died, leaving him a bit of money,” Daniel said with a frown. “You’re kidding,” I exclaimed. “Well… good for him. I’m glad something good happened to him after what he went through.” Daniel frowned some more. “But don’t you think that’s just a bit too much of a coincidence?” he asked. “I mean, he gets bitten on the neck by Grandfather and then magically inherits some money. The whole thing smells of Mother, to me.” “You’re probably right,” I told him. “She’s always had a soft heart. There’s a chance she felt sorry for the boy and set the whole thing up. I can ask her, if you like.” “Don’t worry about it,” Daniel said with a sniff. “Maybe she did and maybe she didn’t. My bet is she had a hand in it, but as long as she only gave him a few thousand, I guess it doesn’t really matter to me.” “Are you ready to go?” I asked, making motions like I was ready to get out of my chair. “Are you really ready to be off this early?” Daniel had to wonder. “I thought you’d probably be up for a second round and here you are, eager to go.” I was eager to go. I wanted to leave in a rather desperate way. And I didn’t just mean the brothel. I wanted out of New York as well. It wasn’t that I was tired of the sights, sounds and smells of a new city, but I wanted to be on my way to Tiburon, Ohio. I had been thinking about it pretty much incessantly since we’d arrived in America, when I could stop thinking about my belly. It wasn’t even homesickness for the castle, as far as I could tell. Something was calling me to that small Ohio town and I couldn’t wait to get there. Chapter 23 Colette “I’m so proud of you girls,” Papa exclaimed, gathering us both in a big bear hug. “Or should I call you young ladies now that you both have jobs and uniforms and everything?” And then he hugged us again. I loved the pipe-tobacco smell of him, although Mama only permitted him to smoke on the porch. “You should see the ballroom,” Lilly said to him. She’d been brimming with excitement, ever since Millie gave us a tour of the castle’s ground floor. “There are cherubs and goddesses painted everywhere, even on the ceiling. I’ve never seen anything so fancy.” Papa nodded, listening intently and beaming at us. “Now that’s something I wish I could see.” “They might have a family day,” Lilly told him, squeezing his hand and then swinging it back and forth. “So that the families of all the local staff can see where they work. At least that’s what Millie said.” Our father chuckled. That was the third time Lilly had mentioned the other maid since we’d told him the news of our new employment. “Sounds like Millie is your new best friend.” “You should see the library,” Lilly went on. “It’s a huge room with all this gold trim. And books stacked as high as the sky. I think the Vanderlinds probably have more books than the Tiburon Library and I’m not exaggerating. Lettie was over the moon.” “They might let you borrow some,” our father said, stroking my hair. “I’ve heard that the great houses of Europe frequently encourage their staff to borrow books from their libraries, if they have any interest.” Our tour of the castle had been so wonderful, it was almost dizzying. Every room was grander than the last. And we’d only toured the ground floor. “Downstairs maids are never allowed upstairs,” Millie informed us. “Mrs. Denkler is very strict about it.” “Are any of the upstairs maids allowed downstairs?” Lilly asked, half jokingly. “They can come down for meals and stuff,” was the reply. “But they all came over from Hungary and don’t really speak any English, so it’s not all that fun when they do.” “Maybe we can learn to speak some Hungarian,” I suggested. “I actually know a few words,” Millie told us. “My grandfather emigrated from there. That’s how I got this job. He walked over to the castle, knocked on the door, and introduced himself.” “What words do you know?” Lilly asked. Millie’s cheeks turned a little red. “Actually, most of the words I know aren’t appropriate for polite company,” she said in a low voice, and then giggled. “I guess by the time you get to the third generation, that’s all anyone remembers.” Lilly and Millie got on like a house on fire, but I was too busy thinking to pay attention to most of the chatter. Mrs. Denkler was such a peculiar lady and the way she looked at me made me uncomfortable. “Papa, who was Empress Elisabeth?” I asked when Lilly paused for breath. “I’m not sure.” Our father frowned a little and then smiled. “That seems a question out of the blue.” “It’s the reason we got the jobs,” Lilly told him. “The housekeeper thinks that Lettie looks like some royal lady who was stabbed by an anarchist.” “Oh.” Papa’s eyebrows rose high on his forehead. And then he laughed. “Well.. that is one of the more peculiar reasons I’ve ever heard for someone being offered a job.” Lilly bounced up and down, clapping her hands. “I can’t wait to tell Walter,” she exclaimed before dashing out of the room. “You don’t seem as excited as your sister,” Papa said, turning his full attention to me. “I’m excited,” I assured him. “Just in a different way.” If I was being honest, Mrs. Denkler’s comments about how I looked like an Empress who had been stabbed to death unsettled me a little. I’d never found the whole idea of reincarnation very appealing. I was me. I never liked the idea of being anyone but me. Or that I could possibly be just a recycled version of someone who had lived before my time. Chapter 24 Jessie Tiburon was a small town in the middle of Ohio, just like any other small town in America, I had to imagine. But there was something about it that felt so right to me. There was an indefinable magic that hung in the air like pollen on a spring day. Ever since I’d been transformed into a vampire, I found it hard to breathe. — Not that I actually needed to breathe anymore, but I felt a figurative tightness in my chest. — But as we arrived in Tiburon, in a motorcade of black sedans, I felt that tightness begin to dissipate. To my mind, becoming a member of the undead meant the end of my life. But being in Tiburon somehow made me feel like I had the chance to live again. I couldn’t have an ordinary life, but I started to feel that maybe I could somehow find happiness. Or maybe it was just the absence of Grandfather that lifted my spirits. He’d been a black cloud hovering over the family for my entire life. I hated to be the kind of ugly person who was made happier by another person’s demise, but Grandfather was an incredibly difficult man to be around. Plus the knowledge that my beloved sister would not face the same curse of immortality as the rest of us put joy in my heart. When my grandfather was a young man, the Vanderlind Castle was in the country. As he grew into a young man, Budapest also grew, expanding to the point that the castle was on the outskirts of town. By the time I was born, the city had swallowed up the open fields that had always surrounded the castle. Our home had become part of the metropolis. Even though Budapest was a city with many architectural beauties, the castle always looked out of place there. It wasn’t meant to be crowded on all sides by the bustle of urban living. That’s why, when I first caught sight of the castle as we made our midnight arrival in Tiburon, it really resonated with me. The castle appeared at home; more so than it ever had in Budapest. It felt like the structure was meant to be there, majestically standing on the shores of the Tiburon River. It felt like home. “My God,” Daniel exclaimed as we exited the cars. “Grandfather must have really been losing his marbles if he thought putting the castle here was a good idea. I’m surprised he didn’t relocate us to a swamp.” “Stop being such a sourpuss, Daniel,” our mother gently chided him. “You might find that you grow to appreciate country living.” My brother made a little snorting sound through his nose. “I know I’m immortal, but I doubt I’ll ever live that long.” Mrs. Denkler was there to greet us bearing three glasses of refreshment on a tray. I don’t know how she managed to arrange for the blood already. I hoped it wasn’t through anything unsavory. But the Vanderlind housekeeper was as fastidious as she was well-mannered. I somehow doubted that she would do anything illegal. “The house is almost completely ready,” she informed us, once we exchanged the most minimal of greetings. “Except for the chandeliers in the great hall. There have been some challenges there and I’m afraid they have yet to be hung.” “That’s quite alright, Mrs. Denkler,” our mother told her. “I have the foreman’s promise that they’ll be in place by tomorrow afternoon,” the housekeeper insisted. “That’s fine,” Mother said, trying to reassure her. “We’re just excited to be home.” Mrs. Denkler stepped out of the way so that she could gesture toward the front door. “Welcome back to your home.” It was so strange to wander the rooms of the castle, seeing each thing exactly in its place, as it had been back in Budapest. Mrs. Denkler must have had a photographic memory to been so exact. I only found the smallest of indiscretions as far as replicating the exact setup of our home. A few shirts that I liked to keep in a drawer had been hung up in the closet, and my cufflinks and shirt studs were in the wrong box. But that was all I could find. It was remarkable. Was Mrs. Denkler really that familiar with the intimacies of my room? That surprised me. Or maybe she was just incredibly intuitive. As dawn broke over Tiburon, I lay down on my bed, hoping to lose myself to a few hours of oblivion,— I had not yet accustomed myself to sleeping in a coffin — but rest did not come to me. I felt a great anticipation deep in my belly and the sensation prevented me from being able to lie quietly. I rolled around on the bed for a few hours, even attempting the first chapter of several books, before getting up and dressing. One of the benefits of the castle was its noticeable lack of windows. A member of the undead could climb from his coffin at midnight or at high noon and still have no fear of shriveling in the sun. I could hear a bit of commotion coming from downstairs, so I wandered down to see what was causing the hubbub. It was a dozen workmen in the great hall trying to suspend one of the enormous chandeliers that some relative had seen fit to purchase for the castle. Each chandelier was bedecked with over a thousand leaded crystals, which made the fixtures enormously heavy. The men had assembled scaffolding and a pulley system to hoist the chandelier up, inch-by-inch, to the vaulted ceiling. I didn’t envy them their task, but it was a marvel to watch. Many members of the castle’s staff were standing around the edges of the room in order to take in the spectacle. I strolled across the polished stone floor with my eyes glued to the dangling crystals of the chandelier. They were all singing as they swayed and clinked together. Their music caused me a pang of sadness. I would never again see the scores of rainbows created by the prisms when they were caught in direct sunlight. I heard a small gasp. It was like a whisper being carried by the wind. I turned my eyes to see a beautiful young woman with tresses of dark hair spilling around her shoulder. And then my world fell away. I could see nothing and no one but her. It was as if my world had been blank and this girl appeared to fill it. She was dressed in black with a white apron. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew her clothing was significant, but somehow that didn’t matter. Somehow, deep inside of me, I knew we were meant to be together. And she was looking at me too. Her eyes were glued to me and she wore the most astonished expression on her face. She opened her mouth and I thought she might speak to me, but then she looked up and started to scream. I had been so captivated by the beautiful creature standing before me that I didn’t realize the workmen had somehow lost control of the massive chandelier. It was crashing toward the ground, heading for the very spot on which I stood. If it hadn’t been for my lightning fast undead reflexes and my incredible ability to heal, I would have been squashed like a bug under a barman’s boot. Even still, I was knocked to the ground. The young woman came running toward me. “Somebody call a doctor!” Pointing toward one of the footmen, she commanded, “Call a doctor this instant,” as if she was the mistress of the castle. Kneeling down, she took my hand. The mere touch of her skin made me feel like my heart had started beating again. “Don’t move,” she said, in a voice that was so lovely it made me shiver. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” I told her, unable to tear my eyes away from her face. “You’re not fine,” she insisted. “You just had a massive chandelier nearly crush you. You’re lucky to still be alive.” “Very lucky,” I whispered, looking deep into her eyes of emerald green. “Because it allowed me to meet you.” She laid her hand to her cheek and shook her head a little. “Oh, how can you flirt at a time like this? I think you must be in shock.” She scanned my body with an assessing eye. “I hope you don’t have any internal injuries.” “I’m fine,” I insisted, trying to untangle myself from the giant arms of the chandelier. “Perhaps a twisted ankle, but that’s all.” My ankle felt fine, but I thought it would be too peculiar if I suffered no injuries at all. “I don’t think you should try to get up,” she told me, pressing her hands gently against my chest to try to coax me back onto the floor. “The doctor will be here soon, I’m sure.” I lay back for a moment, toying with the idea of allowing her to tend to me for a little while longer. But I knew that plan was ungentlemanly, so I decided it was better to get to my feet. “I promise you I am not injured,” I told her. “But perhaps you could be good enough to assist me to a chair.” “Yes, of course,” she said. As she said, put an arm around me to help me to my feet, I felt a moment of sheer happiness. “What is your name?” I asked as she helped me to a small loveseat. Once I was seated, she tried to pull away, but I held onto her hands so that she was forced to take the seat next to me. “Colette Gibson,” she told me. “But most people call me Lettie.” “Colette Gibson,” I said, tasting the words in my mouth. “It’s a great pleasure to meet you, Miss Colette Gibson,” I told her. “I’m Jessie Vanderlind.” “Vander…” The girl gulped. “It’s very nice to meet you, Mr. Jessie Vanderlind.” Then she added, “But I’m horribly concerned that you’re injured. Are you sure you’re not feeling any discomfort?” she asked, her lovely brow furrowing slightly. “I feel wonderful,” I assured her. “If I wanted to, I’m sure I could fly.” Chapter 25 Colette The week before school let out was excruciatingly long for me. I wasn’t even sure how I got through my final exams. In between studying, I looked up the Empress Elisabeth in an encyclopedia at the school library. It took a little research, but I finally managed to find a photograph of the Empress of Austria, who was also the Queen of Hungary. It was a snapshot of her on her coronation day, back in 1867. She was a beautiful young woman with a curvy figure. Her neck and hands were dripping with pearls and other extravagant jewelry. Her hair appeared to be dark brown in color and she had an abundant amount of it. But beyond the hair, I wasn’t sure how much the Empress and I shared in appearance. She was very beautiful, but she also looked a little forlorn as she gazed into the lens of the camera. Her eyes appeared plaintiff and solemn. It wasn’t how I imagined a person would look after just having a crown of diamonds and pearls placed on her head. I thought I might be a little happier about it. But then the encyclopedia went on to explain that she didn’t have a very happy life. And it turned out that the anarchist stabbed her simply because he had missed the opportunity to stab a Duke who claimed to be an heir to the French throne. He vowed to stab the next royal he encountered. Elisabeth was that unfortunately soul. Even staring at her photograph, I felt no connection to her. At least not in the way that Mrs. Denkler had implied. If anything, I felt a little sorry for her, as much as a cat can feel sorry for a king. No, I was positive there was no connection beyond that. I had to conclude that the whole concept of reincarnation was simply hogwash. Finally, after what felt like an excruciatingly long week, it was Lily and my first day as housemaids at the castle. We’d each been issued two black dressed as our uniforms. Mama had pinned and tucked them until they fit us perfectly. Lilly spent an extensive amount of time trying to tame my wild hair. The Empress probably was able to afford a personal hairstylist because her excessively long and quite curly hair had looked perfect for her coronation day. Mine just ended up barely staying piled on my head with a few dozen hairpins. Both Papa and Mama drove us out to the castle to drop us off for our first day at the castle. Papa brought along his camera and stopped the car on the long driveway, just outside the gate. “I want you to know I’m very proud of you girls,” he said as he positioned us so that he could make a photo with the castle in the background. “I’m sure this Mrs. Denkler has hired many a young woman to work at the castle in her day. And with the way the economy is, I’m sure there was more than one woman with experience who applied for the position.” Lilly and I stood still, and very close to each other, so he could make the photograph. “She must have seen something in the two of you,” Papa went on. “She must have sensed that you are proper young ladies and that you will do the Vanderlind Castle justice.” He cleared his throat. “And I hope you remember…’ “Okay, I think that’s enough, dear,” Mama said, touching him gently on the arm. “We don’t want the girls to be late. Especially on their first day.” Millie answered the door again when I rang the bell. “You don’t have to ring, sillies,” she said. “You work here now. You can just let yourselves in.” “I guess I just assumed the door would be locked,” I explained, fussing with my hair. Several of the bobby pins were already trying to make their escape. I think their plan was made easier by the excessive amount of hair lotion Lilly had applied. That made it simple for them to slide free. Millie frowned at the door and then looked back at us. “It hasn’t been locked since I started working here.” First thing we did was report to Mrs. Denkler. We found her in the hallway, just outside the kitchen. She looked us both over while fishing her watch from her pocket. Once she was satisfied that we were on time, she snapped the cover closed on the watch and said, “A housemaid’s hair should always be neat and tidy.” “I’m sorry,” I blurted, knowing her comment was aimed at me. “I seem to have put too much lotion in my hair and now it’s decided to rebel. I promise I’ll get it to behave better tomorrow.” Mrs. Denkler eyed my hair one more time before saying, “There are several things you need to know about the Vanderlind family.” She started walking and snapped her fingers at us to let us know we needed to keep pace. “The family keeps late hours,” she said. “They all suffer, to varying degrees, from a rare condition that makes them very vulnerable to the sun.” She glanced back at both of us to make sure that we were being attentive. “Because of this malady, they usually adjust their schedules to sleep most of the day and only get up when the sun is low in the sky or has already set.” That explained why we were told to arrive for work at ten o’clock. It had seemed a late hour to begin the work day. “You may be asked to work later in the evening on some occasions. This is to accommodate the family and we expect you to adjust your personal schedule accordingly.” Lilly and I exchanged glances. Millie mentioned nothing about odd work hours when she showed us around. I had to wonder what Mama and Papa would think. We’d planned on riding our bicycles to work in good weather, but I was sure they wouldn’t let us ride home alone after dark. “There is illness in the family,” Mrs. Denkler went on. “One of the sons, Arthur, suffers from hemophilia. It’s a rare blood disease and he needs blood transfusions several times a day.” “Isn’t that the same disease that the last czar’s little boy suffered from?” I asked. “The son from the Russian royal family who were assassinated during the revolution.” Mrs. Denkler spent a few moments assessing me with her stern eyes. “Yes, I know perfectly well of whom you are speaking and I believe it is similar,” she finally said. “Not much is known about the disease.” She continued walking. “As I was saying, Arthur suffers from hemophilia. Therefore the family is in constant need of blood to keep him alive. We have set up a small clinic in the back of the castle,” she informed us. “You can tell your friends and family, that if any of them care to donate a pint of blood, they will receive two dollars, a sandwich and some apple juice or coffee for their troubles.” Lilly and I exchanged another look. Two dollars was a full day’s pay for many people. We would both be earning just over three dollars for a full day’s work at the castle and those were considered excellent wages for untrained labor. “I’m sure we know a lot of people who would be happy to help out,” Lilly said, speaking up. “Unless...” She stammered a little. “I mean, is it very painful? Donating blood?” “Not in the least,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “And even if it was, with two dollars in your pocket, I should think most people would be willing to put up with a little pain.” We both nodded, not wanting to annoy her. “Arthur Vanderlind is not to be disturbed under any circumstances,” Mrs. Denkler said, eyeing us both. “Even entering his room is cause for immediate dismissal.” We crossed a large room where several men were hammering together a large piece of scaffolding. “Don’t bother the family at any time, but especially when they are resting. You are never to go upstairs unless directly ordered to do so by me. And you are never to address any member of the Vanderlind family, unless they address you first. Do I make myself clear?” Mrs. Denkler glared at us again. “Yes,” we both said in timid voices. The lady had to be close to seventy, but she was still very formidable. I wouldn’t have crossed her for ten silver dollars. “Besides, it’s not part of your duties to be in the bedrooms,” she said, leading us down a large hallway. “Your work is solely downstairs.” She opened a door and ushered us in. “Oh,” I said with a gasp of excitement. We were back in the library. The wonderful smell of books filled my nostrils. “You’ll get started in here,” she said, producing two feather dusters, seemingly out of nowhere. “Start at one end and work your way to the other. And don’t forget the top shelves, because I’ll check.” She turned to leave, but then paused. “I almost forgot,” she said. “It’s against the rules of the castle for the staff to wear any kind of personal adornment. That means no rings, no bracelets, no pedants, no jewelry of any kind. If I catch you wearing so much as a christening pendant, it’s grounds for immediate dismissal.” I had a silver and crystal pendant that I always wore. It was only about the size of a nickel and not very flashy in any way, but it was the prettiest thing I owned and I loved it. “So you mean something like this...” I began, indicating the pendant. “Is completely unacceptable,” the housekeeper told me. “If I see it around your neck tomorrow, you’ll be fired on the spot.” Then she left the room without another word. We both stood, gazing at the enormous room. It held more books than even a voracious reader could go through in a lifetime. “You must be in heaven,” Lilly murmured. “How are we are going to dust all of these?” I murmured back. Lilly smoothed her apron. “I guess we’ll start in one corner and work our way around,” she said. “It will probably only take seven or eight years.” “Yes,” I agreed with her, “but then the first books will be dusty again.” We both giggled. Then Lilly squared her shoulders and said, “Alright, I guess we’re housemaids now. Let’s get started.” We decided to make a game of it, with Lilly working along one wall and me working along another. They had those rolling ladders like in the Tiburon library, so it was easier to reach the books on the highest shelves. Lilly was much faster at dusting than I was because I wasted a lot of time browsing. I couldn’t help myself; there were so many intriguing titles luring me away from my task. My hair was in open revolt, expelling bobby pins whenever it saw the opportunity. I tried to collect them when they fell, hoping I’d have a chance to pin my tresses back up when we were given a break for lunch. I knew having my hair hanging down would not please Mrs. Denkler, but there was nothing I could do about it for the time being. After we’d been working for a couple of hours, the door to the library opened and Millie came in. “There you are,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere, but this castle is just so big that I kept getting lost.” “What is it?” Lilly asked, climbing down from her ladder. “Are we needed somewhere else? We’re not even half way through in here.” “No, it’s just that they’re hanging the chandeliers in the great hall and I thought you might like to see it,” the other maid told her. This news perked me right up and I descended my ladder immediately. “That’s definitely something I would like to see.” Lilly wasn’t so sure. “Are we allowed to stop working?” she asked. “I’d hate to get in trouble for shirking our duties on the very first day.” “Oh, the Vanderlinds won’t mind,” Millie insisted. “They’re all asleep, anyway. And I’m sure Mrs. Denkler won’t have a problem with it. She’s in there herself.” “Well…” Lilly thought it over. “Oh, come on,” Millie urged. “You have to see how massive these chandeliers are. They’re like the size of a car, with a million prisms hanging off of each one. They’re amazing.” The temptation was too much, so the three of us hurried back to the great hall. I could not believe the amount of scaffolding the men had built in order to raise the chandeliers. Taking into consideration the amount of ropes and pulleys they were using, I wouldn’t have been surprised if someone told me the giant fixtures weighed a thousand pounds each. I guess that was one of the benefits of living in a building constructed out of stone, you could hang heavy things off the ceiling. Millie was right about the chandeliers being magnificent. Even without sunshine lighting up the room, the prisms still practically glowed on their own. They made a delicate music bumping into each other as they swayed back and forth, each suspended from its own small hook. They were so beautiful; I couldn’t imagine owning just one of the little jewels, let alone having an enormous chandelier festooned with them. It looked like the entire staff of the castle was there, mesmerized while watching the first chandelier slowly inching higher and higher toward the vaulted ceiling. That’s why everyone was caught by surprise when one of the Vanderlinds appeared from above stairs and walked to the center of the room, craning his neck so he could take in the show. There was something about the back of the young man’s head that drew my attention. He was tall and well-formed with dark hair that was ruffled on top, as if he’d just gotten up after tossing and turning in bed for a few hours. He was dressed in a crisp white shirt and gray flannel pants that were obviously tailor made to fit him perfectly. One of the workmen hit a snag in the rope he was using to help hoist the chandelier. He called out a few words in a language that I didn’t understand. Some of the men stopped pulling on their ropes and others began pulling rather frantically. The chandelier began to sway harder and it tilted to the side. “Oh,” I exclaimed. I didn’t know what they were going to do to straighten it out. And I didn’t know how they were going to clean the chandeliers once they attached them to the vaulted ceiling. I glanced back down again and got the surprise of my life. The young man was looking directly at me. Suddenly I found it hard to breathe. His face was just so beautiful, with stormy gray eyes, pale skin and full lips. I felt like he wasn’t just looking at me, but that he was seeing into my very soul. Thousands of little shivers ran up my spine as I finally put a face to the young man who had been haunting my dreams. When I realized this, my mouth popped open. I wanted to speak to him. I wanted to just be with him, to stand by his side. It was like he was the only man in the world and I was the only woman. My fixation with the castle suddenly all made sense. I somehow knew that he would live there. It felt like his heart had called me to him and I was powerless to resist. In another instant I was screaming. The chandelier had somehow broken free from the ropes and pulleys. It was crashing toward the ground. And the young man who had just stolen my heart was standing underneath it. My piercing shriek startled him. He looked up and was only able to throw his arms over his head before the massive chandelier crushed him. Chapter 30 Colette People just stood there. It was as if everyone was waiting for someone else to do something. I had a moment of that myself. I kept thinking, I’m just a maid and this is my first day. Surely someone else will come to his aid. Someone in charge will take command of the crisis. But everyone was acting like they were frozen to the ground. And I couldn’t bear the thought of the poor young man suffering. So I hurried forward, shouting as I ran, “Call a doctor. Somebody call a doctor.” Dropping to my knees, I reached out to clutch his hand. Merely touching him sent a charge through me like I had grabbed a live wire. I’d finally met the man of my dreams and he was probably hemorrhaging internally. The thought made me want to shriek and burst into tears. But I had to be brave for him. If he was going to die, then I had to be there to comfort him during his last moments on earth. He’d stolen my heart and we’d never even have the chance to say hello. “Don’t move,” I said, trying to keep a tremor out of my voice. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” he told me, sitting up. “You can’t be fine,” I insisted. “You just have a giant chandelier drop on your head.” This made him smile. “No, I really am fine,” he assured me. “I think maybe I just wrenched my ankle.” And shockingly, he was fine. I kept expecting him to collapse from internal bleeding, but somehow he’d only twisted his ankle. It was a miracle. My heart sang with joy. I helped him to a loveseat and we both sat there, holding each other’s hand. He introduced himself as Jessie Vanderlind. It was a name I knew I would be whispering in my dreams for the rest of my life. “Mr. Vanderlind,” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed, hurrying over. “I do hope you’re alright.” “Fine,” he said, only glancing briefly in her direction before returning his gaze to me. “Better than fine, in fact.” His eyes were shimmering gray clouds before a sudden spring shower. “I’m so glad to hear that,” the housekeeper said. “It’s quite the relief. I’m afraid in all the commotion, our new housemaid has forgotten her place.” “Her place?” Jessie mused, frowning at where I was sitting, as if he couldn’t quite make out the words Mrs. Denkler was saying to him. “She’s perfectly fine, I should think.” And then he asked me, “Are you comfortable? You’ve had quite a shock. Would you maybe like a glass of water?” I couldn’t believe he was asking about my well being. Of course I was alright. Besides the shock of almost seeing a man crushed to death by a thousand pounds of leaded crystal. And the fact that, in the few seconds between when I’d had first laid eyes on Jessie Vanderlind and when the chandelier had knocked him to the ground, I had fallen in love with him. “Get up, girl,” Mrs. Denkler snapped, grabbing me by the arm and hauling me to my feet. “You should be working, not lounging on a couch, harassing Mr. Vanderlind.” “She wasn’t harassing me,” Jessie insisted. “In fact, I was very much enjoying her company.” Mrs. Denkler pursed her lips together, giving me a fierce look. “Miss Gibson, I think it’s time you got back to work.” She raised her head and looked around the room. “Everyone who wants to keep their job should get back to work immediately.” People started hurrying out of the room. “Come with me, young lady,” the housekeeper snarled, still holding my arm in a vice-like grip. I was marched back to the library, where Lilly was already ensconced, furiously dusting, pretending that she’d been there the entire time. Mrs. Denkler released me, practically thrusting me from her side. “I knew it was a mistake to hire such a pretty girl,” she said. “It always is.” “Please don’t fire me, Mrs. Denkler,” I said. It would have been so humiliating. I didn’t know how I would face my parents. “I promise I won’t goof off ever again. I’m a good worker, I swear.” “I’m not so much worried about your work ethic as I’m worried about you making eyes at the Vanderlind boys. I know they’re rich and handsome, but trust me when I say that boys like that aren’t for the likes of you.” I looked down, feeling like I might burst into tears. She was right. I was being an idiot. Someone like Jessie Vanderlind would never even consider someone like me. He lived in a castle and I worked at the castle. Even when we were in the same room, we were still a million worlds apart. “I know,” I told her, unable to raise my voice much louder than a whisper. “I’m not going to let you go,” Mrs. Denkler said, after giving it some serious thought. “You remind me too much of…” She shook her head. “Well, that is neither here nor there. But I will say this; you are not to speak with Jessie Vanderlind. You are not to flirt with him. You are not to even gaze at him from a distance. If you are cleaning a room and he steps inside it, then you must immediately vacate that room and report directly to me. Do you understand?” “Yes.” “I’m just telling you this for your own good,” she informed me. “You’d think a girl your age would have more sense than you do.” “I understand,” I said, doing my best to keep my voice steady. Mama and Papa hadn’t said anything directly to us, but I’d overheard them talking a few nights ago while they were both drying the dishes. Papa hadn’t had any real work in over two months. The extra money we would be bringing home was really going to help. “I’m lucky to have this job,” I told her. “Yes,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I suppose you are. And I’m happy to let you keep it, just as long as you remember your place. Jessie Vanderlind is a very engaging young man when he wants to be, but just remember what I told you. He is to be left alone. Even if another giant chandelier comes crashing down on his head.” Chapter 26 Jessie I went back to my room and sat down on the bed. It felt like someone had just socked me in the stomach. The world was not fair. That much was obvious. If the world was fair, then I would still be human. That way I would be at liberty to fall in love with Miss Colette Gibson. I could woo her, and win her, and marry her. Then I could take her in my arms and kiss her and not fear that I would lose control and rip out her throat. But the world wasn’t fair. And I could not allow myself to fall in love. I thought about instructing Mrs. Denkler to let the girl go. There would be some kind of compensation, of course, but the smart thing to do would be to bar Colette from the castle. But I somehow couldn’t bring myself to do it. And why should the young woman lose her position just because I found her attractive? But it was more than finding her physically beautiful. The way she rushed to my aid when everyone else was standing and staring spoke of a kind heart, a brave heart. And when she’d clasped my hand, the sensation I’d felt was like nothing I’d ever experienced. It was like nothing I’d ever read about in books. Love at first sight always sounded so foolish to me. You couldn’t fall in love with someone after just looking at them. Love was built on knowing someone and having shared experiences and finding out you had a million little things in common. Love at first sight was just an expression perpetuated by novelists and palm readers. But all of my strongly held convictions about love melted away with the knowledge that a girl like Colette Gibson existed in the world. I said her name over and over again and it was ambrosia in my mouth. I kept playing the few brief moments we had spent together over and over again in my head. It felt like I would never be able to stop thinking about her. I rose from my bed several times to find her and then sat back down again. Seeking Miss Gibson would not be a good idea, but it was as if my body had a mind of its own. Any practical decisions I made were quickly overruled. When would Colette be done working for the day? I was half tempted to ring for Mrs. Denkler to find out. But I instantly knew that was a bad idea. Denkie was very protective of the family. If she sensed that I was unduly attracted to the girl, she would fire her on the spot. No, I had to keep my feelings to myself. I had to find a way to deny them. There was no one in which I could confide. I had to find a way to deny my love all on my own. After an hour of just staring at the wall, there was a gentle knock at my door. “Come in,” I called. In walked my sister. “Hello, brother,” she said, hurrying over and bestowing my cheek with a kiss. “I heard what happened with the chandelier and I wanted to check on you. Are you hurt?” I gave her a quick squeeze, trying not to think about how I had yet to eat that day. “I’m fine,” I assured her. “But I guess it’s fortunate that Grandfather turned me when he did or I would have been squashed like a bug under the heel of a boot.”",

      "content": "We walked for a little while in silence, skirting around the unfinished areas that were still mostly mud. The rose garden was nearing completion, with neat, short hedges making squares and rectangles around each bush. “Our father was speaking with one of the gardeners yesterday,” I said to whoever cared to listen. “Both the plants and the gardeners were shipped over from England.” “I thought this pile of bricks was supposed to be Hungarian or something,” Walter said, trying to revive the jovial mood. “It is. But just not the garden,” I said, glancing over my shoulder at him. That’s when I realized that Walter and my sister had their arms around each other. In an instant I knew that suggesting we all get out of the car was a mistake. Walter and Lilly were just looking for an excuse to find a cozy, dark corner where they could canoodle. Besides going against everything Lilly had told our folks, it would leave me alone with Lev. And who knew where his ideas might lead? I didn’t want to inadvertently put Lev in a situation where he thought kissing me was a good idea. I had to get out of there, and fast. Lev Wilson was not going to be my first kiss, if I had anything to say about it. “Oh, we’d better get going,” I said after pretending to check the time. “Don’t want to be late.” “You don’t need to hurry off that quickly, do you?” Lev said, trying to catch my hand. He must have also been aware of Walter and my sister’s intentions. “We do if we don’t want to get grounded,” I insisted, eluding him by taking a few quick steps. “Our father won’t tolerate any kind of nonsense,” I said, hoping he would catch my double meaning. “Come on, Lettie,” Lilly said, her voice carrying a bit of a whine. “We can stay a few more minutes.” “No, we can’t,” I said, allowing my own voice to carry the firmness of my convictions. I had been foolish to agree to an evening drive to an isolated area, even if my sister was with me. “We need to start heading back to the car,” I told her. “Now.” I loved my sister dearly, but enough was enough. “She’s probably right,” I could hear Walter say as I started walking rather briskly. “It’s time to go. I wouldn’t want your father to dislike me.” Then I heard Lev give a scoffing laugh. Chapter 14 Jessie I couldn’t stop staring at the empty bottles of blood. Who would do such a thing? I couldn’t conceive of what would have motivated a thief to such mischief. Whoever had done it must have known that I was a member of the undead. What other possible reason would they have to break into my cabin and dispose of my only food supply? Getting to New York would be a tremendous test of my self-control and I wasn’t sure if I was up to the challenge. The word “test” made me think of my grandfather. This was just the kind of thing he would set up in order to help me “build character”. He felt that Daniel and I were too soft; that our mother coddled us. He also felt that I was ungrateful for my undead transformation. I looked upon being turned into a vampire as a hardship, but he viewed it as the greatest gift he could bestow on another human. After giving it a bit of thought, I decided that disposing of the blood was probably Grandfather’s way of punishing me for my ingratitude. I quickly became convinced that he had hired someone to break into my cabin and get rid of my food. He probably told the criminal to rob me as well, as a measly cover story. Or maybe that was just something the thief thought up on his own, since he was already in my cabin and pawing through my things. Grandfather apparently did not warn the thief not to open the oversized trunk. Or, knowing my grandfather, he had instructed his minion to search the trunk for some nonexistent item. That would serve the dual purpose of forcing me to take a mortal life and probably save Grandfather the couple of coins he’d promised in payment. Thankfully that last part of the plan was foiled. Hurriedly, I checked my valise and was relieved to find that the two pints I had stashed in there had not been disturbed. That was a small blessing. I was already feeling edgy from not having eaten and I needed to slake my appetite before I attempted to send word to my mother about what had happened. I knew she had packed enough blood so that sharing wouldn’t cause her any hardship. Emily tapped at my door and then let herself in. “We’re going up to dinner soon, if you’d like to join us,” she told me. And then stopped short, catching sight of all the empty bottles. “What happened?” “I don’t know,” I told her. “Someone broke into my room while I was resting and this is what they did.” “But who would do such a thing?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She had walked into my cabin behind my sister. If I had been speaking to my mother, I would have voiced my suspicions. But Denkie was loyal to our family’s patriarch and I knew any words that passed from my lips would go straight to my grandfather’s ears. “I have no idea,” I said. “Someone who didn’t understand that they were putting everyone on this ship in mortal danger, I suppose.” Mrs. Denkler’s mouth twitched. “It will be a test of your fortitude,” she told me. “Would you like me to check the ship’s passenger list to see who is likely to be traveling alone?” Emily gave our housekeeper a startled look. “That won’t be necessary,” I assured her. “I’ll have to think things over, but I might just ask you to get a message to my mother.” I looked between the two of them. “For the moment, let’s just keep this incident to ourselves.” Frowning, Mrs. Denkler said, “Of course.” Was the Vanderlind housekeeper aware of my grandfather’s plan? It seemed very unlikely. I knew Grandfather confided in her about many things, but he was too wily to share this type of plans with a mortal. I took a few, careful pulls of blood from one of the pint bottles. It allowed me to focus on solving my predicament rather than thinking about my hunger or allowing my anger to take control of me. I didn’t want to upset my mother unnecessarily. I knew she would come to the same conclusion I had about the disposed of blood. And she already had an adversarial relationship with her father as it was. None of the passengers would benefit from witnessing two vampires battling on the deck of the ship. Plus, my grandfather was much more powerful. If he truly lost control of his temper, then he might actually stake my mother in the heat of battle. No, the best thing I could do for the health of my family was not mention the loss of my food supply. Vampires could go for days without eating, as long as they were careful. I just had to keep myself away from mortals and ration the blood I had left. It would be necessary for me to not leave my cabin for the rest of the trip, day or night. That would keep me away from temptation and the rest of the ship’s passengers safe from me. At first things went smoothly, I had several good books to keep me occupied. When my sister and Mrs. Denkler came back from dinner, I explained that I definitely did not wish for either of them to communicate my troubles to anyone else in the family. Emily was upset by my decision, but Denkie said, “That’s probably for the best.” Things became more of a struggle once the two of them went to bed. My cabin began to feel claustrophobic, so I moved into our shared room, just for a change of scenery. Even with this transition, I felt almost an irresistible urge to go up on deck. But I knew people were still out and about, plus my hunger was increasing. The last time I had a sip from the open pint, I realized that half the contents was already gone. I knew I had to be more conservative when I fed or I would end up having to tell Mrs. Denkler to chain me in my trunk for the remainder of the voyage. As the hour drew close to midnight, I heard someone tapping at the door. Out of habit, my first impulse was to answer it. But then I remembered the state I was in and immediately withdrew into my cabin. Before I knew what was happening, the little French maid who had been such a charming nuisance the previous evening was letting herself into my room. “Hello?” she said, her cheeks aglow. “You called for more towels?” “No, I didn’t call for towels,” I told her in a tight voice. “And I think it advisable that you leave. Right now.” “Do you really want me to go?” she asked, tucking her chin and looking up at me with large blue eyes that had been rimmed in charcoal. “Yes,” I told her firmly. “That’s why I said it.” “But what about your towels?” she asked, stepping further into my cabin. “I never asked for any damn towels,” I insisted, inching past her and heading for the door. I could smell every fragrance of her body in such a confined space and it was making me drool. “But Monsieur,” she said, reluctantly following me as I led her into the main cabin. “I brought them especially for you.” She stepped very close to me and tilted her head back to look up into my eyes. I wanted to show her to the door, but I couldn’t. She was so young and beautiful, and she smelled so good. Her eyes were wide and innocent, but no one was that naive. She obviously wanted me to kiss her. But kissing wasn’t what I had in mind. At least not a mortal kiss. It would have been so easy just to bend her head to the side and expose the tender flesh of her neck. I felt my stomach give a painful growl at the mere thought of it. “Is there nothing else you want from me, Monsieur?” she asked, blinking her wide blue eyes very slowly. “Nothing at all that I can do for you?” “No,” I told her, and my voice came out like a creaking door. “I’m fine. I appreciate your…” I couldn’t even think of what to say. I cleared my throat. “I appreciate your concern for my comfort, but I think I would… I mean, I think you should just leave. Now. Please,” I gulped. “You do not like me?” she said with a hint of a pout. “No, that’s not it at all,” I assured her. “It’s just…” I was clinging to my humanity by the skin of my teeth. “Maybe you would like to get to know me a little bit better?” she suggested. Her voice turned sultry and her French accent faded away. “That is something that could be arranged.” She glanced down at her bosom and then looked back up at me. “No…” I began to say. And then the French maid did something to seal her fate. She reached forward and placed one of her hands on my chest. “Why not?” That’s when I grabbed her. I couldn’t control myself. A small part of my brain was shouting at her, “No! Get out of here! Run for your very life.” But it was too late for that. The evil that was brewing inside of me took over. I had meant to be so strong, but I was lost. Rather than struggling, the maid melted into my arms. “Oh, Monsieur,” she said with a sigh, her accent suddenly returning. “I do not think I can resist you. I have never done anything like this before. But if I give way to you, I trust that you will take care of me. Yes?” But I wasn’t thinking about anything that warranted her trusting me. In fact, I was thinking the exact opposite. Every fiber of my being wanted to drain her and toss the husk of her body over the side of the ship, never to be heard from again. “I’ll take care of you,” I whispered, pulling some tendrils of her hair to one side and fully exposing her neck. That’s when the cabin door burst open. Several burly men charged into the cabin. One of them looked me directly in the face and shouted, “Vampire!” Chapter 15 Colette “I’m mad at you,” Lilly said, thrusting her chin into the air and turning away from me. I already knew she was mad at me. It was obvious from the way she had been storming around our room all evening, picking up books, slamming them down again, and sighing quite dramatically. It wasn’t behavior she could exhibit in front of our mother and father at dinner, but just the two of us in the room we shared was a different story. “Yes, I know that,” I told her. That caught her up for a moment. “Well don’t you want to know why?” “I think I probably already know,” I said, although mostly to myself. “It’s because of the way you’re treating Lev,” she said without really hearing me. “No it’s not,” was my reply. We’d gone driving with the boys the evening before and I was still irritated. If anything, I was the one who should have been mad at her. “It’s because you wanted to stay and canoodle in the moonlight with Walter and I wanted to go home.” I sat down at the dressing table we shared, picked up a brush and started trying to tame my hair. “Well…” she stammered, “that too, but I also think you’re also being very rude to Lev.” “No I’m not,” I said quietly. “He really likes you,” she insisted. “No he doesn’t,” I told her, giving up on the brush and combing my hair with my fingers. “He doesn’t know me. I think he’s just interested in me because I’m a challenge. If I was all gah-gah for him, I’m sure he’d suddenly find that he likes a different girl.” “That’s still no reason to be rude to him,” Lilly grumbled. “It’s no reason to kiss him either,” I told her. “I could see where things were going and I didn’t want any part of it. You know, you don’t always have to do what a boy wants you to,” I told her. She shrugged. “I know. But Lev is so handsome,” she said, sinking onto her bed. “Don’t you think he’s very good looking?” “I’m sure if I saw his picture in a magazine, I might think that,” I told her. “But he’s not very nice and I really think he’s a bit of a bully.” I remembered the menacing look he had given Lilly’s date after just a slight ribbing. “I’m surprised Walter would want to be his friend.” “They’ve know each other forever,” Lilly said. “Walter thinks of him more like a brother.” “How do you think he got that bruise on his cheek?” I asked. It was a question that had been tugging at the back of my mind. Frowning, Lilly said, “Didn’t he say he was roughhousing with some friends and banged into a table?” “Sure, but that must have been some very rough roughhousing. His knuckles were all bruised and his hands were swollen.” “Really?” Lilly said, absentmindedly. “I hadn’t noticed.” “I bet.” My sister only had eyes for Walter. When he was around, a falling star could land at her feet and she probably wouldn’t even notice. “So I think you should go out with him again, just to make it up to him,” Lilly blurted rather quickly. “What?” She’d caught me off guard with that one. “You know, so he doesn’t think you dislike him or anything.” “But I do dislike him,” I told her. “As a matter of fact, I dislike him very much. I’d be perfectly happy if I never see him again.” Lilly got up to stand behind me so that we were both reflected in the mirror. “Isn’t that was Elizabeth says about Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice right before she falls in love with him?” “Lev Wilson is no Mr. Darcy,” I informed her. To me that was abundantly clear. “But you’re Elizabeth,” she said, gathering my hair in her hands. “You’re definitely the beauty of the family. That’s why Lev likes you so much, I guess.” “Jane was the beauty of the family,” I corrected her. “Elizabeth was the one who made the pert remarks.” That made Lilly smile. “So the analogy still holds,” she said with a laugh. I turned in my chair to look at her directly. “But seriously, Lilly, I really do not enjoy Lev Wilson’s company. I’m sorry if it makes things more challenging for Walter and you, but I will never agree to go on another date with his majesty again.” Lilly flopped back on her bed. “Do you really think he’s related to royalty?” she asked. This made me laugh. “Sure, in the same way that we’re all related to Adam and Eve.” “Oh.” Lilly frowned. “I really don’t think he’d lie about something like that. Do you?” I wanted to say that I though Lev Wilson would say it was day when it was pitch black outside, but instead I replied, “I think that Lev is maybe prone to exaggerations.” Gross exaggerations, to be more exact, but I didn’t say that part out loud. “I still don’t know why you don’t like him.” Lilly went back to her bed to have another moment to sulk. “Lilly, I’m afraid I just don’t.” I got up from my chair and walked over to her. “Please respect my feelings and stopped trying to fix us up. You’ll only make everyone miserable.” “Okay,” she finally relented. “How about another date with Herschel?” When I gave her a flat look, she quickly added, “Or maybe Walter could introduce you to another one of his friends.” I sighed. “Lilly, the next time you want to go out with Walter, I’ll go as your chaperone and just read a book. But please stop trying to fix me up with one of his friends.” Shaking her head, Lilly said, “You’re a funny kind of girl. You’re so pretty you could date any boy in town, but instead you spend all of your time with your nose in a book.” I couldn’t help but shrug. “I guess that’s just who I am. And probably who I’ll always be.” Chapter 16 Jessie The French maid let out a shriek and I thrust her from my arms as more men came barreling into the room. They were brandishing makeshift wooden stakes that they’d procured by breaking the legs off of tables and chairs. I was trapped with nowhere to run. There was only one door and that was filled by a dozen armed men. Even if I took out of few of the angry mob, there was no way I was getting out of there without a stake through my heart. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. My life as a member of the undead would be even briefer than my life as a mortal. “What are you doing here?” the maid screeched. “Get out! Get out!” I made the decision that I would not fight them. I would allow them to kill me without a struggle. There would be no blood on my hands as I went to meet the world’s maker. “Grab a stake or anything you have made out of wood,” one of the young men shouted at me. I recognized him immediately as the ruddy faced youth who had been impertinent to my sister. “There’s a vampire aboard the ship,” he said. “He’s lured one of the crew to his cabin and is feeding off the poor soul right now.” I just stood there, frozen to the spot, trying to take it all in. “A vampire?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes!” the man shouted. “They exist. And there’s one aboard this ship. Arm yourself and hurry up. I doubt the creature will go down without a fight.” “I…” I stammered. “I’m with you.” “Good,” the young man told me. “We need every able bodied man we can find. And we don’t have a minute to lose.” Then, turning to the rest of the mob, he shouted, “Let’s go!” The crowd turned as a unit and surged away from the door. I stumbled after them, absentmindedly grabbing a corkscrew on my way out the door. It wasn’t made out of wood. I’m not even sure why I grabbed it beyond the fact that the ruddy faced young man had instructed me to grab a weapon. “What’s going on?” Emily asked. The noise from the mob had woken her and she looked sleep-tousled, her eyes wide with fright. “Everything is fine,” I assured her, even though it was obviously a lie. One of our family had been discovered and was about to face a horrible death. But there was no reason to drag poor Emily into it. I didn’t want her to see one of us getting staked. Especially if the hapless individual happened to be our mother. “Just stay in your cabin,” I told her. “Lock the door.” As I hurried behind the mob, I called over my shoulder. “And keep the maid with you!” There was no reason for any young woman to get caught up in a bloodthirsty crowd, even a female of questionable virtue. “I’ll be fine. You can’t keep me locked in here,” the maid insisted, all remnants of her French accent giving way to something that sounded more like she hailed from Yorkshire. “Do as I say!” I shouted as I ran down the hall, on the heels of the angry mob. Which one of my family had been discovered? And would there be any way for me to save them without putting everyone’s life in danger? As we charged passed door after door of the first class cabins, I saw the face of my brother Daniel peeking out. At least I knew he wasn’t going to be the one to face the business end of a stake. That narrowed things down to either my grandfather or my mother; fifty-fifty odds for both of them. I knew I would fight to death for my mother. I couldn’t say what I would do for her father, especially if my suspicions were true about him hiring someone to dispose of my blood. My grandfather was a difficult man to love. In fact, if I was being honest, I hated him. But he was my maker and that tied me to him for eternity. The angry mob stopped outside a state room door. I had no idea if the room belonged to my mother. They banged on the door, but there was no response. Individuals yelled for a ship’s steward to open the door, but the mob was too impatient to wait. A couple of brawny young men began putting their shoulders to the door. It was well made and held out against the assault for several moments, before eventually bursting open. I had expected the crowd to surge forward, but instead they pulled back. An audible gasp was heard from most of the men who could see through the door. Everyone was so transfixed, either looking through the door or trying to look through the door, that I took a little risk and levitated several inches into the air to see over the crowd. I covered for this trick by pretending I was boosting myself up on the handle of the door across the way, but it would have been an almost impossible test of strength for a mortal. From my elevated position, I was able to see over the heads of the crowd. There was my grandfather, in the corner of the room, hunkered down like a rabid dog that had been cornered by the local sheriff. Blood dripped from the corners of his mouth, his fangs on full display. And there, slumped on the floor, was the half naked body of a boy. I recognized him immediately. It was Christian Franzen, the beautiful cabin boy who had spoken with Mother and me on the deck of the ship the previous evening. Blood was oozing from his neck and he looked very pale. He was making a faint mewing sound, like a hungry kitten. I could tell from the boy’s deathly white complexion and the deep wounds on his neck that Grandfather had intended to drain him dry. The mob had arrived just in time. “You animal,” someone shouted from the crowd. Grandfather jerked his head up. His eyes looked heavy, like those of a drunkard deep in his cups. “You peons,” he snarled, doing his best to pull himself up to his full height. “There’s nothing you can do to me. You cannot touch me.” “Get him!” several people shouted at once and the crowd surged forward. If it had been just a few men, Grandfather could have fought them, and probably won, even in his inebriated state. But the mob was too much for him. They began beating him with their makeshift stakes, the splinters from the broken table and chair legs piercing his flesh. He began to shriek in agony, but that only fueled the crowd. Quickly, I shoved my way through the masses to the limp body of Christian Franzen. People were so outraged by the assault on him, that they were willing to trample him in order to punish his molester. I pulled the cabin boy to the far corner of the room. There was the heavy scent of gin on his breath, which explained why Grandfather was acting so sluggish. The boy’s head lolled, his eyes were glassy, but he was able to focus on me for a brief moment. “Vampire,” he whispered and then he lost consciousness. The mob had seized Grandfather and was dragging him out of the cabin, all the while beating him and making him howl. I needed to save him. But Mr. Franzen was about to expire in my arms. Discretely, I punctured my fingertip with one of my fang. Once there was a bit of blood dripping from it, I stuck my finger in the cabin boy’s mouth. It only took a few moments for his eyelids to start fluttering. A few seconds after that and his eyes began to focus. He looked at me and let out a shriek, which I quickly stifled, clamping a hand over his mouth. “You’re safe,” I told him as he struggled against me, his body still weak from blood loss. “There is no reason to fear.” I forced a few more drops of blood into his mouth and his pallor began to improve. “You were attacked,” I told him. “But your assailant has been captured so there’s nothing more he can do to harm you.” The crowd had cleared the room by that point and I knew I had to follow them as quickly as possible to try to save my grandfather. “You must rest here,” I told him, gently lowering him to the rug. “Be still. No more harm will come to you.” I stood up. “I’ll send the ship’s physician just as soon as I can.” The cabin boy made an attempt to say something. He reached a trembling hand toward me and tried to force words to come out of his mouth. But I had already wasted too much time. I felt I couldn’t spare another moment. I pulled away from him. “Just stay there,” I shouted over my shoulder as I rushed out the door. The corridor was empty, but I followed the sound of angry voices to the deck of the ship. There was the mob, pummeling and kicking at a prostrate figure on the deck, which I knew to be the heartless creature who was my grandfather. What was I to do for him? Was there anything I could say that would stop the crazed mob from tearing him to pieces? I had to try something. He was my maker. “Wait!” I shouted, rushing forward and thrusting myself between the mob and my grandfather. “Stop!” I held my hands up to keep them back. “Why should we?” one of the men asked, his eye appearing crazed with bloodlust. “He’s a human,” I pointed out. “Doesn’t he at least deserve a trial?” “He’s not a human,” the man told me. “He’s a creature of the night. He gave up his right to a trial when he sold his soul to the devil.” Another man began to view me with suspicion. “Why are you so eager to defend him?” he asked, poking me on the chest with a brawny finger. “What’s this creature to you?” “Nothing,” I insisted. “I’m just studying the law.” “The law is only for humans,” a woman’s voice called from the back of the throng. “I wouldn’t give that creature the same consideration I’d give a dog.” Most people in the crowd seemed to heartily agree with her. I felt a hand close tightly around my ankle. Looking down, I made eye contact with my grandfather. “Save me,” he said in words so soft that no mortal ears could have heard them. “I am your maker. You owe me your immortal soul. You must save me.” “How?” I asked, mostly with my eyes. “I am your maker,” he whispered again. “You must save me, even if it means sacrificing yourself.” I knew at that moment that I truly hated my grandfather. I hated him to the very core of my being. But he was also my maker. I had to obey him. I felt obliged to try to preserve his life. Turning back to the crowd, I looked at all their mortal faces. I was just a fledgling vampire, but I knew that I had the ability to compel mortals to do my bidding. I didn’t have much experience using my influence over anyone and it seemed an insurmountable challenge to sway a rabid mob. But I felt Grandfather’s grip around my ankle. I could hear him whispering, “Save me. You must save me.” I had no choice. I had to either compel the crowd to leave him alone or fight them. “Please, listen to me,” I said, raising my hands in the air again to gather their attention. “No,” a woman shouted from the crowd. “Shove the boy out of the way and dispatch the beast.” And then the mob closed in, poking at me with their makeshift stakes to get me out of the way. Each scratch of the wood was like someone had set my skin on fire. I wanted to shriek in pain, but I knew if anyone took notice of the agony a few slivers were causing me, then I would be in the same position as my grandfather. “Come here, boy,” I heard a woman’s gruff voice command me. I was about to protest, but the lady got a firm hold of me and began dragging me away from Grandfather. “There’s no need for you to be caught up in this nonsense.” The woman was elderly and her voice was ragged, but she had a grip on me as strong as a vice. In a softer voice, she added, “We’re almost clear of him.” I did a double take and realized that the elderly woman was my mother in disguise. “What are you doing?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “Saving what’s left of my family,” she said in a low voice. “But Grandfather…” I stammered. “You’re death isn’t going to save him,” she said. I don’t know where Grandfather got the strength, but he’d climbed to his feet and started fighting the crowd. It seemed like some of the frenzy had left the mob. Instead of being swept up with outrage and moving with one mind and one will, they were all standing back, waiting for someone else to take the lead. If he’d played things right, maybe Grandfather could have gained control of the mob. Or at least temporarily escaped the crowd and hidden somewhere on the ship while regaining his strength. Then he could have waited until we were closer to New York and escaped by air, flying the rest of the way. But Grandfather was angry and used to being obeyed by mortals. He grabbed one of the men that was taunting him, lifted him into the air, and then flung him over the side of the ship. “Who wants to die next?” Grandfather shouted, glaring at the crowd. The people moved in a giant mass, slashing and stabbing at Grandfather with their stakes. They had him pinned against the rail. “We have to do something,” I said, pulling against my mother’s tight embrace. “No,” Mother said, shoving me back. “He’ll be gone in another moment. I think we’ve already done enough. We’re better off saving that poor soul who went over the side.” Then she released me and ran for a life preserver. I knew she was right, but I still felt compelled by my maker. Grandfather had commanded me to save him. I had to do something to save the evil fiend. I had to try. Almost against my will, I found myself taking a few steps toward the crowd. “Jessie!” Mother shouted, jolting my out of my trance. “Help me with the man overboard.” “Yes,” I said to her. “Yes, you’re right.” I hurried to the railing, took the life preserver from her and flung it to the man bobbing up and down in the waves. I could see him just as easily as if it had been high noon. The preserver had a rope attached to it. Only a few moments later and we were hauling the man back onto the deck of the ship. Grandfather was losing his battle. The best thing he could have done was take flight, but he was in such a weakened condition from all the stake wounds, that was no longer a possibility. Still, he wouldn’t give up the battle. He lunged for another man, but received a stake to the hand for his efforts. Jerking back in pain, he found himself pinned against the railing. Another moment of struggle and he was pushed over the side. My impulse was to catch him as he fell. I didn’t have much experience flying, but I knew the basics. Mother held me back, gripping my shirt with both her hands. “Let him go, Jessie,” she told me. “But…” I struggled against her grasp. “Jessie,” she said. “Look at me.” After I wrench my gaze away from where Grandfather had plunged in the water, she said, “I didn’t go through all this trouble to arrange your grandfather’s discovery, just to have you put yourself at risk to save him.” I stared at her, too stunned to think for several seconds. “You?” I couldn’t help but ask. And then I added, “Why?” Mother released me and then did her best to straighten out the wrinkles in my shirt. “That son-of-a-bitch already killed my sons,” she said. “I wasn’t going to let him get my daughter.” I let this new information sink into my brain. My mother had set the whole thing up. She’d found the perfect cabin boy and probably even gotten him drunk in the hopes that his blood would intoxicate her father, slowing his reflexes. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything to the rest of the family,” Mother said, scanning the people on the deck for any family members who might have come to see what all the noise was about. “Of course,” I assured her. “But…” My thoughts were all a jumble. Grandfather was Mother’s maker, too. How had she acted against him? It seemed impossible. “How did you do it?” I was finally able to ask. “How could you betray your maker? Even if he was a man like Grandfather?” “It wasn’t easy,” she told me, running her hands over her clothes to smooth nonexistent wrinkles in her dress. “But there’s one thing most makers don’t seem to understand.” “What?” I couldn’t help but ask. She turned to head back to her cabin, but then paused to look at me over her shoulder. “A mother’s love is stronger than any obligation she might feel toward her maker.” Chapter 17 Colette “You’re losing weight,” Mama observed, running an appraising eye over my figure. “Do you think?” I brushed my hands over my hips. I’d never been heavy, but I was rather curvy, which I knew Papa disliked. I’d overheard him talking with Mama once and he’d said flat out that I was too young to have such a womanly figure. “It must be all that bicycling you’ve been doing. It’s great exercise,” Mama said, turning back to the dishes. “I swear you must have ridden across half the state in the last month.” “Probably,” I agreed with her, picking up a clean plate and starting to dry it with a towel. What my mother didn’t know was that, even though I had been riding my bicycle a lot lately, it was always to the same place. It felt almost as if I had a magnet inside my belly that was always pulling me toward the castle. “It looks good on you,” Mama said as she drained the sink and started to wipe down the counter. “I think it’s healthy. You should keep it up.” She wouldn’t have thought it was healthy if she’d known about my visit to the castle that afternoon. I’d ridden my bike over there after school. I wanted to speak with the Italian workers before they finished the floors and were sent back to Italy. After the rose garden was finished, the English workers disappeared like they had evaporated into the air. There was only one caretaker left to make sure the roses stayed beautiful. He looked about a million years old and lived in a tiny house that was tucked out of sight of the castle. The problem was that the Italians were always working inside the castle and I wasn’t bold enough to stroll inside the building just to ask impertinent questions. Still, that afternoon, luck was on my side. As the wheels of my bicycle rolled to a halt just outside the castle, I noticed a young man with an immense crop of shiny black hair leaning against a tree. He was smoking a cigarette and had his eyes closed as he tilted his face toward the sun. The heavy layer of sawdust covering him from head to toe led me to believe that he might be one of the Italian workers. I was trying to think of a possible reason to strike up a conversation with him, when he said, “I am glad for this day. I have missed the sunshine.” He’d kept his eyes closed when speaking so I wasn’t quite sure he was addressing me, but there was nobody else around. “It another few months it will be quite warm,” I answered him, still staying astride my bicycle. “Yes, but by then I will be gone.” He opened his eyes to look at me and I was surprised to realize that they were green when I had been expecting brown. “You are from Italy?” I asked. I was feeling rather shy to be standing there by myself, speaking to a young man I didn’t know, but I forced myself to be bold. “Si,” he said, closing his eyes again like a cat enjoying a nap in a sunbeam. He tilted his head back to rest it against the tree. “You are one of the men laying the floors in the castle?” “Si,” he said again. Climbing off my bike, I put down the kickstand. Taking a deep breath, I blurted, “Have you ever met the family who will live here?” My question caused the young man to lift his head and look directly at me. After staring at me for several seconds, he said, “No,” rather curtly. “I have never met the people who will live here. But I hear of them and it is never good things.” “What have you heard about them?” I asked, fully realizing that I sounded like the town gossip. The young man shifted his weight from one foot to the other. My question had made him uncomfortable. “It is stories that are not nice to hear,” he said. “They are not for the young girl like you.” I felt the sting of disappointment. What was the age where people stopped saying things like, “You’re too young to hear things like that,” or, “I’ll tell you when you’re older,”? This young man couldn’t have been much older than me and he knew the stories. I started getting back on my bicycle. There didn’t seem much point in haranguing him if he was reluctant to talk. But my leaving somehow loosened his tongue. “I will tell you this thing,” he said. “I would not like for such a family to move to my town.” “Why not?” I ask, not bothering to climb off my bike. His face darkened and I couldn’t tell if he was getting angry or just struggling for the right words. “They are not like the people,” he said. “They make the bite.” “Oh.” I was beginning to understand him. “You mean their dogs?” “No.” He shook his head adamantly. “They are not the mannaro.” “Pardon?” I said, bending my ear toward him. His English was good, but I didn’t quite catch the last word. “They’re not the what?” “Mannaro,” he said again, more slowly. “I do not know this word in English, but that is not the family.” He looked at the space between us for a couple of seconds, his lips moving slightly as he tried to work something out in his head. “They are not the lupo.” Then his eyes widened a little. “They are not the wolf, but they bite. They bite very badly. You must stay away.” The Vanderlinds apparently had some kind of weird pets that were especially vicious, was all I could conclude. Some type of dog or wolf or something. Maybe these animals had a habit of escaping their kennels and attacking the locals. That was the only thing I could guess. But would the family really ship such beasts across an ocean? Especially after they’d already made such trouble? I was just about to mention this possibility to the young man, when another worker, middle aged and also covered in sawdust, came out of the castle. He immediately yelled at my new friend in a foreign language. I assumed it was Italian. The young man said something in reply, also in a heated voice. He gestured at me several times. The only word I understood between them was the name Vanderlind. The older man swung around to glare at me and then a string of words came out of his mouth very rapidly. I had no idea what he was saying. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I don’t speak Italian.” This apparently made the man even more furious. He took a deep breath and then said, “You go out of here! You leave this! You do not come here!” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “I was just asking about the Vanderlind family. I didn’t mean to keep anyone from their work.” That was the only thing I could think of that would make him so red in the face. “Go!” the man shouted. “You go now!” He waved his hands at me as if trying to chase me off. “You not come back here.” “I really didn’t mean to get anyone in trouble.” I gave the young man an apologetic look. “I’m sorry,” I told him. “He wants that you should go,” said the young man. “He wants that you leave because there is danger.” “You no come back here!” the older man roared. He picked up a pebble from the ground and threw it in my general direction. “Ora!Ora!” he shouted, reaching for another pebble. I had a feeling that this time he wouldn’t miss. Turning my bike fully around, I started pedaling hard and didn’t stop until I was safe in the garage back at my house. The whole things was very strange, and frightening, and a little humiliating somehow. I didn’t appreciate being chased off like a sheep that had strayed into the wrong pasture. The man didn’t have to throw stones at me. There was still some time before dinner, so I went to my room to think. Why were all the workmen warning me about the Vanderlinds? There must have been some terrible incident back in Hungary. Something to do with some type of vicious dogs. Maybe the dogs had killed a person. Maybe even a few people. Was that why the Vanderlinds had decided to move away? To escape the shame of their pets having killed or maimed some people. That seemed rather strange, but it was the only thing I could thinking of, given what I had been told. I decided that it was probably best for me to stay away from the caste, at least until the floors were finished and the Italian carpenters were gone. I was drawn to the castle, but that didn’t mean I had to be foolish. If there really were rabid dogs that were going to be housed on the estate, then I would have to fight my nature and avoid the place as much as possible. I didn’t mind a well behaved dog that was happy just to sit on a porch or fetch a stick, but I was not overly comfortable with dogs that liked to jump and bark. A vicious dog would probably be able to sense my fear and target me for its next attack. I was sad that I wouldn’t be able to ride over to the castle anymore, but I wasn’t a stupid girl. Those men were warning me for a reason. Just then Lilly came into the room and immediately flung herself on her bed. “What’s wrong?” I asked her. “They’re letting me go from Zucker’s,” she said, tearfully. “Why?” I exclaimed, coming over to sit next to her on the bed. “What happened?” “Oh… Mrs. Zucker’s cousin in moving to Tiburon,” Lilly said, wiping her eyes and giving a loud sniff. “She’s going to start working there, so they won’t have any space left for me,” she explained. “And there’s not a job for you, either,” Lilly said. “Mr. Zucker asked me to tell you.” “Oh, no.” I let my shoulders slump. The Zuckers had told me that I could work at their store over the summer. I was hoping to start at the end of the month, when school let out. Lilly and I had planned to work there as much as we could to bring in extra money for Mama and Papa. And Lilly had thought she might keep working there for a few years, at least until she got married or found another job. “Now I’m never going to get to see Walter,” Lilly said, morosely as she flopped onto her stomach. “Have you told Mama and Papa?” I asked. “No,” Lilly told me, her voice slightly muffled by her pillow. “Well don’t say anything yet,” I told her. “Let’s try to find some other work first so they don’t have to worry.” The other evening, Lilly had overheard Mama and Papa talking about paying the bills. Things were getting very tight. Papa was worried that if he didn’t find more work then we might have to sell the house and move in with his brother. All of us loved our house. Papa had crafted it with his own two hands and it really was a thing of beauty. Lilly and I were determined to contribute whatever we could to keep us in our home. “Alright,” Lilly agreed. The jobs at Zucker’s had sounded too good to be true. There were plenty of people out of work and willing to do just about anything to earn a couple of dollars. “I’m sure we could maybe get something on one of the farms.” “There’s got to something,” I agreed with her, but we both knew it was going to be a challenge. “It’s just a shame they didn’t hire Papa to work building the castle,” I said. Lilly gave a small laugh, even though there were still tears in her eyes. “You’re just saying that because then you would get to look inside.” “Well, that too.” I couldn’t help but join her in giggling a little. “But I mean, it would have been nice for him to have the work.” Sighing, Lilly murmured, “I guess it’s too bad our last name doesn’t sound Hungarian.” Chapter 18 Jessie The person who took Grandfather’s death the hardest was Mrs. Denkler. I told her when I returned to the cabin, after checking that someone was attending to the cabin boy’s injuries. I hoped to everything holy and unholy that Grandfather had not left any clues behind connecting him to the Vanderlind family. I knew his cabin would be thoroughly searched. “No, no, no,” Mrs. Denkler wailed once I’d told her of her employer’s demise. She immediately began tearing at her hair with grief. I wrapped my arms around her and held her firmly to stop her from doing further injury to herself. “He’s gone,” was all I could tell her. “I tried to save him, but it was impossible. The crowd wouldn’t stop until they were sure he was dead.” Emily was standing behind Mrs. Denkler. I could see her over the shoulder of the grieving housekeeper. Tears were pouring down her face. She looked at me, her entire body trembling. “You mean,” she gasped. “You mean that I won’t have too…” she couldn’t finish her words. “You mean I’ll never…” I nodded, and tried to summon a smile. “That’s right,” I told her. “You’re going to live to be an old lady.” Our mother had seen to that. Emily covered her face with her hands and ran to her cabin, slamming the door behind her. I was glad for her. I knew she had dreaded becoming a member of the undead. But her actions did leave me with an inconsolable Mrs. Denkler in my arms. “What will become of me now?” the housekeeper wailed. “What will become of me?” “Everything will be just fine,” I said, half carrying her across the room to lie her down on the couch. “You’ll come with us to America. You’ll be the Vanderlind housekeeper. Nothing has changed,” I assured her. I rang to have some liquor brought to the cabin and ordered it to be brought on the double. The steward arrived with a bottle of bourbon and a bottle of soda. He wanted to come in and set the drinks up for me on the bar, but I refused to let him enter the cabin. Instead, I asked him to just pass everything over the threshold. Mrs. Denkler was so distraught, I didn’t know what she might let slip with a stranger in the room. At first the steward seemed a little offended, but I was able to smooth things over with a rueful smile and a generous tip. “Here, Denkie, drink this,” I instructed, handing her a brimming glass. “It’ll calm you,” I assured her. I had expected our housekeeper to just sip daintily at the straight bourbon I had handed her, but she downed half the glass in just one gulp. Her body shivered and pitched a little as the liquor ran through her, but it did interrupt her wailing. After that she sat there for several minutes, just staring at the wall opposite her, not moving or making a sound. I wasn’t sure what I could do for her or what I could offer her to make her feel better. My mother had suspected Denkie would take the news hard. She had taken it upon herself to somehow get the news to Daniel, if he didn’t already know. My brother had been eager to become a member of the undead and he had more respect for our grandfather than the rest of us. Still, as long as the Vanderlind name was untarnished and our fortune was still intact, I doubted Daniel would mind too horribly much. Without warning, Mrs. Denkler rose to her feet. “If you’ll excuse me,” she said in a quiet voice. “I think I need to lie down for a few minutes. “Please,” I said, hurrying over to her in case she should be unsteady. But that was not the case. She crossed the room to the cabin she shared with my sister without a tremble, her head high and her eyes hard. “I think you should just turn in for the night,” I told her, seeing her to her door. Her eyes shifted in my direction, but I could tell she wasn’t really looking at me. Her movements gave the impression that she was more automaton than human. “Thank you,” she said. “You’ve always been a kind boy.” When Mrs. Denkler had turned the lock inside the cabin, I hurried to my private quarters and dug into my valise. I drained the remaining contents of the first pint in one large gulp and had downed half of the second bottle before I really knew what I was really doing. It took great self-restraint for me to cork the remaining blood and tuck it away. I had to force myself out of the room; the urge to finish the pint was so strong. After the light went out in Emily and Mrs. Denkler’s cabin, I felt truly alone with only my thoughts to keep me company. Sinking onto the couch, I cupped my head in my hands. Grandfather’s demise was too horrible to think about. If I closed my eyes, I could still see the image of him going over the side. He hadn’t cried out as he fell; no wail of fear, no words of farewell. He must have been too weak to fly. I had to wonder if he suspected any of his family of treachery. Did he know my mother had set him up to be discovered? And was Grandfather truly gone? That was another thought that would keep me awake in my coffin. He was in a weakened state and had been slashed at by many shards of wood, but had he actually been staked? Was he still of this world, just floating in the ocean somewhere? We were in the middle of the Atlantic. There wasn’t even the smallest bit of land for a thousand miles, but that didn’t mean that Grandfather wasn’t still alive. Had he somehow kept pace with the ship and was, even now, climbing aboard, hell-bent on revenge? That thought compelled me to my feet. I found myself on deck a moment later without jacket nor any memory if I had locked the state room door. I began hurrying down flights of stairs to the lower decks. Surely there would be wet footprints if he’d managed to save himself. I scanned the polished floorboards and hung over the railing, trying to glimpse if there was a figure bobbing in the ocean. At the stern of the ship, I caught sight of a shadowy figure, leaning against the rail. He was the same size as my grandfather and had the same demeanor. I stutter-stepped with surprise, but a moment later I understood that the figure was my brother. “He’s not here,” Daniel said, his voice a low growl. “I’ve been looking since I got word, but there’s not a sign of him.” “So he’s really gone, then?” I had to wonder. “He’s out there.” We both took a moment to examine the vastness of the ocean. “He was a foolish old bugger,” Daniel felt the need to observe. “Feasting on a cabin boy… I should have thought Grandfather had better self control.” I shrugged. “Maybe the temptation was too great.” Daniel laughed. “I suppose we should be grateful Mother insisted we travel under false names,” he observed, using a voice that was loud enough to draw attention. I jerked my head slightly to let him know he should be silent. It was stupid of him to assume that we were the only beings out and about, even though it was the middle of the night. “Don’t be such a prig,” my brother muttered. “There’s no one around to hear us.” I could see that Daniel had inherited the arrogance that had been our grandfather’s undoing. But it would do me no good to point that out. Daniel seemed satisfied that Grandfather had not made it back onto the ship and I had no reason to doubt him. “Have a good night,” I told my brother as I turned to stroll away. It never even occurred to me to ask him to share some of his blood. I would let the last misdeed of our Grandfather go unknown to the rest of the family. He’d done enough evil things in his life. I didn’t need to add one final black-mark against him. When I opened the door to our quarters again, the first thing I saw was Mrs. Denkler’s hard eyes glittering in the darkness. I could see her clear as day, but there was something about the darkness that may her eyes glow in a different way. “Oh,” I said, rather surprised. “I thought you’d gone to bed.” “No,” she told me. “I just needed to rest for a minute.” I wasn’t sure what to say. “I hope you’re not unwell.” “No, I am well,” she insisted. “The loss of your grandfather was quite a shock, but I’m sure the family feels it more than I do.” I nodded, unwilling to commit words to the topic. “I greatly appreciate your understanding when I…” Mrs. Denkler waved a thin hand through the air. “When I became upset. I was very fond of your grandfather.” “Yes, of course,” was all I could think to say. “And I appreciate your assurance that your family stills values my services,” she said. I tried to smile. “I don’t think we could run the castle without you.” “Do you mind if I turn on a light?” she asked. “It makes things easier for me.” “Yes, of course,” I said. “Don’t get up. Let me do it for you.” I quickly found the switch. “I have something for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, holding out a small cup covered with a cloth. I asked, “What is it?” but my nose had already told me. It’s was blood. “Where did you get it?” I exclaimed. Then I noticed that her left arm was bandaged at the wrist. “Denkie, you didn’t!” “Of course I did,” she said, still offering me the cup of nectar. “I know you’re trying to be brave and not say anything to your family, but it’s going to be hard for you to make it another two full days without feeding. Better to have some of my blood, given voluntarily, than to have you lose control and…” Her voice cracked a little. “And get caught the way your grandfather was.” “I couldn’t,” I told her, although my eyes were glued to the cup in her hand. “Of course you can,” she said, sounding a little cross. “And besides, what do you think will happen if you slip up and the passengers discover another vampire aboard this ship?” She was right. If I did make a mistake, then she and Emily would also be held responsible. And it wouldn’t stop there. They crew would probably search the boat, cabin by cabin, until my mother and brother were also discovered. If I lost control, then my whole family would more than likely be killed. I took the blood, noticing how, when I reached for it, my hand trembled. It seemed somehow obscene to drink Mrs. Denkler’s blood in front of her, so I hurried to my private cabin before gulping down the red nectar. It was still warm from when she’d drained it from her arm. After the cup was empty, I was lost in a confusing swirl of ecstasy and revulsion. Mrs. Denkler had been our housekeeper my entire life. I had never thought of her in any sort of intimate terms beyond her being an older woman who felt at liberty to scold me if I acted up. But drinking her blood, even if it was from a cup, was somehow so intimate. It made me feel uneasy, like I had accidentally stumbled across her in her bath. Once I fought passed all the confusing sensations, I felt much better. I was in control of my appetite again. I could face being with mortals and not break out into a sweat, visualizing them with their necks’ laid bare. I felt an extreme amount of gratitude toward Mrs. Denkler. She was more than just a good housekeeper and a loyal servant. She really was part of the Vanderlind family. I wouldn’t forget the gift she had given me. Chapter 19 Colette I stayed away from the castle for as long as I could. Not going there had me so distracted that it was a challenge to concentrate on my school work or even carry on a simple conversation. Our final exams for the year were quickly approaching and I wondered how I would ever get through them with my thoughts always straying to the massive gray structure on the other side of town. I couldn’t help but daydream about who would be living there and how they would spend their days. I wondered if they had any children, and if yes, how old were they? I knew it was silly to believe that anyone so wealthy would send their offspring to Tiburon High, but I wasted hours daydreaming about it. I didn’t dare include myself in the world I was creating in my mind. I knew that there were thousands of novels where a young man from a wealthy family falls in love with the lowly shop girl, but I knew better than to believe something so magical would ever happen to someone like me. Still, I found the longer I stayed away from the castle, the more it consumed me. After two weeks, I decided I would have to visit the site again or my grades would start to suffer. That afternoon, I set out on my bicycle immediately after school. I hoped that the Italian workers had finished their tasks by then and were on a boat back to Italy. I didn’t relish the idea of having more stones thrown at me while men scolded me in a language I did not understand. As I coasted my bike down the recently paved road, I was stunned to see how complete the castle appeared. If I didn’t know differently, I would have assumed that the Vanderlind Castle had been standing on the shores of the Tiburon since the crusades. Then I caught sight of more barges on the river. The family’s furniture and personal effects had arrived. Giant crates were being used to unloaded the cargo onto the shore. Men wielding claw hammers and pry bars were opening large crates and carefully removing the contents. Everything had been packed in straw, so there were a dozen women efficiently wiping down each item. Then the contents were being moved into the castle by dozens of men. From a distance it looked like a line of ants hefting away the remnants of a picnic. The entire process was being orchestrated by an older woman wearing a long gray dress with a high collar. Her dark gray hair was pulled back in an elaborate coil and her hands never stopped moving as she gave orders to each man as he entered the building. I was amazed that she could look at a lamp or a dressing table and know exactly where it belonged. She wasn’t even consulting a clip board. She apparently had the entire contents of the castle memorized. I stood there for several minutes, just watching the progress and admiring the beautiful furnishings of the Vanderlinds’ home. It was probably the only opportunity I would have to see anything so fine, outside of a museum, so I was doing my best to soak it all in. The workmen unloaded a very large crate that contained several smaller crates. They were all shaped the same, like long, squat rectangles. When one of the workmen started to apply his pry bar to the contents, the older woman in gray rushed over. I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she directed the workmen to carrying those specific crates into the house unopened. I couldn’t figure out what their contents could be. They weren’t the right shape or weight to be safes. And even if they were strongboxes of some type, filled with valuables, it wasn’t likely the workmen would have been able to crack them open with all the other people swarming around. I stared after the peculiar crates with keen interest. When I turned my eyes back to the general crowd of workers, I noticed that the lady in charge of the unpacking was looking directly at me. She had sharp eyes and wore a frown on her lips. I felt immediately embarrassed for being caught gawking. I was being frightfully rude. After all, how would I feel if we moved houses and the new neighbors turned up on the sidewalk to look over all our furnishing? I began to turn my bike around. It seemed like my days of gazing at the castle were over. Once the Vanderlinds moved in, I couldn’t exactly show up and stare at their house, no matter how much I felt drawn to it. If I did, the family would probably call the sheriff on me. As I placed a foot on the pedal and began to push down, I heard a voice call out, “Wait there, young lady.” Turning my head, I saw the woman in charge, marching straight toward me. She did not look pleased. “I’m sorry,” I blurted, unconsciously rolling the bike a little with my foot to keep some distance between us. “I just liked coming by to watch while they were building the castle. I won’t come by anymore,” I assured her. “Do you live in this town?” the woman asked, stopping several yards away from me and waving a hand through the air toward the general direction of Tiburon. “Yes,” I told her, rather hesitantly. “I live in Tiburon.” I wondered if she even knew our town’s name. Something told me she hadn’t bothered to commit it to memory. “Do you like it here?” she asked. From her appearance and her association with the Hungarian castle, I had expected her to speak with a foreign accent, but besides sounding a little formal, she had none. “Um... “It wasn’t a question I had given any great consideration. “Yes. I do like it here,” I said, inching my bike a bit further down the recently paved road. I wasn’t comfortable under the woman’s intense gaze. “And the castle interests you?” she asked, continuing in her questioning. “Yes,” I admitted. “I think it’s fascinating. But, you don’t have to worry. I won’t come by anymore, now that the family is about to arrive. I promise.” I put a hand to my cheek, my face feeling hot under her scrutiny. A tight smile curled the corners of the woman’s mouth. “Would you like to work in the castle?” she asked. “Pardon?” Now she had really caught my attention. “I asked if you would like to work at the castle,” she said, the smile quickly fading and an edge of impatience creeping into her voice. After thinking about it a moment, I said, “Yes, I would like to work at the castle. But I’m not sure what I’m qualified to do.” The woman looked me over from head to toe. “You are very much the kind of young lady I would like to have working at Vanderlind Castle.” “Thank you,” I told her. “And as it happens, I am looking for work as soon as school lets out for the summer. But I’m not sure of what kind of workers you are hoping to find.” “You could work as a housemaid,” she said, “I would have to train you, of course. But I’m sure you’ve cleaned house for your mother, or perhaps an elderly neighbor who was ill. Of course, at the castle we have very exacting standards.” I nodded, my stomach doing a flip. Did this dour-looking woman really mean to offer me a job at the castle that I’d been obsessing over for months? Did she really mean I would get to go inside and look at all the pretty things as I dusted and scrubbed them? I couldn’t imagine any kind of work that I would like better. Trying not to squirm with excitement, I said, “Of course.” “My name is Mrs. Denkler,” the lady told me. “I’m the housekeeper for the castle and I do all the staff hiring.” “How do you do?” I said in reply. “I am Colette Gibson. It’s very nice to meet you.” Mrs. Denkler tilted her head to one side and looked me over some more. “Do you know any other young ladies like you, who might be looking for work as a housemaid?” “My sister is also looking for a job,” I told her, sounding way too eager. “She was just let go from Zucker’s.” I immediately wished I hadn’t mentioned the general store, so I hastily added, “But that was because Mrs. Zucker’s cousin is taking the job. Not because Lilly isn’t a good worker.” The castle’s housekeeper raised her eyebrows slightly. “Your sister?” she asked. “Does she look anything like you?” “Oh, yes,” I told her. “People can always tell we’re sisters. Although she has nicer hair,” I felt the need to say for no good reason, self consciously sliding a hand over my own unruly locks. “Your hair is lovely,” Mrs. Denkler said. The sun was starting to set and it made her eyes glitter. “You remind me of the Empress Elisabeth, poor child.” For a moment, I thought she pitied me for my wild mane, but then she added, “She was stabbed to death by an anarchist, you know.” “Oh,” I exclaimed, but then I could think of nothing else to say. I didn’t know who she meant and I wasn’t quite sure what an anarchist was. “Come by tomorrow,” Mrs. Denkler told me. “You may knock at the door around to the right, closest to the river. Tell whoever lets you in that you have an appointment to see me.” “It will have to be after school,” I told her. “We haven’t been let out for the summer yet.” “That’s fine,” Mrs. Denkler said, turning to return to her duties. “Just come by as early as you can. And be sure to bring your sister.” I practically flew home, I was so excited. After I walked in the door and gave Mama a kiss, she told me that Lilly was in our room. I took the stairs two at a time. I wanted to tell the news to my sister first before we surprised Mama and Papa. “Lettie!” Lilly exclaimed, leaping up from her bed as soon as I entered the room. “I have wonderful news.” “You do?” I asked, momentarily thrown off. I was so caught up in my own news it was hard to change gears. “Well, I have news first, and you’re never going to believe it.” “Let me tell first,” Lilly said. “I’ve been waiting for hours for you to get home.” She was bubbling with excitement and so was I. I gripped her hands and we both started to giggle. “Okay, you first,” I told her, “but tell it quick because I’m about to burst.” “We’ve been invited to a dance in Mansfield,” she blurted. “And there’s going to be a swing band and everything.” “Oh.” I wasn’t exactly sure what she meant by “we’ve” been invited. She was grinning from ear to ear. I didn’t want pour cold water on her excitement, so I hedged for more information by saying, “Walter invited you?” “No, not exactly,” she said, looking a little sly. “It’s Lev who can get the tickets. But he’s allowed to have four, so he thought it would be fun for the four of us to go.” “You mean you’re going on a double date with Lev and another girl,” I insisted. Lilly’s face fell. “Don’t you want to hear a swing band?” “Sure,” I said with a shrug. “But I can do that on the radio.” “I mean don’t you want to see and hear a swing band? Lev is a great dancer,” she assured me. “Right.” I shook my head a little. “I suppose he told you that himself.” “Come on, Lettie,” she said. “You know Mama and Papa won’t let me go unless you’re with me. Please?” My sister’s face was aglow with excitement, probably at the thought of Walter holding her in his arms under the guise of dancing. But the thought of Lev Wilson having his arms around me made me cringe. I didn’t care if he was a good dancer; there was just something about him that made me want to run a mile in the opposite direction. “You have to let me know now,” Lilly insisted, “because Lev needs to know if he should take the tickets.” It sounded like an evening to dread. “When is it?” I asked. “Next month,” she told me, beaming with anticipation. “Doesn’t that leave plenty of time for Lev to find a date with another girl?” I asked. “I mean, aren’t there dozens of young women lining up just hoping he’ll give them the time of day?” My sister put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “Do you really expect me to be excited by your good news when you act this way?” “But my news is actually good news,” I insisted. Chapter 20 Jessie “Stop being such a prig,” Daniel said. “This will be our last glimpse of culture before we’re lost in the jungles of Borneo.” I looked at the line of girls, all in various stages of undress with their negligees showing. “I’m not sure I’d refer to a brothel in New York as culture,” I told him in a low voice, so that the girls couldn’t hear. I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. “At least it’s a Manhattan brothel,” was my brother’s reply. “Just imagine the state of the girls in small town Ohio.” He gave an affected shudder. “I don’t know what Grandfather was thinking. If he was still around, I’d probably try to stake him myself.” We’d arrived in New York with no more trouble. Mrs. Denkler was sent on ahead to oversee the preparations of the house while the family stayed in New York for a few extra weeks. One evening Daniel asked me to head out to see the sights. I hadn’t realized that by “sights” my brother had meant the seedy underbelly of the city. In his defense, vice was often the only mortal activities that went on in the middle of the night. “Just choose one, for pity sake,” Daniel snarled. “You don’t have to feed off of her if you don’t want to.” I didn’t want to feed off of any of the girls. Or, more truthfully, I desperately wanted to suck the life out of every single one of them, but openly admitting that urge was appalling to me. As expected, New York was infested with vampires. The Vanderlind name carried some weight in undead circles, so we were welcomed to the city with open arms. Everyone was appalled to hear of the fate of our patriarch. There was even some discussion of setting up a search party, or taking revenge on the mortals who had thrown him overboard. But mother insisted that she had seen him with a stake in his chest as he fell over the side. “Otherwise he would have simply flown away,” she pointed out. And to those vampires hot for revenge, she settled them by saying, “I knew my father best and he wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to put his immortality at risk to avenge his own foolishness. He knew the risk he was taking when he let that young man into his cabin.” There was ample blood available for us to consume, which brought me great relief. I had barely been clinging to the threads of sanity when a porter finally summoned up the nerve to tell me that I must vacate my cabin and leave the ship. Mrs. Denkler’s generosity had enabled me to save most of the second pint of blood I had concealed in my valise. Before disembarking the ship, I downed the entire bottle so that I would have enough fortitude to make it through customs. When we were offered refreshment at the house where we were to stay, I didn’t ask how the blood had been obtained. I just gulped it down, feeling grateful that I hadn’t done anyone an injury during the crossing. And that I hadn’t ended up alongside Grandfather at the bottom of the Atlantic. “You’re stalling,” Daniel said, jolting me out of my reverie. “If I’d known you were going to be such a prude, I would have come by myself and left you to rot with Mother’s stuffy friends.” It was true, our host and hostess were not the most modern of people. But they had been members of the undead for over two hundred years, so I found it excusable that they hadn’t exactly stayed current with the times. Spending another evening listening to stories about the death of Casanova was quickly losing its appeal. But I would have preferred that to a whore house. I’d never lain with a woman, even though I was as eager as the next seventeen years old fellow. Somehow the thought of a prostitute threw cold water on my desire. They all looked so world weary, even though some of the young women couldn’t have been much older than me. There was a dullness in their eyes that spoke of a numbing of the soul. As a mortal, I had dreamed that my first time would be with my wife, whoever she might be. But I had also dreamed that I would be allowed to marry for love and not to increase the family fortune. Or extend our bloodline. “Oh, for crying out loud,” Daniel grumbled. Striding over to the group of young women who were putting their wares on display, he plucked a girl out of the line. “Here,” he said, grabbing her by the arm. “She looks about your speed,” he said, shoving her in my direction. The girl took a few stumbling steps and then fell into my arms. She looked up at me with large, luminous blue eyes and said, “I’m sorry. Pardon me.” I helped her to her feet, unable to avoid noticing that she was quite lovely, like a pale flower in the moonlight. “It’s not a problem,” I assured her. “Are you alright?” “Yes,” she said, in a half whisper, blinking rapidly. “And I am happy to go with you. I’m happy to do whatever you ask. But you’ll have to be patient with me, sir, because…” She turned her head away from me to conceal her embarrassment and shame. “This is my first time,” she said in a voice that carried a small tremble. My first impulse was to protect her. I wanted to take her in my arms and fly away from there to someplace safe and clean. But then she leaned into me, as if a little unsure on her feet, placing a hand on my chest. I could smell the men on her. And not just from a night of customers, but days and days of sweaty sailors and straying husbands climbing on top of her and partaking of the service she provided. The main room of the bordello was illuminated by only one lamp and that light was covered with a red scarf. It was intended to look like part of the atmosphere, but I suspected it was mostly to make the girls appear a little younger and a little less worn than they would in the daylight. “I’m ready,” the girl told me, tentatively taking my hand. “As long as you promise to be gentle.” Using my night vision, I could see that she wasn’t actually a young girl at all. She wore her hair in a girlish style and she had a petite figure, but I would have placed her age closer to twenty-seven than seventeen. Sensing my hesitation, the young woman tugged on my arm again. “Don’t be bashful,” she told me. “We can experience this new adventure together.” “No, that’s okay,” I told her, gently disengaging my arm. “I wouldn’t want to turn anyone from a fresh flower to a soiled dove. Although I appreciate your willingness.” “You don’t want to share your first time with me?” she asked, somewhat surprised. Her innocence routine had obviously not been questioned too many times before. “No thank you,” I told her and then pressed a half-dollar into her palm. “I think you should probably leave this place while you still have your health.” “Oh, if only I could,” she said, allowing tears to fill her eyes. “But I have nowhere else to go. And no one to be kind to me.” “I’m sorry to hear of your troubles,” I told her, pressing another half dollar into her palm, “but I am not the right man for you.” I sensed she was about to continue to give me her damsel in distress routine, so I fixed her with my eyes and said, “Trust me when I tell you that I am not a person whom you would want to know more intimately. Now please leave me alone.” She stared at me for several seconds, not moving or even blinking, before saying, “I understand. And wish you an enjoyable evening.” Then she turned and quickly hurried out of the room. Daniel made a sound of disgust. “I don’t have all night to dawdle while you act fussy,” he told me. Grabbing a voluptuous red head by the wrist, he began towing her down the hall. “Wait for me, once you’re finished,” he called over his shoulder. “I might go back for seconds.” “I’m sorry about Crystal,” the Madame said, stepping forward. The older lady had her hair piled high on her head and she had painted a red circle on each cheek as a substitute for any kind of blush reflex. “She’s new to our establishment and maybe a little too untested for your liking. But I’m sure we have plenty of girls who can please you,” she said, indicating the females like a butcher displaying a case full of meat. Glancing down the line of women and girls, I spied one female who had withdrawn into the corner, furthest away from the lamp. She was older than the others and standing at a peculiar angle that spoke of suppressed pain. I could tell just from looking at her that she was unwell. She’d done her best to cover her malady with plenty of rouge and powder, but I could detect her sallow skin underneath. Noticing my glance, the Madame perked up. “Has someone caught your eye?” she asked. “Yes,” I told her. “I’d be happy to get to know the young woman in the corner a little better.” The Madame frowned. “Are you sure?” she asked, arching an eyebrow in my direction. “Bernadette has been unwell lately, so maybe you might be happier with a different girl.” “No,” I told her with a polite smile. “Bernadette will suit me just fine.” The older woman shrugged. “You know your own mind, young man,” she said, then snapped her fingers at the female in the corner. “Bernadette,” she called. “Somebody give her a shove.” Another girl goosed her and Bernadette’s eyes fluttered. “Bernadette, you have a customer.” “Oh,” the woman said. “Oh, good. And such a handsome man to take an interest in me.” I could tell by the way she moved across the room that she was in immense pain, but she tried to carry it off as if she wasn’t. Bernadette did her best not to hobble as she led me down a dark passageway to the rooms where the girls plied their trade. Someone, presumably the Madame, had been burning incense to cover the stench of unwashed sheets and human misery. I had to wonder, if this was a high-class whorehouse, what were the low-class whorehouses like? The thought made me shudder. Mistaking my actions for trembling, Bernadette squeezed my arm. “Don’t worry, sweetie,” she said. “I’m not going to judge you. You can be as quick as you like.” Chapter 21 Colette Our mother picked us up from school the next afternoon and drove us out to the castle. “It doesn’t seem right for you girls to arrive on bicycles,” she said, “when applying for work in such a fancy home.” Lilly and I did our best to clean up in the back of the car while Mama drove. I was so nervous I was practically shaking. We were going to go inside the castle. Sure, it was only the servants’ entrance, but still, we would be inside. I should have been tired because I kept waking up all night with crazy, and wonderful, and frightening dreams, but I was too excited to feel tired. In fact, all day at school I was practically bouncing off the walls. As we drove up to the castle, I was surprised to see a gate was being erected around the building. I guess that was probably to keep the family’s vicious dogs from running wild. I hadn’t said anything to my family about the dogs. I didn’t want to risk that my parents would refuse to let us work at the castle, just because of some unruly pets. The Vanderlind family must have recently moved in because there was already a guard in purple livery attending the area where I assumed they would eventually erect the gate. “Yes?” he asked. He had a heavy accent that I couldn’t identify, so the word came out more like, “Ves?” My mother stared at him for a moment, not sure what to say and then eventually found her tongue. “My daughters were asked to come by today to apply for positions as maids,” she said. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she was feeling a little intimidated. “Mrs. Denkler,” I called from the back seat. “We were invited here by a Mrs. Denkler.” The guard’s face registered immediate recognition of the name. “Drive through,” he told Mama in a somber voice. “Go to the right. Knock on the door for deliveries.” Once Mama had parked the car, Lilly and I climbed out and straightened our skirts. “Just remember to be polite,” Mama instructed us. “And be honest about your work experience. I’m sure they would appreciate honesty above anything else.” We both assured her that we would. As we approached the door with the deliveries sign posted on it, Lilly suddenly turned around and took a few quick steps back toward the car. “Mama, aren’t you going in with us?” Her voice had gone up an octave and she suddenly sounded about ten years old. “No,” our mother said, shaking her head a little. “You’re both old enough to apply for a job without me standing over you like a mother hen.” But then she looked at Lilly’s anxious face and added. “It’ll be okay, Lilly. I’m sure everything is going to be fine.” “Why did I let you talk me into this?” Lilly said in a low voice as we both stood in front of the door. “Aren’t you excited?” I asked, confused by her behavior. I was practically jumping up and down. “No,” she said, emphasizing the word by shaking her head rather adamantly. “I was a little excited, when we told Mama and Papa, but I don’t know…” she said, her words trailing off. “It’s just… I just have this horrible feeling of dread. Like we’re going to go into this ugly old building and never come out again.” “Oh, come on, Lilly.” I silently thanked my lucky stars that I hadn’t mention the dogs or I would have never gotten her out of the car. “Mama’s waiting for us right outside the door. I think she’d call the police if we didn’t show up after a couple of hours.” “I know,” Lilly said. “But…” “But what?” I asked, extending my hand to ring the bell. “Wait,” she said, grabbing my arm. “I’m sorry, Colette, but I really don’t want to do this.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” I told her. “Of course we’re going to do this. We need the work. And I hear the castle pay is better than we could get anywhere else. I’m sure it’s much better than what you were getting at Zucker’s.” “I know, but…” I had never known my sister to be a shrinking violet, but there was a tremble in her voice. For whatever reason, she was extremely reluctant to go inside. “Come on, Lilly,” I said, putting my arms around her and giving her a squeeze. “I’m sure it’ll be fine. And if it’s weird, or creepy, or scary at all, we’ll turn right around and leave. I promise.” Lilly didn’t say anything. It was almost as if her feet where frozen to the ground. “Tell you what,” I said, desperate to get her moving. “If you do this for me, then I’ll agree to go to the dance with Lev next month.” My promise caught her attention. “Really?” she said, shifting her eyes in my direction. “Promise?” “Yes,” I assured her. “If you go inside with me and apply for the job, I promise I will chaperone you and Walter under the guise of being Lev’s date.” Some color came back to Lilly’s cheeks. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll go inside. But I don’t promise I’ll take the job.” I reached over and rang the bell. A few moments later the door was opened by a young woman with a friendly face and fair hair that was pulled back into a bun. She was wearing a black dress and a frilly white apron. “Yes?” she asked with a smile. “Hello,” I said. “Mrs. Denkler is expecting us.” “Oh.” She smiled some more. “Are you here about the housemaid positions?” “Yes?” I returned her smile and nodded my head several times. She opened the door wider. “Come on in,” she told us. “I’m Millie. I just started working here, so if you have any questions, don’t ask me,” she said with a laugh. I felt a shiver run through me as I stepped over the threshold and into the castle. I don’t know why, we were simply entering a dark hallway which led to a mudroom, but something about just being inside the building, filled me with a tingling anticipation. As we followed the young maid through the mudroom and down another hall. I tried to keep a little ahead of Lilly, in case we were set upon by a pack of unruly dogs. But we were not assaulted. We simply entered a modest room that contained a small couch, a desk and a few chairs. “Wait here,” the young woman told us. “I’ll go and find Mrs. Denkler.” Neither of us felt comfortable enough to sit down. So we stood there, feeling awkward. “She seems nice,” Lilly eventually said, probably only to break the silence. “Very,” I said, just to say something in reply. “Sorry about being so silly outside. I just felt such a wave of dread. It was like nothing I’d ever experienced before,” my sister told me. “It’s okay.” I reached over and squeezed her arm. “Maybe your lunch didn’t agree with you.” This made her giggle, which made me giggle. We tried to suppress our mirth, but then we’d look at each other and start snickering again. I knew it wouldn’t be a good idea for us to titter our way through a job interview, but I was just so nervous that I couldn’t help myself. Just then the door opened and Mrs. Denkler entered the room. We both stopped giggling immediately. In my excitement to see the inside of the castle, I’d forgotten how intimidating the housekeep actually was. “I was expecting you earlier,” was the first thing Mrs. Denkler said. “We were at school,” I told her. “But classes end after next week.” “And will both of you be returning to school in the fall?” she wanted to know. “My sister, Lillian, is graduating,” I said, gesturing to her by way of introduction, “but I have one year left.” “I suppose if you had a job that paid you well enough, you wouldn’t feel the need to return,” Mrs. Denkler said. It was more of a statement than a question, so I said nothing, even though I had every intention of returning to school in the fall for my senior year. The housekeeper looked me over from head to toe. “It’s so very important when running a great house like the Vanderlind household to hire the right kind of staff,” she said. “Some housekeepers advise to only hire plain girls. Especially when the family has sons to consider.” I couldn’t tell if she was trying to insult me or pay me a compliment. “And yet still I am tempted,” she said, putting a finger to her lips and staring at me intently. “I can’t help but noticed the resemblance” she murmured, half to herself. “It’s quite striking. Especially the hair.” She made a gesture as if she was about to reach over and touch my head, but then she thought better of it and retracted her hand. Lilly glanced over at me and I tried not to return her look. I so very desperately wanted to see the entire interior of the castle and working there seemed like the very best way to accomplish that dream. “I wonder if anyone will notice but me,” Mrs. Denkler said, biting the side of her lower lip and then immediately releasing it. “If the master was still alive, I am sure he would see it in an instant. But we were of that age.” She looked very sad for a moment and I thought I saw tears brimming in hers eyes. But then she cleared her throat and said, “I doubt anyone else will notice.” And then she asked me, “I don’t suppose you have any Hungarian blood?” I wanted the job so desperately that I almost blurted, “Yes, we have,” but then I remembered how our mother had instructed us to be honest, so instead I said, “Not that I know of.” “It’s a pity,” Mrs. Denkler said with another sniff. “That would have at least explained it.” I still had no idea what she was talking about so I just smiled and gave her a nod. And then the housekeeper thought of something. She looked deeply into my eyes. “Do you ever have dreams that are not your own?” she asked. “Do you have glimpsed memories that don’t seem to belong to you?” “Uh… No,” I replied, truthfully. Her line of questioning was starting to make me feel unsettled. Turning her sharp eyes on my sister, the housekeeper said, “Your name is Lillian Gibson, I presume. The resemblance is not as strong in you.” “I’m Lilly Gibson,” my sister managed to say. “How do you do?” “I’m Mrs. Denkler,” was the housekeeper’s response. “You will be issued two uniforms and four aprons each. You are expected to take care of your own uniforms and your appearance should always be flawless,” she informed us. “Now, if you don’t have any questions, “I’ll summon Millicent to show you your duties.” My stomach did a flip. “You mean you’re hiring us?” I stammered. “You can start the Monday after your school ends next week,” the housekeeper said. “But don’t you want to ask us any questions?” Lilly wanted to know. “About our past work experience or… anything?” That’s what we had been expecting, at least. “I’m sure your duties will not be too much for you,” Mrs. Denkler said, her lips drawn into a tight, flat line. “If they are, you’ll be discharged without a reference.” She pulled a small watch on a chain out of her dress pocket and glanced at it. “I really don’t have time for any more questions. Wait here and Millicent will look after you,” she said, before abruptly turning to leave the room. “Will any of our duties involve caring for the dogs?” I asked, before Mrs. Denkler had a chance to disappear. I desperately wanted the job, but I wasn’t a fool. All of the workers had been so adamant about some type of dangerous animal. I couldn’t expose my sister and myself to the risk of being mauled. The housekeeper gave me a sharp look over her shoulder. “What dogs?” she asked. “I hope you are not the kind of girl who is always asking ridiculous questions.” And then she left before I could assure her that I wasn’t. Lilly and I stared at the door for several seconds after she left and then turned to exchange looks. “I guess we’re hired,” my sister said, appearing as mystified as I felt. “I guess.” It seemed a very odd way to hire someone. “Do you think Millicent is the same Millie that answered the door?” Lilly shrugged. “We’re about to find out.” A few moments later and Millie rushed into the room. “Congratulations,” she exclaimed. “I knew Mrs. Denkler was going to hire you, just as soon as I saw you. I just knew it.” “Thank you,” we said in unison. “Oh, I’m so happy.” She really was beaming. “It will be so nice to have other servants around here who can actually speak English.” Chapter 22 Jessie The room itself was small, but not miniscule. There was a fringed shawl hanging over the window and another across the bed in an attempt to make the place look a little less down-at-the-heels. Another red scarf festooned the globe shade of a lamp which sat on the bedside table. The lamp was electric, but had obviously been converted from oil at some point in the last few decades. Bernadette took the shawl from the bed and draped it over the back of a chair with great care. I could tell at a glance that it had been hand embroidered. Then she eased herself onto the bed. “Is there anything you’d like in particular?” she asked, patting the open spot next to her on the mattress. “Any fantasy you have for your first time?” “Actually,” I said, taking a seat on the room’s only chair, but being careful not to disturb the shawl, “I won’t be joining you. Although I greatly appreciate the offer.” “Oh.” A look crossed Bernadette’s face that I couldn’t interpret. It was either surprise or relief. Possibly both. “Do you like to watch?” she asked, leaning back on the bed slightly and letting one of her hands drift over to her thigh. “Is that what you want?” “Actually, what I really wanted was someone to talk with while I wait for my brother,” I told her. “But please don’t be concerned; I’ll pay you for your time.” “Oh,” she said, sitting up a little. “You’re one of those.” “One of what?” I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral, although feeling slightly offended. “You want my life story, I suppose,” she said, her eyes growing a little angry. “You want to know how I managed to become such a downtrodden whore.” “Not particularly,” I told her. “We don’t have to talk at all, if you don’t want to. We could always play cards for awhile, if you have a pack.” Bernadette gave me half a smile and turned her head to view me out of the corner of her eye. “Cards?” she said. “You want to play cards? That’s a new one.” “We don’t have to play cards,” I told her. “But you said you’d rather not talk and I was trying to think of a way to fill the time.” “You’re too good looking to be in a place like this,” she told me. “I’m sure plenty of girls would give you a tumble for free.” “My brother wanted to come here,” I informed her. “If I’d known what he had in mind, I don’t think I would have joined him. “You a funny fellow?” she asked. “You prefer roughhousing with the boys. Is that it?” “No, I prefer girls,” I assured her, taking in her meaning. “But…” I was about to say too much, then decided I would anyway. “But I’d like to wait for someone special.” This made her smile. And this time it was a full, genuine smile. “You’re a romantic,” she said. “I thought all of your kind had died out defeating the Kaiser.” I smiled back at her, a genuine smile of my own. “I guess there are a few of us left.” Bernadette tried to sit up on the bed in order to speak with me more easily, but something must have twinged in her back because she grimaced and then quickly tried to cover it with another smile. “What’s wrong with your back?” I asked her. “Nothing,” she insisted, sitting up a little taller. I lowered my chin and gave her a steady look, so she shrugged. “Okay, there was this fellow who came in a couple of weeks ago. He got a little rough and now I can’t walk straight.” “Have you seen a doctor?” I asked, rising from the chair and walking over to her. “There’s only one kind of doctor that comes to a whore house,” she told me. “And bad backs aren’t his specialty.” “Would you like to stop working here?” I asked. “I mean, if you could.” She gazed up at me, but still managed to keep her eyelids heavy. “You’re going to save me?” she said, and then suppressed a laugh. “That’s Crystal’s racket, not mine. She’s been saved by not-so-virtuous men a dozen times since she started working here. Although she’s getting a little old for that scam now.” “I can’t save you,” I told her, in all honesty. “I could possibly provide you with the means, but you’d have to save yourself.” She thought this over for a minute. “I wonder…’ she said, half dreamily. But then her eyes cleared. “Nah,” she told me. “It’s a nice thought, but I’m too busted and worn out at this point to even try.” Then, with a sigh, she added, “But you’re a sweet boy for offering.” “I could at least try to fix your back,” I offered. “If you’ll let me.” Bernadette looked me over. “You’re too young to be a doctor. And don’t tell me you’ve got a magic willie.” I couldn’t help but laugh at her crassness. “No, it’s not magic,” I told her. “At least I don’t think it is.” This earned me a laugh in return. “But my grandfather was a scientist of sorts and he made a kind of tincture that I think might help you.” “Tincture?” she repeated. I could tell she was beginning to grow suspicious. “What kind of tincture?” “It’s for pain,” I told her. “And it’ll help you relax so that all your bones and joints can settle back into place.” I was standing quite close to her at this point and suddenly Bernadette looked alarmed. “Thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I need any kind of tincture,” she told me. “In fact, I don’t think I’m your kind of girl at all. You’d probably like Sally. She’s real pretty and I’m sure she’d drink whatever tincture you had in mind.” She tried to get to her feet. \"Why don’t I call for Bruno? He can get her for you.” “Sit down, Bernadette,” I commanded, looking her straight in the eyes. “There’s no need for you to be frightened,” I told her, gazing at her intently. “I’m not going to hurt you.” She smiled with relief, her body instantly relaxing. “That’s good. You frightened me there for a moment. You never know what some men are about.” “Close your eyes and open your mouth,” I instructed her. “Oh. This game,” she said. “I guess there are no true gentlemen left.” But she did as I instructed. Quickly I bared a fang and pierced the tip of my finger. Once a few drops of blood had formed, I placed them on her tongue. “Swallow that.” “What is it?” she asked, even as she was swallowing. A few seconds later she opened her eyes. “How do you feel?” I asked. Bernadette shifted from side to side, and then turned her head right and left a few times. There was a popping sound and then a few, quieter crunching noises. “Oh,” she exclaimed. “Something just shifted.” She placed a hand on the back of her neck. “Something’s different. I can feel it.” I stepped back, allowing her room to stand up. She moved cautiously at first and then with greater freedom. “I haven’t felt this good in years,” she said, giving me an amazed look. “What’s that stuff your grandfather made? He was a genius. You could sell that stuff and make a mint.” “Grandfather had his moments,” I assured her. “But I’m afraid his formula died with him. And that was the last of my supply. There isn’t anymore.” “Oh.” Bernadette looked at me with disbelief. “And you wasted the last of it on me?” “I didn’t waste it,” I assured her. “I shared it with a friend.” She moved around a bit more, testing her back for any residual pain. “That stuff is amazing,” she said. “I thought I was on my way to the grave, but now I feel like I might actually want to live.” “Do you want to live here?” I asked. “Not particularly,” she said with a shrug. “But what’s a working girl to do?” “You could get a little shop and live out of the back,” I suggested. “Maybe you embroider shawls. Maybe you raise chickens and sell the eggs. I bet there are a lot of things you can do.” Bernadette thought it over. “I guess I could give it a try,” she said. “The girls always want me to sew them some fancy flowers and things. And I’ve got a little money saved. Not much, but maybe I could rent a place and get some supplies.” I reached into my pocket and pulled out my billfold. Pulling out several bills, I folded them in half and handed them to her. “Hide this somewhere,” I told her. “Don’t let anyone know I gave it to you or I’m sure someone will try to take it away.” Bernadette gaped at the money for a moment and then concealed it in her clothing. “So you really are trying to save me.” “No,” I shook my head. “I told you before, I can’t save you. I can give you a bit of money to help you get started, but you have to save yourself.” Then I looked deeply into her eyes and held her gaze. “I believe in you, Bernadette.” “I’m glad,” she said, giving me a shy smile. “I think I’m starting to believe in me, too.” Sitting in the lobby again, the Madame came over to see if I was satisfied with Bernadette’s services. “Very satisfied,” I told her. “She’s quite a remarkable person.” The Madame sniffed. “She’s as good as any other whore, I reckon,” I engaged the woman with my eyes. “Bernadette might consider leaving here soon,” I told her. “If she decides to leave, then you will not impede her in any fashion. As a matter of fact, you’ll do whatever is within your power to help her. As you would with any of your girls.” “Of course,” the madam assured me. “I would do that for any of my girls.” I sat waiting for another three-quarters of an hour before Daniel reappeared. He looked smug, like the cat that had just swallowed a dozen canaries, and there was the faint smell of blood about him. Sitting down heavily next to me, he turned to look in my direction and said with a lascivious smile, “Now that was a bit of fun.” I shrugged, not sure what kind of reply he would expect from me. “Have you really never been to a bordello before?” he asked, tilting his head a little to get a better look at me. “No,” I said, in all honesty. I’d never even thought about going to a bordello. “You mean Grandfather never took you to one? Not even when you were mortal?” He seemed very surprised. When it was obvious my answer was still no, Daniel added, “That surprises me. He took me to my first whore house when I was sixteen.” I shrugged again. “Grandfather always did like you more than me,” I pointed out. “True,” Daniel said, and then he closed his eyes, emitting a contented sigh. After a quiet moment, he said, “Do you think Mother had anything to do with it?” “To do with what?” I asked. “Grandfather’s cabin boy.” “To do… how?” I asked, keeping my voice steady, even though inside I felt alarmed. I did not know how Daniel would react if he knew our mother had set up our maker to be discovered and tossed into the ocean. “To do with tempting him with a beautiful cabin boy and then arranging it so he was caught in the act.” I frowned and brought my eyebrows together. “Why would you think that?” “Because when we disembarked, Mother went through customs first,” he said. “And while I was waiting in line, I could see her talking to a wily looking fellow in a checkered suit. So naturally I was curious to know who he was.” I kept my face completely neutral while he spoke, as if listening to any ordinary story. Daniel went on with, “So as I was standing by myself, waiting for you and Emily, I saw that same fellow approach one of the ship’s stewards, and he was obviously looking for someone. A few minutes later, the steward brings forth a cabin boy. The same cabin boy that Grandfather was caught feasting upon.” “What did the man want?” I asked, trying not to sound too curious, but as someone who was simply interested in the story. “He told the boy that some long lost relative of his had died, leaving him a bit of money,” Daniel said with a frown. “You’re kidding,” I exclaimed. “Well… good for him. I’m glad something good happened to him after what he went through.” Daniel frowned some more. “But don’t you think that’s just a bit too much of a coincidence?” he asked. “I mean, he gets bitten on the neck by Grandfather and then magically inherits some money. The whole thing smells of Mother, to me.” “You’re probably right,” I told him. “She’s always had a soft heart. There’s a chance she felt sorry for the boy and set the whole thing up. I can ask her, if you like.” “Don’t worry about it,” Daniel said with a sniff. “Maybe she did and maybe she didn’t. My bet is she had a hand in it, but as long as she only gave him a few thousand, I guess it doesn’t really matter to me.” “Are you ready to go?” I asked, making motions like I was ready to get out of my chair. “Are you really ready to be off this early?” Daniel had to wonder. “I thought you’d probably be up for a second round and here you are, eager to go.” I was eager to go. I wanted to leave in a rather desperate way. And I didn’t just mean the brothel. I wanted out of New York as well. It wasn’t that I was tired of the sights, sounds and smells of a new city, but I wanted to be on my way to Tiburon, Ohio. I had been thinking about it pretty much incessantly since we’d arrived in America, when I could stop thinking about my belly. It wasn’t even homesickness for the castle, as far as I could tell. Something was calling me to that small Ohio town and I couldn’t wait to get there. Chapter 23 Colette “I’m so proud of you girls,” Papa exclaimed, gathering us both in a big bear hug. “Or should I call you young ladies now that you both have jobs and uniforms and everything?” And then he hugged us again. I loved the pipe-tobacco smell of him, although Mama only permitted him to smoke on the porch. “You should see the ballroom,” Lilly said to him. She’d been brimming with excitement, ever since Millie gave us a tour of the castle’s ground floor. “There are cherubs and goddesses painted everywhere, even on the ceiling. I’ve never seen anything so fancy.” Papa nodded, listening intently and beaming at us. “Now that’s something I wish I could see.” “They might have a family day,” Lilly told him, squeezing his hand and then swinging it back and forth. “So that the families of all the local staff can see where they work. At least that’s what Millie said.” Our father chuckled. That was the third time Lilly had mentioned the other maid since we’d told him the news of our new employment. “Sounds like Millie is your new best friend.” “You should see the library,” Lilly went on. “It’s a huge room with all this gold trim. And books stacked as high as the sky. I think the Vanderlinds probably have more books than the Tiburon Library and I’m not exaggerating. Lettie was over the moon.” “They might let you borrow some,” our father said, stroking my hair. “I’ve heard that the great houses of Europe frequently encourage their staff to borrow books from their libraries, if they have any interest.” Our tour of the castle had been so wonderful, it was almost dizzying. Every room was grander than the last. And we’d only toured the ground floor. “Downstairs maids are never allowed upstairs,” Millie informed us. “Mrs. Denkler is very strict about it.” “Are any of the upstairs maids allowed downstairs?” Lilly asked, half jokingly. “They can come down for meals and stuff,” was the reply. “But they all came over from Hungary and don’t really speak any English, so it’s not all that fun when they do.” “Maybe we can learn to speak some Hungarian,” I suggested. “I actually know a few words,” Millie told us. “My grandfather emigrated from there. That’s how I got this job. He walked over to the castle, knocked on the door, and introduced himself.” “What words do you know?” Lilly asked. Millie’s cheeks turned a little red. “Actually, most of the words I know aren’t appropriate for polite company,” she said in a low voice, and then giggled. “I guess by the time you get to the third generation, that’s all anyone remembers.” Lilly and Millie got on like a house on fire, but I was too busy thinking to pay attention to most of the chatter. Mrs. Denkler was such a peculiar lady and the way she looked at me made me uncomfortable. “Papa, who was Empress Elisabeth?” I asked when Lilly paused for breath. “I’m not sure.” Our father frowned a little and then smiled. “That seems a question out of the blue.” “It’s the reason we got the jobs,” Lilly told him. “The housekeeper thinks that Lettie looks like some royal lady who was stabbed by an anarchist.” “Oh.” Papa’s eyebrows rose high on his forehead. And then he laughed. “Well.. that is one of the more peculiar reasons I’ve ever heard for someone being offered a job.” Lilly bounced up and down, clapping her hands. “I can’t wait to tell Walter,” she exclaimed before dashing out of the room. “You don’t seem as excited as your sister,” Papa said, turning his full attention to me. “I’m excited,” I assured him. “Just in a different way.” If I was being honest, Mrs. Denkler’s comments about how I looked like an Empress who had been stabbed to death unsettled me a little. I’d never found the whole idea of reincarnation very appealing. I was me. I never liked the idea of being anyone but me. Or that I could possibly be just a recycled version of someone who had lived before my time. Chapter 24 Jessie Tiburon was a small town in the middle of Ohio, just like any other small town in America, I had to imagine. But there was something about it that felt so right to me. There was an indefinable magic that hung in the air like pollen on a spring day. Ever since I’d been transformed into a vampire, I found it hard to breathe. — Not that I actually needed to breathe anymore, but I felt a figurative tightness in my chest. — But as we arrived in Tiburon, in a motorcade of black sedans, I felt that tightness begin to dissipate. To my mind, becoming a member of the undead meant the end of my life. But being in Tiburon somehow made me feel like I had the chance to live again. I couldn’t have an ordinary life, but I started to feel that maybe I could somehow find happiness. Or maybe it was just the absence of Grandfather that lifted my spirits. He’d been a black cloud hovering over the family for my entire life. I hated to be the kind of ugly person who was made happier by another person’s demise, but Grandfather was an incredibly difficult man to be around. Plus the knowledge that my beloved sister would not face the same curse of immortality as the rest of us put joy in my heart. When my grandfather was a young man, the Vanderlind Castle was in the country. As he grew into a young man, Budapest also grew, expanding to the point that the castle was on the outskirts of town. By the time I was born, the city had swallowed up the open fields that had always surrounded the castle. Our home had become part of the metropolis. Even though Budapest was a city with many architectural beauties, the castle always looked out of place there. It wasn’t meant to be crowded on all sides by the bustle of urban living. That’s why, when I first caught sight of the castle as we made our midnight arrival in Tiburon, it really resonated with me. The castle appeared at home; more so than it ever had in Budapest. It felt like the structure was meant to be there, majestically standing on the shores of the Tiburon River. It felt like home. “My God,” Daniel exclaimed as we exited the cars. “Grandfather must have really been losing his marbles if he thought putting the castle here was a good idea. I’m surprised he didn’t relocate us to a swamp.” “Stop being such a sourpuss, Daniel,” our mother gently chided him. “You might find that you grow to appreciate country living.” My brother made a little snorting sound through his nose. “I know I’m immortal, but I doubt I’ll ever live that long.” Mrs. Denkler was there to greet us bearing three glasses of refreshment on a tray. I don’t know how she managed to arrange for the blood already. I hoped it wasn’t through anything unsavory. But the Vanderlind housekeeper was as fastidious as she was well-mannered. I somehow doubted that she would do anything illegal. “The house is almost completely ready,” she informed us, once we exchanged the most minimal of greetings. “Except for the chandeliers in the great hall. There have been some challenges there and I’m afraid they have yet to be hung.” “That’s quite alright, Mrs. Denkler,” our mother told her. “I have the foreman’s promise that they’ll be in place by tomorrow afternoon,” the housekeeper insisted. “That’s fine,” Mother said, trying to reassure her. “We’re just excited to be home.” Mrs. Denkler stepped out of the way so that she could gesture toward the front door. “Welcome back to your home.” It was so strange to wander the rooms of the castle, seeing each thing exactly in its place, as it had been back in Budapest. Mrs. Denkler must have had a photographic memory to been so exact. I only found the smallest of indiscretions as far as replicating the exact setup of our home. A few shirts that I liked to keep in a drawer had been hung up in the closet, and my cufflinks and shirt studs were in the wrong box. But that was all I could find. It was remarkable. Was Mrs. Denkler really that familiar with the intimacies of my room? That surprised me. Or maybe she was just incredibly intuitive. As dawn broke over Tiburon, I lay down on my bed, hoping to lose myself to a few hours of oblivion,— I had not yet accustomed myself to sleeping in a coffin — but rest did not come to me. I felt a great anticipation deep in my belly and the sensation prevented me from being able to lie quietly. I rolled around on the bed for a few hours, even attempting the first chapter of several books, before getting up and dressing. One of the benefits of the castle was its noticeable lack of windows. A member of the undead could climb from his coffin at midnight or at high noon and still have no fear of shriveling in the sun. I could hear a bit of commotion coming from downstairs, so I wandered down to see what was causing the hubbub. It was a dozen workmen in the great hall trying to suspend one of the enormous chandeliers that some relative had seen fit to purchase for the castle. Each chandelier was bedecked with over a thousand leaded crystals, which made the fixtures enormously heavy. The men had assembled scaffolding and a pulley system to hoist the chandelier up, inch-by-inch, to the vaulted ceiling. I didn’t envy them their task, but it was a marvel to watch. Many members of the castle’s staff were standing around the edges of the room in order to take in the spectacle. I strolled across the polished stone floor with my eyes glued to the dangling crystals of the chandelier. They were all singing as they swayed and clinked together. Their music caused me a pang of sadness. I would never again see the scores of rainbows created by the prisms when they were caught in direct sunlight. I heard a small gasp. It was like a whisper being carried by the wind. I turned my eyes to see a beautiful young woman with tresses of dark hair spilling around her shoulder. And then my world fell away. I could see nothing and no one but her. It was as if my world had been blank and this girl appeared to fill it. She was dressed in black with a white apron. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew her clothing was significant, but somehow that didn’t matter. Somehow, deep inside of me, I knew we were meant to be together. And she was looking at me too. Her eyes were glued to me and she wore the most astonished expression on her face. She opened her mouth and I thought she might speak to me, but then she looked up and started to scream. I had been so captivated by the beautiful creature standing before me that I didn’t realize the workmen had somehow lost control of the massive chandelier. It was crashing toward the ground, heading for the very spot on which I stood. If it hadn’t been for my lightning fast undead reflexes and my incredible ability to heal, I would have been squashed like a bug under a barman’s boot. Even still, I was knocked to the ground. The young woman came running toward me. “Somebody call a doctor!” Pointing toward one of the footmen, she commanded, “Call a doctor this instant,” as if she was the mistress of the castle. Kneeling down, she took my hand. The mere touch of her skin made me feel like my heart had started beating again. “Don’t move,” she said, in a voice that was so lovely it made me shiver. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” I told her, unable to tear my eyes away from her face. “You’re not fine,” she insisted. “You just had a massive chandelier nearly crush you. You’re lucky to still be alive.” “Very lucky,” I whispered, looking deep into her eyes of emerald green. “Because it allowed me to meet you.” She laid her hand to her cheek and shook her head a little. “Oh, how can you flirt at a time like this? I think you must be in shock.” She scanned my body with an assessing eye. “I hope you don’t have any internal injuries.” “I’m fine,” I insisted, trying to untangle myself from the giant arms of the chandelier. “Perhaps a twisted ankle, but that’s all.” My ankle felt fine, but I thought it would be too peculiar if I suffered no injuries at all. “I don’t think you should try to get up,” she told me, pressing her hands gently against my chest to try to coax me back onto the floor. “The doctor will be here soon, I’m sure.” I lay back for a moment, toying with the idea of allowing her to tend to me for a little while longer. But I knew that plan was ungentlemanly, so I decided it was better to get to my feet. “I promise you I am not injured,” I told her. “But perhaps you could be good enough to assist me to a chair.” “Yes, of course,” she said. As she said, put an arm around me to help me to my feet, I felt a moment of sheer happiness. “What is your name?” I asked as she helped me to a small loveseat. Once I was seated, she tried to pull away, but I held onto her hands so that she was forced to take the seat next to me. “Colette Gibson,” she told me. “But most people call me Lettie.” “Colette Gibson,” I said, tasting the words in my mouth. “It’s a great pleasure to meet you, Miss Colette Gibson,” I told her. “I’m Jessie Vanderlind.” “Vander…” The girl gulped. “It’s very nice to meet you, Mr. Jessie Vanderlind.” Then she added, “But I’m horribly concerned that you’re injured. Are you sure you’re not feeling any discomfort?” she asked, her lovely brow furrowing slightly. “I feel wonderful,” I assured her. “If I wanted to, I’m sure I could fly.” Chapter 25 Colette The week before school let out was excruciatingly long for me. I wasn’t even sure how I got through my final exams. In between studying, I looked up the Empress Elisabeth in an encyclopedia at the school library. It took a little research, but I finally managed to find a photograph of the Empress of Austria, who was also the Queen of Hungary. It was a snapshot of her on her coronation day, back in 1867. She was a beautiful young woman with a curvy figure. Her neck and hands were dripping with pearls and other extravagant jewelry. Her hair appeared to be dark brown in color and she had an abundant amount of it. But beyond the hair, I wasn’t sure how much the Empress and I shared in appearance. She was very beautiful, but she also looked a little forlorn as she gazed into the lens of the camera. Her eyes appeared plaintiff and solemn. It wasn’t how I imagined a person would look after just having a crown of diamonds and pearls placed on her head. I thought I might be a little happier about it. But then the encyclopedia went on to explain that she didn’t have a very happy life. And it turned out that the anarchist stabbed her simply because he had missed the opportunity to stab a Duke who claimed to be an heir to the French throne. He vowed to stab the next royal he encountered. Elisabeth was that unfortunately soul. Even staring at her photograph, I felt no connection to her. At least not in the way that Mrs. Denkler had implied. If anything, I felt a little sorry for her, as much as a cat can feel sorry for a king. No, I was positive there was no connection beyond that. I had to conclude that the whole concept of reincarnation was simply hogwash. Finally, after what felt like an excruciatingly long week, it was Lily and my first day as housemaids at the castle. We’d each been issued two black dressed as our uniforms. Mama had pinned and tucked them until they fit us perfectly. Lilly spent an extensive amount of time trying to tame my wild hair. The Empress probably was able to afford a personal hairstylist because her excessively long and quite curly hair had looked perfect for her coronation day. Mine just ended up barely staying piled on my head with a few dozen hairpins. Both Papa and Mama drove us out to the castle to drop us off for our first day at the castle. Papa brought along his camera and stopped the car on the long driveway, just outside the gate. “I want you to know I’m very proud of you girls,” he said as he positioned us so that he could make a photo with the castle in the background. “I’m sure this Mrs. Denkler has hired many a young woman to work at the castle in her day. And with the way the economy is, I’m sure there was more than one woman with experience who applied for the position.” Lilly and I stood still, and very close to each other, so he could make the photograph. “She must have seen something in the two of you,” Papa went on. “She must have sensed that you are proper young ladies and that you will do the Vanderlind Castle justice.” He cleared his throat. “And I hope you remember…’ “Okay, I think that’s enough, dear,” Mama said, touching him gently on the arm. “We don’t want the girls to be late. Especially on their first day.” Millie answered the door again when I rang the bell. “You don’t have to ring, sillies,” she said. “You work here now. You can just let yourselves in.” “I guess I just assumed the door would be locked,” I explained, fussing with my hair. Several of the bobby pins were already trying to make their escape. I think their plan was made easier by the excessive amount of hair lotion Lilly had applied. That made it simple for them to slide free. Millie frowned at the door and then looked back at us. “It hasn’t been locked since I started working here.” First thing we did was report to Mrs. Denkler. We found her in the hallway, just outside the kitchen. She looked us both over while fishing her watch from her pocket. Once she was satisfied that we were on time, she snapped the cover closed on the watch and said, “A housemaid’s hair should always be neat and tidy.” “I’m sorry,” I blurted, knowing her comment was aimed at me. “I seem to have put too much lotion in my hair and now it’s decided to rebel. I promise I’ll get it to behave better tomorrow.” Mrs. Denkler eyed my hair one more time before saying, “There are several things you need to know about the Vanderlind family.” She started walking and snapped her fingers at us to let us know we needed to keep pace. “The family keeps late hours,” she said. “They all suffer, to varying degrees, from a rare condition that makes them very vulnerable to the sun.” She glanced back at both of us to make sure that we were being attentive. “Because of this malady, they usually adjust their schedules to sleep most of the day and only get up when the sun is low in the sky or has already set.” That explained why we were told to arrive for work at ten o’clock. It had seemed a late hour to begin the work day. “You may be asked to work later in the evening on some occasions. This is to accommodate the family and we expect you to adjust your personal schedule accordingly.” Lilly and I exchanged glances. Millie mentioned nothing about odd work hours when she showed us around. I had to wonder what Mama and Papa would think. We’d planned on riding our bicycles to work in good weather, but I was sure they wouldn’t let us ride home alone after dark. “There is illness in the family,” Mrs. Denkler went on. “One of the sons, Arthur, suffers from hemophilia. It’s a rare blood disease and he needs blood transfusions several times a day.” “Isn’t that the same disease that the last czar’s little boy suffered from?” I asked. “The son from the Russian royal family who were assassinated during the revolution.” Mrs. Denkler spent a few moments assessing me with her stern eyes. “Yes, I know perfectly well of whom you are speaking and I believe it is similar,” she finally said. “Not much is known about the disease.” She continued walking. “As I was saying, Arthur suffers from hemophilia. Therefore the family is in constant need of blood to keep him alive. We have set up a small clinic in the back of the castle,” she informed us. “You can tell your friends and family, that if any of them care to donate a pint of blood, they will receive two dollars, a sandwich and some apple juice or coffee for their troubles.” Lilly and I exchanged another look. Two dollars was a full day’s pay for many people. We would both be earning just over three dollars for a full day’s work at the castle and those were considered excellent wages for untrained labor. “I’m sure we know a lot of people who would be happy to help out,” Lilly said, speaking up. “Unless...” She stammered a little. “I mean, is it very painful? Donating blood?” “Not in the least,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “And even if it was, with two dollars in your pocket, I should think most people would be willing to put up with a little pain.” We both nodded, not wanting to annoy her. “Arthur Vanderlind is not to be disturbed under any circumstances,” Mrs. Denkler said, eyeing us both. “Even entering his room is cause for immediate dismissal.” We crossed a large room where several men were hammering together a large piece of scaffolding. “Don’t bother the family at any time, but especially when they are resting. You are never to go upstairs unless directly ordered to do so by me. And you are never to address any member of the Vanderlind family, unless they address you first. Do I make myself clear?” Mrs. Denkler glared at us again. “Yes,” we both said in timid voices. The lady had to be close to seventy, but she was still very formidable. I wouldn’t have crossed her for ten silver dollars. “Besides, it’s not part of your duties to be in the bedrooms,” she said, leading us down a large hallway. “Your work is solely downstairs.” She opened a door and ushered us in. “Oh,” I said with a gasp of excitement. We were back in the library. The wonderful smell of books filled my nostrils. “You’ll get started in here,” she said, producing two feather dusters, seemingly out of nowhere. “Start at one end and work your way to the other. And don’t forget the top shelves, because I’ll check.” She turned to leave, but then paused. “I almost forgot,” she said. “It’s against the rules of the castle for the staff to wear any kind of personal adornment. That means no rings, no bracelets, no pedants, no jewelry of any kind. If I catch you wearing so much as a christening pendant, it’s grounds for immediate dismissal.” I had a silver and crystal pendant that I always wore. It was only about the size of a nickel and not very flashy in any way, but it was the prettiest thing I owned and I loved it. “So you mean something like this...” I began, indicating the pendant. “Is completely unacceptable,” the housekeeper told me. “If I see it around your neck tomorrow, you’ll be fired on the spot.” Then she left the room without another word. We both stood, gazing at the enormous room. It held more books than even a voracious reader could go through in a lifetime. “You must be in heaven,” Lilly murmured. “How are we are going to dust all of these?” I murmured back. Lilly smoothed her apron. “I guess we’ll start in one corner and work our way around,” she said. “It will probably only take seven or eight years.” “Yes,” I agreed with her, “but then the first books will be dusty again.” We both giggled. Then Lilly squared her shoulders and said, “Alright, I guess we’re housemaids now. Let’s get started.” We decided to make a game of it, with Lilly working along one wall and me working along another. They had those rolling ladders like in the Tiburon library, so it was easier to reach the books on the highest shelves. Lilly was much faster at dusting than I was because I wasted a lot of time browsing. I couldn’t help myself; there were so many intriguing titles luring me away from my task. My hair was in open revolt, expelling bobby pins whenever it saw the opportunity. I tried to collect them when they fell, hoping I’d have a chance to pin my tresses back up when we were given a break for lunch. I knew having my hair hanging down would not please Mrs. Denkler, but there was nothing I could do about it for the time being. After we’d been working for a couple of hours, the door to the library opened and Millie came in. “There you are,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere, but this castle is just so big that I kept getting lost.” “What is it?” Lilly asked, climbing down from her ladder. “Are we needed somewhere else? We’re not even half way through in here.” “No, it’s just that they’re hanging the chandeliers in the great hall and I thought you might like to see it,” the other maid told her. This news perked me right up and I descended my ladder immediately. “That’s definitely something I would like to see.” Lilly wasn’t so sure. “Are we allowed to stop working?” she asked. “I’d hate to get in trouble for shirking our duties on the very first day.” “Oh, the Vanderlinds won’t mind,” Millie insisted. “They’re all asleep, anyway. And I’m sure Mrs. Denkler won’t have a problem with it. She’s in there herself.” “Well…” Lilly thought it over. “Oh, come on,” Millie urged. “You have to see how massive these chandeliers are. They’re like the size of a car, with a million prisms hanging off of each one. They’re amazing.” The temptation was too much, so the three of us hurried back to the great hall. I could not believe the amount of scaffolding the men had built in order to raise the chandeliers. Taking into consideration the amount of ropes and pulleys they were using, I wouldn’t have been surprised if someone told me the giant fixtures weighed a thousand pounds each. I guess that was one of the benefits of living in a building constructed out of stone, you could hang heavy things off the ceiling. Millie was right about the chandeliers being magnificent. Even without sunshine lighting up the room, the prisms still practically glowed on their own. They made a delicate music bumping into each other as they swayed back and forth, each suspended from its own small hook. They were so beautiful; I couldn’t imagine owning just one of the little jewels, let alone having an enormous chandelier festooned with them. It looked like the entire staff of the castle was there, mesmerized while watching the first chandelier slowly inching higher and higher toward the vaulted ceiling. That’s why everyone was caught by surprise when one of the Vanderlinds appeared from above stairs and walked to the center of the room, craning his neck so he could take in the show. There was something about the back of the young man’s head that drew my attention. He was tall and well-formed with dark hair that was ruffled on top, as if he’d just gotten up after tossing and turning in bed for a few hours. He was dressed in a crisp white shirt and gray flannel pants that were obviously tailor made to fit him perfectly. One of the workmen hit a snag in the rope he was using to help hoist the chandelier. He called out a few words in a language that I didn’t understand. Some of the men stopped pulling on their ropes and others began pulling rather frantically. The chandelier began to sway harder and it tilted to the side. “Oh,” I exclaimed. I didn’t know what they were going to do to straighten it out. And I didn’t know how they were going to clean the chandeliers once they attached them to the vaulted ceiling. I glanced back down again and got the surprise of my life. The young man was looking directly at me. Suddenly I found it hard to breathe. His face was just so beautiful, with stormy gray eyes, pale skin and full lips. I felt like he wasn’t just looking at me, but that he was seeing into my very soul. Thousands of little shivers ran up my spine as I finally put a face to the young man who had been haunting my dreams. When I realized this, my mouth popped open. I wanted to speak to him. I wanted to just be with him, to stand by his side. It was like he was the only man in the world and I was the only woman. My fixation with the castle suddenly all made sense. I somehow knew that he would live there. It felt like his heart had called me to him and I was powerless to resist. In another instant I was screaming. The chandelier had somehow broken free from the ropes and pulleys. It was crashing toward the ground. And the young man who had just stolen my heart was standing underneath it. My piercing shriek startled him. He looked up and was only able to throw his arms over his head before the massive chandelier crushed him. Chapter 30 Colette People just stood there. It was as if everyone was waiting for someone else to do something. I had a moment of that myself. I kept thinking, I’m just a maid and this is my first day. Surely someone else will come to his aid. Someone in charge will take command of the crisis. But everyone was acting like they were frozen to the ground. And I couldn’t bear the thought of the poor young man suffering. So I hurried forward, shouting as I ran, “Call a doctor. Somebody call a doctor.” Dropping to my knees, I reached out to clutch his hand. Merely touching him sent a charge through me like I had grabbed a live wire. I’d finally met the man of my dreams and he was probably hemorrhaging internally. The thought made me want to shriek and burst into tears. But I had to be brave for him. If he was going to die, then I had to be there to comfort him during his last moments on earth. He’d stolen my heart and we’d never even have the chance to say hello. “Don’t move,” I said, trying to keep a tremor out of my voice. “We’re sending for a doctor.” “I’m fine,” he told me, sitting up. “You can’t be fine,” I insisted. “You just have a giant chandelier drop on your head.” This made him smile. “No, I really am fine,” he assured me. “I think maybe I just wrenched my ankle.” And shockingly, he was fine. I kept expecting him to collapse from internal bleeding, but somehow he’d only twisted his ankle. It was a miracle. My heart sang with joy. I helped him to a loveseat and we both sat there, holding each other’s hand. He introduced himself as Jessie Vanderlind. It was a name I knew I would be whispering in my dreams for the rest of my life. “Mr. Vanderlind,” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed, hurrying over. “I do hope you’re alright.” “Fine,” he said, only glancing briefly in her direction before returning his gaze to me. “Better than fine, in fact.” His eyes were shimmering gray clouds before a sudden spring shower. “I’m so glad to hear that,” the housekeeper said. “It’s quite the relief. I’m afraid in all the commotion, our new housemaid has forgotten her place.” “Her place?” Jessie mused, frowning at where I was sitting, as if he couldn’t quite make out the words Mrs. Denkler was saying to him. “She’s perfectly fine, I should think.” And then he asked me, “Are you comfortable? You’ve had quite a shock. Would you maybe like a glass of water?” I couldn’t believe he was asking about my well being. Of course I was alright. Besides the shock of almost seeing a man crushed to death by a thousand pounds of leaded crystal. And the fact that, in the few seconds between when I’d had first laid eyes on Jessie Vanderlind and when the chandelier had knocked him to the ground, I had fallen in love with him. “Get up, girl,” Mrs. Denkler snapped, grabbing me by the arm and hauling me to my feet. “You should be working, not lounging on a couch, harassing Mr. Vanderlind.” “She wasn’t harassing me,” Jessie insisted. “In fact, I was very much enjoying her company.” Mrs. Denkler pursed her lips together, giving me a fierce look. “Miss Gibson, I think it’s time you got back to work.” She raised her head and looked around the room. “Everyone who wants to keep their job should get back to work immediately.” People started hurrying out of the room. “Come with me, young lady,” the housekeeper snarled, still holding my arm in a vice-like grip. I was marched back to the library, where Lilly was already ensconced, furiously dusting, pretending that she’d been there the entire time. Mrs. Denkler released me, practically thrusting me from her side. “I knew it was a mistake to hire such a pretty girl,” she said. “It always is.” “Please don’t fire me, Mrs. Denkler,” I said. It would have been so humiliating. I didn’t know how I would face my parents. “I promise I won’t goof off ever again. I’m a good worker, I swear.” “I’m not so much worried about your work ethic as I’m worried about you making eyes at the Vanderlind boys. I know they’re rich and handsome, but trust me when I say that boys like that aren’t for the likes of you.” I looked down, feeling like I might burst into tears. She was right. I was being an idiot. Someone like Jessie Vanderlind would never even consider someone like me. He lived in a castle and I worked at the castle. Even when we were in the same room, we were still a million worlds apart. “I know,” I told her, unable to raise my voice much louder than a whisper. “I’m not going to let you go,” Mrs. Denkler said, after giving it some serious thought. “You remind me too much of…” She shook her head. “Well, that is neither here nor there. But I will say this; you are not to speak with Jessie Vanderlind. You are not to flirt with him. You are not to even gaze at him from a distance. If you are cleaning a room and he steps inside it, then you must immediately vacate that room and report directly to me. Do you understand?” “Yes.” “I’m just telling you this for your own good,” she informed me. “You’d think a girl your age would have more sense than you do.” “I understand,” I said, doing my best to keep my voice steady. Mama and Papa hadn’t said anything directly to us, but I’d overheard them talking a few nights ago while they were both drying the dishes. Papa hadn’t had any real work in over two months. The extra money we would be bringing home was really going to help. “I’m lucky to have this job,” I told her. “Yes,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I suppose you are. And I’m happy to let you keep it, just as long as you remember your place. Jessie Vanderlind is a very engaging young man when he wants to be, but just remember what I told you. He is to be left alone. Even if another giant chandelier comes crashing down on his head.” Chapter 26 Jessie I went back to my room and sat down on the bed. It felt like someone had just socked me in the stomach. The world was not fair. That much was obvious. If the world was fair, then I would still be human. That way I would be at liberty to fall in love with Miss Colette Gibson. I could woo her, and win her, and marry her. Then I could take her in my arms and kiss her and not fear that I would lose control and rip out her throat. But the world wasn’t fair. And I could not allow myself to fall in love. I thought about instructing Mrs. Denkler to let the girl go. There would be some kind of compensation, of course, but the smart thing to do would be to bar Colette from the castle. But I somehow couldn’t bring myself to do it. And why should the young woman lose her position just because I found her attractive? But it was more than finding her physically beautiful. The way she rushed to my aid when everyone else was standing and staring spoke of a kind heart, a brave heart. And when she’d clasped my hand, the sensation I’d felt was like nothing I’d ever experienced. It was like nothing I’d ever read about in books. Love at first sight always sounded so foolish to me. You couldn’t fall in love with someone after just looking at them. Love was built on knowing someone and having shared experiences and finding out you had a million little things in common. Love at first sight was just an expression perpetuated by novelists and palm readers. But all of my strongly held convictions about love melted away with the knowledge that a girl like Colette Gibson existed in the world. I said her name over and over again and it was ambrosia in my mouth. I kept playing the few brief moments we had spent together over and over again in my head. It felt like I would never be able to stop thinking about her. I rose from my bed several times to find her and then sat back down again. Seeking Miss Gibson would not be a good idea, but it was as if my body had a mind of its own. Any practical decisions I made were quickly overruled. When would Colette be done working for the day? I was half tempted to ring for Mrs. Denkler to find out. But I instantly knew that was a bad idea. Denkie was very protective of the family. If she sensed that I was unduly attracted to the girl, she would fire her on the spot. No, I had to keep my feelings to myself. I had to find a way to deny them. There was no one in which I could confide. I had to find a way to deny my love all on my own. After an hour of just staring at the wall, there was a gentle knock at my door. “Come in,” I called. In walked my sister. “Hello, brother,” she said, hurrying over and bestowing my cheek with a kiss. “I heard what happened with the chandelier and I wanted to check on you. Are you hurt?” I gave her a quick squeeze, trying not to think about how I had yet to eat that day. “I’m fine,” I assured her. “But I guess it’s fortunate that Grandfather turned me when he did or I would have been squashed like a bug under the heel of a boot.”",

It wasn’t the idea of a strong man, but the lightning strike of love had made me weak. “If I asked you to do something for me, would you be able to keep it a secret?” “What kind of secret?” Emily asked, her eyes instantly shining. “It’s not that big of a secret,” I told her, just something I’d like to keep from Old Denkie.” After a bit of thought, I added, “And probably Mother and Daniel.” “I can keep a secret,” she assured me. “I promise,” she said, crossing her heart. “Now what is it?” “I want you to find out what you can about a girl. She’s a maid that just started working here. But I want you to be very discrete.” “What do you want to know about her?” Emily asked, squirming a little with the excitement of her task. “Not much, really. I’d just like to know the days that she’ll be working here. And maybe the hours she’ll be working. And anything else you happen to find out.” “Because you like her?” Emily asked, wearing a big smile. “No.” I shook my head. “I’m not allowed to care about mortals anymore. You know that.” And then, before she could worry, I hastily added, “The only mortal I’m still allowed to love is you.” “So you do like her,” Emily said. “You love her,” she concluded with the perceptiveness of youth. “I don’t even know her,” I exclaimed. “If you’re going to let your imagination run away with you, then I’m sorry I asked. Please forget that I said anything.” “No, I’ll find out for you,” she said, giving me a sly look out of the corner of her eye. “I want to find out. And I’ll be clever about it. I promise.” With that, she got to her feet and started heading for the door. “Oh,” she said, stopping abruptly. “But you have to tell me; what’s her name?” I suppressed a sigh before telling her, “Colette Gibson.” Chapter 27 Colette Lilly and I were in the mud room, taking off our aprons and getting ready to head home for the day. We’d spent most of our afternoon finishing up the library. The time passed as a blur for me. I couldn’t even focus on the titles of the books I was dusting. All of my thoughts were consumed by the memory of Jessie Vanderlind. Part of me felt like I should apologize to Lilly. I had thought her tunnel focus on spending time with Walter had been foolish and a little immature. But just a few minutes with Jessie Vanderlind had made me realize that I was wrong. I knew nothing about him, yet all I wanted to do was be with him. Before that moment, I had never understood how deeply people could love. When I first looked into Jessie Vanderlind’s eyes, the first instant that I saw him, I felt like there was a violin string running through my body and someone had plucked it. I could still feel it vibrating, deep in the very core of me, even thought I hadn’t seen Jessie for hours. The door opened and a young girl stepped inside the small room. “Hello,” she said to me, giving me a hesitant smile. “Hello,” I said in reply. The girl looked to be eleven or twelve. She was very pretty with blonde, curly hair and large gray eyes. She wore a velvet dress and shiny Mary Jane shoes. I knew without guessing that she had to be a member of the Vanderlind family. No one else in Tiburon could afford such fine clothes. Maybe for a wedding, but not for just wandering around the house on a Monday evening. “What’s your name?” the girl asked. “My name is Lettie,” I told her. “And this is my sister, Lilly.” The girl smiled and tilted her head to one side. “Is Lettie short for something? Colette, maybe?” “That’s right,” I said. “What your name?” “I’m Emily,” she told me. “How do you do?” “How do you do?” I replied, suppressing a vague urge to drop a curtsy; she was so adorably formal. “How many days a week will you work here?” she asked. It seemed like an odd question, but I didn’t mind indulging a curious child. “We’re supposed to work ten to seven, every day, but Sunday,” I told her. “But Mrs. Denkler just told us this morning that we might have to work later some evenings.” “And you’re a maid?” Emily asked. Expanding her question to include my sister, she said. “You’re both maids?” “Yes,” I told her. “We’re both downstairs maids. And are you a Vanderlind? Or maybe the chauffeur.” “Yes,” she said with a broad smile. “I’m the chauffeur.” Then she hastily added, “But I’m also a Vanderlind. Jessie’s my brother.” Then her cheeks grew red for some reason and she dashed out of the room. I had to wonder what my brief exchange with Emily Vanderlind was all about. I couldn’t remember if she’d been in the great hall, watching the men raise the chandelier. Had her brother spoken to her about me? I immediately chastised myself for such a flight of fancy. Mr. Jessie Vanderlind would never have any interest in a girl like me. Mrs. Denkler had made that abundantly clear. “Come on. Let’s go,” Lilly said, breaking me out of my musings. “Papa’s probably waiting.” I had trouble sleeping that night. I kept waking up, thinking someone was in the room with us. It startled me to the point that I half considered waking Lilly. But I knew I was being foolish, so instead I got out of bed, put on my robe and went to sit by the window. The moon was only half full, so it was a perfect night to just sit and gaze at the stars. I’d heard that there were so many electric lights in New York City that the stars were washed away and you couldn’t really see them at night. That wasn’t the case in Tiburon. It was a small town. Actually, there were some houses on the outskirts of town that still didn’t even have electricity. I sighed, looking up at the sky. I’d always yearned for something outside of the life laid out before me. It wasn’t that I didn’t love my family and the house where we lived. I even enjoyed our modest town. But I’d always secretly pined for something more that I couldn’t place my finger on. And now that yearning had a name; Jessie Vanderlind. Movement in a nearby tree startled me a little and drew my attention. The trees were nothing but black silhouettes at night. I stared at the closest trees rather intently for several seconds. Was there something up in the apple tree, over toward the trunk? It was a dark form, but too large to be an owl or any other kind of bird. There was definitely a mass in the tree and I thought I had seen it move. I scanned the ground below the tree. I didn’t see a ladder or a car or anything. The apple’s lowest branches were too far up for anyone to climb up there without assistance. What in the world was in our tree? Feeling a shiver running up my spine, I drew the curtains and hurried back to bed. I knew I was being foolish, but I couldn’t shake the distinct feeling that someone or something was watching me. The next morning I slept in a little. I was tired from my bout of insomnia. One of the benefits of having a job that didn’t start until ten o’clock was that I didn’t have to get up at the crack of dawn. By the time I opened my eyes; Lilly had already gotten out of bed and opened the curtains. It seemed silly to be nervous about looking outside in full daylight, but I had a flash of anxiety. Whatever I had caught a glimpse of out the window during the night had seemed very real. But in the bright light of day, I felt ashamed of my cowardice. I forced myself to stand up straight and walk over to the window. There in the tree branches, where I had thought I’d seen a creature the previous evening, was a large squirrel’s nest. I immediately felt like a fool, but at least it explained why I’d seen movement in the tree. What it didn’t explain was how a sizeable squirrel’s nest had magically appeared overnight. And didn’t squirrels usually build their nests in the fall? I wasn’t a squirrel expert, but I didn’t think they did their building in the spring. I shrugged it off. I had always thought of myself as an observant person, but I’d obviously overlooked a large nest just outside of the window I gazed out of every day of my life. As I came downstairs, I could hear Lilly talking with our parents. “It’s because their one son has some kind of blood disease,” she was telling them. “I wonder what kind of disease that would be,” I heard my mother say. “It seems an awful lot of money.” As I walked into the kitchen, I heard my father shift his chair. “If they have the means, and don’t want to run out of blood, then it’s probably a smart move.” “I wonder how the poor dear managed to make the voyage from Europe, if he’s in such bad shape,” Mother said. Then she noticed me as I headed over to the breakfast nook. “Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” “I had trouble sleeping,” I said, helping myself to some toast from a plate. “Say, has anybody noticed the big squirrel’s nest up in the apple tree near Lilly and my window? It’s huge, but I don’t remember seeing it before. When did the squirrels build that?” “That’s been there for months,” my father informed me. “I’ve half a mind to knock it down.” “I don’t see how it’s hurting anyone,” Mama said in a gentle voice. She was of the strong conviction that my father didn’t have enough to do. He was always starting small projects and then letting them expand into giant tasks. “I hear Mr. Thorton is putting a new roof on his barn this afternoon. Maybe you could ride over after you drop the girls off and see what that’s all about.” Papa looked at Mama out of the corner of his eye. He knew she was worried that he’d end up cutting down the apple tree if he got started on the squirrels. “I guess I might as well leave the nest alone.” he said. “And Jim Thorton doesn’t know one end of a ladder from the other. I’d better go make sure he doesn’t bust his head.” Chapter 28 Jessie It was embarrassing to admit, but I followed Colette and her sister home. It was really more happenstance than anything intentional. I’d spent the day pacing in my room. I couldn’t get the vision of Colette Gibson out of my head and it was impossible for me to focus on anything else. By nightfall, I was restless and feeling like I needed to stretch my wings, so to speak. I headed to the castle roof. I figured no one would notice if I took a few laps soaring up and down the Tiburon River. I doubted there would be any fisherman around so late in the evening. There might be a few couples canoodling on the shore, but they would probably only have eyes for each other. As I looked over the edge of the castle roof, I could see Colette and her sister climbing into an automobile. It sounded like their father had stopped by to pick them up. I rose into the air as the car drove away, fully intending to stick to the waterway, but then I found myself following the Gibson family through the streets of Tiburon. I hid on a neighboring rooftop as Colette climbed out of the car, following her father and sister into an attractive house with a neat front yard. There was no distinction between the backyard and the open fields dotted with trees behind the house. After that I forced myself to fly back home. It would be inappropriate for me to spy on the family while they ate their dinner. I still missed sitting down to an evening meal each night. I wondered how long I had to be a member of the undead before I forgot how it felt to enjoy food that wasn’t blood red and in a cup. But after being home for a few hours, I found myself circling the Gibson house again, viewing it from all sides. I just wanted to be near Colette, but I knew there was no excuse for my behavior. I wouldn’t like it very much if there was some stranger sitting outside the castle, just hoping for a glimpse of Emily. So I decided to stop acting like a love-sick fool and go home. Giving one more glance toward the darkened house where a girl lived that I didn’t even know, I was shocked to see that very girl gazing out the window. There was no time for me to fly away before she would notice me, so I concealed myself in the branches of a tree. I knew she must have caught a glimpse of me because, after staring in my direction for several seconds, she swiped the curtain closed. I sat in the apple tree for at least an hour, never taking my eyes off the window. I wanted to make sure that no one was peeking out. Then I quickly gathered as many dead leaves and dried grasses as I could find, rolled it all into a ball and stuffed it into the crook of the tree where I had tried to conceal myself. It wasn’t the best deception, but it was the only thing I could think of to explain the dark figure that Colette had obviously glimpsed. I spent the next week trying not to think about Colette and failing miserably. It would have been one thing if she was just some girl I had seen through a shop window and found attractive. But I had spoken to Colette. I knew the music of her voice. She had rushed to my aid when she thought I was grievously injured. She had held my hand and tried to ease my pain, not realizing she was creating the excruciating pain of longing, just by doing so. And then the fates had arranged it so she was in my home six days a week, dusting, and polishing, and scrubbing at things. It was true that the castle was an enormous structure. It was easy enough to avoid someone else in the building, if that was what you desired. But I desired to be with Colette every minute of every day. Keeping away from her was exquisite torture. I was acting like an idiot. I knew that without a doubt. Colette Gibson was just a charming young woman who had caught my fancy. There was nothing more to it. I arose each evening with the new determination to forget about the pretty housemaid who probably thought no more of me than she did my brother. “Your sweethearts going to a dance,” my sister told me one evening after I had just gotten out of bed and made my way downstairs. Emily had become very good at engaging Colette in casual conversation, whenever she had the chance. I hadn’t asked her to pursue more information from the maid after my first request, but she somehow decided to take it upon herself. “She isn’t my sweetheart,” I told her in a stern voice. “And I’m sorry I asked you to find out about her in the first place. She’s just a young woman who works in this house and she deserves her privacy.” “So you don’t want to know about the dance?” Emily asked, her eyes a little wide with surprise. “No,” I told her, trying to make my voice sound firm, although inwardly I felt stung. I couldn’t imagine Colette going to a dance with any young man, but me. “You don’t want to know that it’s next Saturday night at the Mansfield Country Club in Mansfield, Ohio?” she said. I could tell that my sister was enjoying taunting me. “It’s none of my business,” I informed her. “And I want to hear nothing more about it.” The truth was I desperately wanted to hear about it, but knowing the details would do me no good. “And I suppose you don’t care that she doesn’t want to go because she doesn’t like her date,” Emily said, her voice teasing. “Why would she go if she doesn’t like her date?” I couldn’t help but asked. My little sister shrugged. “I guess she’s double dating with her sister and her boyfriend,” she said. “She wants to get out of it, but then her sister wouldn’t be able to go.” “Oh,” I said. This piece of information made me frown. Any man would be lucky to having Colette Gibson as his date, so I assumed her escort would behave like a gentleman, but that didn’t explain her reluctance to go. “There’s going to be swing music,” Emily went on. “Aren’t you a fan of swing music?” “I enjoy all types of music,” I muttered, still thinking about Lettie’s date. “Maybe you should get out some evening and go see a swing band,” Emily suggested with a suppressed giggle in her voice. I immediately understood what she was suggesting. “No,” I told her, shaking my head. “That wouldn’t be right.” “Why not?” Emily wanted to know. “Then maybe you could talk with her. Or even dance with her.” My little sister’s eyes started glowing again. “Come on,” she said, nudging my arm. “I know you want to.” “Emily,” I said, taking both her hands and bending down so that we were forehead to forehead. “I’m not going to any dance. Not a mortal dance,” I informed her. “You know that would be dangerous for everyone, including me.” “But you’re getting a lot better at controlling your appetite. Aren’t you?” she asked, leaning her weight slightly onto me. “I am, but a dance is not a place to test my new found self control,” I informed her, straightening my spine, but still holding her hands. “I suppose not,” my little sister said with a sigh. “It’s just that I like her so much. She’s really funny and she seems really nice.” Closing my eyes for a second, I indulged in a sigh of my own. “Can we please not talk about Miss Gibson anymore?” I really didn’t need any more confirmation about how wonderful she was. “She brings flowers to Arthur. Did you know that?” “What?” I opened my eyes and frowned at my little sister. “There have been a couple of days now where she shows up to work with a bouquet of wildflowers,” Emily reported. “I guess Colette and her sister ride over here on their bicycles. Sometimes she stops and cuts Arthur some flowers.” “Why would she bring Arthur wildflowers?” I was puzzled. Arthur didn’t even exist; not that she knew that. “I asked her the same thing.” Emily preened a little, pleased by her own cleverness. “She said that she hoped it might cheer him up a little to have some nature in his room. She said she felt bad that he was sick and couldn’t go outside himself.” “Oh.” I thought this over. “That’s very sweet.” And, unfortunately, it made me admire Miss Gibson even more. “She’s perfect for you,” Emily said. “I mean, really perfect.” “Perfect, except for one thing,” I reminded her, letting go of her hands. “We can never be together.” Chapter 29 Colette I didn’t know if Jessie Vanderlind was avoiding me or if he was never home. Or maybe he was always just in another part of the castle. Their home was so massive and the family usually slept so late, that it wasn’t unusual for us to never see any of them for days at a time. Except for the youngest girl, Emily. She seemed to be a morning person. She usually popped by to see Lilly and me at least once a day and frequently found a reason to spend time in whichever room we happened to be cleaning. She was a charming girl and I felt a little sorry for her. The rest of the family never seemed to be around, so she rambled the house by herself most of the time. Sometimes Emily would go to the back of the house where the makeshift clinic was set up to draw blood from the volunteers. She liked to put on a little apron and play nurse, chatting with the people and serving them sandwiches, along with something to drink. Word had started to spread around Tiburon that the Vanderlinds would pay good money and supply a meal in exchange for a pint of blood. The first few days only two or three people showed up and these were people who looked very down on their luck. But it didn’t take long before there was a line of people each morning as the nurses hired to draw the blood opened the back door. The clinic began using a signup sheet where people were supposed to write their names. But then it became clear that some of the people willing to volunteer were unable to sign their names, so rather than embarrass some poor fellow who was struggling, the nurses started listing the names themselves. It didn’t take long before the Vanderlinds had more blood than they could handle, but they never turned anyone away. We’d heard that some of the local hospitals were happy to take what could be spared and that rumor was confirmed by men in white jackets driving up to the castle in an ambulance and then leaving with chests packed full of ice. Lilly and I had only caught a few glimpses of the rest of the Vanderlind family, Jessie’s mother and brother. The brother, whose name was Daniel, was a lot like Jessie in general appearance, but he was made with less generous lines. His lips were thin and his hair was flat. He was somewhat handsome, but his features didn’t have the ample curves that Jessie’s had. No one ever saw poor Arthur, of course. He didn’t seem to ever leave his room and his isolation weighed on me. The real surprise was the mother. She didn’t look a day over twenty-five. In fact, she looked more like a sister than a mother to her two sons. She had raven black hair and a flawless complexion. “I wonder what she puts on her face at night to keep it so wrinkle-free,” Lilly said one day while we were having lunch with Millie. “You know, I asked her lady’s maid that very question,” Millie said between bites of a sandwich. “I’m not sure if she just didn’t understand me because of the language barrier, but she insisted that her mistress applied nothing to her face at all. She’s just naturally like that.” “Hmmm...” Lilly frowned. “I’m not sure I believe that. I bet she has some face cream from Europe that costs about a hundred dollars a bottle.” We didn’t have all that much to do as downstairs maids at the castle. Yes, we dusted quite a bit, washed windows, beat rugs, freshened drapes, and whatever else Mrs. Denkler could think of, but none of the things we were assigned to clean were actually all that dirty. If I found a thin layer of dust on any surface, it was always a surprise to me. There were only five Vanderlinds, after all, so it came as no wonder that there wasn’t much of a mess. Plus the family kept barely any kitchen staff. I’d only ever seen Emily seated for a meal. When I asked Mrs. Denkler about it, she said, “Not that it’s any of your business, but the family are practicing vegetarians. They eat very little, and their food is usually raw, so they don’t need a dozen chefs to prepare it.” Even with the peculiarities of the household, I loved working at the castle. The Vanderlinds had such beautiful things, and some of them appeared quite ancient. There were a few full suits of armor that we were assigned to oil one afternoon. We polished ornately carved chairs that were so massive, I thought of them as thrones. And they may very well have been thrones, for all I knew. But the best thing about working at the Vanderlind Castle was that it was where Jessie lived. Although I rarely caught a glimpse of him, I could feel his presence all around me and it kept the metal string running through my body vibrating all the time. “I’ve not been disappointed with your performance,” Mrs. Denkler told the two of us the next morning. Lilly and I exchanged glances. This was high praise from Mrs. Denkler. She went on, “As long as you girls don’t do anything silly, then I’d like to keep you on as part of the downstairs staff.” “Thank you, Mrs. Denkler,” we said in unison. I hadn’t even realized we were still under review. “If you keep up the good work, then after a period of six months you will receive a wage increase of fifty cents per day,” the housekeeper informed us. Lilly and I exchanged another look. That would be a whole extra dollar between us per day. That would be six dollars per week. Mama and Papa would be thrilled. “I’m afraid school starts in the fall,” Lilly felt the need to point out. “I can stay on because I’ve graduated, but our parents will expect Lettie to finish up high school.” “I could still come after school and on Saturdays,” I blurted. I’d been so happy working at the castle that it never occurred to me that I would go back to school. The housekeeper scowled at both of us. “That’s ridiculous,” she said. “Why would you waste your time at school when you already have good paying jobs?” “Our mother and father value education,” I had to admit, even though it pained me. I did not want to go back to school. I wanted to keep working. I wanted to be near Jessie. “I had not anticipated you leaving here so soon,” Mrs. Denkler said, scowling some more. “I might not be as happy with a new girl.” Then she looked me in the eye. “But you’ll stay until your school begins again?” I assured her that I was happy to stay. Since we were firmly established at the castle, Mama and Papa thought it would be okay for us to ride our bicycles to work as the weather grew fine. They were more concerned about us riding home as the sun was going down, so we had to promise to stick together and ride single file, even on the country roads. Some of the local boys liked to race their jalopies in the country and mother was constantly concerned that one of us might be knocked down by the reckless youths. We had to promise to pull off the road immediately if we heard the rattle of a car engine. Riding to work each morning was one of my favorite times of the day. I knew it was foolish, but I always held out hope that I would see Jessie. Not to speak with him or anything, but maybe just to catch a glimpse of him. The fields and meadows that we rode past on our bicycles were decorated with the cheerful faces of wildflowers. They reminded me of a dream I’d had the previous night where I was lying in a field, holding Jessie’s hand while the sun shone down on us and birds performed a serenade. It was a silly dream. Mrs. Denkler had made it clear that the Vanderlinds did not fare well in the sunshine. It made me sad to think about it, especially for poor Arthur. His life sounded very hard, always being confined to his room. “Hold up a minute,” I called to my sister, pulling over to the side of the road. “What is it?” she called, turning to look back at me as she slowed her bike. “Did your chain slip?” “No,” I told her, pushing down my kickstand and hurrying into the nearby field. “I just want to gather some flowers for Arthur, to cheer up his room.” “You’re not allowed in his room,” Lilly reminded me. “I know, but I can put them in a vase and the nurse can take them up the next time he needs a transfusion.” Lilly made a little noise of disapproval that she’d learned from our mother, but she didn’t try to stop me. “Just hurry up, please,” she said. “I don’t want to be late.” I quickly gathered what I could, laid the flowers in my bicycle basket, and then hurried to catch up with Lilly, who had already started pedaling, once she saw me returning to my bike. “What are those doing in here?” Mrs. Denkler asked, giving the flowers a disapproving look when I brought them in. “They’re for Arthur,” I explained. “I feel so sorry that he can’t enjoy the lovely weather we’ve been having, so I thought maybe I’d bring a little nature to him. Mrs. Denkler opened her mouth to say something, closed it again, and then frowned at the flowers some more. “I think there are some glass vases under the sink in the kitchen,” she said. “One of those should serve for wildflowers.” I knew this was the closest I was going to get to Mrs. Denkler’s approval, so I hurried to mostly unused kitchen. “Leave the flowers at the bottom of the stairs and the nurse will take them up,” she called after me. “And don’t take all day. You’re not being paid to fuss over flowers.” That night, Lilly and I were both rousted from our sleep by a commotion. The phone started ringing and a few moments later someone was pounding on the front door. “What is it?” Lilly wondered aloud as we both leapt out of bed to grab our robes. “I don’t know,” I told her. But then I sniffed the air. “Smells like smoke.” Then we both shivered. Somewhere there was a fire. The door to our room opened and Mama stuck her head in. “Girls, the school is on fire. Get dressed.” Before we could pepper her with questions, she shut the door again. Lilly and I looked at each other. “How did the school catch fire?” Lilly voiced the questions that I was wondering. After we both were dressed, we hurried downstairs to catch Papa just as he was leaving. He gave Mama a kiss and said, “It’ll be alright, Lillian,” and then he hurried out the door to hop in a car that was waiting for him. “What’s happening?” I asked, as soon as he’d left. “The school caught fire,” Mama told us. “Nobody knows how, but it’s a big one. Bundle up because we’re going to have to help with the line.” Tiburon had a volunteer fire department, of which our father was a member. But when a fire was quite large, every able bodied person was expected to help out, usually as a link in a bucket line. Citizens would form a line from the fire to the nearest well or pump. Then we would pass full buckets down the line to the firemen and bring empty buckets back up the line to be refilled. If the fire was very large, then several lines would form on several sides of the burning building. Most fires were handled by the volunteer firefighters, so when they immediately called for a bucket brigade, we knew things were not going well. We could see a weird orange glow in the sky as we got in the car. Even though we were some distance from the school, the smell of smoke filled the air. Mama drove along, cautiously, immediately pulling off the road if anyone was trying to get by. She didn’t want to delay any members of the fire department who were trying to catch up with the rest of the volunteers. “I think we’ll park at the library and then walk over,” she said as we approached the center of town. “That way we won’t be clogging up the roads.” Other members of the bucket brigade must have had the same idea because the library parking lot was almost full when we pulled in. “Come on, girls,” Mama said, immediately hurrying out of the car. “Stick together and stay out of the firemen’s way.” As soon as we saw the school, we simultaneously gasped. The entire building was engulfed in flames. Mrs. McGreevy, head of the bucket brigade, hurried over to us. “Come on. We’re wetting down the neighboring buildings to try to stop the fire’s spread,” she shouted over the racket of the fire. “If the wind picks up, the whole town could go.” We spent the next several hours passing full and empty buckets up and down the line. A few times the firemen thought they had the blaze under control, only to have it flare up again with the night wind. As dawn started to warm the sky, the fire quieted down and the bucket brigade was told that the fire department could handle things from there and everyone else should go home. No neighboring buildings had caught fire, but the school was just a smoking pile of ashes and cinders. “It looks like arson,” Papa said, late the next morning when we had all finally crawled from our beds. Mama called us in sick to the castle and Mrs. Denkler was apparently very understanding about the whole thing. “Looks like the entire perimeter of the school was doused with gasoline,” our father went on. “Thank the Lord Mr. Green wasn’t about or this could have been a real tragedy.” Mr. Green was the school’s janitor. He usually stayed there most evenings, but sometimes he went to visit his sister in Cincinnati during the summer. “What are they going to do about classes?” Lilly asked. “Where will everybody go in the fall?” Papa rubbed his chin. “That hasn’t quite been figured out yet,” he said. “Might be that school is just delayed until the town can get enough money to build a new one.” “Arson,” Mama repeated, shaking her head. “And the whole school gone. Who would do such a thing?” I was as upset as everyone else about the school, but also, secretly, my heart was singing. I’d received a reprieve. I’d be able to keep working at the castle. Chapter 30 Colette A few days after the fire, I left the house a little earlier than usual so that I could gather a proper bouquet of wildflowers. Mrs. Denkler frowned some more when she saw it. Shaking her head slightly, she said, “Just hurry up with that nonsense. Leave the vase at the bottom of the stairs.” “I’m so excited for Saturday,” Lilly told me later that day as we scrubbed the kitchen floor, even though it was already spotless. “Saturday?” I said vaguely. Was something happening on Saturday? I couldn’t remember. “It’s the dance,” Lilly exclaimed, giving me a look that let me know she thought it was an event that was impossible to forget. “In Mansfield,” she went on. “At the country club.” “Oh.” It was my turn to exclaim. “Is that happening already? I thought it wasn’t for a few more weeks.” “It’s this Saturday,” my sister said in a voice that let me know that she was going to brook no excuses. “I’ve already asked Mrs. Denkler if we can leave early.” “Oh,” I said again. “What did she say?” “Well, she didn’t like it, but she agreed,” Lilly told me. “Just as long as we come in early on Monday to make up the hours.” “That’s nice,” I said, although even I knew there was no enthusiasm in my voice. Lilly stopped her scrubbing and turned to look at me. “Aren’t you the least little bit excited?” she asked. “I haven’t exactly thought about it,” I told her, keeping my eyes on my work. Truth be told, I had thought about it from time to time, but always with a vague feeling of dread. “You’ll probably feel differently with Lev twirling you around the dance floor,” she told me. “I doubt that,” was my reply. “Are you sure he wouldn’t rather take some other girl? I mean, we could always say I twisted my ankle and then maybe...” I searched my brain for a substitute that Lev would find acceptable. “Don’t even think about it,” Lilly told me. “You are not spraining your ankle. I agreed to go to the job interview here just so you would agree to go to the dance. Now I’ve held up my end of the bargain and it’s time for you to hold up yours.” “But you like working here,” I insisted. “That’s beside the point,” she informed me. “You agreed to go with Lev Wilson to the dance at the Mansfield Country Club, so you are going and you are going to have a lovely time.” There didn’t appear to be any way to squirm out of it. Lilly could force me to go to the dance, and I wouldn’t sulk or anything, but with Lev as my date, I highly doubted the evening would be enjoyable. Not unless Lev caught laryngitis. Lilly and I each had an organdy dress from a year earlier, when our mother’s youngest sister got married. We’d both grown a little since then, but when my mother made the dresses, she’d included a generous seam allowance. She was able to let both dresses out and lower the hems so that they fit perfectly. Lilly took extra time on my hair and managed, with the aid of hair tonic and about a hundred bobby pins, to fashion it into an upsweep that both she and Mama said was quite becoming. Papa had out his camera and took our picture before the boys came to get us. Walter and Lev arrived looking freshly scrubbed, but it was obvious they were both in borrowed suits. Lev’s was a little too small and Walter’s was a little too big. I wondered if they would have been better off just switching what they were wearing, but I wasn’t going to say anything. I noticed that this time Lev’s right cheek had a faded yellow bruise on it and he had more plasters on his knuckles, which he tried to conceal by keeping his hands clasped behind his back most of the time. I didn’t know what kind of roughhousing he and his friends got up to, but they seemed a little too old for such violent hijinx. “Here,” Lev said, thrusting a box at me. “I got you something.” Inside was a wrist corsage with a single pink rose, surrounded by baby’s breath and tied with a pink ribbon. “Thank you,” I said. It was my first corsage and it was actually quite pretty. I only wished it had been given to me by somebody else. Anybody else, really. Lev shrugged, as if it was no big deal. “I know girls like flowers and this reminded me of you.” Walter presented Lilly with a nosegay of wildflowers, clumsily fashioned with a yellow ribbon. I knew she had secretly been hoping for a corsage of her own, but she acted like he had just handed her an emerald ring. Papa wanted to make another picture, but he was all out of film, so we piled into Lev’s new car with our dates undocumented. Lev got the door for me. He hadn’t said much since arriving to pick us up and that made me feel a little better about the evening. Maybe it wouldn’t be so miserable after all. “The Charlie Barnet Orchestra is going to be playing,” Lev told me as he drove us along. He kept the car at a reasonable speed and was considerate of other motorists out for an evening drive. “Barnet is almost still a kid, but I hear he’s a genius on the saxophone.” I began to actually look forward to the evening. I did like to dance, and swing bands were starting to be popular on the radio. It would be neat to get to experience one in person. Plus, it was nice to have something to think about besides my longing for Jessie Vanderlind. Over the past several days, thoughts of him had taken up way too much of my time. I needed to stop fantasizing about him and live my life. I needed to go out and have new experiences; not spend every minute of every day pining for a man who could never be mine. The Mansfield Country Club was practically glowing with the excitement of the evening. The bushes along the long driveway leading up to the main building had been festooned with twinkle lights. There were at least ten cars ahead of us, waiting for the valet service. Men in snappy uniforms and white gloves were helping guests out of their cars. We could already hear music drifting out of the building. Many of the ladies who were helped from the vehicles were older and dressed far more elegantly than I had been expecting. The men were all in suits, but not dressed quite as spectacularly as their wives and sweethearts. “Who’s hosting this dance?” I asked as we waited. Lilly might have mentioned it at some point, but I hadn’t been paying attention. “An associate of my boss,” Lev told me. “He’s a very well connected guy from way back in the day.” I scanned my memory to see if I had any inkling of what Lev Wilson did for a living. Didn’t his father sell appliances? Was that right? Did Lev sell appliances? No, that didn’t make any sense. Somewhere in the back of my brain I thought maybe I remembered he had something to do with security. I had no idea what kind of security. But, judging by the other guests at the dance, it was for people who had more money that anyone I knew. I thought it would be rude to ask Lev questions about his work when I knew he had probably already told me every detail about it, so I didn’t say anything else. As we entered the dance, Lilly and I were both handed a dance card, done up with pink ribbon, each with a miniature pencil attached. “You won’t need that tonight,” Lev said with a grin. “You can pretty much count on dancing every dance with me.” “Same goes for you,” Walter said, giving Lilly a nudge and then breaking into a wide grin. Lilly nudged her date in return. “I could say the same to you.” They both laughed. “Come here for a minute,” Lev said, herding us all to one side of the foyer. He reached in his pocket and pulled out a silver colored flask. “I know there’s a bar,” he said, uncorking it, “but it’s a cash bar, so I thought we might as well get a little warmed up first.” Lev took a large slug out of the flask and then shoved it in my direction. I’d had a few sips of wine before, but I’d never tried hard alcohol and I didn’t think it was time for me to start. “No thank you,” I told him. Flashing me a quick look of disdain, Lev then offered the flask to my sister. “No thanks,” she said, shaking her head. “It’s gives me a stomach ache.” I didn’t think Lilly had ever tried booze before either, but at least she had a good excuse. With a sigh, Lev positioned the flask in front of Walter. “Don’t let me down, Wally Boy,” he said. Walter accepted the bottle, shooting an apologetic look in my sister’s direction, and then took a modest sip. After which, he grimace a little as the liquor slid into his belly. Lev grabbed the flask back from his friend and took another big slug out of it, just to show us how it was done. After putting the cap back on the bottle, Lev said, “Come on. Let’s check out this Barnet fellow.” Grabbing me by the arm, he steered me through the crowd. “I’m ready to dance.” The ballroom was very large, with two art deco chandeliers overhead that started with a ring of crystals in a large circle and cascaded into smaller and small circles until the crystals came to a point. The band was at the far end, just finishing up a song. The room was full, but not overly crowded. There was still room to breathe. I hoped there wouldn’t be many more people arriving after us. I didn’t want to feel squashed. “My boss should be here, somewhere,” Lev said, scanning the crowd. His eyes must have encountered a presence in the room he didn’t like because he frowned. “Would you look at that pretty boy in the tuxedo? Does he think he’s at a coronation or something?” I turned to look in the general direction that Lev was sneering and locked eyes with Jessie Vanderlind. Chapter 30 Jessie I kept telling myself I wasn’t going to follow Colette to the dance. It would be the height of foolishness. And I would be putting Colette, and everyone at the dance, in danger. I kept telling myself I wouldn’t go as I requested that Mrs. Denkler find my tuxedo and have it pressed. I was still a fledgling vampire, after all, which meant I had less self control than someone who had been a member of the undead for a century. I kept reminding myself I wasn’t going to attend the dance as I ordered a boutonniere from the local florist shop. If I was unmasked as a vampire, it would put my entire family at risk, and that was something I would never do. I even kept telling myself I wasn’t attending the dance at the Mansfield Country Club as I dressed in my tuxedo, launched into the air and made my way across the countryside. “Tickets please,” a man at the door said as I mounted the front steps to the club. His nose was misshapen and had obviously been broken more than once. “Oh,” I stammered. I had been so busy convincing myself that I wasn’t attending the dance that I had forgotten about tickets. The tough guy at the door gave me a steady look. “You can’t get in without a ticket.” I gazed right back at him, fixing him with my eyes. “I’ve already given you my ticket,” I told him. “You were just about to tell me that I could go inside.” The man blinked twice and then said, “You can go on inside.” I liked the Mansfield Country Club. It was a nice, open space with a band shell at the far end of a well-lit ballroom. The floor was already filling up by the time I arrived. There were lots of attractive females present, all dressed in varying levels of finery. But I only had eyes for one girl. My timing was perfect because it was only about ten minutes before I caught a glimpse of Colette Gibson entering the dance. Her escort noticed me first, for some reason, saying something derogatory about my attire. But then Colette and I locked eyes. She immediately blushed and put a hand to her cheek. A new song started and I had to resist the impulse to take her in my arms and twirl her across the dance floor. Her date must have noticed my longing gaze, because he flashed a warning look in my direction and then led Colette to another section of the room. I tracked him with my eyes. Setting aside my instant jealously, I observed that he was obviously a man up to no good. I could see the faded marks of a fight on his cheeks and smell the coagulated blood under his skin. I noticed his knuckles were covered in plasters as he hooked a possessive hand through Colette’s arm. I had to wonder why Colette’s parents would allow her to go out with such a brute. Colette’s eyes lingered on me as her date dragged her off to be introduced to some older gentlemen and their wives. I was immediately glad that I had ignored every argument I’d made against going to the dance. I didn’t trust Miss Gibson’s date. He had an air about him that smelled like trouble. While I stood at a discreet distance from the couple, I began to pay more attention to the crowd. There were a lot more older people at the dance than I had expected. And some of them were quite garishly dressed. Several of the younger men were concealing recent wounds, which told me that perhaps there had been some kind of brawl. Tables ringed the room, out of the way of the dance floor, and I took a moment to glance at the cover of a dance card someone had set down next to her purse. The dance was apparently for members of the Fifteenth Chapter of the Lenox Avenue Corporation. The name meant nothing to me, but I had my suspicions about their business. I doubted they were part of a pipefitters union or some other legal operation. When the next song started, Colette was led by her date onto the dance floor. I could tell she was reluctant to go. Her eyes kept darting around the room and I wondered if she was looking for me. It wasn’t fair of me to show up and throw a wrench in her evening, so I concealed myself in the crowd, but where I could still keep a watchful eye. Much to my distaste, her brute of a date was a rather good dancer. He was much smoother than I would have been on the floor. Colette did an admirable job keeping up with him, but it was obvious the fellow was a bit of a showoff. Colette’s sister seemed much happier with her date, even though the fellow wasn’t nearly as light on his feet. They were hanging onto each other in a manner that bordered on immodest. Lettie frowned a few times while looking in her sister’s direction. But besides too high of spirits, Lilly and her date weren’t actually doing anything inappropriate. After an hour of dancing non-stop, Colette begged to be allowed to catch her breath. Her face was pink and she was breathing heavy. I could smell the perfume of her sweat and it was sweet. I sent up a silent thank you to the good people of Tiburon who had been consistently donating their blood to help poor Arthur. It kept our family well supplied. We even had enough to help out some of the regional hospitals. We were too isolated in Tiburon to share the wealth with any of the other vampire families, but I was grateful that my belly was full and I had a flask in my breast pocket in case of emergency. I felt completely under control. Colette’s date excused himself and headed off in the direction of the men’s room. I fought the urge to go over and ask her to dance. It would have been heaven to hold Colette in my arms, if only for the length of one song. But I knew it was wrong. I knew I couldn’t ask her. She more than likely only thought of me as one of her employers. I’d probably ruined her evening by showing up to the dance. A middle-aged man with a big belly and a pronounced scar across his cheek approached Colette. It was obvious from his stagger that he’d been spending most of his time at the bar. “Hey there, cutie,” he slurred. Colette appeared a little startled to be addressed by the man. “Hello,” she said, rather hesitantly. Then she quickly scanned the dance floor for her sister. “What do you say you and I twinkle our toes a little out on the floor?” he asked, swaying slightly to the left and then straightening up again. “No thank you,” was her reply. “What’s the matter?” the guy asked, immediately taking offense. “You think you’re too good for me or something?” “No,” she assured him. “It’s just that I’m waiting for my escort. He said he’d be right back and that I should wait here.” “Awe, he won’t mind,” the man assured her. “Not when he sees who you’re dancing with. I’m a big name in these parts.” “Thank you, but I think I’d rather wait,” Colette told him, still trying to be gracious. “Maybe you didn’t hear me properly,” the man snarled, turning quite red in the face. “I asked you to dance.” And then he grabbed her arm. “Hello, darling,” I said, immediately appearing at Colette’s side. “Sorry to have kept you waiting.” “Oh,” Colette said, her eyes as wide as saucers. “Who’s your friend?” I asked, smiling at the drunk. “My name is something you don’t need to know,” the man slurred. “Now, excuse me, we were just about to hit the dance floor.” I frowned a little. “There must be some confusion. I’m afraid the young lady promised me the next dance.” The man’s face puckered up like he’d just licked a lemon. “Do you know who I am?” he demanded. I looked him dead in the eye. “I think you are a very nice gentleman who was kind enough to converse with my date. But now you are feeling tired and you’d like to go home. You no longer wish to dance.” “As a matter of fact, I don’t want to dance. Not anymore,” the man said after digesting my words. “I’m tired. To hell with this shindig. I’m going home.” And then he staggered off. “Shall we?” I asked, extending my elbow toward Colette so that I could lead her onto the floor. The orchestra was just starting a slow song. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. As I put my arms around her, I could feel Colette tremble. If I was being honest, I was trembling slightly, too. Not from the confrontation, but just from being so close to her. “I’m sorry if that man frightened you,” I said. “No, I…” Colette stammered. After a moment she tried again. “I’m fine,” she assured me. “But what are you doing here?” I swirled her across the floor and it was like dancing on air. “I wanted to hear the band,” I said. “They’re quite good. Don’t you think?” Colette looked at my feet for a moment. “Your ankle,” she said. “Is it quite better?” “It troubled me for a day or two, but it’s all healed now,” I told her. She was so very close, I felt like I could get lost in her emerald green eyes. “I just can’t believe you’re here,” she said in a very quiet voice. “It’s like something out of a dream.” I couldn’t believe my ears. This beautiful creature in my arms couldn’t possibly feel the same way about me as I felt about her. It was my turn to stammer. “You mean to tell me…” “Hey, buddy.” I felt someone slap me aggressively on the arm. “You’re dancing with my girl.” I knew without looking that it was Colette’s brute of a date. “We’d just like to finish this song,” I told him, never letting my eyes leave Colette. I had to have misunderstood her. I just couldn’t believe there was any chance that all the feelings I had for her were mutual. I had to find out. Unfortunately, it was right then that the song drew to a close. “Before you go back to your escort,” I began as I reluctantly removed my hand from her waist. “I just wanted to ask you if…” But it was too late. The brute was right there, glaring at me like he’d caught me stealing from his father’s store. I could smell the liquor on his breath. Colette’s eyes flicked nervously to her date and then back to me. “Thank you for the lovely dance,” she said. I made a small bow. “It was my pleasure.” And then the brute took her roughly by the arm and pulled her through the crowd. I wanted to go after him and explain to him in detail the proper way to treat a lady, but I knew that was unwise. He thought he was a tough-guy and that probably meant he was always spoiling for a fight. If he took a swing at me, then I doubted I would be able to stop myself from shattering his spine. But I decided to follow them at a discrete distance, anyway. Drink was causing the young man’s temper to flare. I didn’t want him to take his bad mood out on Miss Gibson. Chapter 31 Colette Lev goose-stepped me outside like I was a recalcitrant toddler. “You’re hurting my arm,” I told him, but I wasn’t sure if he was listening. There was fury in his eyes. I desperately scanned the crowd, looking for my sister or Walter. Where had they gone? Once we were at some distance from the crowd, Lev shoved me a little away from him and said, “Let’s you and me get something straight.” We were around to the left side of the country club where no other guests had strayed. “When you’re out with me, I don’t expect to find you in the arms of some other guy. Got it?” “We were just dancing,” I said, not sure why he suddenly thought he owned me. “It’s not like it’s any of your business anyway. Just because we came to the dance together doesn’t mean I’m your property for the evening.” “I paid for that flower,” he said, jabbing a finger at my wrist. “I paid for the tickets. I paid for the gas to drive you here.” He took a step closer to me. “Maybe that means I feel like you owe me a little something.” “Here,” I said, shucking the corsage off my arm and trying to hand it to him. “Tell me how much all of that cost you and I’ll pay you back,” I told him. I didn’t feel like I should have to be beholden to a man just because he’d spent a few dollars. “Just so you know,” I said, “I’m only on this date because my sister begged me. So if you spent two dollars, or three dollars, or even five dollars, then that’s fine. I have a job. I will pay you back.” Lev’s face turned dark and I immediately regretted my words. My goal shouldn’t have been to throw the fact that I didn’t like him in his face. My goal should have been to return to where there were other people, find my sister, and get out of there. “You’re going to pay me back,” he said, grabbing my arm. “But it’s not going to be with money. You’re going to have to earn it.” “Let go of me or I’ll scream,” I told him, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice. “Go ahead and scream,” he said with a laugh. “No man at this dance is going to come running, just because he hears some broad scream.” So I kicked him in the shin, and when he bent forward because of the pain, I socked him in the nose. It wasn’t a solid punch, but it was enough to make him let go of my arm. Seizing my moment, I started running back toward the front of the country club. Lev lunged for me, catching my dress. I didn’t stop, even after my dress tore. I ran without looking back. I expected that Lev would tackle me at any moment, but instead all I heard was a sharp “yipe” like someone had kicked a dog. Once I was back among the crowd, I slowed down. I knew what Lev had said about the other guests, but I couldn’t imagine he could drag me off into the bushes kicking and screaming with nobody saying anything. I had thought that Lev was going to come blundering around the corner in a matter of seconds, but he didn’t. I didn’t know why, but I sure as heck wasn’t going to go back and look for him. I moved deeper into the crowd of people chatting on the lawn and waited, never looking away from where I assumed Lev was going to appear. It couldn’t have been more than a minute or two before a figure did appear from around the corner of the building. But it wasn’t Lev. It was Jessie Vanderlind, discretely straightening his bowtie and dusting dirt off of his tux. I was dumbfounded, but slipped inside the club before he could see me. After several minutes of searching, I finally found my sister and Walter canoodling at a small table in a cozy corner by the bar. “What happened to your dress?” was the first thing out of my sister’s mouth when I finally caught her attention. “Lev tore it,” I said, fighting back tears. “What?” Lilly jumped to her feet. “What happened?” “Lev got angry because I danced with another man,” I said. “He dragged me outside and said I owed him because he bought me a flower and got us these tickets. I told him I’d pay him back but…” My voice caught for a second. “But he said he didn’t want my money. I had to earn it.” “What?” Lilly exclaimed, gripping both of my hands. “So then I kicked him, but he still wouldn’t let go of my arm. So then I had to punch him in the nose.” I half considered telling them about seeing Jessie slinking around the corner of the building, but then changed my mind. Walter slammed his hands down on the table. “I can’t believe it,” he all but yelled. “What is wrong with that guy? Has he lost his mind?” He got to his feet. “You two stay here. I’m going to find us a different ride home.” Spinning on his heel, Walter ran straight into Lev’s chest. Lev was a much bigger man, but anger had blinded my sister’s beau to this obstacle. “We’re going outside,” Walter informed his former friend. “You need to be taught a lesson on how to treat a lady.” I expected Lev to get right back in Walter’s face, or may let the fists start flying right there in the bar of the Mansfield Country Club. But Lev didn’t react in any way that I expected. Instead, he just stood there, swaying slightly on his feet. His skin looked clammy and his eyes were darting around the room. “I came here to apologize,” he said to me in a small voice. “I realize that my actions were wrong and I really want to say I’m sorry.” We all just stared at him, our mouths practically hanging open. Walter was the first to find his voice. “I’m glad to hear you’re sorry, but your behavior is still unforgivable. I hope you understand that I am going to find a different way to get the girls home.” “Please don’t do that,” Lev said, his voice trembling. He scanned the room as if he was afraid there was a wild panther hiding in the corner and he didn’t want to draw its attention. “Please allow me to drive the three of you home as a way of making amends.” “No.” Walter shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.” Lev began to quake and tears started streaming down his cheeks. “Can’t you at least go in my car? Walter, you can drive. Lettie and Lilly can sit in the back seat. I’ll sit up front with you.” He looked at me, beseechingly. “I won’t say a word. I promise. I’ll keep my mouth shut the whole time. But please just let me see you home safely.” He was a total wreck. It was as if we were talking to a completely different man. The Lev Wilson who was standing before us was somehow broken, like he had looked into the abyss and it had scared the fight out of him. “I think it will be okay if Walter drives,” I said. Lev was so altered, it was shocking. I actually found myself feeling sorry for him. “Okay, good,” Lev said, wiping the tears from his cheeks. “I really appreciate that. And I’m so sorry for…” His voice started trembling again and he had no more words. “I think maybe we’d better just get going,” Walter said after several seconds of watching Lev cry. “Why don’t I fetch the car and the three of you can meet me at the side entrance?” I knew he was worried about Lev being humiliated in front of his boss. But then Walter remembered he didn’t want to leave us alone with him. “Or maybe…” Walter tried to think of another option. “It’s probably best if you go get the car,” Lilly said. She obviously was thinking the same thing I was thinking; there was no need for us to fear Lev Wilson. He was a broken man. Chapter 32 Jessie I have never been so close to murdering someone in my life. It took every ounce of self control I possessed not to snap the brute’s spine and toss his body into the river. I was so disgusted by him that I didn’t even want to drink his blood; I just wanted to make him disappear off of the face of the planet. But I knew killing Colette’s date would be a mistake. Violence is rarely the solution to stop violence. Instead I decided to acquaint the brute with his own mortality, just to let him know how insignificant he really was in this world. It turned out he frightened quite easily. I was surprised how quickly he crumbled. But I suppose bullies aren’t really known for their bravery. After giving the young man a new perspective on life, I considered borrowing a car and offering Colette and her sister a ride home. But I decided that was just me wanting to play the hero. Besides, I wanted Colette to know that she had nothing more to fear from her date. He would never harass her again. So I instructed him to find his companions and to drive them home with the greatest of care. I explained that if I ever found out he was bullying or threatening anyone ever again, I would find him. But I wasn’t too worried on that score. I had a feeling that he was going to do everything with the greatest of care for the rest of his life. After straightening out the brute, I immediately walked across the country club lawn and left the dance. I couldn’t be around people any longer. Staying would have been a mistake. I took the flask out of my pocket and finished off its contents in a matter of seconds. Then, once I was clear from the crowd, I took to the air. I had meant to go home, but I was still worried about Colette. I found myself following the brute’s car as Colette and the rest of her party headed for home. Lilly’s escort saw her to the door, but Lettie’s escort was afraid to leave the car. I felt a pang of guilt. I may have frightened him just a little too much. I’d meant to make him a good person, not turn him into a sniveling coward. After the boys left, I followed their car once again, waiting for my chance to catch the brute alone. I had to lessen my influence. I’d put so much fear into him, I doubted his ability to survive. I had to take pity on him and provide at least some relief, however reluctant I was to do so. The next day was Sunday and I knew Colette would not be working at the castle. Even still, I could find no rest in my bed. I couldn’t help but wonder what she would do on her day off. Did she go to church? Did she have any hobbies? What did she eat for breakfast? I wanted to know every little detail of her life. I was already hopelessly in love with her. But I knew it was wrong to love her. When a vampire fell in love with a mortal, it put the mortal at a horrible risk. Even though I would have rather faced the sun than harm one hair on Colette Gibson’s head, loving her still meant I was exposing her to danger. I knew I had to find a way to keep myself from her. Earlier in the evening I had thought that maybe she was about to confess to having feelings for me and I desperately wanted to hear the words that she’d never had a chance to say. But knowing that she cared would probably only make things worse; it would make parting from her all the more painful. No, there was what my heart desired and there was what was right. I had to end things with Colette before they even had a chance to begin. By Monday afternoon, I knew I had to see Colette again. Not to profess my love or anything like that, but just to make sure that she was okay. Her date had tried to brutalize her and that weighed heavily on my mind. I knew she was a brave girl or she wouldn’t have fought her date, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t upset, or still in fear of him. I just wanted reassurance that she was unscathed. I promised myself one last look at the girl and then I would leave her alone forever. I would confess my dilemma to my mother and explain that I needed to move away for a couple of decades. I could always return in twenty years when Colette Gibson was in her thirties, married and raising her children. Children I could never give her. With the safety of a wedding band on her finger, I knew I would find her much easier to resist. With that resolve in mind, I set out to seek Miss Gibson. I didn’t intend to speak to her. I would just gaze upon her one last time to commit her beautiful visage to memory. I could live off of that for a few decades until my feelings of love for her began to fade. A small amount of discrete searching allowed me to find Colette dusting books in the library. It was a task that Mrs. Denkler usually assigned to her every Monday, whether the books needed it or not. By a stroke of good fortune, she was alone. Her sister had been called away to assist one of the other maids. The library door glided silently open on well-oiled hinges. Poking my head in, but not fully stepping into the room, I could not see her. The room smelled of her sweetness, so I placed one foot cautiously over the threshold. Where was she? A second later, I caught a glimpse of her, high on top of a ladder, dusting the books on the shelf closest to the ceiling. She was humming softly to herself, thoroughly engaged in her task. I could see that she was happy and not at all traumatized by the events of Saturday evening. I meant to turn and leave as quietly as I’d entered. But then I just stood there, mesmerized by Colette’s beauty. Everything about her called me to her. I reminded myself that I had to be brave and wrench myself away. I couldn’t give her mortal love. That opportunity was gone for me. I could only deny myself the pleasure of seeing her so that she could have a happy life. It took all of my strength, but I turned to leave the library. That’s when a floorboard creaked beneath my shifting weight. Colette’s eyes immediately met mine. Her lips parted and she exclaimed, “Jessie?” She tried to descend the ladder, but the heel of her shoe got caught on the hem of her dress. Suddenly her legs were out from under her and she was tumbling head first toward the hardwood floor. Chapter 33 Colette I scanned the country club crowd for Jessie Vanderlind as we were leaving the dance, but he was nowhere to be found. Lev was a complete mess. He acted terrified by every trumpet of laughter and every shadow in the trees. “Did something happen after I left you?” I couldn’t help but ask him. “What?” he said, giving me a startled look. “No, nothing. Why do you ask?” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “You just seem very…” I wanted to say altered, but that probably wasn’t very nice. “You seem a little unsettled and I was wondering if anything happened while you were on the lawn by yourself.” “No.” He shook his head rapidly back and forth. “I was alone, by myself, and nothing happened. Nothing at all.” The three of us were standing by the side entrance, waiting for Walter to bring the car. Lev scanned the area with wild eyes, as if he expected the grim reaper to lunge out of the shadows. I clearly remembered Jessie Vanderlind brushing down his tux as he left the general area where Lev had decided to assault me. And I found it very unlikely that Jessie would stand idly by while someone was being attacked. Did he have anything to do with Lev’s current fragile state? “And you spoke to no one?” I asked again. “No,” Lev insisted, shaking his head. “I’ve already told you that. Now please stop asking me.” His eyes started welling with tears again so I decided to just keep my mouth shut. When we arrived home, Walter saw Lilly to the door, but Lev stayed in the car. We could hear him locking the doors as soon as we’d pushed them shut. “I’m so sorry about all of this,” Walter said as he escorted Lilly up the front porch steps. “I am so sorry,” Lilly whispered to me as we entered the front door. “You told me you didn’t want to go with Lev and I wouldn’t listen. I just feel so horrible.” “That’s okay,” I told her in a low voice. “Oh, here comes Mama.” “Hello, girls,” our mother said, beaming at us. She was already in her nightgown and robe. “I wasn’t expecting you home so early.” And then she caught sight of the giant tear in my dress. “Goodness. Lettie, what happened?” “I... was sitting down and didn’t realize the woman next to me was standing on my hem,” I told her. “So when I got up, it all tore.” “Goodness,” Mama said again, bending to examine the damage. “I don’t think I can mend this without it showing.” She scratched her chin and straightened up, still eyeing the hole. “I guess we could add a wide sash and that would hide it well enough. I might have just the right fabric in my scrap box.” “I knew you would think of something to save it,” I said, giving our mother a squeeze. “I felt like such a fool when it happened.” “I hope it didn’t spoil the dance for you,” Mama said. “Oh, no,” I assured her. “We had a lovely time. I think Walter and Lilly danced to every song.” “And what about you?” she asked. “Have you changed your mind about Lev Wilson?” I didn’t think it was worth upsetting my parents with Lev’s behavior, so I sighed and then said, “I’m afraid I just don’t like Lev in that way. We’ve decided to just be friends.” I set out for work extra early Monday morning. The weather was quite warm and I wanted to gather a large bouquet of wildflowers for Arthur. Mrs. Denkler never said if he enjoyed the flowers or not, but I figured he must have at least enjoyed them a little or she would have told me to stop. Lilly caught up with me on her bicycle and we rode the rest of the way to the castle together. “Thank you so much for not saying anything to Mama and Papa,” she said as we rolled along. “I don’t think they’d ever let me see Walter again if they knew about Lev’s behavior.” “I don’t know why,” I called back to her as we both pedaled single file. “It’s not like Walter did anything. As a matter of fact, I think he behaved quite gallantly during the whole incident. Don’t you?” “He did. Didn’t he?” Lilly said. I didn’t have to look back at my sister to know she was smiling. “But I still think Papa would try to stop me from seeing him. You know how protective he can get and he might find Walter guilty just through association.” We rode the rest of the way to the castle in silence. Lilly was probably thinking of Walter’s gallantry and I was thinking of Jessie. I desperately wanted to see him. But seeing one of the Vanderlinds was always strictly by chance. Even so, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I couldn’t stop wondering what he would have said to me if we’d been allowed to dance just a little longer. And I couldn’t help but wonder what I would have said to him. I knew I was being foolish because we barely even knew each other, but if I was being honest, I already felt like I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. Lilly and I were assigned to dust the library again. It was becoming a regular Monday ritual. It seemed impossible to believe that any dust had gathered since we’d wiped down all the books a week earlier, but Mrs. Denkler was in charge. It was our job to just do as she instructed. We worked side-by-side for about an hour, both of us lost in our own thoughts. I heard the door open and my heart jumped into my throat with the hope that it was Jessie. Whipping my head around, I saw it was just Millie. “Mrs. Denkler sent me to get one of you,” she said. Lilly and I exchanged looks. “You go,” I told her. “I’ll stay with the books.” I thought there might be a better chance of seeing Jessie if I stayed in the library, rather than going to a new task. After Lilly left, I began humming to myself. I loved climbing up the ladder to the highest shelf. There were giant volumes up there that appeared to be hundreds of years old. I wondered if any of them were as old as the castle. The creak of a floorboard caught my attention. I turned my head just in time to see Jessie Vanderlind trying to duck out of the door. “Jessie,” I exclaimed, immediately trying to climb down from my perch to speak with him. I needed to know what had happened at the dance. But the heel of my shoes got caught in the hem of my dress and before I knew what was happening, I was plummeting toward the ground head first. It all happened so quickly that I didn’t even have time to shriek. I just shut my eyes and had the fleeting thought that hitting the floor was really going to hurt. And then I let out an “Oof.” It was as if I flopped very hard on a bed and all the air was knocked out of me. I hadn’t hit the ground. In fact, I felt like I was a few feet above it. I opened my eyes to see that I was in Jessie’s arms. “Are you alright,” Jessie asked, holding me like a groom holds a bride when they cross the threshold of their new home as husband and wife. “Yes,” I said with a little gasp. He acted as if I was as light as a ragdoll. “My heel got caught and the next thing I knew...” It was so wonderful being in his arms that more words escaped me. “Here, let me untangle you,” he said, gently setting me down. “Hold onto me and I’ll unhook your hem.” I wobbled a bit and had to steady myself against his broad shoulders. “There,” he said, freeing my shoe. “All better.” He straightened up, but kept a steadying hand against my side. “Are you dizzy at all? Are you hurt in any way?” “I’m fine,” I assured him. “Just a little embarrassed. I saw you standing in the doorway and...” I looked across the room to the door. It had to have been a distance of at least twenty feet. “How did you manage to catch me?” I asked. “When I saw you, you were right by the door.” “No, no,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re remembering it wrong because of the fall. I was walking toward you. I was practically under the ladder.” “But...” I shook my head, trying to clear it. His arms were still around me and that was making it hard for me to think. “I could have sworn you were by the door.” “Then how could I have crossed the room so quickly? It’s not like I can fly,” he pointed out. “I suppose,” I said, shaking my head some more. I still felt so discombobulated. “I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to you at the dance. I saw you on the lawn and I was wondering if you’d spoken to my date when you were out there.” “On the lawn?” he repeated. “No, I only spoke to him when he came over while we were dancing.” “Are you sure?” I asked. “It seemed like you were coming from the same direction where he...” I stopped short when I saw the thunder in Jessie’s eyes. They told me everything I needed to know. Jessie had confronted Lev. That much was obvious. “Did you need me for something?” I asked, taking half a step backward, but I was reluctant to relinquish his touch. “Or were you just wanting a book?” Jessie half turned away from me for a moment and then looked back into my eyes. “I guess I’ve come to tell you goodbye.” “Goodbye?” I asked. “Yes.” He looked down. “I’m leaving Tiburon. I’m afraid I won’t be back for quite some time. Possibly years.” “What?” I exclaimed. “No, you can’t.” I blinked rapidly, trying to stop tears from filling my eyes. “I’ve only just met you. And I know I’m just a maid, but...” I wanted to tell him that I thought we were meant to be together, but I couldn’t speak. “No, you’re not just the maid,” he told me. “You’re everything. I just thought that I should leave because...” And then we were kissing. I don’t even know how it happened, but suddenly his lips were pressing against mine. And it was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I felt the kiss in every cell of my body. It felt like I had been dunked in soda from a fountain. For those few seconds we were standing still and the world was spinning around us. “Oh! Excuse me,” I heard Lilly’s voice exclaim. We quickly pulled apart and I turned to see my sister standing in the doorway, her eyes out on stalks. Chapter 34 Jessie Colette felt about me the same way I felt about her. It didn’t matter that I could already fly, I felt like I was walking on air. I took the stairs back to my room two at a time. Her kiss had been the one perfect moment in my life. I felt our entire lifetime together in that one embrace. I just couldn’t believe my good fortune. I was the luckiest man alive. And then I remembered I wasn’t alive. Not by a long shot. I was a vampire, a member of the undead. And she was a mortal. That realization quickly brought my spirits crashing back to earth. How could I take Colette’s heart and give her my own when we could never be together? I closed the door to my room and then sank into despair. Being so close to Colette, having her in my arms, had made me lose my head for a moment. But what I had done was wrong. Not saving her life — I would have gladly sacrificed my own life to keep her from harm — but kissing her had been a very foolish thing to do. I cursed my misfortune of having contracted scarlet fever. If I’d only managed to avoid that dreaded disease, then I would have still been a mortal. With Grandfather gone, there was no fear of him turning Emily into a member of the undead. I would have fallen under the same protection. But no, the fates had seen to it that I would forever be seventeen, and the love of my life would keep aging. The cruel injustice of it led me to anger and I took some of my frustration out on an ottoman, completely shattering its frame in the process. There was a knock on my door and then Daniel walked into my room without waiting for me to reply. “Why are you attacking the furniture?” he asked. “What’s that ottoman ever done to you?” “I’m just…” And then I couldn’t think of what to say. “I’m just frustrated that I wasn’t able to save Grandfather.” “I see.” Daniel raised his eyebrows high on his forehead. “And you think that the ottoman had something to do with it?” Seating himself in a chair at some distance from the ottoman, he crossed his legs and then folded his hands over one knee. “No, I…” And then I stopped myself again. “What do you want, Daniel?” I asked. “It’s not like you to be up at this hour.” It was the middle of the day and my brother never usually stirred until after six. “I was having trouble sleeping,” Daniel said with a sniff of vexation, “so I thought I’d get a book from the library. And while I was standing in the doorway, I overheard the most remarkable conversation between two of the maids.” I felt my body momentarily tense, but I tried to pretend like his words had no effect on me. “Eavesdropping on the staff?” It was my turn to raise an eyebrow. “That’s not like you.” Daniel would have been happy if everyone who worked at the castle was a deaf-mute. “What’s going on?” Daniel asked, ignoring my barb. “Have you been toying with one of the servants? How very bourgeois.” “I haven’t been toying with anyone,” I informed him. “They were probably gossiping about the fact that one of the girls took a tumble off a ladder in the library. I was nearby so I managed to catch her.” Daniel narrowed his eyes. “Nearby or on the other side of the room?” “I was standing closer to her than you are to me,” I told him, keeping my voice matter-of-fact. “I don’t see what business it is of yours, anyway.” “It’s my business if you’re exposing the family to danger,” he snapped. “You can’t go dashing across the library just because some little mortal might bust her head. You could expose us all with that kind of behavior.” “I didn’t expose us to anyone,” I informed him. “She slipped and I caught her. That’s the end of the story.” Daniel was the very last person I’d want to know about my feelings for Colette. At least not until I had decided what to do. He took the demise of our grandfather as a signal that he should ascend the throne as the head of the Vanderlind family. Mother and I found it quite amusing, but he took himself rather seriously. “Just be careful,” he told me. “I think Denkie should have known better than to hire a couple of pretty housemaids, but that’s no reason to lose your head. If you’re feeling edgy, you can always go visit Arthur, and then find a brothel. I hear Columbus has a few good ones and it’s not that far.” “Alright,” I said, just to placate him. I knew continuing to protest my innocence would get me nowhere. And Daniel might even begin to suspect I was lying if I protested too much. “Next time I’ll let the mortal land on her head.” “Good,” Daniel said, getting to his feet and heading toward the door. “Better a dead girl than having the villagers pounding on the castle door. I hate when they show up with their pitchforks and torches.” Chapter 35 Colette “Have you lost your mind?” Lilly said in a loud whisper. Jessie had slipped out the door as she’d entered the room. “Maybe I have,” I told her, still feeling a bit giddy from Jessie’s kiss. “What if Mama and Papa find out?” she said in a harsh whisper. Then her eyes grew wider. “What if Mrs. Denkler finds out? She’s scary enough as it is.” “No one’s going to find out,” I said to her, picking up my feather duster from where it had fallen. “It was just a harmless kiss.” “But how did it even happen?” Lilly wanted to know. “I slipped off a ladder and he caught me,” I explained. “He had his arms wrapped around me to steady me, and then it just happened.” My sister frowned. “He took advantage of you?” “No,” I exclaimed. “He stopped me from cracking open my skull.” “But he kissed you,” she said. “Without courting you. Or meeting our parents, or anything.” “It wasn’t like that,” I tried to assure her. “It just happened. I kissed him just as much as he kissed me.” Lilly frowned some more while plucking at her feather duster. “I think I have to tell Mama and Papa.” Whirling around, I stared at her, my mouth slightly open at her contemplated betrayal. “Why?” “Because that Vanderlind boy is trying to take advantage of you. He shouldn’t have kissed you like that.” “I told you, it was mutual. And also an accident,” I hastened to add. “And it will probably never happen again, so there’s no reason to get our parents all worried. You want to keep this job. Don’t you?” Lilly thought it over. “Yes, I really do. But… I don’t want…” She couldn’t even put words to her feelings. “I still think I should tell.” “Fine,” I said, pinching my lips together. “After all I’ve done so you could see Walter.” “That’s different,” she insisted. “If you decide to tell Mama and Papa, then I can’t stop you,” I said. “But I just want you to know that if we are sharing everything with our parents, then I am going to have to tell them that you left me alone with Lev Wilson for over an hour. And during that time, he attacked me and ripped my dress.” Lilly let out an audible gasp. “You wouldn’t.” I shrugged. “Why shouldn’t I? It’s the truth.” “But…” Lilly’s eyes were round with the fear of it. “Then they would never let me see Walter again.” “I know,” I told her. “And I don’t want that to happen.” Lilly opened and closed her mouth a few times, reminding me slightly of a goldfish in a bowl. Then she closed her lips firmly and returned to dusting, not speaking to me for the rest of the day. “What’s wrong with you girls?” Mama asked over dinner. “You’ve barely spoken two words to each other since you got home.” “Nothing, as far as I know,” I said, glancing over in Lilly’s direction. My sister refused to look at me. “Nothing,” she said, shaking her head back and forth a few times. “I’m just a little tired.” She looked down to cut her meat. “And besides, we work together all day.” And then, glancing in my direction, she added, “I think we’ve said everything that needs to be said.” Lilly was still ignoring me when we climbed into bed. That was fine. I could handle her anger, just as long as she kept my secret. And I knew she would. I wasn’t exactly playing fair, but I was keeping secrets for her, so I saw no reason why she shouldn’t keep one for me. And besides, Jessie and I had only kissed. It had been unexpected, but it wasn’t something I regretted. Nor was it something I would ever regret. Jessie Vanderlind had stolen my heart without even trying. I couldn’t sleep. There were too many thoughts of Jessie running through my head. Once my sister’s breathing turned to the steady rhythm of someone asleep, I crept out of my bed and shrugged into my robe. I needed to contemplate what had passed between Jessie and me in the complete silence that existed in the middle of the night. On tiptoe, I crossed the room to look out the window. The little creatures of the night were starting to sing to each other and I loved the music they made. Looking down at the ground below our window, I nearly jumped out of my skin when I realized that someone was looking back up at me. It only took a second for me to realize it was Jessie Vanderlind. “What are you doing out here?” I whispered, as I hurried across our yard to stand next to Jessie. I hoped none of my family had heard me easing out of the back door. The screen usually squeaked. “I had to see you,” he said, stepping closer to me. “I wanted…” He paused for a moment, running his fingers through his hair. “I wanted to apologize.” He was just so breathtaking handsome with his full lips and his ruffled black hair. I took several seconds just to stare at him, drinking him in. “Apologize?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes.” Jessie nodded. “Just because you’d fallen off a ladder was no reason for…” He paused again. “It’s just… I just feel like I might have taken advantage of you. I mean, just because you’d fallen off the ladder was no reason for me to…” He gestured at me with his hand. “I’m sorry.” “Don’t apologize,” I told him, stepping a little closer. “You saved me and then we accidentally kissed. That’s no reason to apologize.” “But don’t you see?” Jessie asked, his gray eyes like two perfect gray pearls from the islands of Polynesia. “Kissing you by accident would be like accidentally finding a leprechaun's pot of gold.” I squinted at him, no sure what he meant. “I’m afraid you’ve lost me.” “I mean,” he said, stretching his hands toward me for a moment and then stuffing them in the pockets of the long, dark coat he was wearing, “I wouldn’t want our kiss to have been something you didn’t want or you weren’t expecting. Kissing you, especially for the first time, should be perfect.” My heart was hammering so wildly in my chest that I could barely breathe. “Then kiss me now,” I told him. “Kiss me here under this apple tree. Let this be our first kiss.” It was such a brazen thing to say that I couldn’t even believe the words had come out of my mouth, but he didn’t seem put off by my request. “Are you sure?” Jessie asked, taking a half-step forward. “About the kiss. Because I know if I kiss you again, I would never want to…” And then we melted into each other’s arms, our lips pressing together with such passion that it felt like tiny fireworks were exploding in my chest. “Ever let you go,” Jessie whispered, once we paused for breath. “What’s that?” I asked, my head spinning from being so close to him. His breath smelled slightly of warm pennies. “I was just worried about kissing you,” he whispered into my hair. “I knew that if we were to kiss, I would never want to let you go.” “Then don’t,” I told him. “I’m happy to stay here forever.” He squeezed me tightly for another moment and then I felt him stiffen a little, as if gathering his resolve. “There’s something I have to tell you,” he said in a very controlled voice. “There’s something I have to confess before this goes any further.” “What is it?” I asked, hesitantly. He suddenly sounded so serious that it made me a little afraid. Jessie closed his eyes for a moment and released a deep sigh. “It’s about my family.” “Oh.” I thought of the rumors I’d heard about the Vanderlinds from Mrs. Denkler and the other snatches of gossip. The Vanderlinds all suffered from some type of rare illness. Something hereditary, I had to imagine. Jessie probably felt that he should be honest about his situation before we became too involved. “Don’t tell me,” I said, snuggling deeper into his arms. “I don’t want to know. Not yet.” “But…” he started to say. “Jessie, please don’t,” I insisted, cupping his face with my hands and looking into his fathomless gray eyes. “This moment is so perfect. And I feel about you in a way that I never imagined I could feel about anyone. Let’s pretend that the rest of the world doesn’t exist. At least for right now. Let’s just make this moment about the two us.” And then he kissed me again. Chapter 36 Jessie I felt like a foolish Romeo, standing underneath Colette’s window, but there was no place else in the world I wanted to be. I’d always had my suspicions about Romeo. He was, after all, already infatuated with a girl named Rosaline before sneaking into the ball and first seeing Juliet. Who was to say that, if their families hadn’t been sworn enemies and he’d actually been allowed to woo Juliet, that he wouldn’t have grown bored of her in a couple of months and fallen in love with yet another girl? But I didn’t feel that way about Miss Gibson. I knew I was about the same age as Romeo was in the play, but my love for Colette felt timeless. I knew I could never tire of her, not even in a hundred years. I sighed, feeling the irony of it. I would live to see a hundred years. And probably a hundred more after that, if I didn’t grow despondent under the weight of my own immortality and find some way to end it. Death by an angry mob was a popular way for the undead to give up on living. Of course I would probably have to travel to Romania to accomplish such a grisly task with any ease. The Romanians were always ready to put some world weary vampire to the stake. But then I caught a glimpse of Colette in the window of her house and it felt like my dead heart was beating in my chest. Just the sight of her filled me with life. I had to fight the urge to fly up the side of the house and speak to her through the glass. A few moments later and she was there by my side, her volumes of hair cascading around her shoulders. I had been yearning for her so much that my feelings were almost tangible. And there she was, right in front of me. It was exquisite torture not to sweep her up in my arms. I had meant to apologize for my behavior in the library. It had been ungentlemanly and I very much wanted Colette Gibson to think well of me. I meant to simply apologize, but somehow we ended up kissing again. It was our first kiss, our first real kiss, and there was a dream-like quality to it. The apple tree shading us from the light of the moon was in full leaf and the small animals and insects that came out in warm weather started to sing. It was then that I knew I couldn’t give Colette up. Not ever. Her soul fit with mine like two locking puzzle pieces that, once united, could never be pulled apart. But I also wanted to protect her from the curse that was my family. I needed to tell her exactly who I was, and what I was, so that she would understand the gravity of her decision to be with me. But when I tried to confess to the abomination that was my family, Colette silenced me. She didn’t want to cloud the skies of our new love with talk of anyone or anything but us. And I was too in love to insist. I should have stood strong and explained the evil that Grandfather had inflicted upon us, but instead we kissed again and everything in the world felt perfect. As we pulled apart in order for her to breathe, we both caught a glimpse of a shooting star streaking across the sky. “Do people wish on shooting stars here in America?” I asked, unwilling to turn my head to take in the full astronomical display. I preferred gazing into her green eyes. “Yes,” she said with a small nod, not looking away either. “But I feel like all of my wishes have already come true.” Chapter 37 Colette “I have a bit of good news to share,” Papa said, beaming at all of us as we sat around the dinner table the following evening. “What is it?” Mama asked, taking off her oven mitts after setting down the pot roast. “Well, the W.P.A. has decided that Tiburon needs a proper town hall. And guess who they’ve hired to run the construction?” “Oh!” Mama exclaimed, gasping. “That’s wonderful.” She hurried around the table to wrap her arms around Papa. I was thrilled. All of us were. But it was also a little confusing. “Shouldn’t they focus on rebuilding the school first?” I asked. Papa shook his head, even though he was still smiling. “I know. It doesn’t make much sense. Does it? But I guess the government already had the plans in place for the town hall before the school burnt down.” “But when are they rebuilding the school?” Lilly wanted to know. “It’s in the process of getting funded,” Papa told her. “And hopefully I get that project, too. But for now we should just be grateful that I’m steadily employed again.” He looked at Lilly and me. “There should be enough money for awhile,” he said. “If you girls want to leave your positions at the castle; it wouldn’t be a problem.” “No,” I exclaimed, the word bursting out of my mouth. I didn’t care if we had all the money in the world; I couldn’t stop working at the castle. I couldn’t forgo the chance of seeing Jessie every day, even if the chance was always slim. Surprised by my exuberance, everyone turned to look at me. “I mean, it would be silly to give up such good paying jobs,” I explained. “We should save the money in case things get lean again.” Papa reached over and petted my head. “That’s my bright girl.” The next several weeks drifted past in a pink haze of happiness. In the mornings I would ride out to an obliging field and gather an armload of wildflowers for Arthur. Then Lilly would catch up to me and we would head to the castle together to start our day of dusting and polishing. If it was a lucky day, then Jessie would find some way to see me. Lilly would be called away to help Millie and I’d be left on my own. Or Emily would come to ask for my help with some small task. Once the girl had led me to some secluded room, she would disappear, leaving her brother in her place. Our meetings in the castle were brief. There was only time for a few stolen kisses. But I knew that Jessie would come to see me at night, after my family had fallen asleep. That was when we had our real time together. Each night when we met, Jessie would try to tell me of the horrible curse that plagued his family. And each night I would stop him with a kiss. I didn’t want to tarnish the love I felt for him. His family could have been a pack of snarling wolves and I wouldn’t have cared. Jessie was beautiful and wonderful and kind. I didn’t believe in guilt by association and I knew I would love Jessie Vanderlind, no matter the dark secret his family was hiding. “Why don’t you speak with an accent?” I asked him one evening as we took a turn around the yard. “Don’t I speak with an American accent?” he said with some surprise. “You know what I mean,” I said, nudging his arm. “You’re from Hungary. Aren’t you? But you sound like you were born right here, in Tiburon.” “My grandfather didn’t believe in accents,” he said. I couldn’t let him get away with telling me so little. “What’s that supposed to mean?” “It means that my grandfather was very strict. He felt that if you were going to learn a language, then you should be able to speak it flawlessly.” “How many languages do you speak?” I wanted to know. He gave a shrug of modesty. “Only three or four.” “Three or four?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “You speak English and Hungarian. What other languages do you speak?” “French,” he told me. “And some German, but I could hardly pass for a native.” “Say something in Hungarian,” I requested. He gave me a puzzled look. “Why?” “Because this all sounds too preposterous and I’m not half sure that I should believe you.” He turned to look deeply into my eyes. “Szeretlek,” he said in a whisper. I didn’t understand him, but I had my suspicions because of the way he looked at me. “Okay, now say the same thing in French,” I told him. “Je t’aime,” was his reply, a small smile flitting across his lips. I kept going. “And German?” “Ich liebe dich,” he said, gazing steadily into my eyes. “And what does it mean in English?” I had to ask. Jessie pulled me into his arms. “I think you already know,” he said in a husky voice. And then he kissed me, his lips telling me how he felt without any words. My sister hadn’t spoken of Jessie since she stumbled upon our kiss, and I kept all thoughts of him to myself. Normally we shared all our foolish secrets, like sisters who are close tend to do. But when it came to Jessie, things felt different. First of all, I knew Lilly didn’t approve. After all, the maid falling in love with the tortured heir to the castle falling did sound like something out of a gothic novel. Even I had to admit that. But I didn’t care. I knew what I felt for Jessie was real. And I knew deep in my heart that he felt the same way about me. One morning I woke up and I was seventeen. I found it singular that I didn’t look any different when I washed my face in the morning and peered into the bathroom mirror. But things were different. They were very different. Because I knew that just down the Tiburon River, a few miles away, was a Justice of the Peace who would perform wedding ceremonies without parental consent, as long as both parties were older than seventeen. I had reached an age where I could say, “I do,” to Jessie, if he ever proposed. My whole family greeted me when I came down the stairs. “Happy Birthday,” Mama said, squeezing me tightly. Then she pulled Lilly into the hug. “My two, seventeen-year-old girls.” “Not for long,” Lilly joked. For almost two months out of the year, my sister and I were the same age. My family referred to it as our twin months and we’d always loved this special time when we little girls. “Well, then I’ll have to enjoy it while I can,” our mother said, hugging us both again. “I’m tired of your silly nonsense with these flowers,” Mrs. Denkler snapped at me as I filled a vase with the wildflower bouquet I’d gathered on the way to work. “Oh,” I said, not quite sure why she was annoyed. “You mean you don’t think they cheer Arthur up? I’m sure he must get depressed, never being able to leave his room.” Mrs. Denkler was about to say something, but then stopped herself. She left out the sharp sigh of someone who feels they have extended a great deal of patients and their efforts have gone unappreciated. “Just take the flowers up yourself today and set them outside Arthur’s door,” she instructed me. “It’s the one with the bird carving over it. The nurse will take them in. Just make sure you mind your own business and leave that poor boy alone. If I find out that you’ve so much as stuck your nose in the door, you will be dismissed on the spot.” I did as I was told, trotting up the grand staircase that led to the second floor. I hadn’t been allowed up the stairs and only knew that part of the castle from what could be gleaned from down below. The hallways were massive. I wouldn’t have been surprised if it were possible to drive a car down some of them. There was an ornately carved piece of wood over each door. I took several moments to stare at the carving of a wolf’s head suspended above a door. Its eyes seemed to follow me. I found the door for Arthur’s room easily enough. There was a carving of a peacock with its tail feathers spread into a fan. The bird was beautiful, but also somehow menacing. That paired up well with my memory of how a peacock looked from our family trip to the Cleveland Zoo. I stood outside the closed door for a moment, the vase of flowers still clutched in my hands, cocking my head to one side to listen. I felt so very bad for Arthur. None of the family got out much, as far as I could tell. Emily seemed perfectly healthy. And Jessie left the castle more than the others, but that seemed to be only after the sun went down. What was the illness that kept them all so isolated and cooped up in their home? I’d tried to do researched at the library, but came up with next to nothing. The only thing I could discover was that albinos had some sensitivity to light. Most of the Vanderlinds had very pale skin, but their hair wasn’t the white of an albino and they all had very gray eyes. As I set the vase down outside the closed door, I had to wonder about Arthur’s malady. If Jessie and I had a child, would he or she suffer the same fate? That wouldn’t prevent me from accepting a proposal from Jessie, but it would make me consider adoption instead of bearing my own children. I did rather desperately want to have Jessie’s child, but I also knew that there were many parentless children out in the world who deserved a loving home. I had an anxious day. I kept expecting to see Jessie at every turn, but he never appeared. I didn’t even see Emily, which came as a surprise. She was a lonely little girl and frequently sought Lilly and my company. She was so lucky to have escaped her family’s curse, whatever it was, but it seemed to have isolated her in an unexpected way. Chapter 38 Jessie “So you’re not fiddling with the maid,” Daniel said with a scoff as he sauntered into the library where I sat in a club chair, reading some of Sir Walter Scott’s poetry. “I can’t believe I was fool enough to have believed you.” “What are you talking about?” I asked, glancing up at him from over my book and doing my best not to be baited by my brother. I had been courting Colette for several weeks and I was always careful to ensure that my family knew as little as possible about my activities. Everyone but Emily, of course. She was my secret go-between and she thoroughly approved of where I had given my heart. “I followed you the other night,” he told me, perching himself on the arm of a chair. “I knew you’d been sneaking out of the house, so I followed you. And guess where you went?” I gave him a cool look, closing my book in the process. “Why don’t you tell me?” “You know damn well where you went.” he said. “You flew directly over to that little tramp’s house. I saw you with your arms around each other.” My temper ignited immediately when my brother referred to Colette as a tramp. She was nothing of the sort and I instantly felt compelled to defend her honor. But I knew that was what Daniel was expecting. “What’s it to you?” I asked, keeping my voice in check. “If you’re feeling the urge to dip your wick, then find some foolish young thing who doesn’t know where you live,” he told me. “Not one that works under the very roof of our home.” I wanted to strike him. I could feel the urge down to my fingertips. But what purpose would that serve? That would only convince Daniel that he was justified in his outrage. “You’re right,” I said, coolly. “She was a foolish choice.” Daniel was about to argue with me, but then he processed my words. “So you’ll end things with her?” I nodded a few times. “I shall give it some thought. It’s a matter that would have to be handled with some delicacy.” My brother gave me a flat look. “Just make sure that it’s handled,” he said. “Or I’ll be forced to discuss this with…” and there he paused. I knew he had meant to say Grandfather, but that was no longer an option. “Mother,” I supplied for him. “You’ll be forced to discuss this with our mother.” “I’m sure she’ll be thrilled,” he said, his voice at its most droll. I somehow doubted Mother would have the same reaction as her eldest son, but I said nothing. It was better for Daniel to think he had won. “If you feel the need to share this information with her, then let’s do it now,” I said, making a show of rising from my chair. “We might as well get this all out in the open.” “Forget it,” he said, getting to his feet and preparing to stalk out of the room. “I don’t want to worry her with such pointless trivia. Just make sure you end things with that foolish, little mortal. You should go to New York and find yourself a proper vampiress to love, if you’re feeling the need for a romantic liaison.” “That’s good advice,” I told him. “It’s something I’ll keep in mind.” Daniel left, feeling satisfied that he had the upper hand. But nothing he could do or say would ever change the way I felt about Colette. Our very souls were drawn to each other. There was nothing that could drive us apart, even with our apparently insurmountable differences. Some things were meant to be.” But Daniel’s actions did cause me concern. I didn’t want Colette to be exposed to the dangers of the vampire world. She didn’t want to hear about my family’s curse, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t arm her in some other way. I immediately flew to Main Street in Tiburon and gazed through the window of Houghton’s, the local jewelry shop. One side of the window displayed gold jewelry and the other half showed the silver items for sale. I spied a sterling silver locket in the shape of a heart. It was perfect for my plans. Pulling a pen, paper and an envelope from my pocket, I penned a quick note to the store owner, asking him to please have the locket delivered to the Vanderlind Castle the following day. With the letter, I included several bills. I knew it was probably more than the small silver trinket cost, but I preferred to pay too much rather than too little. After that I headed for home. My purchase was just a small gesture, but hopefully something that would go a few steps toward keeping my darling girl safe. Colette Gibson meant the world to me. My brother was probably right, as far as what was the reasonable thing to do, but he didn’t understand how I felt in my heart. And I doubted explaining it to him would make much of a difference. By the time I got up the next afternoon, the package had already arrived. I opened it to view the pendant up close, being careful not to actually touch the silver as I flipped open the clamshell box. It was a pretty puffed heart with the silver polished to a shine, yet also understated enough not to draw too much attention. I thought it would be perfect as a present for Colette. I would have gladly given her a diamond the size of a robin’s egg, but we were being clandestine with our love and a showy piece of jewelry might give things away. I tried to arrange to see Colette during the day while she was working, but luck was not on my side. Daniel was awake and skulking around the house. He didn’t bother saying anything to me, nor did he appear to be all that interested in keeping an eye on Miss Gibson, but his presence held me in check from speaking to her. That night I took extra care as I was leaving the castle. At first I flew toward the woods, until I was certain Daniel wasn’t following me. I waited a good hour longer than I normally did before heading to Colette’s house. There was always a strong chance my brother was waiting for me there. But I knew Daniel to be an impatient man. I was convinced that after sitting in wait for thirty minutes, he would give up and look for something else to do. The only problem was that I had no way of contacting Colette to explain my delay. I hoped her feelings wouldn’t be too hurt. I surveyed the area before alighting in the Gibson’s back yard. I was always reasonably cautious about such things, — it was never a good idea to be sighted by a mortal farmer with insomnia — but with Daniel’s suspicions aroused, I had to be even more cautious. I knew my brother meant to force my hand. Little did he realize in which direction I would pull. I had no intention of giving Colette up under any circumstances. Reassured that there were no other vampires about, I strode over to our apple tree, only to have Colette appear out of the shadows. “I didn’t think you were coming,” she said. “I’m sorry, darling,” I told her, immediately taking her in my arms. “My brother suspects there is something between us and…” “And you didn’t want to admit to caring for someone like me,” she said, attempting to finish my sentence for me. “No, that’s not it at all,” I insisted, pulling her even closer. “I would rather give him up than you. But he can cause trouble for us,” I had to admit. “So I waited until I was sure he wasn’t following me.” “How could he cause trouble for us?” she asked. “And why?” I scrunched my face and tried to think of a good way to explain it. “Daniel’s… very traditional,” was all I could think to say. “He’s very inflexible about the Vanderlind name and all that rot. I’m sure he would cause a stink if he thought we had any serious intentions in mind. But my brother is also kind of an idiot, so I rarely pay any attention to him,” I assured her. “So your family wouldn’t approve of me?” she asked, her eyes glistening with potential tears. “My mother would,” I told her. Colette sniffed. “How do you know?” “Because, above everything else, my mother wants her children to be happy.” I placed a tender kiss on her lips. “And you make me happier than I ever imagined I could be.” Colette leaned into me and sighed, contentedly. “I know exactly how you feel.” “I have something for you,” I said, reaching into the breast pocket of my coat for the small, velvet box. “What?” she asked, lifting her head, her eyes wide with surprise. “I have a present for you,” I told her, placing the box in both of her hands. “Open it.” “Oh, Jessie,” she exclaimed as she flipped open the lid. “Oh, it’s so beautiful. I love it.” Colette’s already beautiful face blossomed into a radiant smile. “How did you know?” she asked. “Emily told me,” I said, for lack of a better answer. I had unwittingly done something that had made her very happy and I didn’t want that happiness to fade one ounce, so I concealed my ignorance. “Emily,” she said, giving a small frown. “I don’t think I told her it was my birthday.” It was Colette’s birthday! I took a moment to thank my lucky stars that I had a gift for her. “You’ll have to forgive me, darling, but how old are you today?” “Seventeen,” she said, rather shyly. “Seventeen,” I repeated. Colette and I were the same age. But she would one day turn eighteen and I would never see another birthday. “Does turning seventeen hold any particular significance here in the United States?” I asked. “What do you mean?” Colette wanted to know. “I mean like how in countries where the predominant religion is Judaism, turning thirteen is held in high regard.” “Not really,” she said. And then, putting her hand to her cheek, she added, “Except for maybe one thing.” “What’s that?” I asked. And then Colette explained about a neighboring Justice of the Peace who was very accommodating about granting marriage licenses without a young lady’s parents giving consent, just as long as the girl was seventeen. This was very good news, indeed. I stared at her for a few seconds, torn between prudence and dropping to one knee and proposing right there, on the spot. If I had still been a mortal, then I would have done the latter. But the fact that Colette didn’t know that I was a member of the undead kept me from my matrimonial impulse. “Help me put this on,” Colette said, pulling the pendant from its box. I think she was concealing a blush. “Ah,” I said. I hadn’t anticipated she would ask for my assistance. “I’m afraid I’m a bit clumsy with delicate clasps.” “Oh, please try,” she told me. “I want to wear it right away.” Steeling myself against the pain, I took hold of the silver and attempted to fasten the pendant around her neck. The metal immediately began burning my skin instantly. It was like I was pinching a glowing hot poker between my fingers. I tried not to utter any acknowledgement of pain. I thought surely I could endure the agony long enough to secure a simple clasp. But I had never previously encountered silver as a member of the undead. The pain was excruciating. My hands started to tremble with the effort. “I can’t do it, I’m afraid,” I told her, releasing the chain. “Here, let me try,” she said, taking over. A moment later and the pendant was fastened around her slender neck. “There.” She turned toward me. “What do you think?”",

It wasn’t the idea of a strong man, but the lightning strike of love had made me weak. “If I asked you to do something for me, would you be able to keep it a secret?” “What kind of secret?” Emily asked, her eyes instantly shining. “It’s not that big of a secret,” I told her, just something I’d like to keep from Old Denkie.” After a bit of thought, I added, “And probably Mother and Daniel.” “I can keep a secret,” she assured me. “I promise,” she said, crossing her heart. “Now what is it?” “I want you to find out what you can about a girl. She’s a maid that just started working here. But I want you to be very discrete.” “What do you want to know about her?” Emily asked, squirming a little with the excitement of her task. “Not much, really. I’d just like to know the days that she’ll be working here. And maybe the hours she’ll be working. And anything else you happen to find out.” “Because you like her?” Emily asked, wearing a big smile. “No.” I shook my head. “I’m not allowed to care about mortals anymore. You know that.” And then, before she could worry, I hastily added, “The only mortal I’m still allowed to love is you.” “So you do like her,” Emily said. “You love her,” she concluded with the perceptiveness of youth. “I don’t even know her,” I exclaimed. “If you’re going to let your imagination run away with you, then I’m sorry I asked. Please forget that I said anything.” “No, I’ll find out for you,” she said, giving me a sly look out of the corner of her eye. “I want to find out. And I’ll be clever about it. I promise.” With that, she got to her feet and started heading for the door. “Oh,” she said, stopping abruptly. “But you have to tell me; what’s her name?” I suppressed a sigh before telling her, “Colette Gibson.” Chapter 27 Colette Lilly and I were in the mud room, taking off our aprons and getting ready to head home for the day. We’d spent most of our afternoon finishing up the library. The time passed as a blur for me. I couldn’t even focus on the titles of the books I was dusting. All of my thoughts were consumed by the memory of Jessie Vanderlind. Part of me felt like I should apologize to Lilly. I had thought her tunnel focus on spending time with Walter had been foolish and a little immature. But just a few minutes with Jessie Vanderlind had made me realize that I was wrong. I knew nothing about him, yet all I wanted to do was be with him. Before that moment, I had never understood how deeply people could love. When I first looked into Jessie Vanderlind’s eyes, the first instant that I saw him, I felt like there was a violin string running through my body and someone had plucked it. I could still feel it vibrating, deep in the very core of me, even thought I hadn’t seen Jessie for hours. The door opened and a young girl stepped inside the small room. “Hello,” she said to me, giving me a hesitant smile. “Hello,” I said in reply. The girl looked to be eleven or twelve. She was very pretty with blonde, curly hair and large gray eyes. She wore a velvet dress and shiny Mary Jane shoes. I knew without guessing that she had to be a member of the Vanderlind family. No one else in Tiburon could afford such fine clothes. Maybe for a wedding, but not for just wandering around the house on a Monday evening. “What’s your name?” the girl asked. “My name is Lettie,” I told her. “And this is my sister, Lilly.” The girl smiled and tilted her head to one side. “Is Lettie short for something? Colette, maybe?” “That’s right,” I said. “What your name?” “I’m Emily,” she told me. “How do you do?” “How do you do?” I replied, suppressing a vague urge to drop a curtsy; she was so adorably formal. “How many days a week will you work here?” she asked. It seemed like an odd question, but I didn’t mind indulging a curious child. “We’re supposed to work ten to seven, every day, but Sunday,” I told her. “But Mrs. Denkler just told us this morning that we might have to work later some evenings.” “And you’re a maid?” Emily asked. Expanding her question to include my sister, she said. “You’re both maids?” “Yes,” I told her. “We’re both downstairs maids. And are you a Vanderlind? Or maybe the chauffeur.” “Yes,” she said with a broad smile. “I’m the chauffeur.” Then she hastily added, “But I’m also a Vanderlind. Jessie’s my brother.” Then her cheeks grew red for some reason and she dashed out of the room. I had to wonder what my brief exchange with Emily Vanderlind was all about. I couldn’t remember if she’d been in the great hall, watching the men raise the chandelier. Had her brother spoken to her about me? I immediately chastised myself for such a flight of fancy. Mr. Jessie Vanderlind would never have any interest in a girl like me. Mrs. Denkler had made that abundantly clear. “Come on. Let’s go,” Lilly said, breaking me out of my musings. “Papa’s probably waiting.” I had trouble sleeping that night. I kept waking up, thinking someone was in the room with us. It startled me to the point that I half considered waking Lilly. But I knew I was being foolish, so instead I got out of bed, put on my robe and went to sit by the window. The moon was only half full, so it was a perfect night to just sit and gaze at the stars. I’d heard that there were so many electric lights in New York City that the stars were washed away and you couldn’t really see them at night. That wasn’t the case in Tiburon. It was a small town. Actually, there were some houses on the outskirts of town that still didn’t even have electricity. I sighed, looking up at the sky. I’d always yearned for something outside of the life laid out before me. It wasn’t that I didn’t love my family and the house where we lived. I even enjoyed our modest town. But I’d always secretly pined for something more that I couldn’t place my finger on. And now that yearning had a name; Jessie Vanderlind. Movement in a nearby tree startled me a little and drew my attention. The trees were nothing but black silhouettes at night. I stared at the closest trees rather intently for several seconds. Was there something up in the apple tree, over toward the trunk? It was a dark form, but too large to be an owl or any other kind of bird. There was definitely a mass in the tree and I thought I had seen it move. I scanned the ground below the tree. I didn’t see a ladder or a car or anything. The apple’s lowest branches were too far up for anyone to climb up there without assistance. What in the world was in our tree? Feeling a shiver running up my spine, I drew the curtains and hurried back to bed. I knew I was being foolish, but I couldn’t shake the distinct feeling that someone or something was watching me. The next morning I slept in a little. I was tired from my bout of insomnia. One of the benefits of having a job that didn’t start until ten o’clock was that I didn’t have to get up at the crack of dawn. By the time I opened my eyes; Lilly had already gotten out of bed and opened the curtains. It seemed silly to be nervous about looking outside in full daylight, but I had a flash of anxiety. Whatever I had caught a glimpse of out the window during the night had seemed very real. But in the bright light of day, I felt ashamed of my cowardice. I forced myself to stand up straight and walk over to the window. There in the tree branches, where I had thought I’d seen a creature the previous evening, was a large squirrel’s nest. I immediately felt like a fool, but at least it explained why I’d seen movement in the tree. What it didn’t explain was how a sizeable squirrel’s nest had magically appeared overnight. And didn’t squirrels usually build their nests in the fall? I wasn’t a squirrel expert, but I didn’t think they did their building in the spring. I shrugged it off. I had always thought of myself as an observant person, but I’d obviously overlooked a large nest just outside of the window I gazed out of every day of my life. As I came downstairs, I could hear Lilly talking with our parents. “It’s because their one son has some kind of blood disease,” she was telling them. “I wonder what kind of disease that would be,” I heard my mother say. “It seems an awful lot of money.” As I walked into the kitchen, I heard my father shift his chair. “If they have the means, and don’t want to run out of blood, then it’s probably a smart move.” “I wonder how the poor dear managed to make the voyage from Europe, if he’s in such bad shape,” Mother said. Then she noticed me as I headed over to the breakfast nook. “Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” “I had trouble sleeping,” I said, helping myself to some toast from a plate. “Say, has anybody noticed the big squirrel’s nest up in the apple tree near Lilly and my window? It’s huge, but I don’t remember seeing it before. When did the squirrels build that?” “That’s been there for months,” my father informed me. “I’ve half a mind to knock it down.” “I don’t see how it’s hurting anyone,” Mama said in a gentle voice. She was of the strong conviction that my father didn’t have enough to do. He was always starting small projects and then letting them expand into giant tasks. “I hear Mr. Thorton is putting a new roof on his barn this afternoon. Maybe you could ride over after you drop the girls off and see what that’s all about.” Papa looked at Mama out of the corner of his eye. He knew she was worried that he’d end up cutting down the apple tree if he got started on the squirrels. “I guess I might as well leave the nest alone.” he said. “And Jim Thorton doesn’t know one end of a ladder from the other. I’d better go make sure he doesn’t bust his head.” Chapter 28 Jessie It was embarrassing to admit, but I followed Colette and her sister home. It was really more happenstance than anything intentional. I’d spent the day pacing in my room. I couldn’t get the vision of Colette Gibson out of my head and it was impossible for me to focus on anything else. By nightfall, I was restless and feeling like I needed to stretch my wings, so to speak. I headed to the castle roof. I figured no one would notice if I took a few laps soaring up and down the Tiburon River. I doubted there would be any fisherman around so late in the evening. There might be a few couples canoodling on the shore, but they would probably only have eyes for each other. As I looked over the edge of the castle roof, I could see Colette and her sister climbing into an automobile. It sounded like their father had stopped by to pick them up. I rose into the air as the car drove away, fully intending to stick to the waterway, but then I found myself following the Gibson family through the streets of Tiburon. I hid on a neighboring rooftop as Colette climbed out of the car, following her father and sister into an attractive house with a neat front yard. There was no distinction between the backyard and the open fields dotted with trees behind the house. After that I forced myself to fly back home. It would be inappropriate for me to spy on the family while they ate their dinner. I still missed sitting down to an evening meal each night. I wondered how long I had to be a member of the undead before I forgot how it felt to enjoy food that wasn’t blood red and in a cup. But after being home for a few hours, I found myself circling the Gibson house again, viewing it from all sides. I just wanted to be near Colette, but I knew there was no excuse for my behavior. I wouldn’t like it very much if there was some stranger sitting outside the castle, just hoping for a glimpse of Emily. So I decided to stop acting like a love-sick fool and go home. Giving one more glance toward the darkened house where a girl lived that I didn’t even know, I was shocked to see that very girl gazing out the window. There was no time for me to fly away before she would notice me, so I concealed myself in the branches of a tree. I knew she must have caught a glimpse of me because, after staring in my direction for several seconds, she swiped the curtain closed. I sat in the apple tree for at least an hour, never taking my eyes off the window. I wanted to make sure that no one was peeking out. Then I quickly gathered as many dead leaves and dried grasses as I could find, rolled it all into a ball and stuffed it into the crook of the tree where I had tried to conceal myself. It wasn’t the best deception, but it was the only thing I could think of to explain the dark figure that Colette had obviously glimpsed. I spent the next week trying not to think about Colette and failing miserably. It would have been one thing if she was just some girl I had seen through a shop window and found attractive. But I had spoken to Colette. I knew the music of her voice. She had rushed to my aid when she thought I was grievously injured. She had held my hand and tried to ease my pain, not realizing she was creating the excruciating pain of longing, just by doing so. And then the fates had arranged it so she was in my home six days a week, dusting, and polishing, and scrubbing at things. It was true that the castle was an enormous structure. It was easy enough to avoid someone else in the building, if that was what you desired. But I desired to be with Colette every minute of every day. Keeping away from her was exquisite torture. I was acting like an idiot. I knew that without a doubt. Colette Gibson was just a charming young woman who had caught my fancy. There was nothing more to it. I arose each evening with the new determination to forget about the pretty housemaid who probably thought no more of me than she did my brother. “Your sweethearts going to a dance,” my sister told me one evening after I had just gotten out of bed and made my way downstairs. Emily had become very good at engaging Colette in casual conversation, whenever she had the chance. I hadn’t asked her to pursue more information from the maid after my first request, but she somehow decided to take it upon herself. “She isn’t my sweetheart,” I told her in a stern voice. “And I’m sorry I asked you to find out about her in the first place. She’s just a young woman who works in this house and she deserves her privacy.” “So you don’t want to know about the dance?” Emily asked, her eyes a little wide with surprise. “No,” I told her, trying to make my voice sound firm, although inwardly I felt stung. I couldn’t imagine Colette going to a dance with any young man, but me. “You don’t want to know that it’s next Saturday night at the Mansfield Country Club in Mansfield, Ohio?” she said. I could tell that my sister was enjoying taunting me. “It’s none of my business,” I informed her. “And I want to hear nothing more about it.” The truth was I desperately wanted to hear about it, but knowing the details would do me no good. “And I suppose you don’t care that she doesn’t want to go because she doesn’t like her date,” Emily said, her voice teasing. “Why would she go if she doesn’t like her date?” I couldn’t help but asked. My little sister shrugged. “I guess she’s double dating with her sister and her boyfriend,” she said. “She wants to get out of it, but then her sister wouldn’t be able to go.” “Oh,” I said. This piece of information made me frown. Any man would be lucky to having Colette Gibson as his date, so I assumed her escort would behave like a gentleman, but that didn’t explain her reluctance to go. “There’s going to be swing music,” Emily went on. “Aren’t you a fan of swing music?” “I enjoy all types of music,” I muttered, still thinking about Lettie’s date. “Maybe you should get out some evening and go see a swing band,” Emily suggested with a suppressed giggle in her voice. I immediately understood what she was suggesting. “No,” I told her, shaking my head. “That wouldn’t be right.” “Why not?” Emily wanted to know. “Then maybe you could talk with her. Or even dance with her.” My little sister’s eyes started glowing again. “Come on,” she said, nudging my arm. “I know you want to.” “Emily,” I said, taking both her hands and bending down so that we were forehead to forehead. “I’m not going to any dance. Not a mortal dance,” I informed her. “You know that would be dangerous for everyone, including me.” “But you’re getting a lot better at controlling your appetite. Aren’t you?” she asked, leaning her weight slightly onto me. “I am, but a dance is not a place to test my new found self control,” I informed her, straightening my spine, but still holding her hands. “I suppose not,” my little sister said with a sigh. “It’s just that I like her so much. She’s really funny and she seems really nice.” Closing my eyes for a second, I indulged in a sigh of my own. “Can we please not talk about Miss Gibson anymore?” I really didn’t need any more confirmation about how wonderful she was. “She brings flowers to Arthur. Did you know that?” “What?” I opened my eyes and frowned at my little sister. “There have been a couple of days now where she shows up to work with a bouquet of wildflowers,” Emily reported. “I guess Colette and her sister ride over here on their bicycles. Sometimes she stops and cuts Arthur some flowers.” “Why would she bring Arthur wildflowers?” I was puzzled. Arthur didn’t even exist; not that she knew that. “I asked her the same thing.” Emily preened a little, pleased by her own cleverness. “She said that she hoped it might cheer him up a little to have some nature in his room. She said she felt bad that he was sick and couldn’t go outside himself.” “Oh.” I thought this over. “That’s very sweet.” And, unfortunately, it made me admire Miss Gibson even more. “She’s perfect for you,” Emily said. “I mean, really perfect.” “Perfect, except for one thing,” I reminded her, letting go of her hands. “We can never be together.” Chapter 29 Colette I didn’t know if Jessie Vanderlind was avoiding me or if he was never home. Or maybe he was always just in another part of the castle. Their home was so massive and the family usually slept so late, that it wasn’t unusual for us to never see any of them for days at a time. Except for the youngest girl, Emily. She seemed to be a morning person. She usually popped by to see Lilly and me at least once a day and frequently found a reason to spend time in whichever room we happened to be cleaning. She was a charming girl and I felt a little sorry for her. The rest of the family never seemed to be around, so she rambled the house by herself most of the time. Sometimes Emily would go to the back of the house where the makeshift clinic was set up to draw blood from the volunteers. She liked to put on a little apron and play nurse, chatting with the people and serving them sandwiches, along with something to drink. Word had started to spread around Tiburon that the Vanderlinds would pay good money and supply a meal in exchange for a pint of blood. The first few days only two or three people showed up and these were people who looked very down on their luck. But it didn’t take long before there was a line of people each morning as the nurses hired to draw the blood opened the back door. The clinic began using a signup sheet where people were supposed to write their names. But then it became clear that some of the people willing to volunteer were unable to sign their names, so rather than embarrass some poor fellow who was struggling, the nurses started listing the names themselves. It didn’t take long before the Vanderlinds had more blood than they could handle, but they never turned anyone away. We’d heard that some of the local hospitals were happy to take what could be spared and that rumor was confirmed by men in white jackets driving up to the castle in an ambulance and then leaving with chests packed full of ice. Lilly and I had only caught a few glimpses of the rest of the Vanderlind family, Jessie’s mother and brother. The brother, whose name was Daniel, was a lot like Jessie in general appearance, but he was made with less generous lines. His lips were thin and his hair was flat. He was somewhat handsome, but his features didn’t have the ample curves that Jessie’s had. No one ever saw poor Arthur, of course. He didn’t seem to ever leave his room and his isolation weighed on me. The real surprise was the mother. She didn’t look a day over twenty-five. In fact, she looked more like a sister than a mother to her two sons. She had raven black hair and a flawless complexion. “I wonder what she puts on her face at night to keep it so wrinkle-free,” Lilly said one day while we were having lunch with Millie. “You know, I asked her lady’s maid that very question,” Millie said between bites of a sandwich. “I’m not sure if she just didn’t understand me because of the language barrier, but she insisted that her mistress applied nothing to her face at all. She’s just naturally like that.” “Hmmm...” Lilly frowned. “I’m not sure I believe that. I bet she has some face cream from Europe that costs about a hundred dollars a bottle.” We didn’t have all that much to do as downstairs maids at the castle. Yes, we dusted quite a bit, washed windows, beat rugs, freshened drapes, and whatever else Mrs. Denkler could think of, but none of the things we were assigned to clean were actually all that dirty. If I found a thin layer of dust on any surface, it was always a surprise to me. There were only five Vanderlinds, after all, so it came as no wonder that there wasn’t much of a mess. Plus the family kept barely any kitchen staff. I’d only ever seen Emily seated for a meal. When I asked Mrs. Denkler about it, she said, “Not that it’s any of your business, but the family are practicing vegetarians. They eat very little, and their food is usually raw, so they don’t need a dozen chefs to prepare it.” Even with the peculiarities of the household, I loved working at the castle. The Vanderlinds had such beautiful things, and some of them appeared quite ancient. There were a few full suits of armor that we were assigned to oil one afternoon. We polished ornately carved chairs that were so massive, I thought of them as thrones. And they may very well have been thrones, for all I knew. But the best thing about working at the Vanderlind Castle was that it was where Jessie lived. Although I rarely caught a glimpse of him, I could feel his presence all around me and it kept the metal string running through my body vibrating all the time. “I’ve not been disappointed with your performance,” Mrs. Denkler told the two of us the next morning. Lilly and I exchanged glances. This was high praise from Mrs. Denkler. She went on, “As long as you girls don’t do anything silly, then I’d like to keep you on as part of the downstairs staff.” “Thank you, Mrs. Denkler,” we said in unison. I hadn’t even realized we were still under review. “If you keep up the good work, then after a period of six months you will receive a wage increase of fifty cents per day,” the housekeeper informed us. Lilly and I exchanged another look. That would be a whole extra dollar between us per day. That would be six dollars per week. Mama and Papa would be thrilled. “I’m afraid school starts in the fall,” Lilly felt the need to point out. “I can stay on because I’ve graduated, but our parents will expect Lettie to finish up high school.” “I could still come after school and on Saturdays,” I blurted. I’d been so happy working at the castle that it never occurred to me that I would go back to school. The housekeeper scowled at both of us. “That’s ridiculous,” she said. “Why would you waste your time at school when you already have good paying jobs?” “Our mother and father value education,” I had to admit, even though it pained me. I did not want to go back to school. I wanted to keep working. I wanted to be near Jessie. “I had not anticipated you leaving here so soon,” Mrs. Denkler said, scowling some more. “I might not be as happy with a new girl.” Then she looked me in the eye. “But you’ll stay until your school begins again?” I assured her that I was happy to stay. Since we were firmly established at the castle, Mama and Papa thought it would be okay for us to ride our bicycles to work as the weather grew fine. They were more concerned about us riding home as the sun was going down, so we had to promise to stick together and ride single file, even on the country roads. Some of the local boys liked to race their jalopies in the country and mother was constantly concerned that one of us might be knocked down by the reckless youths. We had to promise to pull off the road immediately if we heard the rattle of a car engine. Riding to work each morning was one of my favorite times of the day. I knew it was foolish, but I always held out hope that I would see Jessie. Not to speak with him or anything, but maybe just to catch a glimpse of him. The fields and meadows that we rode past on our bicycles were decorated with the cheerful faces of wildflowers. They reminded me of a dream I’d had the previous night where I was lying in a field, holding Jessie’s hand while the sun shone down on us and birds performed a serenade. It was a silly dream. Mrs. Denkler had made it clear that the Vanderlinds did not fare well in the sunshine. It made me sad to think about it, especially for poor Arthur. His life sounded very hard, always being confined to his room. “Hold up a minute,” I called to my sister, pulling over to the side of the road. “What is it?” she called, turning to look back at me as she slowed her bike. “Did your chain slip?” “No,” I told her, pushing down my kickstand and hurrying into the nearby field. “I just want to gather some flowers for Arthur, to cheer up his room.” “You’re not allowed in his room,” Lilly reminded me. “I know, but I can put them in a vase and the nurse can take them up the next time he needs a transfusion.” Lilly made a little noise of disapproval that she’d learned from our mother, but she didn’t try to stop me. “Just hurry up, please,” she said. “I don’t want to be late.” I quickly gathered what I could, laid the flowers in my bicycle basket, and then hurried to catch up with Lilly, who had already started pedaling, once she saw me returning to my bike. “What are those doing in here?” Mrs. Denkler asked, giving the flowers a disapproving look when I brought them in. “They’re for Arthur,” I explained. “I feel so sorry that he can’t enjoy the lovely weather we’ve been having, so I thought maybe I’d bring a little nature to him. Mrs. Denkler opened her mouth to say something, closed it again, and then frowned at the flowers some more. “I think there are some glass vases under the sink in the kitchen,” she said. “One of those should serve for wildflowers.” I knew this was the closest I was going to get to Mrs. Denkler’s approval, so I hurried to mostly unused kitchen. “Leave the flowers at the bottom of the stairs and the nurse will take them up,” she called after me. “And don’t take all day. You’re not being paid to fuss over flowers.” That night, Lilly and I were both rousted from our sleep by a commotion. The phone started ringing and a few moments later someone was pounding on the front door. “What is it?” Lilly wondered aloud as we both leapt out of bed to grab our robes. “I don’t know,” I told her. But then I sniffed the air. “Smells like smoke.” Then we both shivered. Somewhere there was a fire. The door to our room opened and Mama stuck her head in. “Girls, the school is on fire. Get dressed.” Before we could pepper her with questions, she shut the door again. Lilly and I looked at each other. “How did the school catch fire?” Lilly voiced the questions that I was wondering. After we both were dressed, we hurried downstairs to catch Papa just as he was leaving. He gave Mama a kiss and said, “It’ll be alright, Lillian,” and then he hurried out the door to hop in a car that was waiting for him. “What’s happening?” I asked, as soon as he’d left. “The school caught fire,” Mama told us. “Nobody knows how, but it’s a big one. Bundle up because we’re going to have to help with the line.” Tiburon had a volunteer fire department, of which our father was a member. But when a fire was quite large, every able bodied person was expected to help out, usually as a link in a bucket line. Citizens would form a line from the fire to the nearest well or pump. Then we would pass full buckets down the line to the firemen and bring empty buckets back up the line to be refilled. If the fire was very large, then several lines would form on several sides of the burning building. Most fires were handled by the volunteer firefighters, so when they immediately called for a bucket brigade, we knew things were not going well. We could see a weird orange glow in the sky as we got in the car. Even though we were some distance from the school, the smell of smoke filled the air. Mama drove along, cautiously, immediately pulling off the road if anyone was trying to get by. She didn’t want to delay any members of the fire department who were trying to catch up with the rest of the volunteers. “I think we’ll park at the library and then walk over,” she said as we approached the center of town. “That way we won’t be clogging up the roads.” Other members of the bucket brigade must have had the same idea because the library parking lot was almost full when we pulled in. “Come on, girls,” Mama said, immediately hurrying out of the car. “Stick together and stay out of the firemen’s way.” As soon as we saw the school, we simultaneously gasped. The entire building was engulfed in flames. Mrs. McGreevy, head of the bucket brigade, hurried over to us. “Come on. We’re wetting down the neighboring buildings to try to stop the fire’s spread,” she shouted over the racket of the fire. “If the wind picks up, the whole town could go.” We spent the next several hours passing full and empty buckets up and down the line. A few times the firemen thought they had the blaze under control, only to have it flare up again with the night wind. As dawn started to warm the sky, the fire quieted down and the bucket brigade was told that the fire department could handle things from there and everyone else should go home. No neighboring buildings had caught fire, but the school was just a smoking pile of ashes and cinders. “It looks like arson,” Papa said, late the next morning when we had all finally crawled from our beds. Mama called us in sick to the castle and Mrs. Denkler was apparently very understanding about the whole thing. “Looks like the entire perimeter of the school was doused with gasoline,” our father went on. “Thank the Lord Mr. Green wasn’t about or this could have been a real tragedy.” Mr. Green was the school’s janitor. He usually stayed there most evenings, but sometimes he went to visit his sister in Cincinnati during the summer. “What are they going to do about classes?” Lilly asked. “Where will everybody go in the fall?” Papa rubbed his chin. “That hasn’t quite been figured out yet,” he said. “Might be that school is just delayed until the town can get enough money to build a new one.” “Arson,” Mama repeated, shaking her head. “And the whole school gone. Who would do such a thing?” I was as upset as everyone else about the school, but also, secretly, my heart was singing. I’d received a reprieve. I’d be able to keep working at the castle. Chapter 30 Colette A few days after the fire, I left the house a little earlier than usual so that I could gather a proper bouquet of wildflowers. Mrs. Denkler frowned some more when she saw it. Shaking her head slightly, she said, “Just hurry up with that nonsense. Leave the vase at the bottom of the stairs.” “I’m so excited for Saturday,” Lilly told me later that day as we scrubbed the kitchen floor, even though it was already spotless. “Saturday?” I said vaguely. Was something happening on Saturday? I couldn’t remember. “It’s the dance,” Lilly exclaimed, giving me a look that let me know she thought it was an event that was impossible to forget. “In Mansfield,” she went on. “At the country club.” “Oh.” It was my turn to exclaim. “Is that happening already? I thought it wasn’t for a few more weeks.” “It’s this Saturday,” my sister said in a voice that let me know that she was going to brook no excuses. “I’ve already asked Mrs. Denkler if we can leave early.” “Oh,” I said again. “What did she say?” “Well, she didn’t like it, but she agreed,” Lilly told me. “Just as long as we come in early on Monday to make up the hours.” “That’s nice,” I said, although even I knew there was no enthusiasm in my voice. Lilly stopped her scrubbing and turned to look at me. “Aren’t you the least little bit excited?” she asked. “I haven’t exactly thought about it,” I told her, keeping my eyes on my work. Truth be told, I had thought about it from time to time, but always with a vague feeling of dread. “You’ll probably feel differently with Lev twirling you around the dance floor,” she told me. “I doubt that,” was my reply. “Are you sure he wouldn’t rather take some other girl? I mean, we could always say I twisted my ankle and then maybe...” I searched my brain for a substitute that Lev would find acceptable. “Don’t even think about it,” Lilly told me. “You are not spraining your ankle. I agreed to go to the job interview here just so you would agree to go to the dance. Now I’ve held up my end of the bargain and it’s time for you to hold up yours.” “But you like working here,” I insisted. “That’s beside the point,” she informed me. “You agreed to go with Lev Wilson to the dance at the Mansfield Country Club, so you are going and you are going to have a lovely time.” There didn’t appear to be any way to squirm out of it. Lilly could force me to go to the dance, and I wouldn’t sulk or anything, but with Lev as my date, I highly doubted the evening would be enjoyable. Not unless Lev caught laryngitis. Lilly and I each had an organdy dress from a year earlier, when our mother’s youngest sister got married. We’d both grown a little since then, but when my mother made the dresses, she’d included a generous seam allowance. She was able to let both dresses out and lower the hems so that they fit perfectly. Lilly took extra time on my hair and managed, with the aid of hair tonic and about a hundred bobby pins, to fashion it into an upsweep that both she and Mama said was quite becoming. Papa had out his camera and took our picture before the boys came to get us. Walter and Lev arrived looking freshly scrubbed, but it was obvious they were both in borrowed suits. Lev’s was a little too small and Walter’s was a little too big. I wondered if they would have been better off just switching what they were wearing, but I wasn’t going to say anything. I noticed that this time Lev’s right cheek had a faded yellow bruise on it and he had more plasters on his knuckles, which he tried to conceal by keeping his hands clasped behind his back most of the time. I didn’t know what kind of roughhousing he and his friends got up to, but they seemed a little too old for such violent hijinx. “Here,” Lev said, thrusting a box at me. “I got you something.” Inside was a wrist corsage with a single pink rose, surrounded by baby’s breath and tied with a pink ribbon. “Thank you,” I said. It was my first corsage and it was actually quite pretty. I only wished it had been given to me by somebody else. Anybody else, really. Lev shrugged, as if it was no big deal. “I know girls like flowers and this reminded me of you.” Walter presented Lilly with a nosegay of wildflowers, clumsily fashioned with a yellow ribbon. I knew she had secretly been hoping for a corsage of her own, but she acted like he had just handed her an emerald ring. Papa wanted to make another picture, but he was all out of film, so we piled into Lev’s new car with our dates undocumented. Lev got the door for me. He hadn’t said much since arriving to pick us up and that made me feel a little better about the evening. Maybe it wouldn’t be so miserable after all. “The Charlie Barnet Orchestra is going to be playing,” Lev told me as he drove us along. He kept the car at a reasonable speed and was considerate of other motorists out for an evening drive. “Barnet is almost still a kid, but I hear he’s a genius on the saxophone.” I began to actually look forward to the evening. I did like to dance, and swing bands were starting to be popular on the radio. It would be neat to get to experience one in person. Plus, it was nice to have something to think about besides my longing for Jessie Vanderlind. Over the past several days, thoughts of him had taken up way too much of my time. I needed to stop fantasizing about him and live my life. I needed to go out and have new experiences; not spend every minute of every day pining for a man who could never be mine. The Mansfield Country Club was practically glowing with the excitement of the evening. The bushes along the long driveway leading up to the main building had been festooned with twinkle lights. There were at least ten cars ahead of us, waiting for the valet service. Men in snappy uniforms and white gloves were helping guests out of their cars. We could already hear music drifting out of the building. Many of the ladies who were helped from the vehicles were older and dressed far more elegantly than I had been expecting. The men were all in suits, but not dressed quite as spectacularly as their wives and sweethearts. “Who’s hosting this dance?” I asked as we waited. Lilly might have mentioned it at some point, but I hadn’t been paying attention. “An associate of my boss,” Lev told me. “He’s a very well connected guy from way back in the day.” I scanned my memory to see if I had any inkling of what Lev Wilson did for a living. Didn’t his father sell appliances? Was that right? Did Lev sell appliances? No, that didn’t make any sense. Somewhere in the back of my brain I thought maybe I remembered he had something to do with security. I had no idea what kind of security. But, judging by the other guests at the dance, it was for people who had more money that anyone I knew. I thought it would be rude to ask Lev questions about his work when I knew he had probably already told me every detail about it, so I didn’t say anything else. As we entered the dance, Lilly and I were both handed a dance card, done up with pink ribbon, each with a miniature pencil attached. “You won’t need that tonight,” Lev said with a grin. “You can pretty much count on dancing every dance with me.” “Same goes for you,” Walter said, giving Lilly a nudge and then breaking into a wide grin. Lilly nudged her date in return. “I could say the same to you.” They both laughed. “Come here for a minute,” Lev said, herding us all to one side of the foyer. He reached in his pocket and pulled out a silver colored flask. “I know there’s a bar,” he said, uncorking it, “but it’s a cash bar, so I thought we might as well get a little warmed up first.” Lev took a large slug out of the flask and then shoved it in my direction. I’d had a few sips of wine before, but I’d never tried hard alcohol and I didn’t think it was time for me to start. “No thank you,” I told him. Flashing me a quick look of disdain, Lev then offered the flask to my sister. “No thanks,” she said, shaking her head. “It’s gives me a stomach ache.” I didn’t think Lilly had ever tried booze before either, but at least she had a good excuse. With a sigh, Lev positioned the flask in front of Walter. “Don’t let me down, Wally Boy,” he said. Walter accepted the bottle, shooting an apologetic look in my sister’s direction, and then took a modest sip. After which, he grimace a little as the liquor slid into his belly. Lev grabbed the flask back from his friend and took another big slug out of it, just to show us how it was done. After putting the cap back on the bottle, Lev said, “Come on. Let’s check out this Barnet fellow.” Grabbing me by the arm, he steered me through the crowd. “I’m ready to dance.” The ballroom was very large, with two art deco chandeliers overhead that started with a ring of crystals in a large circle and cascaded into smaller and small circles until the crystals came to a point. The band was at the far end, just finishing up a song. The room was full, but not overly crowded. There was still room to breathe. I hoped there wouldn’t be many more people arriving after us. I didn’t want to feel squashed. “My boss should be here, somewhere,” Lev said, scanning the crowd. His eyes must have encountered a presence in the room he didn’t like because he frowned. “Would you look at that pretty boy in the tuxedo? Does he think he’s at a coronation or something?” I turned to look in the general direction that Lev was sneering and locked eyes with Jessie Vanderlind. Chapter 30 Jessie I kept telling myself I wasn’t going to follow Colette to the dance. It would be the height of foolishness. And I would be putting Colette, and everyone at the dance, in danger. I kept telling myself I wouldn’t go as I requested that Mrs. Denkler find my tuxedo and have it pressed. I was still a fledgling vampire, after all, which meant I had less self control than someone who had been a member of the undead for a century. I kept reminding myself I wasn’t going to attend the dance as I ordered a boutonniere from the local florist shop. If I was unmasked as a vampire, it would put my entire family at risk, and that was something I would never do. I even kept telling myself I wasn’t attending the dance at the Mansfield Country Club as I dressed in my tuxedo, launched into the air and made my way across the countryside. “Tickets please,” a man at the door said as I mounted the front steps to the club. His nose was misshapen and had obviously been broken more than once. “Oh,” I stammered. I had been so busy convincing myself that I wasn’t attending the dance that I had forgotten about tickets. The tough guy at the door gave me a steady look. “You can’t get in without a ticket.” I gazed right back at him, fixing him with my eyes. “I’ve already given you my ticket,” I told him. “You were just about to tell me that I could go inside.” The man blinked twice and then said, “You can go on inside.” I liked the Mansfield Country Club. It was a nice, open space with a band shell at the far end of a well-lit ballroom. The floor was already filling up by the time I arrived. There were lots of attractive females present, all dressed in varying levels of finery. But I only had eyes for one girl. My timing was perfect because it was only about ten minutes before I caught a glimpse of Colette Gibson entering the dance. Her escort noticed me first, for some reason, saying something derogatory about my attire. But then Colette and I locked eyes. She immediately blushed and put a hand to her cheek. A new song started and I had to resist the impulse to take her in my arms and twirl her across the dance floor. Her date must have noticed my longing gaze, because he flashed a warning look in my direction and then led Colette to another section of the room. I tracked him with my eyes. Setting aside my instant jealously, I observed that he was obviously a man up to no good. I could see the faded marks of a fight on his cheeks and smell the coagulated blood under his skin. I noticed his knuckles were covered in plasters as he hooked a possessive hand through Colette’s arm. I had to wonder why Colette’s parents would allow her to go out with such a brute. Colette’s eyes lingered on me as her date dragged her off to be introduced to some older gentlemen and their wives. I was immediately glad that I had ignored every argument I’d made against going to the dance. I didn’t trust Miss Gibson’s date. He had an air about him that smelled like trouble. While I stood at a discreet distance from the couple, I began to pay more attention to the crowd. There were a lot more older people at the dance than I had expected. And some of them were quite garishly dressed. Several of the younger men were concealing recent wounds, which told me that perhaps there had been some kind of brawl. Tables ringed the room, out of the way of the dance floor, and I took a moment to glance at the cover of a dance card someone had set down next to her purse. The dance was apparently for members of the Fifteenth Chapter of the Lenox Avenue Corporation. The name meant nothing to me, but I had my suspicions about their business. I doubted they were part of a pipefitters union or some other legal operation. When the next song started, Colette was led by her date onto the dance floor. I could tell she was reluctant to go. Her eyes kept darting around the room and I wondered if she was looking for me. It wasn’t fair of me to show up and throw a wrench in her evening, so I concealed myself in the crowd, but where I could still keep a watchful eye. Much to my distaste, her brute of a date was a rather good dancer. He was much smoother than I would have been on the floor. Colette did an admirable job keeping up with him, but it was obvious the fellow was a bit of a showoff. Colette’s sister seemed much happier with her date, even though the fellow wasn’t nearly as light on his feet. They were hanging onto each other in a manner that bordered on immodest. Lettie frowned a few times while looking in her sister’s direction. But besides too high of spirits, Lilly and her date weren’t actually doing anything inappropriate. After an hour of dancing non-stop, Colette begged to be allowed to catch her breath. Her face was pink and she was breathing heavy. I could smell the perfume of her sweat and it was sweet. I sent up a silent thank you to the good people of Tiburon who had been consistently donating their blood to help poor Arthur. It kept our family well supplied. We even had enough to help out some of the regional hospitals. We were too isolated in Tiburon to share the wealth with any of the other vampire families, but I was grateful that my belly was full and I had a flask in my breast pocket in case of emergency. I felt completely under control. Colette’s date excused himself and headed off in the direction of the men’s room. I fought the urge to go over and ask her to dance. It would have been heaven to hold Colette in my arms, if only for the length of one song. But I knew it was wrong. I knew I couldn’t ask her. She more than likely only thought of me as one of her employers. I’d probably ruined her evening by showing up to the dance. A middle-aged man with a big belly and a pronounced scar across his cheek approached Colette. It was obvious from his stagger that he’d been spending most of his time at the bar. “Hey there, cutie,” he slurred. Colette appeared a little startled to be addressed by the man. “Hello,” she said, rather hesitantly. Then she quickly scanned the dance floor for her sister. “What do you say you and I twinkle our toes a little out on the floor?” he asked, swaying slightly to the left and then straightening up again. “No thank you,” was her reply. “What’s the matter?” the guy asked, immediately taking offense. “You think you’re too good for me or something?” “No,” she assured him. “It’s just that I’m waiting for my escort. He said he’d be right back and that I should wait here.” “Awe, he won’t mind,” the man assured her. “Not when he sees who you’re dancing with. I’m a big name in these parts.” “Thank you, but I think I’d rather wait,” Colette told him, still trying to be gracious. “Maybe you didn’t hear me properly,” the man snarled, turning quite red in the face. “I asked you to dance.” And then he grabbed her arm. “Hello, darling,” I said, immediately appearing at Colette’s side. “Sorry to have kept you waiting.” “Oh,” Colette said, her eyes as wide as saucers. “Who’s your friend?” I asked, smiling at the drunk. “My name is something you don’t need to know,” the man slurred. “Now, excuse me, we were just about to hit the dance floor.” I frowned a little. “There must be some confusion. I’m afraid the young lady promised me the next dance.” The man’s face puckered up like he’d just licked a lemon. “Do you know who I am?” he demanded. I looked him dead in the eye. “I think you are a very nice gentleman who was kind enough to converse with my date. But now you are feeling tired and you’d like to go home. You no longer wish to dance.” “As a matter of fact, I don’t want to dance. Not anymore,” the man said after digesting my words. “I’m tired. To hell with this shindig. I’m going home.” And then he staggered off. “Shall we?” I asked, extending my elbow toward Colette so that I could lead her onto the floor. The orchestra was just starting a slow song. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. As I put my arms around her, I could feel Colette tremble. If I was being honest, I was trembling slightly, too. Not from the confrontation, but just from being so close to her. “I’m sorry if that man frightened you,” I said. “No, I…” Colette stammered. After a moment she tried again. “I’m fine,” she assured me. “But what are you doing here?” I swirled her across the floor and it was like dancing on air. “I wanted to hear the band,” I said. “They’re quite good. Don’t you think?” Colette looked at my feet for a moment. “Your ankle,” she said. “Is it quite better?” “It troubled me for a day or two, but it’s all healed now,” I told her. She was so very close, I felt like I could get lost in her emerald green eyes. “I just can’t believe you’re here,” she said in a very quiet voice. “It’s like something out of a dream.” I couldn’t believe my ears. This beautiful creature in my arms couldn’t possibly feel the same way about me as I felt about her. It was my turn to stammer. “You mean to tell me…” “Hey, buddy.” I felt someone slap me aggressively on the arm. “You’re dancing with my girl.” I knew without looking that it was Colette’s brute of a date. “We’d just like to finish this song,” I told him, never letting my eyes leave Colette. I had to have misunderstood her. I just couldn’t believe there was any chance that all the feelings I had for her were mutual. I had to find out. Unfortunately, it was right then that the song drew to a close. “Before you go back to your escort,” I began as I reluctantly removed my hand from her waist. “I just wanted to ask you if…” But it was too late. The brute was right there, glaring at me like he’d caught me stealing from his father’s store. I could smell the liquor on his breath. Colette’s eyes flicked nervously to her date and then back to me. “Thank you for the lovely dance,” she said. I made a small bow. “It was my pleasure.” And then the brute took her roughly by the arm and pulled her through the crowd. I wanted to go after him and explain to him in detail the proper way to treat a lady, but I knew that was unwise. He thought he was a tough-guy and that probably meant he was always spoiling for a fight. If he took a swing at me, then I doubted I would be able to stop myself from shattering his spine. But I decided to follow them at a discrete distance, anyway. Drink was causing the young man’s temper to flare. I didn’t want him to take his bad mood out on Miss Gibson. Chapter 31 Colette Lev goose-stepped me outside like I was a recalcitrant toddler. “You’re hurting my arm,” I told him, but I wasn’t sure if he was listening. There was fury in his eyes. I desperately scanned the crowd, looking for my sister or Walter. Where had they gone? Once we were at some distance from the crowd, Lev shoved me a little away from him and said, “Let’s you and me get something straight.” We were around to the left side of the country club where no other guests had strayed. “When you’re out with me, I don’t expect to find you in the arms of some other guy. Got it?” “We were just dancing,” I said, not sure why he suddenly thought he owned me. “It’s not like it’s any of your business anyway. Just because we came to the dance together doesn’t mean I’m your property for the evening.” “I paid for that flower,” he said, jabbing a finger at my wrist. “I paid for the tickets. I paid for the gas to drive you here.” He took a step closer to me. “Maybe that means I feel like you owe me a little something.” “Here,” I said, shucking the corsage off my arm and trying to hand it to him. “Tell me how much all of that cost you and I’ll pay you back,” I told him. I didn’t feel like I should have to be beholden to a man just because he’d spent a few dollars. “Just so you know,” I said, “I’m only on this date because my sister begged me. So if you spent two dollars, or three dollars, or even five dollars, then that’s fine. I have a job. I will pay you back.” Lev’s face turned dark and I immediately regretted my words. My goal shouldn’t have been to throw the fact that I didn’t like him in his face. My goal should have been to return to where there were other people, find my sister, and get out of there. “You’re going to pay me back,” he said, grabbing my arm. “But it’s not going to be with money. You’re going to have to earn it.” “Let go of me or I’ll scream,” I told him, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice. “Go ahead and scream,” he said with a laugh. “No man at this dance is going to come running, just because he hears some broad scream.” So I kicked him in the shin, and when he bent forward because of the pain, I socked him in the nose. It wasn’t a solid punch, but it was enough to make him let go of my arm. Seizing my moment, I started running back toward the front of the country club. Lev lunged for me, catching my dress. I didn’t stop, even after my dress tore. I ran without looking back. I expected that Lev would tackle me at any moment, but instead all I heard was a sharp “yipe” like someone had kicked a dog. Once I was back among the crowd, I slowed down. I knew what Lev had said about the other guests, but I couldn’t imagine he could drag me off into the bushes kicking and screaming with nobody saying anything. I had thought that Lev was going to come blundering around the corner in a matter of seconds, but he didn’t. I didn’t know why, but I sure as heck wasn’t going to go back and look for him. I moved deeper into the crowd of people chatting on the lawn and waited, never looking away from where I assumed Lev was going to appear. It couldn’t have been more than a minute or two before a figure did appear from around the corner of the building. But it wasn’t Lev. It was Jessie Vanderlind, discretely straightening his bowtie and dusting dirt off of his tux. I was dumbfounded, but slipped inside the club before he could see me. After several minutes of searching, I finally found my sister and Walter canoodling at a small table in a cozy corner by the bar. “What happened to your dress?” was the first thing out of my sister’s mouth when I finally caught her attention. “Lev tore it,” I said, fighting back tears. “What?” Lilly jumped to her feet. “What happened?” “Lev got angry because I danced with another man,” I said. “He dragged me outside and said I owed him because he bought me a flower and got us these tickets. I told him I’d pay him back but…” My voice caught for a second. “But he said he didn’t want my money. I had to earn it.” “What?” Lilly exclaimed, gripping both of my hands. “So then I kicked him, but he still wouldn’t let go of my arm. So then I had to punch him in the nose.” I half considered telling them about seeing Jessie slinking around the corner of the building, but then changed my mind. Walter slammed his hands down on the table. “I can’t believe it,” he all but yelled. “What is wrong with that guy? Has he lost his mind?” He got to his feet. “You two stay here. I’m going to find us a different ride home.” Spinning on his heel, Walter ran straight into Lev’s chest. Lev was a much bigger man, but anger had blinded my sister’s beau to this obstacle. “We’re going outside,” Walter informed his former friend. “You need to be taught a lesson on how to treat a lady.” I expected Lev to get right back in Walter’s face, or may let the fists start flying right there in the bar of the Mansfield Country Club. But Lev didn’t react in any way that I expected. Instead, he just stood there, swaying slightly on his feet. His skin looked clammy and his eyes were darting around the room. “I came here to apologize,” he said to me in a small voice. “I realize that my actions were wrong and I really want to say I’m sorry.” We all just stared at him, our mouths practically hanging open. Walter was the first to find his voice. “I’m glad to hear you’re sorry, but your behavior is still unforgivable. I hope you understand that I am going to find a different way to get the girls home.” “Please don’t do that,” Lev said, his voice trembling. He scanned the room as if he was afraid there was a wild panther hiding in the corner and he didn’t want to draw its attention. “Please allow me to drive the three of you home as a way of making amends.” “No.” Walter shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.” Lev began to quake and tears started streaming down his cheeks. “Can’t you at least go in my car? Walter, you can drive. Lettie and Lilly can sit in the back seat. I’ll sit up front with you.” He looked at me, beseechingly. “I won’t say a word. I promise. I’ll keep my mouth shut the whole time. But please just let me see you home safely.” He was a total wreck. It was as if we were talking to a completely different man. The Lev Wilson who was standing before us was somehow broken, like he had looked into the abyss and it had scared the fight out of him. “I think it will be okay if Walter drives,” I said. Lev was so altered, it was shocking. I actually found myself feeling sorry for him. “Okay, good,” Lev said, wiping the tears from his cheeks. “I really appreciate that. And I’m so sorry for…” His voice started trembling again and he had no more words. “I think maybe we’d better just get going,” Walter said after several seconds of watching Lev cry. “Why don’t I fetch the car and the three of you can meet me at the side entrance?” I knew he was worried about Lev being humiliated in front of his boss. But then Walter remembered he didn’t want to leave us alone with him. “Or maybe…” Walter tried to think of another option. “It’s probably best if you go get the car,” Lilly said. She obviously was thinking the same thing I was thinking; there was no need for us to fear Lev Wilson. He was a broken man. Chapter 32 Jessie I have never been so close to murdering someone in my life. It took every ounce of self control I possessed not to snap the brute’s spine and toss his body into the river. I was so disgusted by him that I didn’t even want to drink his blood; I just wanted to make him disappear off of the face of the planet. But I knew killing Colette’s date would be a mistake. Violence is rarely the solution to stop violence. Instead I decided to acquaint the brute with his own mortality, just to let him know how insignificant he really was in this world. It turned out he frightened quite easily. I was surprised how quickly he crumbled. But I suppose bullies aren’t really known for their bravery. After giving the young man a new perspective on life, I considered borrowing a car and offering Colette and her sister a ride home. But I decided that was just me wanting to play the hero. Besides, I wanted Colette to know that she had nothing more to fear from her date. He would never harass her again. So I instructed him to find his companions and to drive them home with the greatest of care. I explained that if I ever found out he was bullying or threatening anyone ever again, I would find him. But I wasn’t too worried on that score. I had a feeling that he was going to do everything with the greatest of care for the rest of his life. After straightening out the brute, I immediately walked across the country club lawn and left the dance. I couldn’t be around people any longer. Staying would have been a mistake. I took the flask out of my pocket and finished off its contents in a matter of seconds. Then, once I was clear from the crowd, I took to the air. I had meant to go home, but I was still worried about Colette. I found myself following the brute’s car as Colette and the rest of her party headed for home. Lilly’s escort saw her to the door, but Lettie’s escort was afraid to leave the car. I felt a pang of guilt. I may have frightened him just a little too much. I’d meant to make him a good person, not turn him into a sniveling coward. After the boys left, I followed their car once again, waiting for my chance to catch the brute alone. I had to lessen my influence. I’d put so much fear into him, I doubted his ability to survive. I had to take pity on him and provide at least some relief, however reluctant I was to do so. The next day was Sunday and I knew Colette would not be working at the castle. Even still, I could find no rest in my bed. I couldn’t help but wonder what she would do on her day off. Did she go to church? Did she have any hobbies? What did she eat for breakfast? I wanted to know every little detail of her life. I was already hopelessly in love with her. But I knew it was wrong to love her. When a vampire fell in love with a mortal, it put the mortal at a horrible risk. Even though I would have rather faced the sun than harm one hair on Colette Gibson’s head, loving her still meant I was exposing her to danger. I knew I had to find a way to keep myself from her. Earlier in the evening I had thought that maybe she was about to confess to having feelings for me and I desperately wanted to hear the words that she’d never had a chance to say. But knowing that she cared would probably only make things worse; it would make parting from her all the more painful. No, there was what my heart desired and there was what was right. I had to end things with Colette before they even had a chance to begin. By Monday afternoon, I knew I had to see Colette again. Not to profess my love or anything like that, but just to make sure that she was okay. Her date had tried to brutalize her and that weighed heavily on my mind. I knew she was a brave girl or she wouldn’t have fought her date, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t upset, or still in fear of him. I just wanted reassurance that she was unscathed. I promised myself one last look at the girl and then I would leave her alone forever. I would confess my dilemma to my mother and explain that I needed to move away for a couple of decades. I could always return in twenty years when Colette Gibson was in her thirties, married and raising her children. Children I could never give her. With the safety of a wedding band on her finger, I knew I would find her much easier to resist. With that resolve in mind, I set out to seek Miss Gibson. I didn’t intend to speak to her. I would just gaze upon her one last time to commit her beautiful visage to memory. I could live off of that for a few decades until my feelings of love for her began to fade. A small amount of discrete searching allowed me to find Colette dusting books in the library. It was a task that Mrs. Denkler usually assigned to her every Monday, whether the books needed it or not. By a stroke of good fortune, she was alone. Her sister had been called away to assist one of the other maids. The library door glided silently open on well-oiled hinges. Poking my head in, but not fully stepping into the room, I could not see her. The room smelled of her sweetness, so I placed one foot cautiously over the threshold. Where was she? A second later, I caught a glimpse of her, high on top of a ladder, dusting the books on the shelf closest to the ceiling. She was humming softly to herself, thoroughly engaged in her task. I could see that she was happy and not at all traumatized by the events of Saturday evening. I meant to turn and leave as quietly as I’d entered. But then I just stood there, mesmerized by Colette’s beauty. Everything about her called me to her. I reminded myself that I had to be brave and wrench myself away. I couldn’t give her mortal love. That opportunity was gone for me. I could only deny myself the pleasure of seeing her so that she could have a happy life. It took all of my strength, but I turned to leave the library. That’s when a floorboard creaked beneath my shifting weight. Colette’s eyes immediately met mine. Her lips parted and she exclaimed, “Jessie?” She tried to descend the ladder, but the heel of her shoe got caught on the hem of her dress. Suddenly her legs were out from under her and she was tumbling head first toward the hardwood floor. Chapter 33 Colette I scanned the country club crowd for Jessie Vanderlind as we were leaving the dance, but he was nowhere to be found. Lev was a complete mess. He acted terrified by every trumpet of laughter and every shadow in the trees. “Did something happen after I left you?” I couldn’t help but ask him. “What?” he said, giving me a startled look. “No, nothing. Why do you ask?” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “You just seem very…” I wanted to say altered, but that probably wasn’t very nice. “You seem a little unsettled and I was wondering if anything happened while you were on the lawn by yourself.” “No.” He shook his head rapidly back and forth. “I was alone, by myself, and nothing happened. Nothing at all.” The three of us were standing by the side entrance, waiting for Walter to bring the car. Lev scanned the area with wild eyes, as if he expected the grim reaper to lunge out of the shadows. I clearly remembered Jessie Vanderlind brushing down his tux as he left the general area where Lev had decided to assault me. And I found it very unlikely that Jessie would stand idly by while someone was being attacked. Did he have anything to do with Lev’s current fragile state? “And you spoke to no one?” I asked again. “No,” Lev insisted, shaking his head. “I’ve already told you that. Now please stop asking me.” His eyes started welling with tears again so I decided to just keep my mouth shut. When we arrived home, Walter saw Lilly to the door, but Lev stayed in the car. We could hear him locking the doors as soon as we’d pushed them shut. “I’m so sorry about all of this,” Walter said as he escorted Lilly up the front porch steps. “I am so sorry,” Lilly whispered to me as we entered the front door. “You told me you didn’t want to go with Lev and I wouldn’t listen. I just feel so horrible.” “That’s okay,” I told her in a low voice. “Oh, here comes Mama.” “Hello, girls,” our mother said, beaming at us. She was already in her nightgown and robe. “I wasn’t expecting you home so early.” And then she caught sight of the giant tear in my dress. “Goodness. Lettie, what happened?” “I... was sitting down and didn’t realize the woman next to me was standing on my hem,” I told her. “So when I got up, it all tore.” “Goodness,” Mama said again, bending to examine the damage. “I don’t think I can mend this without it showing.” She scratched her chin and straightened up, still eyeing the hole. “I guess we could add a wide sash and that would hide it well enough. I might have just the right fabric in my scrap box.” “I knew you would think of something to save it,” I said, giving our mother a squeeze. “I felt like such a fool when it happened.” “I hope it didn’t spoil the dance for you,” Mama said. “Oh, no,” I assured her. “We had a lovely time. I think Walter and Lilly danced to every song.” “And what about you?” she asked. “Have you changed your mind about Lev Wilson?” I didn’t think it was worth upsetting my parents with Lev’s behavior, so I sighed and then said, “I’m afraid I just don’t like Lev in that way. We’ve decided to just be friends.” I set out for work extra early Monday morning. The weather was quite warm and I wanted to gather a large bouquet of wildflowers for Arthur. Mrs. Denkler never said if he enjoyed the flowers or not, but I figured he must have at least enjoyed them a little or she would have told me to stop. Lilly caught up with me on her bicycle and we rode the rest of the way to the castle together. “Thank you so much for not saying anything to Mama and Papa,” she said as we rolled along. “I don’t think they’d ever let me see Walter again if they knew about Lev’s behavior.” “I don’t know why,” I called back to her as we both pedaled single file. “It’s not like Walter did anything. As a matter of fact, I think he behaved quite gallantly during the whole incident. Don’t you?” “He did. Didn’t he?” Lilly said. I didn’t have to look back at my sister to know she was smiling. “But I still think Papa would try to stop me from seeing him. You know how protective he can get and he might find Walter guilty just through association.” We rode the rest of the way to the castle in silence. Lilly was probably thinking of Walter’s gallantry and I was thinking of Jessie. I desperately wanted to see him. But seeing one of the Vanderlinds was always strictly by chance. Even so, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I couldn’t stop wondering what he would have said to me if we’d been allowed to dance just a little longer. And I couldn’t help but wonder what I would have said to him. I knew I was being foolish because we barely even knew each other, but if I was being honest, I already felt like I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. Lilly and I were assigned to dust the library again. It was becoming a regular Monday ritual. It seemed impossible to believe that any dust had gathered since we’d wiped down all the books a week earlier, but Mrs. Denkler was in charge. It was our job to just do as she instructed. We worked side-by-side for about an hour, both of us lost in our own thoughts. I heard the door open and my heart jumped into my throat with the hope that it was Jessie. Whipping my head around, I saw it was just Millie. “Mrs. Denkler sent me to get one of you,” she said. Lilly and I exchanged looks. “You go,” I told her. “I’ll stay with the books.” I thought there might be a better chance of seeing Jessie if I stayed in the library, rather than going to a new task. After Lilly left, I began humming to myself. I loved climbing up the ladder to the highest shelf. There were giant volumes up there that appeared to be hundreds of years old. I wondered if any of them were as old as the castle. The creak of a floorboard caught my attention. I turned my head just in time to see Jessie Vanderlind trying to duck out of the door. “Jessie,” I exclaimed, immediately trying to climb down from my perch to speak with him. I needed to know what had happened at the dance. But the heel of my shoes got caught in the hem of my dress and before I knew what was happening, I was plummeting toward the ground head first. It all happened so quickly that I didn’t even have time to shriek. I just shut my eyes and had the fleeting thought that hitting the floor was really going to hurt. And then I let out an “Oof.” It was as if I flopped very hard on a bed and all the air was knocked out of me. I hadn’t hit the ground. In fact, I felt like I was a few feet above it. I opened my eyes to see that I was in Jessie’s arms. “Are you alright,” Jessie asked, holding me like a groom holds a bride when they cross the threshold of their new home as husband and wife. “Yes,” I said with a little gasp. He acted as if I was as light as a ragdoll. “My heel got caught and the next thing I knew...” It was so wonderful being in his arms that more words escaped me. “Here, let me untangle you,” he said, gently setting me down. “Hold onto me and I’ll unhook your hem.” I wobbled a bit and had to steady myself against his broad shoulders. “There,” he said, freeing my shoe. “All better.” He straightened up, but kept a steadying hand against my side. “Are you dizzy at all? Are you hurt in any way?” “I’m fine,” I assured him. “Just a little embarrassed. I saw you standing in the doorway and...” I looked across the room to the door. It had to have been a distance of at least twenty feet. “How did you manage to catch me?” I asked. “When I saw you, you were right by the door.” “No, no,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re remembering it wrong because of the fall. I was walking toward you. I was practically under the ladder.” “But...” I shook my head, trying to clear it. His arms were still around me and that was making it hard for me to think. “I could have sworn you were by the door.” “Then how could I have crossed the room so quickly? It’s not like I can fly,” he pointed out. “I suppose,” I said, shaking my head some more. I still felt so discombobulated. “I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to you at the dance. I saw you on the lawn and I was wondering if you’d spoken to my date when you were out there.” “On the lawn?” he repeated. “No, I only spoke to him when he came over while we were dancing.” “Are you sure?” I asked. “It seemed like you were coming from the same direction where he...” I stopped short when I saw the thunder in Jessie’s eyes. They told me everything I needed to know. Jessie had confronted Lev. That much was obvious. “Did you need me for something?” I asked, taking half a step backward, but I was reluctant to relinquish his touch. “Or were you just wanting a book?” Jessie half turned away from me for a moment and then looked back into my eyes. “I guess I’ve come to tell you goodbye.” “Goodbye?” I asked. “Yes.” He looked down. “I’m leaving Tiburon. I’m afraid I won’t be back for quite some time. Possibly years.” “What?” I exclaimed. “No, you can’t.” I blinked rapidly, trying to stop tears from filling my eyes. “I’ve only just met you. And I know I’m just a maid, but...” I wanted to tell him that I thought we were meant to be together, but I couldn’t speak. “No, you’re not just the maid,” he told me. “You’re everything. I just thought that I should leave because...” And then we were kissing. I don’t even know how it happened, but suddenly his lips were pressing against mine. And it was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I felt the kiss in every cell of my body. It felt like I had been dunked in soda from a fountain. For those few seconds we were standing still and the world was spinning around us. “Oh! Excuse me,” I heard Lilly’s voice exclaim. We quickly pulled apart and I turned to see my sister standing in the doorway, her eyes out on stalks. Chapter 34 Jessie Colette felt about me the same way I felt about her. It didn’t matter that I could already fly, I felt like I was walking on air. I took the stairs back to my room two at a time. Her kiss had been the one perfect moment in my life. I felt our entire lifetime together in that one embrace. I just couldn’t believe my good fortune. I was the luckiest man alive. And then I remembered I wasn’t alive. Not by a long shot. I was a vampire, a member of the undead. And she was a mortal. That realization quickly brought my spirits crashing back to earth. How could I take Colette’s heart and give her my own when we could never be together? I closed the door to my room and then sank into despair. Being so close to Colette, having her in my arms, had made me lose my head for a moment. But what I had done was wrong. Not saving her life — I would have gladly sacrificed my own life to keep her from harm — but kissing her had been a very foolish thing to do. I cursed my misfortune of having contracted scarlet fever. If I’d only managed to avoid that dreaded disease, then I would have still been a mortal. With Grandfather gone, there was no fear of him turning Emily into a member of the undead. I would have fallen under the same protection. But no, the fates had seen to it that I would forever be seventeen, and the love of my life would keep aging. The cruel injustice of it led me to anger and I took some of my frustration out on an ottoman, completely shattering its frame in the process. There was a knock on my door and then Daniel walked into my room without waiting for me to reply. “Why are you attacking the furniture?” he asked. “What’s that ottoman ever done to you?” “I’m just…” And then I couldn’t think of what to say. “I’m just frustrated that I wasn’t able to save Grandfather.” “I see.” Daniel raised his eyebrows high on his forehead. “And you think that the ottoman had something to do with it?” Seating himself in a chair at some distance from the ottoman, he crossed his legs and then folded his hands over one knee. “No, I…” And then I stopped myself again. “What do you want, Daniel?” I asked. “It’s not like you to be up at this hour.” It was the middle of the day and my brother never usually stirred until after six. “I was having trouble sleeping,” Daniel said with a sniff of vexation, “so I thought I’d get a book from the library. And while I was standing in the doorway, I overheard the most remarkable conversation between two of the maids.” I felt my body momentarily tense, but I tried to pretend like his words had no effect on me. “Eavesdropping on the staff?” It was my turn to raise an eyebrow. “That’s not like you.” Daniel would have been happy if everyone who worked at the castle was a deaf-mute. “What’s going on?” Daniel asked, ignoring my barb. “Have you been toying with one of the servants? How very bourgeois.” “I haven’t been toying with anyone,” I informed him. “They were probably gossiping about the fact that one of the girls took a tumble off a ladder in the library. I was nearby so I managed to catch her.” Daniel narrowed his eyes. “Nearby or on the other side of the room?” “I was standing closer to her than you are to me,” I told him, keeping my voice matter-of-fact. “I don’t see what business it is of yours, anyway.” “It’s my business if you’re exposing the family to danger,” he snapped. “You can’t go dashing across the library just because some little mortal might bust her head. You could expose us all with that kind of behavior.” “I didn’t expose us to anyone,” I informed him. “She slipped and I caught her. That’s the end of the story.” Daniel was the very last person I’d want to know about my feelings for Colette. At least not until I had decided what to do. He took the demise of our grandfather as a signal that he should ascend the throne as the head of the Vanderlind family. Mother and I found it quite amusing, but he took himself rather seriously. “Just be careful,” he told me. “I think Denkie should have known better than to hire a couple of pretty housemaids, but that’s no reason to lose your head. If you’re feeling edgy, you can always go visit Arthur, and then find a brothel. I hear Columbus has a few good ones and it’s not that far.” “Alright,” I said, just to placate him. I knew continuing to protest my innocence would get me nowhere. And Daniel might even begin to suspect I was lying if I protested too much. “Next time I’ll let the mortal land on her head.” “Good,” Daniel said, getting to his feet and heading toward the door. “Better a dead girl than having the villagers pounding on the castle door. I hate when they show up with their pitchforks and torches.” Chapter 35 Colette “Have you lost your mind?” Lilly said in a loud whisper. Jessie had slipped out the door as she’d entered the room. “Maybe I have,” I told her, still feeling a bit giddy from Jessie’s kiss. “What if Mama and Papa find out?” she said in a harsh whisper. Then her eyes grew wider. “What if Mrs. Denkler finds out? She’s scary enough as it is.” “No one’s going to find out,” I said to her, picking up my feather duster from where it had fallen. “It was just a harmless kiss.” “But how did it even happen?” Lilly wanted to know. “I slipped off a ladder and he caught me,” I explained. “He had his arms wrapped around me to steady me, and then it just happened.” My sister frowned. “He took advantage of you?” “No,” I exclaimed. “He stopped me from cracking open my skull.” “But he kissed you,” she said. “Without courting you. Or meeting our parents, or anything.” “It wasn’t like that,” I tried to assure her. “It just happened. I kissed him just as much as he kissed me.” Lilly frowned some more while plucking at her feather duster. “I think I have to tell Mama and Papa.” Whirling around, I stared at her, my mouth slightly open at her contemplated betrayal. “Why?” “Because that Vanderlind boy is trying to take advantage of you. He shouldn’t have kissed you like that.” “I told you, it was mutual. And also an accident,” I hastened to add. “And it will probably never happen again, so there’s no reason to get our parents all worried. You want to keep this job. Don’t you?” Lilly thought it over. “Yes, I really do. But… I don’t want…” She couldn’t even put words to her feelings. “I still think I should tell.” “Fine,” I said, pinching my lips together. “After all I’ve done so you could see Walter.” “That’s different,” she insisted. “If you decide to tell Mama and Papa, then I can’t stop you,” I said. “But I just want you to know that if we are sharing everything with our parents, then I am going to have to tell them that you left me alone with Lev Wilson for over an hour. And during that time, he attacked me and ripped my dress.” Lilly let out an audible gasp. “You wouldn’t.” I shrugged. “Why shouldn’t I? It’s the truth.” “But…” Lilly’s eyes were round with the fear of it. “Then they would never let me see Walter again.” “I know,” I told her. “And I don’t want that to happen.” Lilly opened and closed her mouth a few times, reminding me slightly of a goldfish in a bowl. Then she closed her lips firmly and returned to dusting, not speaking to me for the rest of the day. “What’s wrong with you girls?” Mama asked over dinner. “You’ve barely spoken two words to each other since you got home.” “Nothing, as far as I know,” I said, glancing over in Lilly’s direction. My sister refused to look at me. “Nothing,” she said, shaking her head back and forth a few times. “I’m just a little tired.” She looked down to cut her meat. “And besides, we work together all day.” And then, glancing in my direction, she added, “I think we’ve said everything that needs to be said.” Lilly was still ignoring me when we climbed into bed. That was fine. I could handle her anger, just as long as she kept my secret. And I knew she would. I wasn’t exactly playing fair, but I was keeping secrets for her, so I saw no reason why she shouldn’t keep one for me. And besides, Jessie and I had only kissed. It had been unexpected, but it wasn’t something I regretted. Nor was it something I would ever regret. Jessie Vanderlind had stolen my heart without even trying. I couldn’t sleep. There were too many thoughts of Jessie running through my head. Once my sister’s breathing turned to the steady rhythm of someone asleep, I crept out of my bed and shrugged into my robe. I needed to contemplate what had passed between Jessie and me in the complete silence that existed in the middle of the night. On tiptoe, I crossed the room to look out the window. The little creatures of the night were starting to sing to each other and I loved the music they made. Looking down at the ground below our window, I nearly jumped out of my skin when I realized that someone was looking back up at me. It only took a second for me to realize it was Jessie Vanderlind. “What are you doing out here?” I whispered, as I hurried across our yard to stand next to Jessie. I hoped none of my family had heard me easing out of the back door. The screen usually squeaked. “I had to see you,” he said, stepping closer to me. “I wanted…” He paused for a moment, running his fingers through his hair. “I wanted to apologize.” He was just so breathtaking handsome with his full lips and his ruffled black hair. I took several seconds just to stare at him, drinking him in. “Apologize?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes.” Jessie nodded. “Just because you’d fallen off a ladder was no reason for…” He paused again. “It’s just… I just feel like I might have taken advantage of you. I mean, just because you’d fallen off the ladder was no reason for me to…” He gestured at me with his hand. “I’m sorry.” “Don’t apologize,” I told him, stepping a little closer. “You saved me and then we accidentally kissed. That’s no reason to apologize.” “But don’t you see?” Jessie asked, his gray eyes like two perfect gray pearls from the islands of Polynesia. “Kissing you by accident would be like accidentally finding a leprechaun's pot of gold.” I squinted at him, no sure what he meant. “I’m afraid you’ve lost me.” “I mean,” he said, stretching his hands toward me for a moment and then stuffing them in the pockets of the long, dark coat he was wearing, “I wouldn’t want our kiss to have been something you didn’t want or you weren’t expecting. Kissing you, especially for the first time, should be perfect.” My heart was hammering so wildly in my chest that I could barely breathe. “Then kiss me now,” I told him. “Kiss me here under this apple tree. Let this be our first kiss.” It was such a brazen thing to say that I couldn’t even believe the words had come out of my mouth, but he didn’t seem put off by my request. “Are you sure?” Jessie asked, taking a half-step forward. “About the kiss. Because I know if I kiss you again, I would never want to…” And then we melted into each other’s arms, our lips pressing together with such passion that it felt like tiny fireworks were exploding in my chest. “Ever let you go,” Jessie whispered, once we paused for breath. “What’s that?” I asked, my head spinning from being so close to him. His breath smelled slightly of warm pennies. “I was just worried about kissing you,” he whispered into my hair. “I knew that if we were to kiss, I would never want to let you go.” “Then don’t,” I told him. “I’m happy to stay here forever.” He squeezed me tightly for another moment and then I felt him stiffen a little, as if gathering his resolve. “There’s something I have to tell you,” he said in a very controlled voice. “There’s something I have to confess before this goes any further.” “What is it?” I asked, hesitantly. He suddenly sounded so serious that it made me a little afraid. Jessie closed his eyes for a moment and released a deep sigh. “It’s about my family.” “Oh.” I thought of the rumors I’d heard about the Vanderlinds from Mrs. Denkler and the other snatches of gossip. The Vanderlinds all suffered from some type of rare illness. Something hereditary, I had to imagine. Jessie probably felt that he should be honest about his situation before we became too involved. “Don’t tell me,” I said, snuggling deeper into his arms. “I don’t want to know. Not yet.” “But…” he started to say. “Jessie, please don’t,” I insisted, cupping his face with my hands and looking into his fathomless gray eyes. “This moment is so perfect. And I feel about you in a way that I never imagined I could feel about anyone. Let’s pretend that the rest of the world doesn’t exist. At least for right now. Let’s just make this moment about the two us.” And then he kissed me again. Chapter 36 Jessie I felt like a foolish Romeo, standing underneath Colette’s window, but there was no place else in the world I wanted to be. I’d always had my suspicions about Romeo. He was, after all, already infatuated with a girl named Rosaline before sneaking into the ball and first seeing Juliet. Who was to say that, if their families hadn’t been sworn enemies and he’d actually been allowed to woo Juliet, that he wouldn’t have grown bored of her in a couple of months and fallen in love with yet another girl? But I didn’t feel that way about Miss Gibson. I knew I was about the same age as Romeo was in the play, but my love for Colette felt timeless. I knew I could never tire of her, not even in a hundred years. I sighed, feeling the irony of it. I would live to see a hundred years. And probably a hundred more after that, if I didn’t grow despondent under the weight of my own immortality and find some way to end it. Death by an angry mob was a popular way for the undead to give up on living. Of course I would probably have to travel to Romania to accomplish such a grisly task with any ease. The Romanians were always ready to put some world weary vampire to the stake. But then I caught a glimpse of Colette in the window of her house and it felt like my dead heart was beating in my chest. Just the sight of her filled me with life. I had to fight the urge to fly up the side of the house and speak to her through the glass. A few moments later and she was there by my side, her volumes of hair cascading around her shoulders. I had been yearning for her so much that my feelings were almost tangible. And there she was, right in front of me. It was exquisite torture not to sweep her up in my arms. I had meant to apologize for my behavior in the library. It had been ungentlemanly and I very much wanted Colette Gibson to think well of me. I meant to simply apologize, but somehow we ended up kissing again. It was our first kiss, our first real kiss, and there was a dream-like quality to it. The apple tree shading us from the light of the moon was in full leaf and the small animals and insects that came out in warm weather started to sing. It was then that I knew I couldn’t give Colette up. Not ever. Her soul fit with mine like two locking puzzle pieces that, once united, could never be pulled apart. But I also wanted to protect her from the curse that was my family. I needed to tell her exactly who I was, and what I was, so that she would understand the gravity of her decision to be with me. But when I tried to confess to the abomination that was my family, Colette silenced me. She didn’t want to cloud the skies of our new love with talk of anyone or anything but us. And I was too in love to insist. I should have stood strong and explained the evil that Grandfather had inflicted upon us, but instead we kissed again and everything in the world felt perfect. As we pulled apart in order for her to breathe, we both caught a glimpse of a shooting star streaking across the sky. “Do people wish on shooting stars here in America?” I asked, unwilling to turn my head to take in the full astronomical display. I preferred gazing into her green eyes. “Yes,” she said with a small nod, not looking away either. “But I feel like all of my wishes have already come true.” Chapter 37 Colette “I have a bit of good news to share,” Papa said, beaming at all of us as we sat around the dinner table the following evening. “What is it?” Mama asked, taking off her oven mitts after setting down the pot roast. “Well, the W.P.A. has decided that Tiburon needs a proper town hall. And guess who they’ve hired to run the construction?” “Oh!” Mama exclaimed, gasping. “That’s wonderful.” She hurried around the table to wrap her arms around Papa. I was thrilled. All of us were. But it was also a little confusing. “Shouldn’t they focus on rebuilding the school first?” I asked. Papa shook his head, even though he was still smiling. “I know. It doesn’t make much sense. Does it? But I guess the government already had the plans in place for the town hall before the school burnt down.” “But when are they rebuilding the school?” Lilly wanted to know. “It’s in the process of getting funded,” Papa told her. “And hopefully I get that project, too. But for now we should just be grateful that I’m steadily employed again.” He looked at Lilly and me. “There should be enough money for awhile,” he said. “If you girls want to leave your positions at the castle; it wouldn’t be a problem.” “No,” I exclaimed, the word bursting out of my mouth. I didn’t care if we had all the money in the world; I couldn’t stop working at the castle. I couldn’t forgo the chance of seeing Jessie every day, even if the chance was always slim. Surprised by my exuberance, everyone turned to look at me. “I mean, it would be silly to give up such good paying jobs,” I explained. “We should save the money in case things get lean again.” Papa reached over and petted my head. “That’s my bright girl.” The next several weeks drifted past in a pink haze of happiness. In the mornings I would ride out to an obliging field and gather an armload of wildflowers for Arthur. Then Lilly would catch up to me and we would head to the castle together to start our day of dusting and polishing. If it was a lucky day, then Jessie would find some way to see me. Lilly would be called away to help Millie and I’d be left on my own. Or Emily would come to ask for my help with some small task. Once the girl had led me to some secluded room, she would disappear, leaving her brother in her place. Our meetings in the castle were brief. There was only time for a few stolen kisses. But I knew that Jessie would come to see me at night, after my family had fallen asleep. That was when we had our real time together. Each night when we met, Jessie would try to tell me of the horrible curse that plagued his family. And each night I would stop him with a kiss. I didn’t want to tarnish the love I felt for him. His family could have been a pack of snarling wolves and I wouldn’t have cared. Jessie was beautiful and wonderful and kind. I didn’t believe in guilt by association and I knew I would love Jessie Vanderlind, no matter the dark secret his family was hiding. “Why don’t you speak with an accent?” I asked him one evening as we took a turn around the yard. “Don’t I speak with an American accent?” he said with some surprise. “You know what I mean,” I said, nudging his arm. “You’re from Hungary. Aren’t you? But you sound like you were born right here, in Tiburon.” “My grandfather didn’t believe in accents,” he said. I couldn’t let him get away with telling me so little. “What’s that supposed to mean?” “It means that my grandfather was very strict. He felt that if you were going to learn a language, then you should be able to speak it flawlessly.” “How many languages do you speak?” I wanted to know. He gave a shrug of modesty. “Only three or four.” “Three or four?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “You speak English and Hungarian. What other languages do you speak?” “French,” he told me. “And some German, but I could hardly pass for a native.” “Say something in Hungarian,” I requested. He gave me a puzzled look. “Why?” “Because this all sounds too preposterous and I’m not half sure that I should believe you.” He turned to look deeply into my eyes. “Szeretlek,” he said in a whisper. I didn’t understand him, but I had my suspicions because of the way he looked at me. “Okay, now say the same thing in French,” I told him. “Je t’aime,” was his reply, a small smile flitting across his lips. I kept going. “And German?” “Ich liebe dich,” he said, gazing steadily into my eyes. “And what does it mean in English?” I had to ask. Jessie pulled me into his arms. “I think you already know,” he said in a husky voice. And then he kissed me, his lips telling me how he felt without any words. My sister hadn’t spoken of Jessie since she stumbled upon our kiss, and I kept all thoughts of him to myself. Normally we shared all our foolish secrets, like sisters who are close tend to do. But when it came to Jessie, things felt different. First of all, I knew Lilly didn’t approve. After all, the maid falling in love with the tortured heir to the castle falling did sound like something out of a gothic novel. Even I had to admit that. But I didn’t care. I knew what I felt for Jessie was real. And I knew deep in my heart that he felt the same way about me. One morning I woke up and I was seventeen. I found it singular that I didn’t look any different when I washed my face in the morning and peered into the bathroom mirror. But things were different. They were very different. Because I knew that just down the Tiburon River, a few miles away, was a Justice of the Peace who would perform wedding ceremonies without parental consent, as long as both parties were older than seventeen. I had reached an age where I could say, “I do,” to Jessie, if he ever proposed. My whole family greeted me when I came down the stairs. “Happy Birthday,” Mama said, squeezing me tightly. Then she pulled Lilly into the hug. “My two, seventeen-year-old girls.” “Not for long,” Lilly joked. For almost two months out of the year, my sister and I were the same age. My family referred to it as our twin months and we’d always loved this special time when we little girls. “Well, then I’ll have to enjoy it while I can,” our mother said, hugging us both again. “I’m tired of your silly nonsense with these flowers,” Mrs. Denkler snapped at me as I filled a vase with the wildflower bouquet I’d gathered on the way to work. “Oh,” I said, not quite sure why she was annoyed. “You mean you don’t think they cheer Arthur up? I’m sure he must get depressed, never being able to leave his room.” Mrs. Denkler was about to say something, but then stopped herself. She left out the sharp sigh of someone who feels they have extended a great deal of patients and their efforts have gone unappreciated. “Just take the flowers up yourself today and set them outside Arthur’s door,” she instructed me. “It’s the one with the bird carving over it. The nurse will take them in. Just make sure you mind your own business and leave that poor boy alone. If I find out that you’ve so much as stuck your nose in the door, you will be dismissed on the spot.” I did as I was told, trotting up the grand staircase that led to the second floor. I hadn’t been allowed up the stairs and only knew that part of the castle from what could be gleaned from down below. The hallways were massive. I wouldn’t have been surprised if it were possible to drive a car down some of them. There was an ornately carved piece of wood over each door. I took several moments to stare at the carving of a wolf’s head suspended above a door. Its eyes seemed to follow me. I found the door for Arthur’s room easily enough. There was a carving of a peacock with its tail feathers spread into a fan. The bird was beautiful, but also somehow menacing. That paired up well with my memory of how a peacock looked from our family trip to the Cleveland Zoo. I stood outside the closed door for a moment, the vase of flowers still clutched in my hands, cocking my head to one side to listen. I felt so very bad for Arthur. None of the family got out much, as far as I could tell. Emily seemed perfectly healthy. And Jessie left the castle more than the others, but that seemed to be only after the sun went down. What was the illness that kept them all so isolated and cooped up in their home? I’d tried to do researched at the library, but came up with next to nothing. The only thing I could discover was that albinos had some sensitivity to light. Most of the Vanderlinds had very pale skin, but their hair wasn’t the white of an albino and they all had very gray eyes. As I set the vase down outside the closed door, I had to wonder about Arthur’s malady. If Jessie and I had a child, would he or she suffer the same fate? That wouldn’t prevent me from accepting a proposal from Jessie, but it would make me consider adoption instead of bearing my own children. I did rather desperately want to have Jessie’s child, but I also knew that there were many parentless children out in the world who deserved a loving home. I had an anxious day. I kept expecting to see Jessie at every turn, but he never appeared. I didn’t even see Emily, which came as a surprise. She was a lonely little girl and frequently sought Lilly and my company. She was so lucky to have escaped her family’s curse, whatever it was, but it seemed to have isolated her in an unexpected way. Chapter 38 Jessie “So you’re not fiddling with the maid,” Daniel said with a scoff as he sauntered into the library where I sat in a club chair, reading some of Sir Walter Scott’s poetry. “I can’t believe I was fool enough to have believed you.” “What are you talking about?” I asked, glancing up at him from over my book and doing my best not to be baited by my brother. I had been courting Colette for several weeks and I was always careful to ensure that my family knew as little as possible about my activities. Everyone but Emily, of course. She was my secret go-between and she thoroughly approved of where I had given my heart. “I followed you the other night,” he told me, perching himself on the arm of a chair. “I knew you’d been sneaking out of the house, so I followed you. And guess where you went?” I gave him a cool look, closing my book in the process. “Why don’t you tell me?” “You know damn well where you went.” he said. “You flew directly over to that little tramp’s house. I saw you with your arms around each other.” My temper ignited immediately when my brother referred to Colette as a tramp. She was nothing of the sort and I instantly felt compelled to defend her honor. But I knew that was what Daniel was expecting. “What’s it to you?” I asked, keeping my voice in check. “If you’re feeling the urge to dip your wick, then find some foolish young thing who doesn’t know where you live,” he told me. “Not one that works under the very roof of our home.” I wanted to strike him. I could feel the urge down to my fingertips. But what purpose would that serve? That would only convince Daniel that he was justified in his outrage. “You’re right,” I said, coolly. “She was a foolish choice.” Daniel was about to argue with me, but then he processed my words. “So you’ll end things with her?” I nodded a few times. “I shall give it some thought. It’s a matter that would have to be handled with some delicacy.” My brother gave me a flat look. “Just make sure that it’s handled,” he said. “Or I’ll be forced to discuss this with…” and there he paused. I knew he had meant to say Grandfather, but that was no longer an option. “Mother,” I supplied for him. “You’ll be forced to discuss this with our mother.” “I’m sure she’ll be thrilled,” he said, his voice at its most droll. I somehow doubted Mother would have the same reaction as her eldest son, but I said nothing. It was better for Daniel to think he had won. “If you feel the need to share this information with her, then let’s do it now,” I said, making a show of rising from my chair. “We might as well get this all out in the open.” “Forget it,” he said, getting to his feet and preparing to stalk out of the room. “I don’t want to worry her with such pointless trivia. Just make sure you end things with that foolish, little mortal. You should go to New York and find yourself a proper vampiress to love, if you’re feeling the need for a romantic liaison.” “That’s good advice,” I told him. “It’s something I’ll keep in mind.” Daniel left, feeling satisfied that he had the upper hand. But nothing he could do or say would ever change the way I felt about Colette. Our very souls were drawn to each other. There was nothing that could drive us apart, even with our apparently insurmountable differences. Some things were meant to be.” But Daniel’s actions did cause me concern. I didn’t want Colette to be exposed to the dangers of the vampire world. She didn’t want to hear about my family’s curse, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t arm her in some other way. I immediately flew to Main Street in Tiburon and gazed through the window of Houghton’s, the local jewelry shop. One side of the window displayed gold jewelry and the other half showed the silver items for sale. I spied a sterling silver locket in the shape of a heart. It was perfect for my plans. Pulling a pen, paper and an envelope from my pocket, I penned a quick note to the store owner, asking him to please have the locket delivered to the Vanderlind Castle the following day. With the letter, I included several bills. I knew it was probably more than the small silver trinket cost, but I preferred to pay too much rather than too little. After that I headed for home. My purchase was just a small gesture, but hopefully something that would go a few steps toward keeping my darling girl safe. Colette Gibson meant the world to me. My brother was probably right, as far as what was the reasonable thing to do, but he didn’t understand how I felt in my heart. And I doubted explaining it to him would make much of a difference. By the time I got up the next afternoon, the package had already arrived. I opened it to view the pendant up close, being careful not to actually touch the silver as I flipped open the clamshell box. It was a pretty puffed heart with the silver polished to a shine, yet also understated enough not to draw too much attention. I thought it would be perfect as a present for Colette. I would have gladly given her a diamond the size of a robin’s egg, but we were being clandestine with our love and a showy piece of jewelry might give things away. I tried to arrange to see Colette during the day while she was working, but luck was not on my side. Daniel was awake and skulking around the house. He didn’t bother saying anything to me, nor did he appear to be all that interested in keeping an eye on Miss Gibson, but his presence held me in check from speaking to her. That night I took extra care as I was leaving the castle. At first I flew toward the woods, until I was certain Daniel wasn’t following me. I waited a good hour longer than I normally did before heading to Colette’s house. There was always a strong chance my brother was waiting for me there. But I knew Daniel to be an impatient man. I was convinced that after sitting in wait for thirty minutes, he would give up and look for something else to do. The only problem was that I had no way of contacting Colette to explain my delay. I hoped her feelings wouldn’t be too hurt. I surveyed the area before alighting in the Gibson’s back yard. I was always reasonably cautious about such things, — it was never a good idea to be sighted by a mortal farmer with insomnia — but with Daniel’s suspicions aroused, I had to be even more cautious. I knew my brother meant to force my hand. Little did he realize in which direction I would pull. I had no intention of giving Colette up under any circumstances. Reassured that there were no other vampires about, I strode over to our apple tree, only to have Colette appear out of the shadows. “I didn’t think you were coming,” she said. “I’m sorry, darling,” I told her, immediately taking her in my arms. “My brother suspects there is something between us and…” “And you didn’t want to admit to caring for someone like me,” she said, attempting to finish my sentence for me. “No, that’s not it at all,” I insisted, pulling her even closer. “I would rather give him up than you. But he can cause trouble for us,” I had to admit. “So I waited until I was sure he wasn’t following me.” “How could he cause trouble for us?” she asked. “And why?” I scrunched my face and tried to think of a good way to explain it. “Daniel’s… very traditional,” was all I could think to say. “He’s very inflexible about the Vanderlind name and all that rot. I’m sure he would cause a stink if he thought we had any serious intentions in mind. But my brother is also kind of an idiot, so I rarely pay any attention to him,” I assured her. “So your family wouldn’t approve of me?” she asked, her eyes glistening with potential tears. “My mother would,” I told her. Colette sniffed. “How do you know?” “Because, above everything else, my mother wants her children to be happy.” I placed a tender kiss on her lips. “And you make me happier than I ever imagined I could be.” Colette leaned into me and sighed, contentedly. “I know exactly how you feel.” “I have something for you,” I said, reaching into the breast pocket of my coat for the small, velvet box. “What?” she asked, lifting her head, her eyes wide with surprise. “I have a present for you,” I told her, placing the box in both of her hands. “Open it.” “Oh, Jessie,” she exclaimed as she flipped open the lid. “Oh, it’s so beautiful. I love it.” Colette’s already beautiful face blossomed into a radiant smile. “How did you know?” she asked. “Emily told me,” I said, for lack of a better answer. I had unwittingly done something that had made her very happy and I didn’t want that happiness to fade one ounce, so I concealed my ignorance. “Emily,” she said, giving a small frown. “I don’t think I told her it was my birthday.” It was Colette’s birthday! I took a moment to thank my lucky stars that I had a gift for her. “You’ll have to forgive me, darling, but how old are you today?” “Seventeen,” she said, rather shyly. “Seventeen,” I repeated. Colette and I were the same age. But she would one day turn eighteen and I would never see another birthday. “Does turning seventeen hold any particular significance here in the United States?” I asked. “What do you mean?” Colette wanted to know. “I mean like how in countries where the predominant religion is Judaism, turning thirteen is held in high regard.” “Not really,” she said. And then, putting her hand to her cheek, she added, “Except for maybe one thing.” “What’s that?” I asked. And then Colette explained about a neighboring Justice of the Peace who was very accommodating about granting marriage licenses without a young lady’s parents giving consent, just as long as the girl was seventeen. This was very good news, indeed. I stared at her for a few seconds, torn between prudence and dropping to one knee and proposing right there, on the spot. If I had still been a mortal, then I would have done the latter. But the fact that Colette didn’t know that I was a member of the undead kept me from my matrimonial impulse. “Help me put this on,” Colette said, pulling the pendant from its box. I think she was concealing a blush. “Ah,” I said. I hadn’t anticipated she would ask for my assistance. “I’m afraid I’m a bit clumsy with delicate clasps.” “Oh, please try,” she told me. “I want to wear it right away.” Steeling myself against the pain, I took hold of the silver and attempted to fasten the pendant around her neck. The metal immediately began burning my skin instantly. It was like I was pinching a glowing hot poker between my fingers. I tried not to utter any acknowledgement of pain. I thought surely I could endure the agony long enough to secure a simple clasp. But I had never previously encountered silver as a member of the undead. The pain was excruciating. My hands started to tremble with the effort. “I can’t do it, I’m afraid,” I told her, releasing the chain. “Here, let me try,” she said, taking over. A moment later and the pendant was fastened around her slender neck. “There.” She turned toward me. “What do you think?”",

It wasn’t the idea of a strong man, but the lightning strike of love had made me weak. “If I asked you to do something for me, would you be able to keep it a secret?” “What kind of secret?” Emily asked, her eyes instantly shining. “It’s not that big of a secret,” I told her, just something I’d like to keep from Old Denkie.” After a bit of thought, I added, “And probably Mother and Daniel.” “I can keep a secret,” she assured me. “I promise,” she said, crossing her heart. “Now what is it?” “I want you to find out what you can about a girl. She’s a maid that just started working here. But I want you to be very discrete.” “What do you want to know about her?” Emily asked, squirming a little with the excitement of her task. “Not much, really. I’d just like to know the days that she’ll be working here. And maybe the hours she’ll be working. And anything else you happen to find out.” “Because you like her?” Emily asked, wearing a big smile. “No.” I shook my head. “I’m not allowed to care about mortals anymore. You know that.” And then, before she could worry, I hastily added, “The only mortal I’m still allowed to love is you.” “So you do like her,” Emily said. “You love her,” she concluded with the perceptiveness of youth. “I don’t even know her,” I exclaimed. “If you’re going to let your imagination run away with you, then I’m sorry I asked. Please forget that I said anything.” “No, I’ll find out for you,” she said, giving me a sly look out of the corner of her eye. “I want to find out. And I’ll be clever about it. I promise.” With that, she got to her feet and started heading for the door. “Oh,” she said, stopping abruptly. “But you have to tell me; what’s her name?” I suppressed a sigh before telling her, “Colette Gibson.” Chapter 27 Colette Lilly and I were in the mud room, taking off our aprons and getting ready to head home for the day. We’d spent most of our afternoon finishing up the library. The time passed as a blur for me. I couldn’t even focus on the titles of the books I was dusting. All of my thoughts were consumed by the memory of Jessie Vanderlind. Part of me felt like I should apologize to Lilly. I had thought her tunnel focus on spending time with Walter had been foolish and a little immature. But just a few minutes with Jessie Vanderlind had made me realize that I was wrong. I knew nothing about him, yet all I wanted to do was be with him. Before that moment, I had never understood how deeply people could love. When I first looked into Jessie Vanderlind’s eyes, the first instant that I saw him, I felt like there was a violin string running through my body and someone had plucked it. I could still feel it vibrating, deep in the very core of me, even thought I hadn’t seen Jessie for hours. The door opened and a young girl stepped inside the small room. “Hello,” she said to me, giving me a hesitant smile. “Hello,” I said in reply. The girl looked to be eleven or twelve. She was very pretty with blonde, curly hair and large gray eyes. She wore a velvet dress and shiny Mary Jane shoes. I knew without guessing that she had to be a member of the Vanderlind family. No one else in Tiburon could afford such fine clothes. Maybe for a wedding, but not for just wandering around the house on a Monday evening. “What’s your name?” the girl asked. “My name is Lettie,” I told her. “And this is my sister, Lilly.” The girl smiled and tilted her head to one side. “Is Lettie short for something? Colette, maybe?” “That’s right,” I said. “What your name?” “I’m Emily,” she told me. “How do you do?” “How do you do?” I replied, suppressing a vague urge to drop a curtsy; she was so adorably formal. “How many days a week will you work here?” she asked. It seemed like an odd question, but I didn’t mind indulging a curious child. “We’re supposed to work ten to seven, every day, but Sunday,” I told her. “But Mrs. Denkler just told us this morning that we might have to work later some evenings.” “And you’re a maid?” Emily asked. Expanding her question to include my sister, she said. “You’re both maids?” “Yes,” I told her. “We’re both downstairs maids. And are you a Vanderlind? Or maybe the chauffeur.” “Yes,” she said with a broad smile. “I’m the chauffeur.” Then she hastily added, “But I’m also a Vanderlind. Jessie’s my brother.” Then her cheeks grew red for some reason and she dashed out of the room. I had to wonder what my brief exchange with Emily Vanderlind was all about. I couldn’t remember if she’d been in the great hall, watching the men raise the chandelier. Had her brother spoken to her about me? I immediately chastised myself for such a flight of fancy. Mr. Jessie Vanderlind would never have any interest in a girl like me. Mrs. Denkler had made that abundantly clear. “Come on. Let’s go,” Lilly said, breaking me out of my musings. “Papa’s probably waiting.” I had trouble sleeping that night. I kept waking up, thinking someone was in the room with us. It startled me to the point that I half considered waking Lilly. But I knew I was being foolish, so instead I got out of bed, put on my robe and went to sit by the window. The moon was only half full, so it was a perfect night to just sit and gaze at the stars. I’d heard that there were so many electric lights in New York City that the stars were washed away and you couldn’t really see them at night. That wasn’t the case in Tiburon. It was a small town. Actually, there were some houses on the outskirts of town that still didn’t even have electricity. I sighed, looking up at the sky. I’d always yearned for something outside of the life laid out before me. It wasn’t that I didn’t love my family and the house where we lived. I even enjoyed our modest town. But I’d always secretly pined for something more that I couldn’t place my finger on. And now that yearning had a name; Jessie Vanderlind. Movement in a nearby tree startled me a little and drew my attention. The trees were nothing but black silhouettes at night. I stared at the closest trees rather intently for several seconds. Was there something up in the apple tree, over toward the trunk? It was a dark form, but too large to be an owl or any other kind of bird. There was definitely a mass in the tree and I thought I had seen it move. I scanned the ground below the tree. I didn’t see a ladder or a car or anything. The apple’s lowest branches were too far up for anyone to climb up there without assistance. What in the world was in our tree? Feeling a shiver running up my spine, I drew the curtains and hurried back to bed. I knew I was being foolish, but I couldn’t shake the distinct feeling that someone or something was watching me. The next morning I slept in a little. I was tired from my bout of insomnia. One of the benefits of having a job that didn’t start until ten o’clock was that I didn’t have to get up at the crack of dawn. By the time I opened my eyes; Lilly had already gotten out of bed and opened the curtains. It seemed silly to be nervous about looking outside in full daylight, but I had a flash of anxiety. Whatever I had caught a glimpse of out the window during the night had seemed very real. But in the bright light of day, I felt ashamed of my cowardice. I forced myself to stand up straight and walk over to the window. There in the tree branches, where I had thought I’d seen a creature the previous evening, was a large squirrel’s nest. I immediately felt like a fool, but at least it explained why I’d seen movement in the tree. What it didn’t explain was how a sizeable squirrel’s nest had magically appeared overnight. And didn’t squirrels usually build their nests in the fall? I wasn’t a squirrel expert, but I didn’t think they did their building in the spring. I shrugged it off. I had always thought of myself as an observant person, but I’d obviously overlooked a large nest just outside of the window I gazed out of every day of my life. As I came downstairs, I could hear Lilly talking with our parents. “It’s because their one son has some kind of blood disease,” she was telling them. “I wonder what kind of disease that would be,” I heard my mother say. “It seems an awful lot of money.” As I walked into the kitchen, I heard my father shift his chair. “If they have the means, and don’t want to run out of blood, then it’s probably a smart move.” “I wonder how the poor dear managed to make the voyage from Europe, if he’s in such bad shape,” Mother said. Then she noticed me as I headed over to the breakfast nook. “Good morning, sweetie. Did you sleep well?” “I had trouble sleeping,” I said, helping myself to some toast from a plate. “Say, has anybody noticed the big squirrel’s nest up in the apple tree near Lilly and my window? It’s huge, but I don’t remember seeing it before. When did the squirrels build that?” “That’s been there for months,” my father informed me. “I’ve half a mind to knock it down.” “I don’t see how it’s hurting anyone,” Mama said in a gentle voice. She was of the strong conviction that my father didn’t have enough to do. He was always starting small projects and then letting them expand into giant tasks. “I hear Mr. Thorton is putting a new roof on his barn this afternoon. Maybe you could ride over after you drop the girls off and see what that’s all about.” Papa looked at Mama out of the corner of his eye. He knew she was worried that he’d end up cutting down the apple tree if he got started on the squirrels. “I guess I might as well leave the nest alone.” he said. “And Jim Thorton doesn’t know one end of a ladder from the other. I’d better go make sure he doesn’t bust his head.” Chapter 28 Jessie It was embarrassing to admit, but I followed Colette and her sister home. It was really more happenstance than anything intentional. I’d spent the day pacing in my room. I couldn’t get the vision of Colette Gibson out of my head and it was impossible for me to focus on anything else. By nightfall, I was restless and feeling like I needed to stretch my wings, so to speak. I headed to the castle roof. I figured no one would notice if I took a few laps soaring up and down the Tiburon River. I doubted there would be any fisherman around so late in the evening. There might be a few couples canoodling on the shore, but they would probably only have eyes for each other. As I looked over the edge of the castle roof, I could see Colette and her sister climbing into an automobile. It sounded like their father had stopped by to pick them up. I rose into the air as the car drove away, fully intending to stick to the waterway, but then I found myself following the Gibson family through the streets of Tiburon. I hid on a neighboring rooftop as Colette climbed out of the car, following her father and sister into an attractive house with a neat front yard. There was no distinction between the backyard and the open fields dotted with trees behind the house. After that I forced myself to fly back home. It would be inappropriate for me to spy on the family while they ate their dinner. I still missed sitting down to an evening meal each night. I wondered how long I had to be a member of the undead before I forgot how it felt to enjoy food that wasn’t blood red and in a cup. But after being home for a few hours, I found myself circling the Gibson house again, viewing it from all sides. I just wanted to be near Colette, but I knew there was no excuse for my behavior. I wouldn’t like it very much if there was some stranger sitting outside the castle, just hoping for a glimpse of Emily. So I decided to stop acting like a love-sick fool and go home. Giving one more glance toward the darkened house where a girl lived that I didn’t even know, I was shocked to see that very girl gazing out the window. There was no time for me to fly away before she would notice me, so I concealed myself in the branches of a tree. I knew she must have caught a glimpse of me because, after staring in my direction for several seconds, she swiped the curtain closed. I sat in the apple tree for at least an hour, never taking my eyes off the window. I wanted to make sure that no one was peeking out. Then I quickly gathered as many dead leaves and dried grasses as I could find, rolled it all into a ball and stuffed it into the crook of the tree where I had tried to conceal myself. It wasn’t the best deception, but it was the only thing I could think of to explain the dark figure that Colette had obviously glimpsed. I spent the next week trying not to think about Colette and failing miserably. It would have been one thing if she was just some girl I had seen through a shop window and found attractive. But I had spoken to Colette. I knew the music of her voice. She had rushed to my aid when she thought I was grievously injured. She had held my hand and tried to ease my pain, not realizing she was creating the excruciating pain of longing, just by doing so. And then the fates had arranged it so she was in my home six days a week, dusting, and polishing, and scrubbing at things. It was true that the castle was an enormous structure. It was easy enough to avoid someone else in the building, if that was what you desired. But I desired to be with Colette every minute of every day. Keeping away from her was exquisite torture. I was acting like an idiot. I knew that without a doubt. Colette Gibson was just a charming young woman who had caught my fancy. There was nothing more to it. I arose each evening with the new determination to forget about the pretty housemaid who probably thought no more of me than she did my brother. “Your sweethearts going to a dance,” my sister told me one evening after I had just gotten out of bed and made my way downstairs. Emily had become very good at engaging Colette in casual conversation, whenever she had the chance. I hadn’t asked her to pursue more information from the maid after my first request, but she somehow decided to take it upon herself. “She isn’t my sweetheart,” I told her in a stern voice. “And I’m sorry I asked you to find out about her in the first place. She’s just a young woman who works in this house and she deserves her privacy.” “So you don’t want to know about the dance?” Emily asked, her eyes a little wide with surprise. “No,” I told her, trying to make my voice sound firm, although inwardly I felt stung. I couldn’t imagine Colette going to a dance with any young man, but me. “You don’t want to know that it’s next Saturday night at the Mansfield Country Club in Mansfield, Ohio?” she said. I could tell that my sister was enjoying taunting me. “It’s none of my business,” I informed her. “And I want to hear nothing more about it.” The truth was I desperately wanted to hear about it, but knowing the details would do me no good. “And I suppose you don’t care that she doesn’t want to go because she doesn’t like her date,” Emily said, her voice teasing. “Why would she go if she doesn’t like her date?” I couldn’t help but asked. My little sister shrugged. “I guess she’s double dating with her sister and her boyfriend,” she said. “She wants to get out of it, but then her sister wouldn’t be able to go.” “Oh,” I said. This piece of information made me frown. Any man would be lucky to having Colette Gibson as his date, so I assumed her escort would behave like a gentleman, but that didn’t explain her reluctance to go. “There’s going to be swing music,” Emily went on. “Aren’t you a fan of swing music?” “I enjoy all types of music,” I muttered, still thinking about Lettie’s date. “Maybe you should get out some evening and go see a swing band,” Emily suggested with a suppressed giggle in her voice. I immediately understood what she was suggesting. “No,” I told her, shaking my head. “That wouldn’t be right.” “Why not?” Emily wanted to know. “Then maybe you could talk with her. Or even dance with her.” My little sister’s eyes started glowing again. “Come on,” she said, nudging my arm. “I know you want to.” “Emily,” I said, taking both her hands and bending down so that we were forehead to forehead. “I’m not going to any dance. Not a mortal dance,” I informed her. “You know that would be dangerous for everyone, including me.” “But you’re getting a lot better at controlling your appetite. Aren’t you?” she asked, leaning her weight slightly onto me. “I am, but a dance is not a place to test my new found self control,” I informed her, straightening my spine, but still holding her hands. “I suppose not,” my little sister said with a sigh. “It’s just that I like her so much. She’s really funny and she seems really nice.” Closing my eyes for a second, I indulged in a sigh of my own. “Can we please not talk about Miss Gibson anymore?” I really didn’t need any more confirmation about how wonderful she was. “She brings flowers to Arthur. Did you know that?” “What?” I opened my eyes and frowned at my little sister. “There have been a couple of days now where she shows up to work with a bouquet of wildflowers,” Emily reported. “I guess Colette and her sister ride over here on their bicycles. Sometimes she stops and cuts Arthur some flowers.” “Why would she bring Arthur wildflowers?” I was puzzled. Arthur didn’t even exist; not that she knew that. “I asked her the same thing.” Emily preened a little, pleased by her own cleverness. “She said that she hoped it might cheer him up a little to have some nature in his room. She said she felt bad that he was sick and couldn’t go outside himself.” “Oh.” I thought this over. “That’s very sweet.” And, unfortunately, it made me admire Miss Gibson even more. “She’s perfect for you,” Emily said. “I mean, really perfect.” “Perfect, except for one thing,” I reminded her, letting go of her hands. “We can never be together.” Chapter 29 Colette I didn’t know if Jessie Vanderlind was avoiding me or if he was never home. Or maybe he was always just in another part of the castle. Their home was so massive and the family usually slept so late, that it wasn’t unusual for us to never see any of them for days at a time. Except for the youngest girl, Emily. She seemed to be a morning person. She usually popped by to see Lilly and me at least once a day and frequently found a reason to spend time in whichever room we happened to be cleaning. She was a charming girl and I felt a little sorry for her. The rest of the family never seemed to be around, so she rambled the house by herself most of the time. Sometimes Emily would go to the back of the house where the makeshift clinic was set up to draw blood from the volunteers. She liked to put on a little apron and play nurse, chatting with the people and serving them sandwiches, along with something to drink. Word had started to spread around Tiburon that the Vanderlinds would pay good money and supply a meal in exchange for a pint of blood. The first few days only two or three people showed up and these were people who looked very down on their luck. But it didn’t take long before there was a line of people each morning as the nurses hired to draw the blood opened the back door. The clinic began using a signup sheet where people were supposed to write their names. But then it became clear that some of the people willing to volunteer were unable to sign their names, so rather than embarrass some poor fellow who was struggling, the nurses started listing the names themselves. It didn’t take long before the Vanderlinds had more blood than they could handle, but they never turned anyone away. We’d heard that some of the local hospitals were happy to take what could be spared and that rumor was confirmed by men in white jackets driving up to the castle in an ambulance and then leaving with chests packed full of ice. Lilly and I had only caught a few glimpses of the rest of the Vanderlind family, Jessie’s mother and brother. The brother, whose name was Daniel, was a lot like Jessie in general appearance, but he was made with less generous lines. His lips were thin and his hair was flat. He was somewhat handsome, but his features didn’t have the ample curves that Jessie’s had. No one ever saw poor Arthur, of course. He didn’t seem to ever leave his room and his isolation weighed on me. The real surprise was the mother. She didn’t look a day over twenty-five. In fact, she looked more like a sister than a mother to her two sons. She had raven black hair and a flawless complexion. “I wonder what she puts on her face at night to keep it so wrinkle-free,” Lilly said one day while we were having lunch with Millie. “You know, I asked her lady’s maid that very question,” Millie said between bites of a sandwich. “I’m not sure if she just didn’t understand me because of the language barrier, but she insisted that her mistress applied nothing to her face at all. She’s just naturally like that.” “Hmmm...” Lilly frowned. “I’m not sure I believe that. I bet she has some face cream from Europe that costs about a hundred dollars a bottle.” We didn’t have all that much to do as downstairs maids at the castle. Yes, we dusted quite a bit, washed windows, beat rugs, freshened drapes, and whatever else Mrs. Denkler could think of, but none of the things we were assigned to clean were actually all that dirty. If I found a thin layer of dust on any surface, it was always a surprise to me. There were only five Vanderlinds, after all, so it came as no wonder that there wasn’t much of a mess. Plus the family kept barely any kitchen staff. I’d only ever seen Emily seated for a meal. When I asked Mrs. Denkler about it, she said, “Not that it’s any of your business, but the family are practicing vegetarians. They eat very little, and their food is usually raw, so they don’t need a dozen chefs to prepare it.” Even with the peculiarities of the household, I loved working at the castle. The Vanderlinds had such beautiful things, and some of them appeared quite ancient. There were a few full suits of armor that we were assigned to oil one afternoon. We polished ornately carved chairs that were so massive, I thought of them as thrones. And they may very well have been thrones, for all I knew. But the best thing about working at the Vanderlind Castle was that it was where Jessie lived. Although I rarely caught a glimpse of him, I could feel his presence all around me and it kept the metal string running through my body vibrating all the time. “I’ve not been disappointed with your performance,” Mrs. Denkler told the two of us the next morning. Lilly and I exchanged glances. This was high praise from Mrs. Denkler. She went on, “As long as you girls don’t do anything silly, then I’d like to keep you on as part of the downstairs staff.” “Thank you, Mrs. Denkler,” we said in unison. I hadn’t even realized we were still under review. “If you keep up the good work, then after a period of six months you will receive a wage increase of fifty cents per day,” the housekeeper informed us. Lilly and I exchanged another look. That would be a whole extra dollar between us per day. That would be six dollars per week. Mama and Papa would be thrilled. “I’m afraid school starts in the fall,” Lilly felt the need to point out. “I can stay on because I’ve graduated, but our parents will expect Lettie to finish up high school.” “I could still come after school and on Saturdays,” I blurted. I’d been so happy working at the castle that it never occurred to me that I would go back to school. The housekeeper scowled at both of us. “That’s ridiculous,” she said. “Why would you waste your time at school when you already have good paying jobs?” “Our mother and father value education,” I had to admit, even though it pained me. I did not want to go back to school. I wanted to keep working. I wanted to be near Jessie. “I had not anticipated you leaving here so soon,” Mrs. Denkler said, scowling some more. “I might not be as happy with a new girl.” Then she looked me in the eye. “But you’ll stay until your school begins again?” I assured her that I was happy to stay. Since we were firmly established at the castle, Mama and Papa thought it would be okay for us to ride our bicycles to work as the weather grew fine. They were more concerned about us riding home as the sun was going down, so we had to promise to stick together and ride single file, even on the country roads. Some of the local boys liked to race their jalopies in the country and mother was constantly concerned that one of us might be knocked down by the reckless youths. We had to promise to pull off the road immediately if we heard the rattle of a car engine. Riding to work each morning was one of my favorite times of the day. I knew it was foolish, but I always held out hope that I would see Jessie. Not to speak with him or anything, but maybe just to catch a glimpse of him. The fields and meadows that we rode past on our bicycles were decorated with the cheerful faces of wildflowers. They reminded me of a dream I’d had the previous night where I was lying in a field, holding Jessie’s hand while the sun shone down on us and birds performed a serenade. It was a silly dream. Mrs. Denkler had made it clear that the Vanderlinds did not fare well in the sunshine. It made me sad to think about it, especially for poor Arthur. His life sounded very hard, always being confined to his room. “Hold up a minute,” I called to my sister, pulling over to the side of the road. “What is it?” she called, turning to look back at me as she slowed her bike. “Did your chain slip?” “No,” I told her, pushing down my kickstand and hurrying into the nearby field. “I just want to gather some flowers for Arthur, to cheer up his room.” “You’re not allowed in his room,” Lilly reminded me. “I know, but I can put them in a vase and the nurse can take them up the next time he needs a transfusion.” Lilly made a little noise of disapproval that she’d learned from our mother, but she didn’t try to stop me. “Just hurry up, please,” she said. “I don’t want to be late.” I quickly gathered what I could, laid the flowers in my bicycle basket, and then hurried to catch up with Lilly, who had already started pedaling, once she saw me returning to my bike. “What are those doing in here?” Mrs. Denkler asked, giving the flowers a disapproving look when I brought them in. “They’re for Arthur,” I explained. “I feel so sorry that he can’t enjoy the lovely weather we’ve been having, so I thought maybe I’d bring a little nature to him. Mrs. Denkler opened her mouth to say something, closed it again, and then frowned at the flowers some more. “I think there are some glass vases under the sink in the kitchen,” she said. “One of those should serve for wildflowers.” I knew this was the closest I was going to get to Mrs. Denkler’s approval, so I hurried to mostly unused kitchen. “Leave the flowers at the bottom of the stairs and the nurse will take them up,” she called after me. “And don’t take all day. You’re not being paid to fuss over flowers.” That night, Lilly and I were both rousted from our sleep by a commotion. The phone started ringing and a few moments later someone was pounding on the front door. “What is it?” Lilly wondered aloud as we both leapt out of bed to grab our robes. “I don’t know,” I told her. But then I sniffed the air. “Smells like smoke.” Then we both shivered. Somewhere there was a fire. The door to our room opened and Mama stuck her head in. “Girls, the school is on fire. Get dressed.” Before we could pepper her with questions, she shut the door again. Lilly and I looked at each other. “How did the school catch fire?” Lilly voiced the questions that I was wondering. After we both were dressed, we hurried downstairs to catch Papa just as he was leaving. He gave Mama a kiss and said, “It’ll be alright, Lillian,” and then he hurried out the door to hop in a car that was waiting for him. “What’s happening?” I asked, as soon as he’d left. “The school caught fire,” Mama told us. “Nobody knows how, but it’s a big one. Bundle up because we’re going to have to help with the line.” Tiburon had a volunteer fire department, of which our father was a member. But when a fire was quite large, every able bodied person was expected to help out, usually as a link in a bucket line. Citizens would form a line from the fire to the nearest well or pump. Then we would pass full buckets down the line to the firemen and bring empty buckets back up the line to be refilled. If the fire was very large, then several lines would form on several sides of the burning building. Most fires were handled by the volunteer firefighters, so when they immediately called for a bucket brigade, we knew things were not going well. We could see a weird orange glow in the sky as we got in the car. Even though we were some distance from the school, the smell of smoke filled the air. Mama drove along, cautiously, immediately pulling off the road if anyone was trying to get by. She didn’t want to delay any members of the fire department who were trying to catch up with the rest of the volunteers. “I think we’ll park at the library and then walk over,” she said as we approached the center of town. “That way we won’t be clogging up the roads.” Other members of the bucket brigade must have had the same idea because the library parking lot was almost full when we pulled in. “Come on, girls,” Mama said, immediately hurrying out of the car. “Stick together and stay out of the firemen’s way.” As soon as we saw the school, we simultaneously gasped. The entire building was engulfed in flames. Mrs. McGreevy, head of the bucket brigade, hurried over to us. “Come on. We’re wetting down the neighboring buildings to try to stop the fire’s spread,” she shouted over the racket of the fire. “If the wind picks up, the whole town could go.” We spent the next several hours passing full and empty buckets up and down the line. A few times the firemen thought they had the blaze under control, only to have it flare up again with the night wind. As dawn started to warm the sky, the fire quieted down and the bucket brigade was told that the fire department could handle things from there and everyone else should go home. No neighboring buildings had caught fire, but the school was just a smoking pile of ashes and cinders. “It looks like arson,” Papa said, late the next morning when we had all finally crawled from our beds. Mama called us in sick to the castle and Mrs. Denkler was apparently very understanding about the whole thing. “Looks like the entire perimeter of the school was doused with gasoline,” our father went on. “Thank the Lord Mr. Green wasn’t about or this could have been a real tragedy.” Mr. Green was the school’s janitor. He usually stayed there most evenings, but sometimes he went to visit his sister in Cincinnati during the summer. “What are they going to do about classes?” Lilly asked. “Where will everybody go in the fall?” Papa rubbed his chin. “That hasn’t quite been figured out yet,” he said. “Might be that school is just delayed until the town can get enough money to build a new one.” “Arson,” Mama repeated, shaking her head. “And the whole school gone. Who would do such a thing?” I was as upset as everyone else about the school, but also, secretly, my heart was singing. I’d received a reprieve. I’d be able to keep working at the castle. Chapter 30 Colette A few days after the fire, I left the house a little earlier than usual so that I could gather a proper bouquet of wildflowers. Mrs. Denkler frowned some more when she saw it. Shaking her head slightly, she said, “Just hurry up with that nonsense. Leave the vase at the bottom of the stairs.” “I’m so excited for Saturday,” Lilly told me later that day as we scrubbed the kitchen floor, even though it was already spotless. “Saturday?” I said vaguely. Was something happening on Saturday? I couldn’t remember. “It’s the dance,” Lilly exclaimed, giving me a look that let me know she thought it was an event that was impossible to forget. “In Mansfield,” she went on. “At the country club.” “Oh.” It was my turn to exclaim. “Is that happening already? I thought it wasn’t for a few more weeks.” “It’s this Saturday,” my sister said in a voice that let me know that she was going to brook no excuses. “I’ve already asked Mrs. Denkler if we can leave early.” “Oh,” I said again. “What did she say?” “Well, she didn’t like it, but she agreed,” Lilly told me. “Just as long as we come in early on Monday to make up the hours.” “That’s nice,” I said, although even I knew there was no enthusiasm in my voice. Lilly stopped her scrubbing and turned to look at me. “Aren’t you the least little bit excited?” she asked. “I haven’t exactly thought about it,” I told her, keeping my eyes on my work. Truth be told, I had thought about it from time to time, but always with a vague feeling of dread. “You’ll probably feel differently with Lev twirling you around the dance floor,” she told me. “I doubt that,” was my reply. “Are you sure he wouldn’t rather take some other girl? I mean, we could always say I twisted my ankle and then maybe...” I searched my brain for a substitute that Lev would find acceptable. “Don’t even think about it,” Lilly told me. “You are not spraining your ankle. I agreed to go to the job interview here just so you would agree to go to the dance. Now I’ve held up my end of the bargain and it’s time for you to hold up yours.” “But you like working here,” I insisted. “That’s beside the point,” she informed me. “You agreed to go with Lev Wilson to the dance at the Mansfield Country Club, so you are going and you are going to have a lovely time.” There didn’t appear to be any way to squirm out of it. Lilly could force me to go to the dance, and I wouldn’t sulk or anything, but with Lev as my date, I highly doubted the evening would be enjoyable. Not unless Lev caught laryngitis. Lilly and I each had an organdy dress from a year earlier, when our mother’s youngest sister got married. We’d both grown a little since then, but when my mother made the dresses, she’d included a generous seam allowance. She was able to let both dresses out and lower the hems so that they fit perfectly. Lilly took extra time on my hair and managed, with the aid of hair tonic and about a hundred bobby pins, to fashion it into an upsweep that both she and Mama said was quite becoming. Papa had out his camera and took our picture before the boys came to get us. Walter and Lev arrived looking freshly scrubbed, but it was obvious they were both in borrowed suits. Lev’s was a little too small and Walter’s was a little too big. I wondered if they would have been better off just switching what they were wearing, but I wasn’t going to say anything. I noticed that this time Lev’s right cheek had a faded yellow bruise on it and he had more plasters on his knuckles, which he tried to conceal by keeping his hands clasped behind his back most of the time. I didn’t know what kind of roughhousing he and his friends got up to, but they seemed a little too old for such violent hijinx. “Here,” Lev said, thrusting a box at me. “I got you something.” Inside was a wrist corsage with a single pink rose, surrounded by baby’s breath and tied with a pink ribbon. “Thank you,” I said. It was my first corsage and it was actually quite pretty. I only wished it had been given to me by somebody else. Anybody else, really. Lev shrugged, as if it was no big deal. “I know girls like flowers and this reminded me of you.” Walter presented Lilly with a nosegay of wildflowers, clumsily fashioned with a yellow ribbon. I knew she had secretly been hoping for a corsage of her own, but she acted like he had just handed her an emerald ring. Papa wanted to make another picture, but he was all out of film, so we piled into Lev’s new car with our dates undocumented. Lev got the door for me. He hadn’t said much since arriving to pick us up and that made me feel a little better about the evening. Maybe it wouldn’t be so miserable after all. “The Charlie Barnet Orchestra is going to be playing,” Lev told me as he drove us along. He kept the car at a reasonable speed and was considerate of other motorists out for an evening drive. “Barnet is almost still a kid, but I hear he’s a genius on the saxophone.” I began to actually look forward to the evening. I did like to dance, and swing bands were starting to be popular on the radio. It would be neat to get to experience one in person. Plus, it was nice to have something to think about besides my longing for Jessie Vanderlind. Over the past several days, thoughts of him had taken up way too much of my time. I needed to stop fantasizing about him and live my life. I needed to go out and have new experiences; not spend every minute of every day pining for a man who could never be mine. The Mansfield Country Club was practically glowing with the excitement of the evening. The bushes along the long driveway leading up to the main building had been festooned with twinkle lights. There were at least ten cars ahead of us, waiting for the valet service. Men in snappy uniforms and white gloves were helping guests out of their cars. We could already hear music drifting out of the building. Many of the ladies who were helped from the vehicles were older and dressed far more elegantly than I had been expecting. The men were all in suits, but not dressed quite as spectacularly as their wives and sweethearts. “Who’s hosting this dance?” I asked as we waited. Lilly might have mentioned it at some point, but I hadn’t been paying attention. “An associate of my boss,” Lev told me. “He’s a very well connected guy from way back in the day.” I scanned my memory to see if I had any inkling of what Lev Wilson did for a living. Didn’t his father sell appliances? Was that right? Did Lev sell appliances? No, that didn’t make any sense. Somewhere in the back of my brain I thought maybe I remembered he had something to do with security. I had no idea what kind of security. But, judging by the other guests at the dance, it was for people who had more money that anyone I knew. I thought it would be rude to ask Lev questions about his work when I knew he had probably already told me every detail about it, so I didn’t say anything else. As we entered the dance, Lilly and I were both handed a dance card, done up with pink ribbon, each with a miniature pencil attached. “You won’t need that tonight,” Lev said with a grin. “You can pretty much count on dancing every dance with me.” “Same goes for you,” Walter said, giving Lilly a nudge and then breaking into a wide grin. Lilly nudged her date in return. “I could say the same to you.” They both laughed. “Come here for a minute,” Lev said, herding us all to one side of the foyer. He reached in his pocket and pulled out a silver colored flask. “I know there’s a bar,” he said, uncorking it, “but it’s a cash bar, so I thought we might as well get a little warmed up first.” Lev took a large slug out of the flask and then shoved it in my direction. I’d had a few sips of wine before, but I’d never tried hard alcohol and I didn’t think it was time for me to start. “No thank you,” I told him. Flashing me a quick look of disdain, Lev then offered the flask to my sister. “No thanks,” she said, shaking her head. “It’s gives me a stomach ache.” I didn’t think Lilly had ever tried booze before either, but at least she had a good excuse. With a sigh, Lev positioned the flask in front of Walter. “Don’t let me down, Wally Boy,” he said. Walter accepted the bottle, shooting an apologetic look in my sister’s direction, and then took a modest sip. After which, he grimace a little as the liquor slid into his belly. Lev grabbed the flask back from his friend and took another big slug out of it, just to show us how it was done. After putting the cap back on the bottle, Lev said, “Come on. Let’s check out this Barnet fellow.” Grabbing me by the arm, he steered me through the crowd. “I’m ready to dance.” The ballroom was very large, with two art deco chandeliers overhead that started with a ring of crystals in a large circle and cascaded into smaller and small circles until the crystals came to a point. The band was at the far end, just finishing up a song. The room was full, but not overly crowded. There was still room to breathe. I hoped there wouldn’t be many more people arriving after us. I didn’t want to feel squashed. “My boss should be here, somewhere,” Lev said, scanning the crowd. His eyes must have encountered a presence in the room he didn’t like because he frowned. “Would you look at that pretty boy in the tuxedo? Does he think he’s at a coronation or something?” I turned to look in the general direction that Lev was sneering and locked eyes with Jessie Vanderlind. Chapter 30 Jessie I kept telling myself I wasn’t going to follow Colette to the dance. It would be the height of foolishness. And I would be putting Colette, and everyone at the dance, in danger. I kept telling myself I wouldn’t go as I requested that Mrs. Denkler find my tuxedo and have it pressed. I was still a fledgling vampire, after all, which meant I had less self control than someone who had been a member of the undead for a century. I kept reminding myself I wasn’t going to attend the dance as I ordered a boutonniere from the local florist shop. If I was unmasked as a vampire, it would put my entire family at risk, and that was something I would never do. I even kept telling myself I wasn’t attending the dance at the Mansfield Country Club as I dressed in my tuxedo, launched into the air and made my way across the countryside. “Tickets please,” a man at the door said as I mounted the front steps to the club. His nose was misshapen and had obviously been broken more than once. “Oh,” I stammered. I had been so busy convincing myself that I wasn’t attending the dance that I had forgotten about tickets. The tough guy at the door gave me a steady look. “You can’t get in without a ticket.” I gazed right back at him, fixing him with my eyes. “I’ve already given you my ticket,” I told him. “You were just about to tell me that I could go inside.” The man blinked twice and then said, “You can go on inside.” I liked the Mansfield Country Club. It was a nice, open space with a band shell at the far end of a well-lit ballroom. The floor was already filling up by the time I arrived. There were lots of attractive females present, all dressed in varying levels of finery. But I only had eyes for one girl. My timing was perfect because it was only about ten minutes before I caught a glimpse of Colette Gibson entering the dance. Her escort noticed me first, for some reason, saying something derogatory about my attire. But then Colette and I locked eyes. She immediately blushed and put a hand to her cheek. A new song started and I had to resist the impulse to take her in my arms and twirl her across the dance floor. Her date must have noticed my longing gaze, because he flashed a warning look in my direction and then led Colette to another section of the room. I tracked him with my eyes. Setting aside my instant jealously, I observed that he was obviously a man up to no good. I could see the faded marks of a fight on his cheeks and smell the coagulated blood under his skin. I noticed his knuckles were covered in plasters as he hooked a possessive hand through Colette’s arm. I had to wonder why Colette’s parents would allow her to go out with such a brute. Colette’s eyes lingered on me as her date dragged her off to be introduced to some older gentlemen and their wives. I was immediately glad that I had ignored every argument I’d made against going to the dance. I didn’t trust Miss Gibson’s date. He had an air about him that smelled like trouble. While I stood at a discreet distance from the couple, I began to pay more attention to the crowd. There were a lot more older people at the dance than I had expected. And some of them were quite garishly dressed. Several of the younger men were concealing recent wounds, which told me that perhaps there had been some kind of brawl. Tables ringed the room, out of the way of the dance floor, and I took a moment to glance at the cover of a dance card someone had set down next to her purse. The dance was apparently for members of the Fifteenth Chapter of the Lenox Avenue Corporation. The name meant nothing to me, but I had my suspicions about their business. I doubted they were part of a pipefitters union or some other legal operation. When the next song started, Colette was led by her date onto the dance floor. I could tell she was reluctant to go. Her eyes kept darting around the room and I wondered if she was looking for me. It wasn’t fair of me to show up and throw a wrench in her evening, so I concealed myself in the crowd, but where I could still keep a watchful eye. Much to my distaste, her brute of a date was a rather good dancer. He was much smoother than I would have been on the floor. Colette did an admirable job keeping up with him, but it was obvious the fellow was a bit of a showoff. Colette’s sister seemed much happier with her date, even though the fellow wasn’t nearly as light on his feet. They were hanging onto each other in a manner that bordered on immodest. Lettie frowned a few times while looking in her sister’s direction. But besides too high of spirits, Lilly and her date weren’t actually doing anything inappropriate. After an hour of dancing non-stop, Colette begged to be allowed to catch her breath. Her face was pink and she was breathing heavy. I could smell the perfume of her sweat and it was sweet. I sent up a silent thank you to the good people of Tiburon who had been consistently donating their blood to help poor Arthur. It kept our family well supplied. We even had enough to help out some of the regional hospitals. We were too isolated in Tiburon to share the wealth with any of the other vampire families, but I was grateful that my belly was full and I had a flask in my breast pocket in case of emergency. I felt completely under control. Colette’s date excused himself and headed off in the direction of the men’s room. I fought the urge to go over and ask her to dance. It would have been heaven to hold Colette in my arms, if only for the length of one song. But I knew it was wrong. I knew I couldn’t ask her. She more than likely only thought of me as one of her employers. I’d probably ruined her evening by showing up to the dance. A middle-aged man with a big belly and a pronounced scar across his cheek approached Colette. It was obvious from his stagger that he’d been spending most of his time at the bar. “Hey there, cutie,” he slurred. Colette appeared a little startled to be addressed by the man. “Hello,” she said, rather hesitantly. Then she quickly scanned the dance floor for her sister. “What do you say you and I twinkle our toes a little out on the floor?” he asked, swaying slightly to the left and then straightening up again. “No thank you,” was her reply. “What’s the matter?” the guy asked, immediately taking offense. “You think you’re too good for me or something?” “No,” she assured him. “It’s just that I’m waiting for my escort. He said he’d be right back and that I should wait here.” “Awe, he won’t mind,” the man assured her. “Not when he sees who you’re dancing with. I’m a big name in these parts.” “Thank you, but I think I’d rather wait,” Colette told him, still trying to be gracious. “Maybe you didn’t hear me properly,” the man snarled, turning quite red in the face. “I asked you to dance.” And then he grabbed her arm. “Hello, darling,” I said, immediately appearing at Colette’s side. “Sorry to have kept you waiting.” “Oh,” Colette said, her eyes as wide as saucers. “Who’s your friend?” I asked, smiling at the drunk. “My name is something you don’t need to know,” the man slurred. “Now, excuse me, we were just about to hit the dance floor.” I frowned a little. “There must be some confusion. I’m afraid the young lady promised me the next dance.” The man’s face puckered up like he’d just licked a lemon. “Do you know who I am?” he demanded. I looked him dead in the eye. “I think you are a very nice gentleman who was kind enough to converse with my date. But now you are feeling tired and you’d like to go home. You no longer wish to dance.” “As a matter of fact, I don’t want to dance. Not anymore,” the man said after digesting my words. “I’m tired. To hell with this shindig. I’m going home.” And then he staggered off. “Shall we?” I asked, extending my elbow toward Colette so that I could lead her onto the floor. The orchestra was just starting a slow song. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. As I put my arms around her, I could feel Colette tremble. If I was being honest, I was trembling slightly, too. Not from the confrontation, but just from being so close to her. “I’m sorry if that man frightened you,” I said. “No, I…” Colette stammered. After a moment she tried again. “I’m fine,” she assured me. “But what are you doing here?” I swirled her across the floor and it was like dancing on air. “I wanted to hear the band,” I said. “They’re quite good. Don’t you think?” Colette looked at my feet for a moment. “Your ankle,” she said. “Is it quite better?” “It troubled me for a day or two, but it’s all healed now,” I told her. She was so very close, I felt like I could get lost in her emerald green eyes. “I just can’t believe you’re here,” she said in a very quiet voice. “It’s like something out of a dream.” I couldn’t believe my ears. This beautiful creature in my arms couldn’t possibly feel the same way about me as I felt about her. It was my turn to stammer. “You mean to tell me…” “Hey, buddy.” I felt someone slap me aggressively on the arm. “You’re dancing with my girl.” I knew without looking that it was Colette’s brute of a date. “We’d just like to finish this song,” I told him, never letting my eyes leave Colette. I had to have misunderstood her. I just couldn’t believe there was any chance that all the feelings I had for her were mutual. I had to find out. Unfortunately, it was right then that the song drew to a close. “Before you go back to your escort,” I began as I reluctantly removed my hand from her waist. “I just wanted to ask you if…” But it was too late. The brute was right there, glaring at me like he’d caught me stealing from his father’s store. I could smell the liquor on his breath. Colette’s eyes flicked nervously to her date and then back to me. “Thank you for the lovely dance,” she said. I made a small bow. “It was my pleasure.” And then the brute took her roughly by the arm and pulled her through the crowd. I wanted to go after him and explain to him in detail the proper way to treat a lady, but I knew that was unwise. He thought he was a tough-guy and that probably meant he was always spoiling for a fight. If he took a swing at me, then I doubted I would be able to stop myself from shattering his spine. But I decided to follow them at a discrete distance, anyway. Drink was causing the young man’s temper to flare. I didn’t want him to take his bad mood out on Miss Gibson. Chapter 31 Colette Lev goose-stepped me outside like I was a recalcitrant toddler. “You’re hurting my arm,” I told him, but I wasn’t sure if he was listening. There was fury in his eyes. I desperately scanned the crowd, looking for my sister or Walter. Where had they gone? Once we were at some distance from the crowd, Lev shoved me a little away from him and said, “Let’s you and me get something straight.” We were around to the left side of the country club where no other guests had strayed. “When you’re out with me, I don’t expect to find you in the arms of some other guy. Got it?” “We were just dancing,” I said, not sure why he suddenly thought he owned me. “It’s not like it’s any of your business anyway. Just because we came to the dance together doesn’t mean I’m your property for the evening.” “I paid for that flower,” he said, jabbing a finger at my wrist. “I paid for the tickets. I paid for the gas to drive you here.” He took a step closer to me. “Maybe that means I feel like you owe me a little something.” “Here,” I said, shucking the corsage off my arm and trying to hand it to him. “Tell me how much all of that cost you and I’ll pay you back,” I told him. I didn’t feel like I should have to be beholden to a man just because he’d spent a few dollars. “Just so you know,” I said, “I’m only on this date because my sister begged me. So if you spent two dollars, or three dollars, or even five dollars, then that’s fine. I have a job. I will pay you back.” Lev’s face turned dark and I immediately regretted my words. My goal shouldn’t have been to throw the fact that I didn’t like him in his face. My goal should have been to return to where there were other people, find my sister, and get out of there. “You’re going to pay me back,” he said, grabbing my arm. “But it’s not going to be with money. You’re going to have to earn it.” “Let go of me or I’ll scream,” I told him, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice. “Go ahead and scream,” he said with a laugh. “No man at this dance is going to come running, just because he hears some broad scream.” So I kicked him in the shin, and when he bent forward because of the pain, I socked him in the nose. It wasn’t a solid punch, but it was enough to make him let go of my arm. Seizing my moment, I started running back toward the front of the country club. Lev lunged for me, catching my dress. I didn’t stop, even after my dress tore. I ran without looking back. I expected that Lev would tackle me at any moment, but instead all I heard was a sharp “yipe” like someone had kicked a dog. Once I was back among the crowd, I slowed down. I knew what Lev had said about the other guests, but I couldn’t imagine he could drag me off into the bushes kicking and screaming with nobody saying anything. I had thought that Lev was going to come blundering around the corner in a matter of seconds, but he didn’t. I didn’t know why, but I sure as heck wasn’t going to go back and look for him. I moved deeper into the crowd of people chatting on the lawn and waited, never looking away from where I assumed Lev was going to appear. It couldn’t have been more than a minute or two before a figure did appear from around the corner of the building. But it wasn’t Lev. It was Jessie Vanderlind, discretely straightening his bowtie and dusting dirt off of his tux. I was dumbfounded, but slipped inside the club before he could see me. After several minutes of searching, I finally found my sister and Walter canoodling at a small table in a cozy corner by the bar. “What happened to your dress?” was the first thing out of my sister’s mouth when I finally caught her attention. “Lev tore it,” I said, fighting back tears. “What?” Lilly jumped to her feet. “What happened?” “Lev got angry because I danced with another man,” I said. “He dragged me outside and said I owed him because he bought me a flower and got us these tickets. I told him I’d pay him back but…” My voice caught for a second. “But he said he didn’t want my money. I had to earn it.” “What?” Lilly exclaimed, gripping both of my hands. “So then I kicked him, but he still wouldn’t let go of my arm. So then I had to punch him in the nose.” I half considered telling them about seeing Jessie slinking around the corner of the building, but then changed my mind. Walter slammed his hands down on the table. “I can’t believe it,” he all but yelled. “What is wrong with that guy? Has he lost his mind?” He got to his feet. “You two stay here. I’m going to find us a different ride home.” Spinning on his heel, Walter ran straight into Lev’s chest. Lev was a much bigger man, but anger had blinded my sister’s beau to this obstacle. “We’re going outside,” Walter informed his former friend. “You need to be taught a lesson on how to treat a lady.” I expected Lev to get right back in Walter’s face, or may let the fists start flying right there in the bar of the Mansfield Country Club. But Lev didn’t react in any way that I expected. Instead, he just stood there, swaying slightly on his feet. His skin looked clammy and his eyes were darting around the room. “I came here to apologize,” he said to me in a small voice. “I realize that my actions were wrong and I really want to say I’m sorry.” We all just stared at him, our mouths practically hanging open. Walter was the first to find his voice. “I’m glad to hear you’re sorry, but your behavior is still unforgivable. I hope you understand that I am going to find a different way to get the girls home.” “Please don’t do that,” Lev said, his voice trembling. He scanned the room as if he was afraid there was a wild panther hiding in the corner and he didn’t want to draw its attention. “Please allow me to drive the three of you home as a way of making amends.” “No.” Walter shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s impossible.” Lev began to quake and tears started streaming down his cheeks. “Can’t you at least go in my car? Walter, you can drive. Lettie and Lilly can sit in the back seat. I’ll sit up front with you.” He looked at me, beseechingly. “I won’t say a word. I promise. I’ll keep my mouth shut the whole time. But please just let me see you home safely.” He was a total wreck. It was as if we were talking to a completely different man. The Lev Wilson who was standing before us was somehow broken, like he had looked into the abyss and it had scared the fight out of him. “I think it will be okay if Walter drives,” I said. Lev was so altered, it was shocking. I actually found myself feeling sorry for him. “Okay, good,” Lev said, wiping the tears from his cheeks. “I really appreciate that. And I’m so sorry for…” His voice started trembling again and he had no more words. “I think maybe we’d better just get going,” Walter said after several seconds of watching Lev cry. “Why don’t I fetch the car and the three of you can meet me at the side entrance?” I knew he was worried about Lev being humiliated in front of his boss. But then Walter remembered he didn’t want to leave us alone with him. “Or maybe…” Walter tried to think of another option. “It’s probably best if you go get the car,” Lilly said. She obviously was thinking the same thing I was thinking; there was no need for us to fear Lev Wilson. He was a broken man. Chapter 32 Jessie I have never been so close to murdering someone in my life. It took every ounce of self control I possessed not to snap the brute’s spine and toss his body into the river. I was so disgusted by him that I didn’t even want to drink his blood; I just wanted to make him disappear off of the face of the planet. But I knew killing Colette’s date would be a mistake. Violence is rarely the solution to stop violence. Instead I decided to acquaint the brute with his own mortality, just to let him know how insignificant he really was in this world. It turned out he frightened quite easily. I was surprised how quickly he crumbled. But I suppose bullies aren’t really known for their bravery. After giving the young man a new perspective on life, I considered borrowing a car and offering Colette and her sister a ride home. But I decided that was just me wanting to play the hero. Besides, I wanted Colette to know that she had nothing more to fear from her date. He would never harass her again. So I instructed him to find his companions and to drive them home with the greatest of care. I explained that if I ever found out he was bullying or threatening anyone ever again, I would find him. But I wasn’t too worried on that score. I had a feeling that he was going to do everything with the greatest of care for the rest of his life. After straightening out the brute, I immediately walked across the country club lawn and left the dance. I couldn’t be around people any longer. Staying would have been a mistake. I took the flask out of my pocket and finished off its contents in a matter of seconds. Then, once I was clear from the crowd, I took to the air. I had meant to go home, but I was still worried about Colette. I found myself following the brute’s car as Colette and the rest of her party headed for home. Lilly’s escort saw her to the door, but Lettie’s escort was afraid to leave the car. I felt a pang of guilt. I may have frightened him just a little too much. I’d meant to make him a good person, not turn him into a sniveling coward. After the boys left, I followed their car once again, waiting for my chance to catch the brute alone. I had to lessen my influence. I’d put so much fear into him, I doubted his ability to survive. I had to take pity on him and provide at least some relief, however reluctant I was to do so. The next day was Sunday and I knew Colette would not be working at the castle. Even still, I could find no rest in my bed. I couldn’t help but wonder what she would do on her day off. Did she go to church? Did she have any hobbies? What did she eat for breakfast? I wanted to know every little detail of her life. I was already hopelessly in love with her. But I knew it was wrong to love her. When a vampire fell in love with a mortal, it put the mortal at a horrible risk. Even though I would have rather faced the sun than harm one hair on Colette Gibson’s head, loving her still meant I was exposing her to danger. I knew I had to find a way to keep myself from her. Earlier in the evening I had thought that maybe she was about to confess to having feelings for me and I desperately wanted to hear the words that she’d never had a chance to say. But knowing that she cared would probably only make things worse; it would make parting from her all the more painful. No, there was what my heart desired and there was what was right. I had to end things with Colette before they even had a chance to begin. By Monday afternoon, I knew I had to see Colette again. Not to profess my love or anything like that, but just to make sure that she was okay. Her date had tried to brutalize her and that weighed heavily on my mind. I knew she was a brave girl or she wouldn’t have fought her date, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t upset, or still in fear of him. I just wanted reassurance that she was unscathed. I promised myself one last look at the girl and then I would leave her alone forever. I would confess my dilemma to my mother and explain that I needed to move away for a couple of decades. I could always return in twenty years when Colette Gibson was in her thirties, married and raising her children. Children I could never give her. With the safety of a wedding band on her finger, I knew I would find her much easier to resist. With that resolve in mind, I set out to seek Miss Gibson. I didn’t intend to speak to her. I would just gaze upon her one last time to commit her beautiful visage to memory. I could live off of that for a few decades until my feelings of love for her began to fade. A small amount of discrete searching allowed me to find Colette dusting books in the library. It was a task that Mrs. Denkler usually assigned to her every Monday, whether the books needed it or not. By a stroke of good fortune, she was alone. Her sister had been called away to assist one of the other maids. The library door glided silently open on well-oiled hinges. Poking my head in, but not fully stepping into the room, I could not see her. The room smelled of her sweetness, so I placed one foot cautiously over the threshold. Where was she? A second later, I caught a glimpse of her, high on top of a ladder, dusting the books on the shelf closest to the ceiling. She was humming softly to herself, thoroughly engaged in her task. I could see that she was happy and not at all traumatized by the events of Saturday evening. I meant to turn and leave as quietly as I’d entered. But then I just stood there, mesmerized by Colette’s beauty. Everything about her called me to her. I reminded myself that I had to be brave and wrench myself away. I couldn’t give her mortal love. That opportunity was gone for me. I could only deny myself the pleasure of seeing her so that she could have a happy life. It took all of my strength, but I turned to leave the library. That’s when a floorboard creaked beneath my shifting weight. Colette’s eyes immediately met mine. Her lips parted and she exclaimed, “Jessie?” She tried to descend the ladder, but the heel of her shoe got caught on the hem of her dress. Suddenly her legs were out from under her and she was tumbling head first toward the hardwood floor. Chapter 33 Colette I scanned the country club crowd for Jessie Vanderlind as we were leaving the dance, but he was nowhere to be found. Lev was a complete mess. He acted terrified by every trumpet of laughter and every shadow in the trees. “Did something happen after I left you?” I couldn’t help but ask him. “What?” he said, giving me a startled look. “No, nothing. Why do you ask?” “I’m sorry,” I told him. “You just seem very…” I wanted to say altered, but that probably wasn’t very nice. “You seem a little unsettled and I was wondering if anything happened while you were on the lawn by yourself.” “No.” He shook his head rapidly back and forth. “I was alone, by myself, and nothing happened. Nothing at all.” The three of us were standing by the side entrance, waiting for Walter to bring the car. Lev scanned the area with wild eyes, as if he expected the grim reaper to lunge out of the shadows. I clearly remembered Jessie Vanderlind brushing down his tux as he left the general area where Lev had decided to assault me. And I found it very unlikely that Jessie would stand idly by while someone was being attacked. Did he have anything to do with Lev’s current fragile state? “And you spoke to no one?” I asked again. “No,” Lev insisted, shaking his head. “I’ve already told you that. Now please stop asking me.” His eyes started welling with tears again so I decided to just keep my mouth shut. When we arrived home, Walter saw Lilly to the door, but Lev stayed in the car. We could hear him locking the doors as soon as we’d pushed them shut. “I’m so sorry about all of this,” Walter said as he escorted Lilly up the front porch steps. “I am so sorry,” Lilly whispered to me as we entered the front door. “You told me you didn’t want to go with Lev and I wouldn’t listen. I just feel so horrible.” “That’s okay,” I told her in a low voice. “Oh, here comes Mama.” “Hello, girls,” our mother said, beaming at us. She was already in her nightgown and robe. “I wasn’t expecting you home so early.” And then she caught sight of the giant tear in my dress. “Goodness. Lettie, what happened?” “I... was sitting down and didn’t realize the woman next to me was standing on my hem,” I told her. “So when I got up, it all tore.” “Goodness,” Mama said again, bending to examine the damage. “I don’t think I can mend this without it showing.” She scratched her chin and straightened up, still eyeing the hole. “I guess we could add a wide sash and that would hide it well enough. I might have just the right fabric in my scrap box.” “I knew you would think of something to save it,” I said, giving our mother a squeeze. “I felt like such a fool when it happened.” “I hope it didn’t spoil the dance for you,” Mama said. “Oh, no,” I assured her. “We had a lovely time. I think Walter and Lilly danced to every song.” “And what about you?” she asked. “Have you changed your mind about Lev Wilson?” I didn’t think it was worth upsetting my parents with Lev’s behavior, so I sighed and then said, “I’m afraid I just don’t like Lev in that way. We’ve decided to just be friends.” I set out for work extra early Monday morning. The weather was quite warm and I wanted to gather a large bouquet of wildflowers for Arthur. Mrs. Denkler never said if he enjoyed the flowers or not, but I figured he must have at least enjoyed them a little or she would have told me to stop. Lilly caught up with me on her bicycle and we rode the rest of the way to the castle together. “Thank you so much for not saying anything to Mama and Papa,” she said as we rolled along. “I don’t think they’d ever let me see Walter again if they knew about Lev’s behavior.” “I don’t know why,” I called back to her as we both pedaled single file. “It’s not like Walter did anything. As a matter of fact, I think he behaved quite gallantly during the whole incident. Don’t you?” “He did. Didn’t he?” Lilly said. I didn’t have to look back at my sister to know she was smiling. “But I still think Papa would try to stop me from seeing him. You know how protective he can get and he might find Walter guilty just through association.” We rode the rest of the way to the castle in silence. Lilly was probably thinking of Walter’s gallantry and I was thinking of Jessie. I desperately wanted to see him. But seeing one of the Vanderlinds was always strictly by chance. Even so, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I couldn’t stop wondering what he would have said to me if we’d been allowed to dance just a little longer. And I couldn’t help but wonder what I would have said to him. I knew I was being foolish because we barely even knew each other, but if I was being honest, I already felt like I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. Lilly and I were assigned to dust the library again. It was becoming a regular Monday ritual. It seemed impossible to believe that any dust had gathered since we’d wiped down all the books a week earlier, but Mrs. Denkler was in charge. It was our job to just do as she instructed. We worked side-by-side for about an hour, both of us lost in our own thoughts. I heard the door open and my heart jumped into my throat with the hope that it was Jessie. Whipping my head around, I saw it was just Millie. “Mrs. Denkler sent me to get one of you,” she said. Lilly and I exchanged looks. “You go,” I told her. “I’ll stay with the books.” I thought there might be a better chance of seeing Jessie if I stayed in the library, rather than going to a new task. After Lilly left, I began humming to myself. I loved climbing up the ladder to the highest shelf. There were giant volumes up there that appeared to be hundreds of years old. I wondered if any of them were as old as the castle. The creak of a floorboard caught my attention. I turned my head just in time to see Jessie Vanderlind trying to duck out of the door. “Jessie,” I exclaimed, immediately trying to climb down from my perch to speak with him. I needed to know what had happened at the dance. But the heel of my shoes got caught in the hem of my dress and before I knew what was happening, I was plummeting toward the ground head first. It all happened so quickly that I didn’t even have time to shriek. I just shut my eyes and had the fleeting thought that hitting the floor was really going to hurt. And then I let out an “Oof.” It was as if I flopped very hard on a bed and all the air was knocked out of me. I hadn’t hit the ground. In fact, I felt like I was a few feet above it. I opened my eyes to see that I was in Jessie’s arms. “Are you alright,” Jessie asked, holding me like a groom holds a bride when they cross the threshold of their new home as husband and wife. “Yes,” I said with a little gasp. He acted as if I was as light as a ragdoll. “My heel got caught and the next thing I knew...” It was so wonderful being in his arms that more words escaped me. “Here, let me untangle you,” he said, gently setting me down. “Hold onto me and I’ll unhook your hem.” I wobbled a bit and had to steady myself against his broad shoulders. “There,” he said, freeing my shoe. “All better.” He straightened up, but kept a steadying hand against my side. “Are you dizzy at all? Are you hurt in any way?” “I’m fine,” I assured him. “Just a little embarrassed. I saw you standing in the doorway and...” I looked across the room to the door. It had to have been a distance of at least twenty feet. “How did you manage to catch me?” I asked. “When I saw you, you were right by the door.” “No, no,” he said with a chuckle. “You’re remembering it wrong because of the fall. I was walking toward you. I was practically under the ladder.” “But...” I shook my head, trying to clear it. His arms were still around me and that was making it hard for me to think. “I could have sworn you were by the door.” “Then how could I have crossed the room so quickly? It’s not like I can fly,” he pointed out. “I suppose,” I said, shaking my head some more. I still felt so discombobulated. “I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to you at the dance. I saw you on the lawn and I was wondering if you’d spoken to my date when you were out there.” “On the lawn?” he repeated. “No, I only spoke to him when he came over while we were dancing.” “Are you sure?” I asked. “It seemed like you were coming from the same direction where he...” I stopped short when I saw the thunder in Jessie’s eyes. They told me everything I needed to know. Jessie had confronted Lev. That much was obvious. “Did you need me for something?” I asked, taking half a step backward, but I was reluctant to relinquish his touch. “Or were you just wanting a book?” Jessie half turned away from me for a moment and then looked back into my eyes. “I guess I’ve come to tell you goodbye.” “Goodbye?” I asked. “Yes.” He looked down. “I’m leaving Tiburon. I’m afraid I won’t be back for quite some time. Possibly years.” “What?” I exclaimed. “No, you can’t.” I blinked rapidly, trying to stop tears from filling my eyes. “I’ve only just met you. And I know I’m just a maid, but...” I wanted to tell him that I thought we were meant to be together, but I couldn’t speak. “No, you’re not just the maid,” he told me. “You’re everything. I just thought that I should leave because...” And then we were kissing. I don’t even know how it happened, but suddenly his lips were pressing against mine. And it was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I felt the kiss in every cell of my body. It felt like I had been dunked in soda from a fountain. For those few seconds we were standing still and the world was spinning around us. “Oh! Excuse me,” I heard Lilly’s voice exclaim. We quickly pulled apart and I turned to see my sister standing in the doorway, her eyes out on stalks. Chapter 34 Jessie Colette felt about me the same way I felt about her. It didn’t matter that I could already fly, I felt like I was walking on air. I took the stairs back to my room two at a time. Her kiss had been the one perfect moment in my life. I felt our entire lifetime together in that one embrace. I just couldn’t believe my good fortune. I was the luckiest man alive. And then I remembered I wasn’t alive. Not by a long shot. I was a vampire, a member of the undead. And she was a mortal. That realization quickly brought my spirits crashing back to earth. How could I take Colette’s heart and give her my own when we could never be together? I closed the door to my room and then sank into despair. Being so close to Colette, having her in my arms, had made me lose my head for a moment. But what I had done was wrong. Not saving her life — I would have gladly sacrificed my own life to keep her from harm — but kissing her had been a very foolish thing to do. I cursed my misfortune of having contracted scarlet fever. If I’d only managed to avoid that dreaded disease, then I would have still been a mortal. With Grandfather gone, there was no fear of him turning Emily into a member of the undead. I would have fallen under the same protection. But no, the fates had seen to it that I would forever be seventeen, and the love of my life would keep aging. The cruel injustice of it led me to anger and I took some of my frustration out on an ottoman, completely shattering its frame in the process. There was a knock on my door and then Daniel walked into my room without waiting for me to reply. “Why are you attacking the furniture?” he asked. “What’s that ottoman ever done to you?” “I’m just…” And then I couldn’t think of what to say. “I’m just frustrated that I wasn’t able to save Grandfather.” “I see.” Daniel raised his eyebrows high on his forehead. “And you think that the ottoman had something to do with it?” Seating himself in a chair at some distance from the ottoman, he crossed his legs and then folded his hands over one knee. “No, I…” And then I stopped myself again. “What do you want, Daniel?” I asked. “It’s not like you to be up at this hour.” It was the middle of the day and my brother never usually stirred until after six. “I was having trouble sleeping,” Daniel said with a sniff of vexation, “so I thought I’d get a book from the library. And while I was standing in the doorway, I overheard the most remarkable conversation between two of the maids.” I felt my body momentarily tense, but I tried to pretend like his words had no effect on me. “Eavesdropping on the staff?” It was my turn to raise an eyebrow. “That’s not like you.” Daniel would have been happy if everyone who worked at the castle was a deaf-mute. “What’s going on?” Daniel asked, ignoring my barb. “Have you been toying with one of the servants? How very bourgeois.” “I haven’t been toying with anyone,” I informed him. “They were probably gossiping about the fact that one of the girls took a tumble off a ladder in the library. I was nearby so I managed to catch her.” Daniel narrowed his eyes. “Nearby or on the other side of the room?” “I was standing closer to her than you are to me,” I told him, keeping my voice matter-of-fact. “I don’t see what business it is of yours, anyway.” “It’s my business if you’re exposing the family to danger,” he snapped. “You can’t go dashing across the library just because some little mortal might bust her head. You could expose us all with that kind of behavior.” “I didn’t expose us to anyone,” I informed him. “She slipped and I caught her. That’s the end of the story.” Daniel was the very last person I’d want to know about my feelings for Colette. At least not until I had decided what to do. He took the demise of our grandfather as a signal that he should ascend the throne as the head of the Vanderlind family. Mother and I found it quite amusing, but he took himself rather seriously. “Just be careful,” he told me. “I think Denkie should have known better than to hire a couple of pretty housemaids, but that’s no reason to lose your head. If you’re feeling edgy, you can always go visit Arthur, and then find a brothel. I hear Columbus has a few good ones and it’s not that far.” “Alright,” I said, just to placate him. I knew continuing to protest my innocence would get me nowhere. And Daniel might even begin to suspect I was lying if I protested too much. “Next time I’ll let the mortal land on her head.” “Good,” Daniel said, getting to his feet and heading toward the door. “Better a dead girl than having the villagers pounding on the castle door. I hate when they show up with their pitchforks and torches.” Chapter 35 Colette “Have you lost your mind?” Lilly said in a loud whisper. Jessie had slipped out the door as she’d entered the room. “Maybe I have,” I told her, still feeling a bit giddy from Jessie’s kiss. “What if Mama and Papa find out?” she said in a harsh whisper. Then her eyes grew wider. “What if Mrs. Denkler finds out? She’s scary enough as it is.” “No one’s going to find out,” I said to her, picking up my feather duster from where it had fallen. “It was just a harmless kiss.” “But how did it even happen?” Lilly wanted to know. “I slipped off a ladder and he caught me,” I explained. “He had his arms wrapped around me to steady me, and then it just happened.” My sister frowned. “He took advantage of you?” “No,” I exclaimed. “He stopped me from cracking open my skull.” “But he kissed you,” she said. “Without courting you. Or meeting our parents, or anything.” “It wasn’t like that,” I tried to assure her. “It just happened. I kissed him just as much as he kissed me.” Lilly frowned some more while plucking at her feather duster. “I think I have to tell Mama and Papa.” Whirling around, I stared at her, my mouth slightly open at her contemplated betrayal. “Why?” “Because that Vanderlind boy is trying to take advantage of you. He shouldn’t have kissed you like that.” “I told you, it was mutual. And also an accident,” I hastened to add. “And it will probably never happen again, so there’s no reason to get our parents all worried. You want to keep this job. Don’t you?” Lilly thought it over. “Yes, I really do. But… I don’t want…” She couldn’t even put words to her feelings. “I still think I should tell.” “Fine,” I said, pinching my lips together. “After all I’ve done so you could see Walter.” “That’s different,” she insisted. “If you decide to tell Mama and Papa, then I can’t stop you,” I said. “But I just want you to know that if we are sharing everything with our parents, then I am going to have to tell them that you left me alone with Lev Wilson for over an hour. And during that time, he attacked me and ripped my dress.” Lilly let out an audible gasp. “You wouldn’t.” I shrugged. “Why shouldn’t I? It’s the truth.” “But…” Lilly’s eyes were round with the fear of it. “Then they would never let me see Walter again.” “I know,” I told her. “And I don’t want that to happen.” Lilly opened and closed her mouth a few times, reminding me slightly of a goldfish in a bowl. Then she closed her lips firmly and returned to dusting, not speaking to me for the rest of the day. “What’s wrong with you girls?” Mama asked over dinner. “You’ve barely spoken two words to each other since you got home.” “Nothing, as far as I know,” I said, glancing over in Lilly’s direction. My sister refused to look at me. “Nothing,” she said, shaking her head back and forth a few times. “I’m just a little tired.” She looked down to cut her meat. “And besides, we work together all day.” And then, glancing in my direction, she added, “I think we’ve said everything that needs to be said.” Lilly was still ignoring me when we climbed into bed. That was fine. I could handle her anger, just as long as she kept my secret. And I knew she would. I wasn’t exactly playing fair, but I was keeping secrets for her, so I saw no reason why she shouldn’t keep one for me. And besides, Jessie and I had only kissed. It had been unexpected, but it wasn’t something I regretted. Nor was it something I would ever regret. Jessie Vanderlind had stolen my heart without even trying. I couldn’t sleep. There were too many thoughts of Jessie running through my head. Once my sister’s breathing turned to the steady rhythm of someone asleep, I crept out of my bed and shrugged into my robe. I needed to contemplate what had passed between Jessie and me in the complete silence that existed in the middle of the night. On tiptoe, I crossed the room to look out the window. The little creatures of the night were starting to sing to each other and I loved the music they made. Looking down at the ground below our window, I nearly jumped out of my skin when I realized that someone was looking back up at me. It only took a second for me to realize it was Jessie Vanderlind. “What are you doing out here?” I whispered, as I hurried across our yard to stand next to Jessie. I hoped none of my family had heard me easing out of the back door. The screen usually squeaked. “I had to see you,” he said, stepping closer to me. “I wanted…” He paused for a moment, running his fingers through his hair. “I wanted to apologize.” He was just so breathtaking handsome with his full lips and his ruffled black hair. I took several seconds just to stare at him, drinking him in. “Apologize?” I finally managed to ask. “Yes.” Jessie nodded. “Just because you’d fallen off a ladder was no reason for…” He paused again. “It’s just… I just feel like I might have taken advantage of you. I mean, just because you’d fallen off the ladder was no reason for me to…” He gestured at me with his hand. “I’m sorry.” “Don’t apologize,” I told him, stepping a little closer. “You saved me and then we accidentally kissed. That’s no reason to apologize.” “But don’t you see?” Jessie asked, his gray eyes like two perfect gray pearls from the islands of Polynesia. “Kissing you by accident would be like accidentally finding a leprechaun's pot of gold.” I squinted at him, no sure what he meant. “I’m afraid you’ve lost me.” “I mean,” he said, stretching his hands toward me for a moment and then stuffing them in the pockets of the long, dark coat he was wearing, “I wouldn’t want our kiss to have been something you didn’t want or you weren’t expecting. Kissing you, especially for the first time, should be perfect.” My heart was hammering so wildly in my chest that I could barely breathe. “Then kiss me now,” I told him. “Kiss me here under this apple tree. Let this be our first kiss.” It was such a brazen thing to say that I couldn’t even believe the words had come out of my mouth, but he didn’t seem put off by my request. “Are you sure?” Jessie asked, taking a half-step forward. “About the kiss. Because I know if I kiss you again, I would never want to…” And then we melted into each other’s arms, our lips pressing together with such passion that it felt like tiny fireworks were exploding in my chest. “Ever let you go,” Jessie whispered, once we paused for breath. “What’s that?” I asked, my head spinning from being so close to him. His breath smelled slightly of warm pennies. “I was just worried about kissing you,” he whispered into my hair. “I knew that if we were to kiss, I would never want to let you go.” “Then don’t,” I told him. “I’m happy to stay here forever.” He squeezed me tightly for another moment and then I felt him stiffen a little, as if gathering his resolve. “There’s something I have to tell you,” he said in a very controlled voice. “There’s something I have to confess before this goes any further.” “What is it?” I asked, hesitantly. He suddenly sounded so serious that it made me a little afraid. Jessie closed his eyes for a moment and released a deep sigh. “It’s about my family.” “Oh.” I thought of the rumors I’d heard about the Vanderlinds from Mrs. Denkler and the other snatches of gossip. The Vanderlinds all suffered from some type of rare illness. Something hereditary, I had to imagine. Jessie probably felt that he should be honest about his situation before we became too involved. “Don’t tell me,” I said, snuggling deeper into his arms. “I don’t want to know. Not yet.” “But…” he started to say. “Jessie, please don’t,” I insisted, cupping his face with my hands and looking into his fathomless gray eyes. “This moment is so perfect. And I feel about you in a way that I never imagined I could feel about anyone. Let’s pretend that the rest of the world doesn’t exist. At least for right now. Let’s just make this moment about the two us.” And then he kissed me again. Chapter 36 Jessie I felt like a foolish Romeo, standing underneath Colette’s window, but there was no place else in the world I wanted to be. I’d always had my suspicions about Romeo. He was, after all, already infatuated with a girl named Rosaline before sneaking into the ball and first seeing Juliet. Who was to say that, if their families hadn’t been sworn enemies and he’d actually been allowed to woo Juliet, that he wouldn’t have grown bored of her in a couple of months and fallen in love with yet another girl? But I didn’t feel that way about Miss Gibson. I knew I was about the same age as Romeo was in the play, but my love for Colette felt timeless. I knew I could never tire of her, not even in a hundred years. I sighed, feeling the irony of it. I would live to see a hundred years. And probably a hundred more after that, if I didn’t grow despondent under the weight of my own immortality and find some way to end it. Death by an angry mob was a popular way for the undead to give up on living. Of course I would probably have to travel to Romania to accomplish such a grisly task with any ease. The Romanians were always ready to put some world weary vampire to the stake. But then I caught a glimpse of Colette in the window of her house and it felt like my dead heart was beating in my chest. Just the sight of her filled me with life. I had to fight the urge to fly up the side of the house and speak to her through the glass. A few moments later and she was there by my side, her volumes of hair cascading around her shoulders. I had been yearning for her so much that my feelings were almost tangible. And there she was, right in front of me. It was exquisite torture not to sweep her up in my arms. I had meant to apologize for my behavior in the library. It had been ungentlemanly and I very much wanted Colette Gibson to think well of me. I meant to simply apologize, but somehow we ended up kissing again. It was our first kiss, our first real kiss, and there was a dream-like quality to it. The apple tree shading us from the light of the moon was in full leaf and the small animals and insects that came out in warm weather started to sing. It was then that I knew I couldn’t give Colette up. Not ever. Her soul fit with mine like two locking puzzle pieces that, once united, could never be pulled apart. But I also wanted to protect her from the curse that was my family. I needed to tell her exactly who I was, and what I was, so that she would understand the gravity of her decision to be with me. But when I tried to confess to the abomination that was my family, Colette silenced me. She didn’t want to cloud the skies of our new love with talk of anyone or anything but us. And I was too in love to insist. I should have stood strong and explained the evil that Grandfather had inflicted upon us, but instead we kissed again and everything in the world felt perfect. As we pulled apart in order for her to breathe, we both caught a glimpse of a shooting star streaking across the sky. “Do people wish on shooting stars here in America?” I asked, unwilling to turn my head to take in the full astronomical display. I preferred gazing into her green eyes. “Yes,” she said with a small nod, not looking away either. “But I feel like all of my wishes have already come true.” Chapter 37 Colette “I have a bit of good news to share,” Papa said, beaming at all of us as we sat around the dinner table the following evening. “What is it?” Mama asked, taking off her oven mitts after setting down the pot roast. “Well, the W.P.A. has decided that Tiburon needs a proper town hall. And guess who they’ve hired to run the construction?” “Oh!” Mama exclaimed, gasping. “That’s wonderful.” She hurried around the table to wrap her arms around Papa. I was thrilled. All of us were. But it was also a little confusing. “Shouldn’t they focus on rebuilding the school first?” I asked. Papa shook his head, even though he was still smiling. “I know. It doesn’t make much sense. Does it? But I guess the government already had the plans in place for the town hall before the school burnt down.” “But when are they rebuilding the school?” Lilly wanted to know. “It’s in the process of getting funded,” Papa told her. “And hopefully I get that project, too. But for now we should just be grateful that I’m steadily employed again.” He looked at Lilly and me. “There should be enough money for awhile,” he said. “If you girls want to leave your positions at the castle; it wouldn’t be a problem.” “No,” I exclaimed, the word bursting out of my mouth. I didn’t care if we had all the money in the world; I couldn’t stop working at the castle. I couldn’t forgo the chance of seeing Jessie every day, even if the chance was always slim. Surprised by my exuberance, everyone turned to look at me. “I mean, it would be silly to give up such good paying jobs,” I explained. “We should save the money in case things get lean again.” Papa reached over and petted my head. “That’s my bright girl.” The next several weeks drifted past in a pink haze of happiness. In the mornings I would ride out to an obliging field and gather an armload of wildflowers for Arthur. Then Lilly would catch up to me and we would head to the castle together to start our day of dusting and polishing. If it was a lucky day, then Jessie would find some way to see me. Lilly would be called away to help Millie and I’d be left on my own. Or Emily would come to ask for my help with some small task. Once the girl had led me to some secluded room, she would disappear, leaving her brother in her place. Our meetings in the castle were brief. There was only time for a few stolen kisses. But I knew that Jessie would come to see me at night, after my family had fallen asleep. That was when we had our real time together. Each night when we met, Jessie would try to tell me of the horrible curse that plagued his family. And each night I would stop him with a kiss. I didn’t want to tarnish the love I felt for him. His family could have been a pack of snarling wolves and I wouldn’t have cared. Jessie was beautiful and wonderful and kind. I didn’t believe in guilt by association and I knew I would love Jessie Vanderlind, no matter the dark secret his family was hiding. “Why don’t you speak with an accent?” I asked him one evening as we took a turn around the yard. “Don’t I speak with an American accent?” he said with some surprise. “You know what I mean,” I said, nudging his arm. “You’re from Hungary. Aren’t you? But you sound like you were born right here, in Tiburon.” “My grandfather didn’t believe in accents,” he said. I couldn’t let him get away with telling me so little. “What’s that supposed to mean?” “It means that my grandfather was very strict. He felt that if you were going to learn a language, then you should be able to speak it flawlessly.” “How many languages do you speak?” I wanted to know. He gave a shrug of modesty. “Only three or four.” “Three or four?” I couldn’t help but exclaim. “You speak English and Hungarian. What other languages do you speak?” “French,” he told me. “And some German, but I could hardly pass for a native.” “Say something in Hungarian,” I requested. He gave me a puzzled look. “Why?” “Because this all sounds too preposterous and I’m not half sure that I should believe you.” He turned to look deeply into my eyes. “Szeretlek,” he said in a whisper. I didn’t understand him, but I had my suspicions because of the way he looked at me. “Okay, now say the same thing in French,” I told him. “Je t’aime,” was his reply, a small smile flitting across his lips. I kept going. “And German?” “Ich liebe dich,” he said, gazing steadily into my eyes. “And what does it mean in English?” I had to ask. Jessie pulled me into his arms. “I think you already know,” he said in a husky voice. And then he kissed me, his lips telling me how he felt without any words. My sister hadn’t spoken of Jessie since she stumbled upon our kiss, and I kept all thoughts of him to myself. Normally we shared all our foolish secrets, like sisters who are close tend to do. But when it came to Jessie, things felt different. First of all, I knew Lilly didn’t approve. After all, the maid falling in love with the tortured heir to the castle falling did sound like something out of a gothic novel. Even I had to admit that. But I didn’t care. I knew what I felt for Jessie was real. And I knew deep in my heart that he felt the same way about me. One morning I woke up and I was seventeen. I found it singular that I didn’t look any different when I washed my face in the morning and peered into the bathroom mirror. But things were different. They were very different. Because I knew that just down the Tiburon River, a few miles away, was a Justice of the Peace who would perform wedding ceremonies without parental consent, as long as both parties were older than seventeen. I had reached an age where I could say, “I do,” to Jessie, if he ever proposed. My whole family greeted me when I came down the stairs. “Happy Birthday,” Mama said, squeezing me tightly. Then she pulled Lilly into the hug. “My two, seventeen-year-old girls.” “Not for long,” Lilly joked. For almost two months out of the year, my sister and I were the same age. My family referred to it as our twin months and we’d always loved this special time when we little girls. “Well, then I’ll have to enjoy it while I can,” our mother said, hugging us both again. “I’m tired of your silly nonsense with these flowers,” Mrs. Denkler snapped at me as I filled a vase with the wildflower bouquet I’d gathered on the way to work. “Oh,” I said, not quite sure why she was annoyed. “You mean you don’t think they cheer Arthur up? I’m sure he must get depressed, never being able to leave his room.” Mrs. Denkler was about to say something, but then stopped herself. She left out the sharp sigh of someone who feels they have extended a great deal of patients and their efforts have gone unappreciated. “Just take the flowers up yourself today and set them outside Arthur’s door,” she instructed me. “It’s the one with the bird carving over it. The nurse will take them in. Just make sure you mind your own business and leave that poor boy alone. If I find out that you’ve so much as stuck your nose in the door, you will be dismissed on the spot.” I did as I was told, trotting up the grand staircase that led to the second floor. I hadn’t been allowed up the stairs and only knew that part of the castle from what could be gleaned from down below. The hallways were massive. I wouldn’t have been surprised if it were possible to drive a car down some of them. There was an ornately carved piece of wood over each door. I took several moments to stare at the carving of a wolf’s head suspended above a door. Its eyes seemed to follow me. I found the door for Arthur’s room easily enough. There was a carving of a peacock with its tail feathers spread into a fan. The bird was beautiful, but also somehow menacing. That paired up well with my memory of how a peacock looked from our family trip to the Cleveland Zoo. I stood outside the closed door for a moment, the vase of flowers still clutched in my hands, cocking my head to one side to listen. I felt so very bad for Arthur. None of the family got out much, as far as I could tell. Emily seemed perfectly healthy. And Jessie left the castle more than the others, but that seemed to be only after the sun went down. What was the illness that kept them all so isolated and cooped up in their home? I’d tried to do researched at the library, but came up with next to nothing. The only thing I could discover was that albinos had some sensitivity to light. Most of the Vanderlinds had very pale skin, but their hair wasn’t the white of an albino and they all had very gray eyes. As I set the vase down outside the closed door, I had to wonder about Arthur’s malady. If Jessie and I had a child, would he or she suffer the same fate? That wouldn’t prevent me from accepting a proposal from Jessie, but it would make me consider adoption instead of bearing my own children. I did rather desperately want to have Jessie’s child, but I also knew that there were many parentless children out in the world who deserved a loving home. I had an anxious day. I kept expecting to see Jessie at every turn, but he never appeared. I didn’t even see Emily, which came as a surprise. She was a lonely little girl and frequently sought Lilly and my company. She was so lucky to have escaped her family’s curse, whatever it was, but it seemed to have isolated her in an unexpected way. Chapter 38 Jessie “So you’re not fiddling with the maid,” Daniel said with a scoff as he sauntered into the library where I sat in a club chair, reading some of Sir Walter Scott’s poetry. “I can’t believe I was fool enough to have believed you.” “What are you talking about?” I asked, glancing up at him from over my book and doing my best not to be baited by my brother. I had been courting Colette for several weeks and I was always careful to ensure that my family knew as little as possible about my activities. Everyone but Emily, of course. She was my secret go-between and she thoroughly approved of where I had given my heart. “I followed you the other night,” he told me, perching himself on the arm of a chair. “I knew you’d been sneaking out of the house, so I followed you. And guess where you went?” I gave him a cool look, closing my book in the process. “Why don’t you tell me?” “You know damn well where you went.” he said. “You flew directly over to that little tramp’s house. I saw you with your arms around each other.” My temper ignited immediately when my brother referred to Colette as a tramp. She was nothing of the sort and I instantly felt compelled to defend her honor. But I knew that was what Daniel was expecting. “What’s it to you?” I asked, keeping my voice in check. “If you’re feeling the urge to dip your wick, then find some foolish young thing who doesn’t know where you live,” he told me. “Not one that works under the very roof of our home.” I wanted to strike him. I could feel the urge down to my fingertips. But what purpose would that serve? That would only convince Daniel that he was justified in his outrage. “You’re right,” I said, coolly. “She was a foolish choice.” Daniel was about to argue with me, but then he processed my words. “So you’ll end things with her?” I nodded a few times. “I shall give it some thought. It’s a matter that would have to be handled with some delicacy.” My brother gave me a flat look. “Just make sure that it’s handled,” he said. “Or I’ll be forced to discuss this with…” and there he paused. I knew he had meant to say Grandfather, but that was no longer an option. “Mother,” I supplied for him. “You’ll be forced to discuss this with our mother.” “I’m sure she’ll be thrilled,” he said, his voice at its most droll. I somehow doubted Mother would have the same reaction as her eldest son, but I said nothing. It was better for Daniel to think he had won. “If you feel the need to share this information with her, then let’s do it now,” I said, making a show of rising from my chair. “We might as well get this all out in the open.” “Forget it,” he said, getting to his feet and preparing to stalk out of the room. “I don’t want to worry her with such pointless trivia. Just make sure you end things with that foolish, little mortal. You should go to New York and find yourself a proper vampiress to love, if you’re feeling the need for a romantic liaison.” “That’s good advice,” I told him. “It’s something I’ll keep in mind.” Daniel left, feeling satisfied that he had the upper hand. But nothing he could do or say would ever change the way I felt about Colette. Our very souls were drawn to each other. There was nothing that could drive us apart, even with our apparently insurmountable differences. Some things were meant to be.” But Daniel’s actions did cause me concern. I didn’t want Colette to be exposed to the dangers of the vampire world. She didn’t want to hear about my family’s curse, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t arm her in some other way. I immediately flew to Main Street in Tiburon and gazed through the window of Houghton’s, the local jewelry shop. One side of the window displayed gold jewelry and the other half showed the silver items for sale. I spied a sterling silver locket in the shape of a heart. It was perfect for my plans. Pulling a pen, paper and an envelope from my pocket, I penned a quick note to the store owner, asking him to please have the locket delivered to the Vanderlind Castle the following day. With the letter, I included several bills. I knew it was probably more than the small silver trinket cost, but I preferred to pay too much rather than too little. After that I headed for home. My purchase was just a small gesture, but hopefully something that would go a few steps toward keeping my darling girl safe. Colette Gibson meant the world to me. My brother was probably right, as far as what was the reasonable thing to do, but he didn’t understand how I felt in my heart. And I doubted explaining it to him would make much of a difference. By the time I got up the next afternoon, the package had already arrived. I opened it to view the pendant up close, being careful not to actually touch the silver as I flipped open the clamshell box. It was a pretty puffed heart with the silver polished to a shine, yet also understated enough not to draw too much attention. I thought it would be perfect as a present for Colette. I would have gladly given her a diamond the size of a robin’s egg, but we were being clandestine with our love and a showy piece of jewelry might give things away. I tried to arrange to see Colette during the day while she was working, but luck was not on my side. Daniel was awake and skulking around the house. He didn’t bother saying anything to me, nor did he appear to be all that interested in keeping an eye on Miss Gibson, but his presence held me in check from speaking to her. That night I took extra care as I was leaving the castle. At first I flew toward the woods, until I was certain Daniel wasn’t following me. I waited a good hour longer than I normally did before heading to Colette’s house. There was always a strong chance my brother was waiting for me there. But I knew Daniel to be an impatient man. I was convinced that after sitting in wait for thirty minutes, he would give up and look for something else to do. The only problem was that I had no way of contacting Colette to explain my delay. I hoped her feelings wouldn’t be too hurt. I surveyed the area before alighting in the Gibson’s back yard. I was always reasonably cautious about such things, — it was never a good idea to be sighted by a mortal farmer with insomnia — but with Daniel’s suspicions aroused, I had to be even more cautious. I knew my brother meant to force my hand. Little did he realize in which direction I would pull. I had no intention of giving Colette up under any circumstances. Reassured that there were no other vampires about, I strode over to our apple tree, only to have Colette appear out of the shadows. “I didn’t think you were coming,” she said. “I’m sorry, darling,” I told her, immediately taking her in my arms. “My brother suspects there is something between us and…” “And you didn’t want to admit to caring for someone like me,” she said, attempting to finish my sentence for me. “No, that’s not it at all,” I insisted, pulling her even closer. “I would rather give him up than you. But he can cause trouble for us,” I had to admit. “So I waited until I was sure he wasn’t following me.” “How could he cause trouble for us?” she asked. “And why?” I scrunched my face and tried to think of a good way to explain it. “Daniel’s… very traditional,” was all I could think to say. “He’s very inflexible about the Vanderlind name and all that rot. I’m sure he would cause a stink if he thought we had any serious intentions in mind. But my brother is also kind of an idiot, so I rarely pay any attention to him,” I assured her. “So your family wouldn’t approve of me?” she asked, her eyes glistening with potential tears. “My mother would,” I told her. Colette sniffed. “How do you know?” “Because, above everything else, my mother wants her children to be happy.” I placed a tender kiss on her lips. “And you make me happier than I ever imagined I could be.” Colette leaned into me and sighed, contentedly. “I know exactly how you feel.” “I have something for you,” I said, reaching into the breast pocket of my coat for the small, velvet box. “What?” she asked, lifting her head, her eyes wide with surprise. “I have a present for you,” I told her, placing the box in both of her hands. “Open it.” “Oh, Jessie,” she exclaimed as she flipped open the lid. “Oh, it’s so beautiful. I love it.” Colette’s already beautiful face blossomed into a radiant smile. “How did you know?” she asked. “Emily told me,” I said, for lack of a better answer. I had unwittingly done something that had made her very happy and I didn’t want that happiness to fade one ounce, so I concealed my ignorance. “Emily,” she said, giving a small frown. “I don’t think I told her it was my birthday.” It was Colette’s birthday! I took a moment to thank my lucky stars that I had a gift for her. “You’ll have to forgive me, darling, but how old are you today?” “Seventeen,” she said, rather shyly. “Seventeen,” I repeated. Colette and I were the same age. But she would one day turn eighteen and I would never see another birthday. “Does turning seventeen hold any particular significance here in the United States?” I asked. “What do you mean?” Colette wanted to know. “I mean like how in countries where the predominant religion is Judaism, turning thirteen is held in high regard.” “Not really,” she said. And then, putting her hand to her cheek, she added, “Except for maybe one thing.” “What’s that?” I asked. And then Colette explained about a neighboring Justice of the Peace who was very accommodating about granting marriage licenses without a young lady’s parents giving consent, just as long as the girl was seventeen. This was very good news, indeed. I stared at her for a few seconds, torn between prudence and dropping to one knee and proposing right there, on the spot. If I had still been a mortal, then I would have done the latter. But the fact that Colette didn’t know that I was a member of the undead kept me from my matrimonial impulse. “Help me put this on,” Colette said, pulling the pendant from its box. I think she was concealing a blush. “Ah,” I said. I hadn’t anticipated she would ask for my assistance. “I’m afraid I’m a bit clumsy with delicate clasps.” “Oh, please try,” she told me. “I want to wear it right away.” Steeling myself against the pain, I took hold of the silver and attempted to fasten the pendant around her neck. The metal immediately began burning my skin instantly. It was like I was pinching a glowing hot poker between my fingers. I tried not to utter any acknowledgement of pain. I thought surely I could endure the agony long enough to secure a simple clasp. But I had never previously encountered silver as a member of the undead. The pain was excruciating. My hands started to tremble with the effort. “I can’t do it, I’m afraid,” I told her, releasing the chain. “Here, let me try,” she said, taking over. A moment later and the pendant was fastened around her slender neck. “There.” She turned toward me. “What do you think?”",

      "content": "“It looks lovely on you,” I told her. The happiness she exuded quickly made me forget about the pain coursing through my hands. Colette reached up and caressed the heart. “I’ve never loved a gift more,” she told me. “I’m so glad,” was my reply. “You must promise me to always wear it. Especially at night,” I added. “Promise that you’ll never take it off.” “I’ll never take it off,” she assured me, pressing the pendant to her own heart. “But why especially at night?” she asked. “Oh.” I hadn’t even realized I’d urged her to do so. “I...” I stammered, scrambling for any plausible excuse. “I just worry about you, sometimes. You and your sister riding your bicycles home after the sun has gone down. I just feel like if you wear this pendant, then it will be like a good-luck token.” Colette bestowed me with another one of her lovely smiles. “I promise I’ll wear it always,” she said putting her arms around my neck to kiss me. It was challenging to kiss her with the silver being so close to my skin. The memory of the pain that had shot through my hands was still at the forefront of my brain. But none of that mattered if the little trinket kept my darling girl safe from harm. I would have walked out into the noon day sun for her. Something caught my attention and I quickly scanned the skies. It wasn’t so much a noise that had reached my ears, but more like a silence. It was the silence of a bird taking wing. Or a vampire rising into the sky. Chapter 39 Colette The next morning, I couldn’t have been happier as I gathered blossoms for Jessie’s sick brother. The vivid wildflowers of summer had been replaced by the hardy sunflowers and Queen Ann’s lace of fall. The pendant hanging around my neck sent little shivers of happiness up my spine every time it brushed against my skin. The chain was long enough that I could tuck the pendant under the bodice of my dress and it wasn’t too visible with the heart nestling between my breasts. With the sun warming my face, I closed my eyes and thought of Jessie. His kisses filled me with an anticipation that I found challenging to suppress. I so desperately wanted to be with him in every way. I wanted to lie in bed with him, our bodies pressed together, smelling his warm-penny breath. I wanted to know what it was to be a woman and how it felt to be with him as my man. A little shiver of desire crept up my spine. Was seventeen too young to get married, if you knew you were truly in love? “How many flowers does one sick boy need?” Lilly called out as she coasted her bicycle to a stop. I opened my eyes and looked down, releasing a small laugh. I’d been enjoying the humming of the bees, and the grasses gently tugging at my skirt, so much that I hadn’t realized the enormous size of the bouquet I was holding. “What’s that?” Lilly asked as I was putting the flowers in my bicycle’s basket. She reached forward, touching the silver heart dangling from my neck and making it sway. “Oh.” I took half a step backward and covered the pendent with my hand. I guess it had slipped out of the top of my dress when I was bending over to pluck the flowers. “It’s…” I stammered. “Where’d you get it?” Lilly wanted to know. I had no explanation for her. All I could do was stare at her, wide-eyed. My sister’s face grew hard. “Did he give it to you?” I nodded my head. “For my birthday.” “I thought that was over,” Lilly said in a tight voice as she remounted her bicycle. “No,” I told her, also climbing on mine. “It’s definitely not over.” “I hope he hasn’t taken advantage of you,” Lilly said. “That’s usually what happens when the rich boy starts sniffing around the maid.” “It’s nothing like that,” I exclaimed. “You sound like Mama.” Lilly shrugged. “She’s right about a lot of things.” “She wasn’t right about Lev Wilson,” I pointed out as I pushed down on a pedal to get my bike rolling. “She still thinks he’s a nice boy.” “Just be careful,” my sister said, following me. “He’s always been a gentleman,” I insisted, not wanting to say his name out loud for some reason. “That’s not what I’m talking about,” Lilly told me. “At least not completely.” “What, then?” I asked over my shoulder. “I don’t know.” She rode for a few moments in silence. “There’s just something so very peculiar about the Vanderlind family. I don’t like their eyes.” “What about their eyes?” I asked. I loved gazing into Jessie’s eyes. “Their eyes all are the same color,” Lilly said. “Gray. And they’re all so cold... Sometimes it makes me think they’re dead inside, the blank grayness of their eyes.” Lilly was being ridiculous. Jessie was so loving and passionate and wonderful. He couldn’t have been more alive. “Don’t pester me with those,” Mrs. Denkler said when she saw the enormous bouquet I had gathered. “Just take them upstairs. And don’t bother Arthur.” At that point I had taken the flowers up to Arthur’s room numerous times, but the housekeeper always felt the need to warn me that the Vanderlind invalid needed to be left alone. Lilly was right, I thought as I arranged the blossoms in a vase. I had gone a little overboard with my flower gathering that morning. I needed a much larger vase than usual and I could barely see around it at I tottered up the stairs. At the top of the steps, as I peered through the flowers as thick as shrubbery, I thought I saw a figure slipping out of Arthur’s room. Moving my head to one side of the arrangement, I had a clearer view, but I was only able to catch a glimpse of Daniel heading around a corner at the end of the hall. I thought maybe he glanced back at me, but then again, maybe he didn’t. I made my way over to Arthur’s door and set the overfilled vase on the ground. As I pulled my arms away from the arrangement, the flowers expanded and pushed the door to the room open several inches. I froze, not sure what to do. The door was always firmly shut and Mrs. Denkler had warned us in no uncertain terms that we were to never bother Arthur under any circumstances. Did I close the door or leave it open? It was hard to know which was best. After giving it some quick thought, I decided I would just ease the door closed as quietly as possible. The family wanted Arthur to have privacy, after all. I meant to just gently tug the door shut and go back downstairs, but I couldn’t help glancing inside as I reached for the knob. And then I pulled up short. The room appeared to be empty. I guess I had been expecting a large hospital bed and a young man propped up on a pile of pillows, with a nurse tending to him, and some tubes coming out of his arm. But there was no bed, no nurse, not even a young man. At least there wasn’t a young man that I could see. The portion of the room that I could view through the crack in the door was bereft of any furniture. I felt something cold run through me. Glancing up, I double-checked that I was standing in front of the correct door, the one with the bird over it. What was going on? I felt the urge to open the door the entirely, but I also felt like I should just pretend that nothing happened and hurry back down the stairs. Indecision kept me glued to the floor, right at the threshold of the room, for several seconds. I thought about Jessie and how he had tried numerous times to confess his family’s sins to me, but I wouldn’t let him. Then, although my curiosity was killing me, I took hold of the doorknob and eased the door shut. “Is it what you were expecting?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She was standing right behind me and I was barely able to suppress a shriek. “I wasn’t expecting anything,” I told her, backing away from the door a few steps. “When I put the vase down, some of the flowers popped the door open, so I thought I should pull it shut.” Mrs. Denkler frowned. “Don’t lie to me, young lady. I saw you leaving the room. You had yourself a right good snoop.” “I didn’t,” I insisted. “I promise. All I did was stand here for a moment and then try to close the door.” The housekeeper looked like she was on the verge of believing me, when her eyes alighted on my neck. “What’s this?” she demanded, snatching at the pendant that Jessie had given me. “Didn’t I make myself perfectly clear on your first day that you are to wear no personal adornments whatsoever?” “I’m sorry, Mrs. Denkler,” I blurted. “I do remember you telling us, but…” “And silver, nonetheless,” she said, yanking at the chain and causing my head to jerk forward. “What in the world were you thinking?” “I’m sorry,” I said again. “It’s just…” She pulled at the chain another time. “Why on God’s green earth would you wear this?” she demanded. “I have to wear it,” I told her, trying to pry her hand open as she clutched at the locket. “I was told to wear it. Now let go or the clasp is going to break.” “Told to wear it?” she all but shouted. “And who, pray tell, told you to wear it?” “Jessie Vanderlind.” The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. Mrs. Denkler stopped yanking on the pendant, but she did not let go. “Jessie Vanderlind?” she repeated, her eyes wide as if she was having trouble understanding the words. Then she focused on me and gave a sneer of a smile. “Well,” she said, slowly. “Haven’t you been up to all kinds of little tricks? And right under my nose. I should have known better than to hire the likes of you.” The old lady laughed. “And here I thought you were just some good little girl. Oh, so very nice, always gathering flowers for a sick boy.” She jerked on the chain again and I clutched at her hand to stop her from breaking it. “Little did I realize you were just doing it to suck-up. How dare you even think you had a chance of winning the heart of someone like Jessie Vanderlind?” Angry tears filled my eyes. “Why shouldn’t I? He’s good and he’s kind. He loves me and I love him.” “Love?” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed with a rueful laugh. “You are such a little fool.” She looked my face over, closely. “You have no idea what’s going on. Do you? He hasn’t told you a thing.” No, Jessie hadn’t told me he loved me. Not in so many words. Or at least not in a language that I understood. But I knew it in my heart every time he looked at me. I felt it every time we kissed. “He does love me,” I insisted, practically clawing at her hand, but the old woman had a grip like a vice. This elicited more laughter from Mrs. Denkler. “You are such a fool. Someone like Jessie doesn’t know how to love.” She gave me a shake. “That part of him died when he was made.” “No,” I insisted, trying to push her off of me. Her words made no sense. “He loves me. I know he does. And I love him. I love Jessie Vanderlind.” “You have no idea what it takes to love a member of this family,” Mrs. Denkler hissed. “You don’t even know who the Vanderlinds really are. If he loves you so much, then why hasn’t he told you the truth about his family?” “He’s tried,” I insisted. “He’s tried dozens of times, but I wouldn’t let him.” She froze for a moment, her eyes looking quite wild. “I believe you,” she said. “But that makes things worse. Just wait until I tell his grandfather.” “His grandfather is dead,” I whimpered. “Mr. Vanderlind is dead.” “He will never be dead!” Mrs. Denkler shouted. “Do you hear me?” she demanded, giving me another good shake. “A man like that can never die!” “Stop it,” I cried, thrashing against her might, as well as her words. “Leave me alone,” I wailed, using all my strength to wrench myself free. But she yanked me back in the other direction. The clasp of the pendant finally snapping under the strain. I ended up falling forward and crashing through the door to Arthur’s room. I lay there, groaning for a moment. The castle’s floor was hard stone and the wind had been knocked out of me. My elbow throbbed and I let out a sharp whimper when I tried to push myself up. Through a blur of pain, I took in the room. It was, as I’d gleaned through the crack in the door, almost completely devoid of furniture. At the far end of the room there was some type of appliance. It looked like a large icebox, or some kind of new, fancy refrigerator. There was also a small sideboard laid out with rows of clean goblets on one side and dirty on the other. The dirty glasses were coated with the remnants of something that was red and looked sticky. A few flies circled lazily around the soiled crystal. The flowers I had gathered yesterday had been placed to the left of the sideboard, out of the way. “Where’s Arthur?” I asked, cradling my injured arm. Mrs. Denkler just stood there, looking down at me, clutching Jessie’s pendent in her fist. “There is no Arthur,” she told me. “Now get up.” Reaching down, she grabbed me by the shoulders and hauled me to my feet. “I don’t understand,” I said, feeling tearful again. “What happened to him?” “Nothing happened to him,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “You are such a stupid child. Isn’t it obvious?” “No.” I shook my head, covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to look at the room. I didn’t want to see the soiled goblets, all sticky and red. The housekeeper drew a sharp breath, her hands at her sides, balled into such tight fists that her knuckles were white. And then she sighed, her hands releasing, Jessie’s gift slipped through her fingers and onto the floor. “Arthur was sent to New York last week,” she said, her voice becoming much softer. I could tell she was trying to be reassuring. “There’s a clinic there. They think they might have a cure.” “But where are all of his things?” I asked, glancing around at the empty room. “He took everything with him,” she informed me. “He might be there for awhile.” “But…” I couldn’t stop shaking. “Why are you still taking blood donations if Arthur’s not here?” I forced myself not to glance in the direction of the large refrigerator at the far end of the room. “I’ve seen people lining up outside the clinic door, just like usual.” “It’s because…” Mrs. Denkler smoothed her hands over her skirt and I could tell she was casting about for an explanation. “It’s because so many people in the town have come to depend on earning a few extra dollars from donating blood.” She folded her hands in front of her and looked me in the eye. “The family didn’t want to take that money away from people in need. So all the blood is going to local hospitals.” She nodded her head, indicating the back of the castle. “You’ve seen the ambulances drive up and haul the blood away.” “Oh... “I forced myself to stop trembling. “Yes. I hadn’t thought of that. It’s very good of the Vanderlinds to provide such a service.” I forced myself not to think about the soiled goblets on the sideboard. I knew no good would come from asking their purpose. “Yes, they are a great family,” Mrs. Denkler said with conviction. “I’ve never met finer.” “I’m sorry for causing trouble,” I said, trying to stand up straight, but still feeling the need to clutch my elbow; it throbbed with a deep ache. I had to wonder if it was broken. “It’s just when I set the flowers down, the door popped open. That’s all.” “I understand,” Mrs. Denkler said in a voice that was almost kind. “It’s usually locked. I guess someone was careless and left it open.” She stepped forward and touched me on the shoulder. “You’ve had a rough day and I think you should go home now. I’ll have one of the chauffeurs take you home in the car.” “But what about my sister?” I asked, almost afraid to leave Lilly there without me. “And my bicycle?” “I’ll request one of the larger cars,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “There will be ample room to put your bicycle in the back. As for your sister, I’ll tell her you weren’t feeling well so I sent you home.” “Thank you,” I said in a choked whisper, staring hard at the floor. I wanted to ask to take Jessie’s gift with me, but she was staring at me too intently. “I need you to think very closely about what you’ve seen here today,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I need you to think about your relationship with Jessie Vanderlind. I understand that he’s a very handsome young man and I’m sure he can be charming when he chooses, but I hope you also understand that pursuing such a relationship might not be such a healthy choice for a young girl like you.” She reached out and squeezed my shoulder again, this time in a much firmer grip. “You might want to consider seeking other employment, if working here at the castle makes you uncomfortable.” The strength of her grip increased, making me squirm under its pressure. “But mind me when I tell you not to discuss what you’ve seen here,” she said. “About Arthur. The good people of Tiburon don’t need to know anything more about him. If the blood donations were to stop, then that could make things very unpleasant for a great many people.” Chapter 40 Jessie Mother, Emily and I were sitting in the dining hall, enjoying our evening repast when Daniel stalked in. We were used to him being moody and entitled, so his attitude was no surprise, but his presence seemed to fill the very air with disapproval. “Is there something you want to share with us?” Mother asked. “Am I to guess that there is something going on?” Knowing Mother, she just wanted to get on with whatever criticism Daniel was about to rain down on us. “Why don’t you ask him what’s going on?” Daniel said, thrusting his chin in my direction. “It’s called diner,” I said, lifting my goblet for his benefit. “Maybe you should have some. It might make you feel better.” Emily was seated next to mother, enjoying a meal of roasted pork and mashed sweet potatoes. I hated when Daniel had one of his little temper tantrums in front of her. She was at an impressionable age and I didn’t want her to think that she had to tolerate such poor behavior from a man. She kept her head bent to her meal, but I knew she was observing our exchange through her lashes. “It case you haven’t noticed,” Daniel said, continuing to address our mother, “your second son has been diddling with one of the housemaids.” If this came as a surprise to Mother, she did not react as if it was. She simply regarded Daniel with a calm expression on her face. “And you feel that Jessie’s activities somehow affect you?” “It could have damning repercussions for all of us,” he exclaimed. “I don’t see why he couldn’t just go to a cat house if he wants some pretty little mortal to toy with.” “He’s not toying with her,” Emily said, straightening up from her meal. “He’s in love with her.” She looked over at me, her eyes glowing. “And she is completely in love with him.” “That’s completely preposterous,” Daniel practically shouted. “No Vanderlind would soil himself by falling in love with a mortal girl.” Mother turned to look at me, her eyes filled with curiosity, but also encouragement. “Is this true, Jessie? Have you fallen in love with a mortal?” “Yes,” I said, addressing my mother, but steadfastly staring at my brother. “I am in love with Colette Gibson. She is a mortal young woman who works as a maid in this house.” “I knew it,” Daniel all but howled. “I knew you were too soft-hearted. You’ll bring shame to us all. You disgust me.” “Daniel, that’s hardly called for,” our mother chastised him. “And besides, falling in love is the best sort of news. It’s a reason to celebrate.” “Your son admits to being in love with a mortal and you think that’s good news?” Daniel was aghast. “Excuse me, but I really don’t want to be staked in my coffin because of his foolishness. God only knows how much he’s told her about our family.” “I haven’t told her anything,” I said, rising so quickly from my chair that it tipped over. “I’ve actually wanted to tell her. I thought I owed her the truth. But she refused to hear it. She said that she wanted to get to know me and not have her feelings influenced by any dark secrets the Vanderlinds might be concealing.” “She’s obviously just a little gold digger,” Daniel insisted. “She shows you the shapeliness of her ankle and suddenly you fancy yourself in love.” I wanted to fly across the room and smash my brother in the face. But I also knew that he probably wanted me to lose my temper and I wasn’t going to play his game. “I am in love,” I told him. “I know that’s an emotion you don’t easily understand, but just because you’ve never felt love doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.” “At least I know better than to fall in love with some little trollop who probably only sees you as a meal ticket.” He rubbed his chin. “Or maybe that’s how you see her? Were you waiting for someone pure so you could slake both your lust and your appetite?” “Boys!” Mother thundered, slapping her palm down loudly on the table. “That is enough.” She turned to my brother. “Daniel, you are acting beyond ill-bred. Didn’t I raise you to have better manners than this?” “Yes, Mother,” Daniel said, immediately cowed by her displeasure. “I’m glad you realize that,” Mother said. “Now take a seat and let’s hear what your brother has to say.” She turned to me. “Jessie, it makes me so happy to hear that you’ve found someone you care about. And you obviously know that loving a mortal comes with many disadvantages, so I know you didn’t enter into this thing lightly.” Her gaze was steady, but also kind. “I’d like to know what your plans are. Do you think you’d like to turn this girl and make her your bride? Is she the type of young lady who would fare well as a vampire?” “I don’t know,” I had to admit. I loved Colette with every ounce of my soul and I wanted to be with her every moment of the day, but the idea of turning her into a member of the undead had never entered my mind. I loved her for who she was, not for who she might become. “I’d have to give it some thought.” “It’s actually something you should have thought about before you started pawing at her,” Daniel grumbled. “Daniel,” Mother said, sharply. Then she turned back to me. “If you’re truly in love with this girl, then her future is something you have to think about very carefully.” I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no shred of doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. I nodded to Mother. “I understand.” Chapter 41 Colette Mama came running out of the house, apron still tied around her waist, when she saw the big car pull into the driveway. “What happened?” she asked, racing down the steps. “Are you alright?” “I’m fine,” I told her. “Mostly fine. I slipped off a ladder while dusting and hurt my elbow.” My arm had actually stopped throbbing, so I knew it was going to be fine, but it was also a convenient excuse for why I’d left work early. “Here, let me help you into the house,” Mama said, putting her arm around me. “Do you think I should call Doctor Winters?” “No, I don’t think so,” I told her. “It’s probably just really bruised. I’m sure it’ll be better if we just use some ice.” We didn’t have any ice in the house, so Mama sent the chauffeur off to get some. He looked like he wanted to protest, but my mother didn’t give him the opportunity. Then she tucked me in bed and fussed over me, making sure I was comfortable. “Are you sure it’s just your elbow?” she asked, once I was situated. “You seem very upset.” “I’m still a little rattled from the fall,” I assured her. “The castle floors are really hard and I was worried I was going to crack my head.” Mama kissed my head several times just to ward off the horrible thoughts that had obviously entered her brain. “I’m glad you’re alright. But let’s keep an eye on that arm of yours. If it swells more or the pain starts increasing, then I think we should call Dr. Winters anyway. Better safe than sorry.” After letting my mother fuss a bit more, I feigned sleepiness and she left the room. I loved my mother dearly and felt comforted by having her there with me, but I also needed time alone to think. Did Arthur exist? That was a big question that I had no way of answering. The state of his room indicated that he didn’t. Even if he had left for a clinic in New York, then there would still have been some remnants of his having stayed in the room for months on end. There would have been clothes, or leftover medical equipment. And he probably wouldn’t have taken all of his furniture with him. Not if he intended to return to his family home. No, there was nothing to indicate that Arthur had ever been a real person. If I believed that the Vanderlinds did not have a hemophiliac son, then that left a gaping question in need of an explanation. What did they do with the blood? That evening my arm felt much better, yet I didn’t go downstairs for dinner. I didn’t feel like I could face my family. Mama accommodated me by bringing a tray to my room, even though I had very little appetite. “What happened to you today?” Lilly whispered to me, once our bedroom light was off and we were both tucked in our beds. “I slipped and fell,” I told her. “You know how hard the floors are in the castle.” “Mama seems to think you fell off a ladder in the library,” she said. “But I know that’s not true.” Falling off a ladder seemed like such an easy excuse when the chauffeur drove me home. I had forgotten that Lilly would immediately see it for a lie. “I just slipped when I went to take the flowers upstairs,” I told her. Lilly was silent for a moment. “Was Jessie there when you fell?” “No,” I assured her. “But Mrs. Denkler was.” It took a long time for my sister to fall asleep. She knew I was lying about how I’d been injured, but she didn’t pester me for the truth. I was tempted to tell her anyway. I was confused and frightened. I wanted to talk to someone. I wanted someone I trusted to tell me I was being foolish and that there was probably a reasonable explanation for everything. Plus Lilly and I had always shared our secrets, ever since we were little girls. It was a struggle not to tell her, but I knew if I did, then she would tell Mama and Papa. And then we would be forced to give up our positions at the castle. And I would probably never see Jessie again. After more than an hour, my sister’s breathing took on the steady rhythm of the sleeper. But I stayed tucked in my bed, paralyzed with indecisiveness. I loved Jessie. There was no doubt in my mind that I loved him. But that didn’t mean I wasn’t afraid. Finally I couldn’t stand it any longer and I slipped out of bed. Castle gossip being what it was, Jessie had probably already heard about my accident. I wondered how much Mrs. Denkler had told the family about my Arthur discovery. Was Jessie outside the house waiting for me at that very moment? I wouldn’t go outside. Mrs. Denkler had frightened me enough to make that an impossibility. But I had to know if he was out there. Stealing across the room, I pressed myself against the wall, right next to the window. I had to know if he was outside, but I didn’t want him to see me. Our room was dark and the moon was getting close to full. I doubted Jessie would be able to see me, but I still only pulled the curtain aside just enough to peep out. It was difficult for me to see anything on the lawn in the middle of the night. I could make out the apple tree where Jessie and I spent so many wonderful nights arm-in-arm. The tree’s leaves were changing color and falling to the ground. I felt a pang in my chest. I wondered if there was any way I could give Jessie up. I would have to leave my position at the castle, but I had to leave that anyway, once the school was reopened. Ending my secret love affair with Jessie Vanderlind would break my heart. But I knew deep down that it was also probably the smartest thing I could do. No good could come from me being sucked deeper and deeper into whatever dark secret the Vanderlinds were hiding. And then Jessie stepped out of the shadows and looked up at the window where I stood. I thought the darkness would conceal me, but it was obvious that he could see me plain as day. His hair was ruffled and his dark coat billowed around his legs as the wind kicked up. I couldn’t move. All thoughts of my own safety vanished from my mind. All I wanted to do was to run to Jessie, to be with Jessie. Pushing the curtain aside, I pressed one hand against the window’s glass. Jessie took another step forward in response. “What are you doing?” Lilly called from her bed. “What are you looking at out there?” “Nothing,” I told her, hastily stepping away from the window. “I just saw something. I thought there was a fox in the yard, but I think it’s probably just the neighbor’s dog.” “Well, get back in bed,” she told me. “Aren’t you freezing?” “No,” I told her, shaking my head. I hadn’t even noticed the cold. I did not want to go to work the next day, so I claimed that my arm was still too painful to do any polishing or dusting. And it did still hurt quite a bit when I tried to move it. The truth was that I didn’t know what to make of my emotions and working in the castle all day wasn’t going to help me figure them out. Whenever I was anywhere close to Jessie, all I wanted to do was be with him. I needed to have my head clear so I could think things out. Of course I regretted my decision just as soon as Mama left to drive Lilly over in the car. At least when I was in the castle, there was always the hope of a chance-encounter with Jessie. I had no hope of seeing him while sulking around the house all day. But why did I want to see him so desperately? Being away from Jessie felt almost physically painful. But I also felt like I was losing my mind. Was this how everyone my age felt when they fell in love? Was this how Lilly felt about Walter? I went out for a walk to try to clear my head. “You’re so restless today. Do you have a fever?” Mama asked when we sat down for lunch. She pressed her lips to my forehead. “No, you feel just fine.” “I didn’t sleep well last night,” I told her. “I think I’m just overtired.” The day seemed to stretch on forever. I began to look forward to Lilly returning home from work in the hope that she had some news of Jessie. Maybe Emily had spoken to her or maybe Mrs. Denkler had a message for me. But when my sister got home there was nothing. It had apparently been just an ordinary day of dusting and polishing. By the time the sun started to set, I’d worked myself up into a mental state of torment. I began to understand why Guinevere had locked herself away in a convent because she couldn’t deal with how she felt about Lancelot while still being married to the king. As night drew in, I came to a conclusion. Being with Jessie was wrong. I could feel it in my gut that there was danger in the castle. But that didn’t keep me from loving him. I spent hours tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep, but fearing to look out the window. And then, when I finally did manage to close my eyes, I had a tortuous dream where Jessie and I were in love, but I was prohibited from marrying him. Instead I was packed off in a horse drawn carriage and sent far away. The last I saw of Jessie was his figure fading in the distance as he watched the coach carry me off. “How do you feel?” Mama asked when I came downstairs the next morning. “Better,” I told her, but that was only part of the truth. Yes, my arm did feel quite a bit better. — It was only a little sore. — But I actually felt better because I had come to a decision. It was true that I had been frightened by what Mrs. Denkler partially revealed to me about the Vanderlind family. There was obviously a secret there much darker than I had ever imagined. My mind couldn’t even begin to fathom what it might be. But I also knew that nothing could stop me from loving Jessie. If, for some reason, I was never to see him again, I would still love him just as passionately until the day I died as I did at that very moment. I knew I was barely seventeen and these were crazy thoughts for someone my age, but I felt my love for him deep in my soul. It was like it had always been there. Meeting him for the first time had just awoken those feelings from hibernation. I walked into town that afternoon with something on my mind. Would Jessie forgive me for the way I behaved? How could I let him know that I didn’t care about his family’s curse; I loved him for being him. As I strolled along, I stopped to look in the window of Houghton’s and then an idea came to me. The jewelry store was closed on Sundays, but I knew Mr. Houghton lived in the rooms above the shop, so I took a chance and rang the bell. “Yes, young lady?” Mr. Houghton said, peering out of a window on the second floor. He was an older man who lived by himself and had no family. His white hair stuck out on either side of his balding head so that he reminded me of how I’d always imagined Kris Kringle. “Sorry to bother you,” I called up to him. “But I need to buy a present and I have to have it for tonight.” Mr. Houghton was kind enough to open his store just for me. I had been earning good money for the whole summer, but giving most of it to Mama and Papa, so I didn’t have much to spend. There was a gold plated pocket watch that I thought Jessie might like, even though pocket watches were quickly going out of fashion. I had enough money for the watch itself, but not enough for any engraving. Mr. Houghton looked at me from over the top of his bifocals and said, “I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I’m running a Sunday special. Today only, engraving is free.” It took me several minutes to think of just the right words. When I had decided, Mr. Houghton engraved them on the inside of the watch cover. He wrote: Our love is timeless. All of my heart, Lettie As I walked home, Jessie’s present concealed in the pocket of my coat, I wondered if Jessie would come see me that night. I didn’t know if he was angry with me or hurt by my behavior. All I knew was I had to speak to Jessie Vanderlind and earn his forgiveness. Chapter 30 Colette “Did you know you were in love with Walter the first time you met him?” I asked as Lilly and I got ready for bed. My sister had been brushing her hair in front of the mirror and she paused as she thought about it. “I knew that I thought he was good looking,” she told me. “I knew right away that I found him attractive.” “But how long until you knew you were in love with him?” I persisted as I wiggled into my nightgown. “And who says I am in love with Walter?” she asked, giving me a coy look over her shoulder. “Oh, come on, Lilly,” I told her. “How long until you knew you were in love?” “Not that long,” she admitted. “I knew that I liked him a whole lot and then one day I just knew it was love. I think I really knew it at the dance when, instead of trying to defend Lev’s behavior, he was instantly trying to think of another way to get us home. That’s when I knew I wanted to marry him.” I took a moment to digest the fact that my sister knew she wanted to marry Walter Bennett. “And you think you’d feel differently if he’d rushed to Lev’s defense and said some horrible excuse like, ‘boys will be boy,’ or something like that?” Lilly frowned a little. “I don’t know. I’d like to think that I would. But I also know Walter, and he would never say anything so aweful. That’s a big part of the reason why I love him.” I envied Lilly. Her love for Walter seemed so simple. They loved each other and one day they would get married. There was no disease. There was no difference in social position. There wasn’t some dark family curse keeping them apart. “Are in love?” Lilly asked. Her question caught me by surprise. I wanted to tell her yes. I wanted to share that I was madly in love with Jessie Vanderlind and that he was in love with me. It didn’t feel right to keep my feelings from her, even thought I’d been fighting for the last few days to keep them from myself. “I don’t know,” I told her, after giving it some thought. “Things are complicated.” Lilly shook her head. “If the first word out of your mouth wasn’t yes, then you’re not in love. That’s not how love feels.” I pulled down the blankets on my bed and climbed in. “I guess you would know.” “Well, I’m glad if you’re not,” she said, reaching over to switch off the lamp that sat on a small table between our two beds. “I mean, I want you to be in love, but not with that Vanderlind boy. I know he’s beautiful, but there’s something not right with that family. I don’t know what it is, but there’s obviously something not quite right.” I thought about Lilly’s words as I waited for her to fall asleep. My first impulse had been to admit to her that I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. In fact, I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. But I was still reluctant to tell her. Maybe it was because I knew Lilly would disapprove. Maybe it was because I wasn’t sure of Jessie’s feelings. We’d never said I love you, but I had no doubt about my feelings. Once Lilly’s breathing became regular, I put on my robe and slipped outside. I didn’t know if Jessie was going to be there, but I was ready to wait all night. As I hurried across the lawn, Jessie stepped out of the shadows and caught me in his arms. “Oh, Jessie,” I exclaimed in a loud whisper, my voice practically startled out of me. “What happened?” he asked, a concerned frown pulling at the corners of his mouth. “Mrs. Denkler said she had to send you home on Friday. And then I saw you in the window Friday night, but you didn’t come out.” “I went upstairs to leave Arthur’s flowers in the hallway, but his door popped open a few inches,” I told him, taking strength from the fact that his arms were still around me. “I went to pull it closed, but then Mrs. Denkler came up and accused me of looking in the room.” “Oh,” Jessie said, looking even graver than he had before. “And then she saw the pendant you gave me and she grew very angry. We’re not allowed to wear any personal adornment at work and she tried to rip it form my neck. I stumbled and ended up falling into the room,” I confessed. “I saw what was in there. And what wasn’t.” “And what did Mrs. Denkler say to you?” he asked, cautiously. “She said that Arthur had been sent to a clinic in New York,” I admitted. “And that it would be a very bad thing for the town if the blood donations were to stop.” Jessie took me by the shoulders and held me slightly away from him so he could look into my eyes. “I should have never let this happen,” he said. “I should have just kept away, even with how I feel about you.” “No,” I told him, shaking my head. “If you feel anything for me like I feel about you, then that would have been impossible.” “I feel more for you than I ever imagined I could.” His eyes searched mine. “But I need to explain,” Jessie said, furrowing his forehead as he struggled with some dark burden that I knew he was reluctant to share. “I need to tell you about my family.” “Please don’t,” I said, closing the gap between us. “Not now. I know that there is some horrible secret that you hide from the world. But I don’t want to know. Not yet. I just want to love you, and know that you love me, and not worry about whatever your family really does with the blood for Arthur.” “I love you,” Jessie whispered, his voice hoarse. “I’ve loved you since before I even met you. I can’t begin to explain how, but it’s true.” “I know,” I told him. “I feel the exact same way.” “But still,” he went on. “This secret of my family’s... It’s much worse than you can possibly imagine.” “Please don’t,” I told him, touching his perfect lips to stop his words. “Don’t tell me you love me and then spoil it all in the next breath. Let me just enjoy this moment.” He nodded his head slightly. “I have something for you,” I said, suddenly feeling shy. Jessie was from an incredibly wealthy family. The watch I had purchased for him was only made of gold plate. “What is it?” he asked, sensing my sudden reluctance. “It’s not much,” I admitted, pulling the small package form the pocket of my robe. He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it. “If it’s from you, then I shall cherish it forever,” he assured me. I carefully observed his face as he unwrapped the watch and read the engraving. “It’s wonderful,” he said, and I could tell he was sincere. “The engraving alone means the world to me.” “I meant every word,” I told him. “I’m not sure how, but our love does feel timeless. At least it does for me.” “It does for me,” he quickly assured me. “I know that I’ll never stop loving you.” And then he dropped to one knee and took my hand. “There’s a question I need to ask you.” Chapter 42 Jessie “She left?” I asked, frowning at my little sister. “Yes,” Emily said, nodding a few times. “Mrs. Denkler sent her home in a car.” My impulse was to rush over to the Gibson house immediately to see if Colette was alright, but the sun was still shining in the sky so I wouldn’t have made it very far. “Do you have any idea what happened?” I asked, both of my hands clenched at my sides with the frustration of my impotence. “All I know is that Colette went upstairs to deliver the flowers that she brought. Mrs. Denkler followed her.” Emily shifted from foot to foot, obviously feeling anxious as well. “And then Denkie was dragging Colette downstairs by the arm and ordering the chauffeur to bring the car around to the back to take her home.” I ran my hand through my hair a few times. “Do you think it had anything to do with Arthur?” I asked. “I don’t know.” Emily looked alarmed. She knew how important it was to keep the family’s unfortunate situation a secret. “That’s the only thing I can think it might be.” Quickly, I sought Mrs. Denkler, finding her in her sitting room, having a cup of tea. “What happened to Colette?” I asked. “Who?” she asked, frowning slightly, as if trying to place the name. “Colette Gibson,” I said for clarity. “I heard that she had to go home for the day.” “Oh, you mean Miss Gibson, the housemaid,” she said, setting down her cup. “Yes, I think we may no longer be in need of Miss Gibson’s services.” “What in the world happened?” I asked. I needed some sort of explanation because my imagination was running wild. “Someone apparently left the door to Arthur’s room unlocked and it popped open. I’m afraid she saw into the room,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “I heard she was injured,” I pressed. “She stumbled and may have hurt her arm,” the housekeeper admitted. “But it was just a little bump. Nothing of consequence.” “But what did you tell her?” I asked. “How did you explain Arthur’s absence?” She gave a small shrug, as if she couldn’t understand my concern. “I said that he had left last week for a clinic in New York.” “And she believed you?” I demanded. “I see no reason why she wouldn’t believe me,” Mrs. Denkler said with the conviction of a person who was used to never being questioned. “I think she found the soiled goblets a bit disconcerting, and she did have a few questions as to why we were still paying people for their blood. But I explained that it was healthier for the town if the donations continued.” I stared at the housekeeper for several seconds, trying to decide if she was being intentionally obtuse. “Are you saying that you purposely frightened the girl?” Mrs. Denkler shook her head. “Girls like that are never frightened. Not even when it’s obvious that they should be.” She gave me a penetrating look with eyes as hard as flint. “She’s the kind of girl who always makes trouble in a great house. I should have seen that. I would have never hired her, but...” She paused for a moment with a far-away look in her eyes and then shook her head. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll release her from her position tomorrow and that will be the end of it.” “You will do no such thing,” I informed her. The housekeeper put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “I have a responsibility to run this house in the manner that it was run when your grandfather was alive. He never tolerated nonsense from the staff. Especially the kind of nonsense I suspect has been going on for the past few months.” She gave me a significant look. “The Vanderlind reputation must be upheld.” “You have an obligation to do as you are told, Mrs. Denkler,” I informed her. “You are not above being released from your position. Just remember that.” Mrs. Denkler’s eyes bulged with surprise and she clutched at the lace on her high collar. “You wouldn’t,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been the housekeeper for the castle since before you were born.” Her eyes were glistening and I saw that she was actually fighting back tears. “You’re right, Denkie,” I told her, squeezing her shoulder to be reassuring. “I wouldn’t. But let’s not fight over this. Just make sure that Miss Gibson remains employed here and we’ll say nothing else about it.” The tears were instantly replaced by Mrs. Denkler’s customary shrewd appearance. “You want the maid to stay a maid. I understand.” That was not my point, by any means, but I didn’t want to argue with her any longer. The rest of the day passed at a snail’s pace. I was practically climbing the walls. As soon as the sun dipped below the horizon, I was out the door. And outside Colette’s window a few minutes after that, concealing myself in the long shadows of the backyard. It was foolish to arrive so early. My skin was throbbing with the pain of the dwindling sunlight and Colette wouldn’t be expecting me until much later, if she was expecting me at all. But I had to be near here. I had to know that she wasn’t injured in any way. I had to know if she still loved me, or if she now considered me some kind of fiend. As the minutes slowly dragged by, I grew increasingly anxious about Colette’s affections. I’d only known her for a few short months, but her feelings for me were the axis upon which my whole world turned. If Mrs. Denkler had revealed more than she’d admitted, or if Colette was able to surmise the truth from what she saw in Arthur’s room, then there was a strong possibility that I would never hold my dear girl in my arms again. It would be a harsh reality, but one that I would more than likely have to face. I only wished that I had been the one to tell her about the curse that my grandfather had spread to all of us. That would have been the noble thing to do. Instead I just kept ignoring the truth because I so desperately wanted to be with her. If only I hadn’t caught scarlet fever. If only Grandfather had been a better man. But such was my life. I had to accept the fact that fate was a cruel master. The light in Colette’s bedroom came on as the hour approached ten and then went off again shortly thereafter. I knew that Colette shared a room with her sister and that she had to wait until Lilly had fallen asleep. I stood by our apple tree and waited, my eyes glued to the window. An hour ticked past and there was no movement that I could discern. As the second hour got underway, I saw the curtain twitch and caught a glimpse of Colette’s hair. She probably assumed she was concealed by the darkness of her room, but I could see her as plain as day. Stepping away from the tree, I stood on the lawn, looking up at her. Moving the curtain aside, Colette looked down at me. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from her. She was just so lovely; it ripped at my heart not to be able to take her in my arms. But she wasn’t moving. She wasn’t coming down to be by my side. She just stood there, safe behind the walls of her family’s home, and stared at me. Did she know the full truth? Or had she simply guessed that the secret that I’d been on the verge of telling her so many times was much worse than she’d ever imagined. I knew she hadn’t completely turned against me. If she had, then she wouldn’t have been standing there with her palm pressed against the glass. Lilly must have awoken and drawn Colette’s attention because she suddenly turned away and then disappeared from view. I stood on the lawn for most of the rest of the night, but Colette did not return to the window. I knew she wouldn’t, but I found it almost impossible to leave. I decided to sleep in my coffin that dawn. It wasn’t my usual custom, but I felt like I needed walls around me or I might explode. I hated that I was a vampire. I felt desperate to escape the prison of being a member of the undead. I longed for the simple pleasures of mortality, like holding Colette’s hand while strolling in the sunshine. “What’s this I hear about housemaids sneaking into Arthur’s room?” Daniel demanded as he stalked into the dining hall the next evening. “I knew we should have never hired anyone local.” “I think you’re being a bit overdramatic, darling,” Mother said, setting down her goblet. “One of the maids got a peek into Arthur’s room because someone left the door unlocked. But Mrs. Denkler explained it all away, so there’s no need to get your nose bent out of shape.” “Well, I think we should fire her anyway,” Daniel said, helping himself to a crystal goblet and filling it from a carafe on the table. “Or maybe get rid of her altogether. One can never be too cautious about these things.” “You will not touch one hair on her head!” I found myself snarling from my seat on the other side of the table. It was a ridiculous thing to have said. Mother was making light of the problem and that was probably the best course of action. But Daniel was so cavalier about ending the life of the girl I loved, that I found it hard to control my temper. “Oh,” my brother said with an amused smirk. “Was it the little trollop who Jessie’s been toying with? Well, this does add an intriguing twist to the evening.” “She’s not a trollop and I haven’t been toying with her,” I informed him, knowing full well that I was rising to the bait. Daniel cocked an eyebrow and took on a superior tone. “So what have you decided to do with the girl?” he asked. “Don’t leave us all in suspense.” “I’ve decided that I’m going to ask her to marry me,” I said, glaring straight back into his eyes. “You can’t!” Daniel practically shrieked. “The undead can’t marry the living. The Bishops would never stand for it.” “They would if I conjoin with her,” I said, keeping my own voice steady. “And that is what I intend to do.” “Conjoin?!” Daniel sounded like I had just offered him a slug of poison. “You know some little trollop for a few weeks and you decide you want to be with her forever?” “Yes,” I said, firmly. “Then just turn her, you fool!” my brother exclaimed. “That’s the reasonable thing to do. You can’t bond yourself for eternity to someone who is going to get old and gray while you’re still in your prime. That’s insanity.” “That’s love,” our mother said in a much quieter voice. Daniel swung around to face her. “You’re not helping!” he shouted. “Watch your tone,” she said to him. Then, turning to me, Mother said, “Sweetheart, you know that if you conjoin with a mortal, then you can never be with anyone else, not for the rest of eternity. You wouldn’t be able to be with your own kind.” “Not that a vampiress would have you,” Daniel said with a sneer. “You would probably be shunned from vampire society,” Mother pointed out. “And what would you do after she passed away?” It was a thought so painful to me that I had trouble even thinking about it. “I don’t know.” “You make me sick,” my brother said. “Thinking you’re in love... You’ve been going to the damn theater too often. You’re not in love. You don’t know anything about it.” I shrugged my shoulders. “It’s the way I feel.” “But you’re only seventeen,” Mother insisted. “How do you know it’s the way you will always feel?” “Turn her,” Daniel said. “If you don’t like her as a vampiress, you can always stake her and be done with it.” “Daniel,” Mother exclaimed. “I hope you are being facetious.” My brother gave her a flat look. “What would you have me say? He can’t conjoin with her. That would bring shame to all of us. I’m not going to be ostracized from all good society just because Jessie has a crush.” “It’s more than a crush,” I assured him. “Much more.” “Oh, save your romantic pap for the mortal,” Daniel snarled. “I don’t buy any of it.” “I’m sorry you feel that way,” I told him, “but I’m not changing my mind.” “Mother,” Daniel said, turning to face her. “Are you going to stand for this nonsense?” Our mother lifted her hands, palms up, in dismay. “The heart wants what the heart wants.” “I think the family’s honor should come before Jessie’s foolish notions of love.” I knew Daniel and I would never see eye-to-eye, so I addressed our mother when I said, “I want to go before the Bishops and explain my position.” “You will do no such thing,” Daniel snapped, shoving between us and getting right up in my face. “I won’t let you.” I gave him a steady look. “It’s not up to you.” “I am the head of this family now,” Daniel said, sticking his chin in the air. This caused me to grin. “Only in your own mind.” “Mother, are you going to allow him to do this?” Daniel whined. “Both of you need to stop,” she said in her most no-nonsense tone. “I think we should wait and allow cooler heads to prevail. Daniel, you need to stop thinking you’re in charge. I had quite enough of that from your grandfather.” Turning to me, she said, “And you need to slow down. This is a monumental decision and it shouldn’t be made on just one day’s sleep.” “But...” I intended to protest that I hadn’t made the decision lightly, but Mother held up her hand. “Daniel is right in that this decision will affect all of us, so I ask that you not do anything too hastily.” Reaching up, she caressed my cheek and looked into my eyes. “I know you don’t take love lightly,” she told me, “but I think a little patience is called for. A few months delay won’t mean the end of the world. And right now I think you really need some perspective.” “You’re wrong,” I said. “Both of you. The love I feel for Colette is different than anything I ever imagined. It’s as if my life only really began when I met her.” “I can’t stay here and listen to this nonsense,” Daniel growled. “I’m going upstairs to pack a bag. If Jessie’s going to ruin the family, I’m sure not going to stand around and watch it.” He glanced at our mother. “I’m going to New York. Call me when you’ve talk some sense into him.” If it had been only Daniel who was against me, then I would have simply ignored him. But I had always heeded the advice of my mother. I knew she had my best interest in mind. If she thought I needed time to reconsider, then I needed to take some time. Daniel was as good as his word. He left the castle later that night. I was happy to see the back of him. I didn’t need him glowering at me and complaining about the honor of the family. Families survived scandal all the time. It was true that conjoining with a mortal was something that would probably ostracize me from the undead world, but I found that the more I thought about it, the less I cared. I’d never wanted to be part of the undead world. “You won’t have enough time to make it to New York,” Mother said, as Daniel was headed out the door. “I’ll overnight in Cleveland,” he said, giving her a brusque kiss on the cheek. “I just need to get out of here before I ram a stake through Jessie’s romantic heart.” “It’s probably best that you go for a little while,” she said, leading him to the door. “Have a safe flight.” “Update me when my little brother has come to his senses,” he said, sparing me a withering glance and then disappearing into the night. It was painful, but I didn’t go to see Colette that night. My brain became too full of pink champagne bubbles whenever I was near her. I desperately wanted to fly along the river to try to clear my head. But I knew if I went outside, then I would suddenly find myself in Colette’s yard. So I stuck to the castle, spending most of the night in my room. My isolation was a special kind of torture, with my thoughts being constantly filled by Colette. I wanted to see her so desperately, and yet I had no idea if she wanted to see me. I spent another day in my coffin, practically tearing apart the upholstery. All I could think about was Colette. How could she possibly have won my heart so easily? And how could I ever give her up? Ending my romance with Colette Gibson and then leaving Tiburon for the next couple of decades would be the right thing to do. Turning her into a member of the undead would be the selfish thing to do. And conjoining with Colette for the rest of her life, and the rest of my eternity, would be the foolish thing to do. I knew all of that. The only problem was; I didn’t know which option to choose. I couldn’t see clearly which was the right path to take. By the time the sun was starting to set and I climbed out of my coffin for the evening, I knew only one thing for sure; I had to see her. I took special care dressing that evening. It was possibly the last time I would ever see my darling girl and I wanted to look my best. I put on a dark gray suit and even went so far as to decorate my lapel with a red carnation. I took my fill of blood and then slipped out of the castle without a word to anyone. I was undecided in my actions, but I didn’t want Mother or Emily to interfere. I was grateful Daniel had left. Just knowing he was in New York made me feel less on edge. As I flew along, I resolved that I had to confess. I had to explain everything to Colette and then let the cards fall where they may. She deserved to know what I was. She deserved to know the truth. Chapter 43 Colette “Colette Gibson,” Jessie said, looking up at me with his fathomless gray eyes. “Will you marry me?” “Yes,” I said, as soon as the words had passed through his perfect lips. I probably should have hesitated. I probably should have taken some time to think it over. But I didn’t want to. Every fiber of my being wanted to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I didn’t care that his family was hiding some dark, morbid secret. That had nothing to do with Jessie. That had nothing to do with our love. Jessie sprang to his feet and swept me up in his arms. Under his long coat, he was wearing some type of dark suit. There was a red flower in his lapel. He had come dressed for the occasion and I wished that I was wearing something besides my nightgown and wrapper. But then he washed all my awkwardness away by saying, “You’ve made the happiest man in the world.” And then he kissed me. It was a kiss that both filled me with heat and made me shiver. “Should we go to your family? Or should I speak to your father alone?” Jessie asked. “How are things like this handled in your country?” “I...” I stammered. I had no idea what to tell him. I wanted to be his bride, but I knew my family would insist upon a lengthy engagement and I wanted to be with Jessie that very instant. “I think we should elope.” It was as if dark clouds filled Jessie’s eyes. “Why?” he asked. “Because I can’t wait to be your wife,” I explained. “Every second I’m away from you feels like an eternity.” “But your family...” he began. “I know,” I told him. “I hate to cause my parents any grief, but once they see how happy I am as Mrs. Jessie Vanderlind, then I know they’ll forgive us for running off.” Jessie frowned. “It wouldn’t be honorable,” he said. “We’re already starting our life together with too many secrets. And if you would only let me...” “Don’t,” I said, stopping his lips with a kiss. “I know you have your secrets, but share them with me when we are husband and wife.” “When?” he asked, burying his face in my hair. “If we are to be wed, then I want it to be this instant.” “Tomorrow night,” I told him. “We can sneak down the Tiburon to Yontville and wake up the Justice of the Peace. Then I can call my family in the morning and tell them the good news.” The clouds parted from Jessie’s brow. “I love you Colette Gibson,” he told me. “I can’t believe you want to be my wife.” “I’ve never wanted anything more in the world,” I assured him. Then I thought of something. “What about your family?” I asked. He was quiet for a moment. “What about them?” “Will they approve of us?” I put a hand to my cheek at the thought of how they would react. “I can’t imagine they will.” A rich young man running off with the maid was not something fine families usually found appealing. “I hate to think of your family disliking me. And I don’t want them to think that I’m some kind of...” I fought off the urge to say gold digger. “My sister already adores you,” Jessie assured me, squeezing me in his arms. “And my mother will love you just as soon as I tell her that you are my bride.” “What about your brothers?” I asked, with some hesitancy. “What about Arthur and Daniel?” “Arthur is...” he began. “Arthur is someone we don’t have to worry about.” He shook his head and then continued with, “And Daniel left for New York last evening. We don’t expect him back for at least a month.” And then he kissed me again, a deep, penetrating kiss that I felt all the way down to my toes. “I don’t think I can wait that long,” I said, my breath catching in my throat with anticipation. “Tomorrow evening then,” he said, running his fingertips across my cheek, down my neck and to my collarbone. His caress sent shivers through my whole body. “Where shall we rendezvous? Shall I meet you here, by our favorite apple tree?” “No,” I said, thinking it over. I hated deceiving my family. It would be an emotional challenge for me to sneak off, if only for less than a day. And when I came home again, I would no longer be a girl. I would be a married woman. I wanted to leave the house by myself. I wanted to say goodbye to my present life and step away from childhood all on my own. “I’ll meet you at the castle,” I finally told him. Jessie was about to say something in protest, but I stopped him by adding, “I mean outside the castle, in the woods out there along the river. If you can arrange a boat, then we can row down to the next town.” Jessie probably could have arranged a car, but a boat sounded so much more romantic. “Are you sure that’s what you want?” Jessie asked. “It will be dark. I would feel better accompanying you.” “No, this is something I have to do on my own,” I assured him. “And besides, Tiburon is perfectly safe, day or night. We haven’t had so much as a robbery since I can remember.” “But...” Jessie tried protesting again. “How will you get there? On your bicycle? What kind of bridegroom would I be if I allowed that to happen?” “Don’t you worry about me,” I said, patting him on the forearm to assure him. “You just focus on finding a boat that doesn’t leak. Our elopement will be a lot less romantic if we ended up getting soaked.” “Shall we meet at midnight?” he asked. I nodded. “Midnight,” I repeated. “But shouldn’t we choose an exact spot? Do you know of an old tree or something? How will we find each other?” Jessie gave it some thought. “There’s that large oak tree by the water’s edge. The one where the boughs hang way out over the water.” I knew the exact tree. “Sure,” I told him. “It’s got a rope swing. In the summer, kids use it all the time for swimming.” “Oh.” Jessie frowned a little. “I’m not sure that there’s a rope swing.” “I think we’re probably talking about the same tree, but maybe we should pick someplace else, just in case.” “Don’t worry,” Jessie assured me, bending slightly to nuzzle my hair. “No matter where you are, I’ll always be able to find you.” Chapter 44 Colette I begged off from work for another day. I needed time alone in the room I shared with Lilly to prepare for my elopement, and I couldn’t exactly pack with my family around. My mother frowned when I told her that I was staying home. “If you’re still in pain, then maybe we really should call the doctor.” “I don’t think that’s necessary,” I said. “I’m sure by tomorrow I’ll be right as rain.” Mama reached up and laid her hand against my cheek, looking into my eyes. “Are you sure that’s all it is?” she asked. “It’s just a sore arm. Nothing else is bothering you?” “No.” I shook my head back and forth a few times. “Nothing at all.” I’d always been an obedient daughter and never given my parents much grief. They were good parents and I knew they loved me, so it seemed only fair to show them the same consideration. Not telling them about my engagement to Jessie was one of the most difficult things I’d ever done. But I knew if I told them, then they would want me to wait. They’d insist that I finished high school and get to know Jessie better. But I wouldn’t wait. I couldn’t wait. Being in Jessie’s arms, sharing a life together, was all I could think about. Papa needed to get out the door bright and early to make sure everything was running smoothly on the town hall project. They were going to pour the foundation soon and he wanted to make sure it was done right. Mama was going to drop him off and then drive over to meet up with a few of her old school friends who live in the next town. They got together for a luncheon a few times a year. This was perfect for my plans because it left me with the house to myself for a few hours until Mama returned. Even though I was still in my nightgown when my parents were about to leave, I ran downstairs to give both of them a hug and a kiss goodbye. “You’re being awfully affectionate this morning,” Papa remarked as I took a moment to give him a second squeeze. “Am I?” I asked, putting my arms around Mama and hugging her again, too. “I just wanted to let you know how much I love you.” Mama gave me a kiss on the head. “We love you too, you silly girl. Are you sure you don’t feel well enough to go to work? You seem to be full of energy and I wouldn’t want you to lose your position.” Gingerly moving my elbow up and down, I said, “It still hurts a little, but I’m sure I’ll be fine in another day if I just take it easy.” After they left, pulling the door closed behind them, I turned around to find Lilly sitting on the stairs, watching me. “What are you up to, Lettie?” she asked, suspicion in her eyes. “Nothing,” I assured her. “I’m just letting my arm heal.” “Is that all it is?” she asked, getting to her feet. “Because you’re acting awfully funny.” “No, I’m not,” I insisted. “If you want to give your notice at the castle, then I’m all for it,” she said. “Papa has his town hall job and then he’ll work on the school. We don’t have to keep working there. Our family’s doing fine now.” Her comment surprised me. “Don’t you like working at the castle?” “If I’m being completely honest, no,” she said. “The work is fine, but the family makes me uncomfortable. There’s something about them that’s just not right. You can see it in their eyes.” “They all have beautiful eyes,” I insisted. I couldn’t bear to hear Jessie criticized. “No.” Lilly shook her head. “They all have cold eyes. Dead eyes. Like the eyes of a shark.” “You’re being ridiculous,” I told her. “And you’re only saying that because of the color. The Vanderlinds can’t help it that their eyes are gray.” “I suppose,” Lilly said. “But I still don’t like it there. I heard that Mrs. Zucker’s cousin isn’t working out at the store. They’re going to be hiring again and I’m thinking of asking for my old job back.” My first impulse was to tell her not to do it. I couldn’t imagine leaving the castle, even if I wasn’t betrothed to Jessie. But then I thought about how odd it would be if Lilly was still working there as a maid while I was Jessie’s wife. “Maybe you should,” I told her. “That might be a good idea, seeing that you don’t like it.” “I’ll ask for you, too,” my sister told me. “I think it would be better if we left the castle together.” “Thank you,” I said, giving her a hug. “I love you, Lilly.” “I love you, too,” she said, pulling away from me while giving me another suspicious look. “But I wish I understood why you are acting so strangely.” After Lilly left for work, it didn’t take me long to decide on my wedding trousseau. I wanted to wear my organdy dress as my bridal gown, but it was still torn from my encounter with Lev Wilson. I decided on my green dress with the white flowers. It was of a light fabric, so I knew I’d probably be chilly, but once Jessie and I were together, he could put his arms around me and keep me warm. I positioned the dress and my favorite hat, the straw one with the silk daisies on it, toward the front of the closet. That way it would be easier to retrieve my clothes without disturbing my sister. After that I pulled a small suitcase down from the closet shelf, flipped it open on the bed, and packed my prettiest nightgown. I knew I would also need something to wear the next morning, so I added a sweater and a wool skirt, along with some warm tights and a few toiletries. There was still my toothbrush and a few other items, but I thought I would slip those things in at the last minute, so that no one in my family would notice anything missing. Taking a seat at my desk, I pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and found a pen. I didn’t want my family to panic when they found my bed empty in the morning. That wouldn’t be a nice thing to do to them. So I thought I would write a note, just to assure everyone that I was fine and in no danger. It would lessen the surprise when Jessie and I called the next morning as newlyweds, but it was better not to make my parents worry. Dear Family, I’m sorry for keeping this secret from you, but Jessie Vanderlind and I have fallen in love. In fact, by the time you read this note, I will already be his wife. I apologize for sneaking off and eloping in this way, but I know you would counsel me to wait to get married until we’re both a little older. I’m afraid I love Jessie too much to delay. I hope you’ll forgive me, once you see how happy he makes me. He truly is the most wonderful man I have ever met. We’ll call you when we get up. Please don’t worry until then. I’m sure Jessie will take good care of me. I love you all very much. Lettie It was just as I was signing my name when I heard the front door open and close. Snatching the note off my desk, I tossed it into the suitcase, on top of my clothes. Snapping the lid shut, I quickly tucked the whole thing under my bed. “Lettie,” I heard my mother call as she was climbing the stairs. A moment later she was poking her head in the door. “Hi, Mama,” I said. “What are you doing back so soon?” “I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said, pulling the pin from her hat. “After dropping your father off, I drove half way there before I realized the luncheon isn’t until next week.” Chapter 45 Jessie I’d already worn my favorite suit when I’d proposed to Colette, so I felt at a bit of a loss for proper wedding attire. I wondered if it would be considered bad manners to wear the suit again for the ceremony. My next choice was to wear my tuxedo, but I decided against that pretty quickly. I sincerely doubted Colette had a wedding dress tucked away in her closet and it wouldn’t do to be dressed fancier than the bride. I did have a blue suit that I’d been told was becoming, but I couldn’t seem to find it anywhere in my closet. After an extensive search, I discovered it crumpled on the floor. It must have not been hung up properly when the household contents were unpacked. It definitely needed a good pressing. When I’d flown back from Lettie’s, I’d spent the rest of the night searching for a boat. My mother had plans to get a couple of small boats for the castle, but no one had gotten around to ordering them yet. Most people who used the river had already taken their boats out of the water in anticipation of the first big freeze. I had to soar up and down the river for a few hours until a small rowboat, pulled up on the bank and turned over to dry, caught my eye. It wasn’t the most attractive of conveyances, but I hoped that Colette would find it romantic. By the time I’d towed it back to the castle and hid it in the woods, the sun was preparing to rise. As I hurried inside, the sunlight had already starting to lighten the sky, making my skin ache. I had to laugh at my own stupidity. I didn’t want to be such a distracted bridegroom that I ended up inadvertently roasting myself. Once I was safe inside the walls of the castle, I found that I was inordinately tired. But there were still so many things that I had to get done. I had to choose my wedding suit. I had to figure out a plan to avoid the sun once we’d been officially wed. I loved Lettie more than I loved my own life, but it would be a terrible shock for her to see her new husband burn to a crisp the morning after her wedding. I also needed to find some type of ring for my darling girl. I intended to have her real wedding ring specially crafted, but there wasn’t time at the moment. I would just have to go through the family vault and find a temporary ring adequate for the ceremony. My head throbbed and I realized I was hungry. I hurried to Arthur’s room and helped myself to one of the blood packets in the refrigerator. Packing had to wait, I decided as I finished my meal. I needed time to rest. The knowledge that Colette would soon be my bride must have put me at ease because I quickly found the repose that was usually so elusive. When I finally opened my eyes again, the sun had set on another day. I immediately leapt to my feet and started packing, which led to the dilemma about which suit to wear. I rang for a maid and handed her the blue suit. “I need this pressed right away,” I told her. “Bring it to me just as soon as it’s ready.” And then I headed to the vault, where we kept quite a bit of the family jewelry. The vault was a large room in the dungeon that Grandfather had converted into a walk-in safe. Three of its walls were stone and the fourth was a large, metal door with a combination lock. It would be foolhardy for a mortal to steal from vampires, but we saw no reason to subject the servants to temptation. Especially with so much jewelry around. We could easily lose dozens of pieces and never even notice for a few decades, if ever. Once I opened the vault, I was faced with a real challenge. What was an appropriate ring for a girl like Lettie? I dug through boxes upon boxes of jewelry, putting rings aside that I thought might be a possibility, but nothing seemed quite right. I knew that Lettie came from a good family, but she wasn’t used to the wealth of a family like the Vanderlinds. I didn’t want to overwhelm her with a giant diamond, but I didn’t want to insult her with a ring of no consequence. It was just impossible to put everything I felt for Miss Gibson into one tiny piece of jewelry. “You wanted to see me?” Mrs. Denkler asked, appearing in the vault’s doorway. “What?” I had been so absorbed in finding the right piece of jewelry that I hadn’t even heard her approaching. “One of the maids said you were looking for me,” she said, her eyes flitting over the pile of jewelry in front of me. “Is there something I can help you find?” “No, that’s quite alright,” I assured her. “This is…” I couldn’t think of an excuse for why I was combing through diamond rings. “I didn’t send for you,” I finally managed to say. “I just wanted my blue suit pressed.” “One of the maids is doing it now,” she said. “Is there a special occasion?” “No, no,” I assured her. “I just found my blue suit crumpled on the floor of my closet and I want it pressed.” “The maid said you wanted it right away,” she said, persisting in knowing why I was acting so suspiciously. “I’d like it done,” I told her. “Whoever hung up my clothes made a poor job of it.” “I apologize,” the housekeeper said. “I will see to it that whoever is responsible has their pay docked.” “Please don’t do that,” I said, not wanting to cause trouble for somebody else, just to conceal my own secret activities. “It’s not necessary. It’s really just the one suit.” “I believe your brother has a blue suit of similar style. If you like, I could ask him if you may borrow it. The two of you are about the same size,” she said. “Daniel is in New York,” I told her. “Isn’t he?” Mrs. Denkler gave a brief look of surprise. “Oh, yes. That’s right. I’d forgotten.” She stared at me for a moment. “May I ask if there is a specific ring you are searching for? I have all the jewelry catalogued. Perhaps I can help.” “No,” I snapped, tired of her meddling. “I’m fine. I just want to look through the vault in peace.” Mrs. Denkler stared at me for another moment, her mouth opening to say something and then shutting again, the words unsaid. Finally, she decided on, “You know that my first priority in this world is your family.” “I know,” I told her, feeling a little guilty for being short-tempered. “You’ve proven your loyalty many times. “May I at least know if you’ve eaten recently,” she asked. “I could bring you something, if you’re hungry.” “No, thank you,” I told her. “I ate just before I came down here.” “I understand,” she said. “And I hope that someday you’ll understand why I have to do this.” And then she slammed the vault door shut. Chapter 46 Colette The moon was full in the sky as I walked along the edge of the road with my hat clamped on my head and my suitcase under my arm. It was a bright evening with a real hunter’s moon illuminating everything with the unearthly quality of moon glow. It took forever for Lilly to fall asleep. She kept wanting to talk about leaving the castle and going back to Zucker’s. She was doing her best to get me excited about the plan. More than once I was on the verge of confessing the truth, but something always held me back. I was afraid she would go immediately to Mama and Papa so that they would stop me from leaving. I couldn’t have that. I couldn’t have Jessie standing alone in the woods, wondering what had happened to me. It was better to leave my family the note and call them in the morning when I was a new bride. Finally Lilly’s breathing became steady and I slipped out of bed. Gathering up my clothes and suitcase, I crept out into the hall before dressing. That way if Lilly woke up, she wouldn’t catch me in the act. She would probably just assume I was using the water closet. Saying goodbye to my girlhood home was difficult. I had to brush away more than one tear. It was only the thought of Jessie that gave me the strength to leave my family. Thinking of him spurred me onward. I had slipped out of the house and was far down the road before I remembered that the note was still in my suitcase. I’d forgotten to leave it. My family would not know what had happened to me. The thought of how worried my mother would be almost turned my feet around. But then I looked at my watch and saw that it was getting close to midnight. And I still had a very long way to walk. I resolved that I would have to get up very early and give my parents a call. That way they would only have a few minutes of worry, if any at all. I walked along, trying to hurry. It was a long way to the castle on foot. I don’t know why I didn’t tell Jessie to come get me. Then we would be walking arm-in-arm. I should have at least taken my bicycle. At the rate I was going, I wouldn’t rendezvous with Jessie until one in the morning. I spied an obliging bike on the porch of a house and decided I had to borrow it. I made sure to memorize the address and location of the house so I could return the bicycle the next day. I didn’t like the idea of taking it without permission, but time was of the essence and I hadn’t thought my plan out very clearly. Riding made things go much faster. There was even a basket on the front of the bicycle, so I balanced my suitcase there. It was a cool evening, but I was pedaling as quickly as my legs would take me. Stopping for a moment, I stripped my coat off so I wouldn’t break into a sweat. My green dress felt very thin in the night air, but I didn’t want to elope with Jessie while covered in sweat. When I reached the turnoff for the castle, I tucked the borrowed bicycle behind some trees. I didn’t want anyone else to borrow it before I had a chance to return it to its owners. Then I headed down the road toward the castle on foot with my suitcase in my hand and my coat over my arm. The night air had gone from chilly to cold, but I wanted to make sure I had fully cooled down from my ride before putting on my coat again. As the castle came into view, I stopped for a moment to take it in. I was about to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I would be his bride. Soon the castle would be my home. It felt so very right to me, like it was somehow meant-to-be. “Destiny,” I murmured to the wind. I turned left off the road, crossed a portion of the expanse of lawn that led up to the Vanderlind estate, and then started making my way through the woods. The full moon was helpful with my progress, but it was still slow going. There wasn’t enough light for me to see my watch, but I began to fear that I was late. I tried going faster, but my feet kept getting tripped up by rocks and fallen branches. I thought if I went too quickly I would twist an ankle. Jessie would just have to be patient. The deeper I went into the woods, the darker things became. I could no longer see the castle to my right and was only vaguely aware that the public road was somewhere off to my left. Not many people stayed up past midnight in Tiburon, and they definitely weren’t out driving around. I was starting to feel very alone and wished, not for the first time, that I had agreed to Jessie meeting me at my house. I had to keep going, I decided. The sooner I got to the river, the sooner I would be in Jessie’s arms. The sound of a twig snapping caused me to freeze for a moment, straining to listen. “Jessie?” I asked in a small voice. I heard nothing after that, so I kept going, quickening my pace, even though it made me stumble. Another twig snapped, but I didn’t stop. It was probably just a raccoon, or maybe even a skunk out for a midnight stroll, but I was getting spooked. I started to run. Not a flat-out sprint, but faster than a jog. “Colette.” I stopped suddenly, thinking I’d heard somebody call my name. “Jessie?” I called back. “Is that you?”I strained to hear my fiancé’s reply, but all that reached my ears was another twig snapping. I instantly knew it wasn’t Jessie. He would not toy with me. If it was him in the woods, then he would say something. He wasn’t the kind of man who took delight in terrifying a girl. Someone or something was following me. And it knew my name. Chapter 47 Jessie “Mrs. Denkler! Open the damn door! Mrs. Denkler!” I shouted, hammering on the metal until my fists were bloody. I stopped, allowing my hands a moment to heal. Our housekeeper must have gone crazy. That was the only explanation that entered my head. Why would she possibly lock me in the vault? What excuse could she offer for such behavior? I heard the sound of something scraping along the stone floor. I had to assume it was still Mrs. Denkler on the other side. “Mrs. Denkler,” I said in an elevated voice, but without shouting. “Why are you doing this?” When she still didn’t answer I said, “Denkie, please tell me. What’s going on?” “I have too much respect for your family to allow you to do what I think you’re planning on doing,” the housekeeper informed me in a calm voice. If I was still a mortal, I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear her, but my undead ears could distinguish every word. “And just what is it that you think I’m planning on doing?” I asked. “You’re running off to marry that mortal girl,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone. “The pretty one who works here as a maid.” And then, mostly to herself, she added, “This is all my fault. I should have never hired her.” Banging against the metal door was a futile gesture, but the rest of the walls were made out of stone. I knew that striking a stone wall would hurt, but I thought there was a chance I could break through one of them and get out of the vault that way. I couldn’t stand the thought of Colette being alone in the woods, thinking that I had abandoned her. Assessing the room and its orientation in the castle, I thought the wall to the right of the door was probably my best bet. Taking a deep breath to steel myself against the pain, I drew back my arm and punched the wall with all of my might. A shriek of pain escaped my lips, but I ignored it. Once the pain started to subside, I clenched my other fist and struck the wall again in the same spot. A small bit of dust drifted into the air, but the rocks were still solid and the mortar, so recently applied, didn’t crumble. “What are you doing in there?” the housekeeper asked. “Trying to get out,” I told her through clenched teeth as I cradled my hand. “You don’t have to be so dramatic,” she said. “I’ll let you out eventually. I’m just waiting until the trollop is out of the picture.” “She’ll never be out of the picture,” I informed her. “Not with the way I feel about her. I will love her for the rest of her life, and then for the rest of mine.” There was silence on the other side of the door, so I added, “Do you understand me?” My words were only met with more silence. I tried to calm myself. Beating my fists against the wall wasn’t getting me anywhere. Colette would be upset, but once I was free, I would find her and explain what had happened. She would understand that I didn’t intentionally stand her up. We could always elope in a night or two, once she had forgiven me. But I hated the thought of my darling girl in tears. I hated the thought of hurting her. And I didn’t want her to be in the woods all alone. Tiburon was a safe community, but you never knew if there was a wayward tramp or rabid dog that might be wandering the woods in the dark. I should have never agreed to let Colette walk by herself. I should have insisted that I meet her outside her home so that we could head to the river together. “Mrs. Denkler, you need to open the door right now,” I said in the calmest voice I could muster. “It’s not your place to tell me what to do and what not to do.” “So you admit that you intend to run away with her?” she asked. “Do you plan on turning the little tramp?” I kicked the wall in frustration. “She’s not a tramp,” I snarled, my voice ragged with pain as I waited for my foot to heel. “She’s the most wonderful girl in the world. And yes, I am going to marry her. I will conjoin with her. Whether you like it or not.” “But not turn her?” Mrs. Denkler asked. “You’ll leave her bound to her mortal coil?” “No, I will not turn her,” I admitted. “That is something I will never do.” “But she’ll age,” Mrs. Denkler insisted. “She’ll grow old and gray. The beauty you see now is only temporary. Her life will end and you will still be young and fresh. Why not just turn her, if you love her so much?” “Because I love her too much to do that to her,” I said, pressing my forehead against the vault door. “Loving someone means doing what’s right for her, not just what makes you happy.” And then I knew that I couldn’t marry Colette without telling her the complete truth about my family. I couldn’t bind her to me without her knowing that I was a vampire. She would try to stop me from confessing, but I loved her too much to keep the secret from her until we were wed. “Haven’t you ever loved someone like that?” I asked, stepping away from the door. My hands were fully healed, but I knew battering them against the walls would get me nowhere. I had to persuade Mrs. Denkler to open the door. “Haven’t you ever loved someone so much that you would do anything for him?” “But Colette is mortal,” Mrs. Denkler said again, her voice sounding unsure. “And you are a vampire. Some day she will die. Then what will you do?” It was a question I had asked myself many times. “I will spend eternity cherishing her memory.” There was a long pause, and then I heard the sound of the combination lock being turned. Slowly, the door cracked open. “I loved your grandfather like that,” Mrs. Denkler said, avoiding my eye as I stepped out of the vault. “I would have done anything for him. But he didn’t feel the same way about me. So I became this,” she said, raising her hands and then letting them fall to her side. “I became his servant.” “But why?” I asked. “At least it allowed me to be near him and see him every day. It allowed me to help raise his family, even if none of you are my own.” “But he offered to turn you,” I said. “I heard him do it. More than once.” The housekeeper shook her head. “He only did that once I was old and the bloom of my youth was gone. He only started making the offer when he knew I wouldn’t accept it.” I stared at her, horrified. For Grandfather to torture her in that way was unforgivable. And yet she was still devoted to him. “I’m sorry,” I told her. It was the only thing I could think of to say. Reaching forward, she pressed a hand to my forearms. “I’m sorry for what I did,” she went on. “I was so worried about protecting the Vanderlind name that I forgot to protect you.” “It’s alright,” I said, patting her hand. “I understand. But now I have to go.” “Go,” she told me. “You must hurry. I only hope it’s not too late.” I was halfway down the hall before the real meaning of her words filter through to my brain. “Too late?” I paused to ask. Mrs. Denkler gave me a strangled look. “I mean, I hope she isn’t mad at you for being late.” I gave her a smile. “I just hope I can find a way to earn her forgiveness.” Chapter 48 Colette My lungs were burning and I had to stop for a moment to catch my breath. My hat was gone, my suitcase was gone, and I was terrified because I knew I was not alone. There was something out there, stalking me through the trees. I thought I’d heard it say my name, but that was impossible because whatever was chasing me wasn’t human. The sound of some leaves rustling behind me gave me a start and I started running again. I knew I was headed deeper into the woods and away from the road. I knew the creature was flushing me away from my only chance to flag down a passing car or signal someone in a nearby house. Branches tore at my dress and ripped out my hair. One of my shoes got stuck in the mud and was pulled from my foot. A few steps after that and my other foot got tangled in a tree root and I fell to the ground with a sob. I freed my leg, but did not immediately get to my feet again. I needed to calm down. I needed to catch my breath. There was a large log next to where I’d fallen and it afforded me some protection from the eyes of the predator that was pursuing me. I just needed to rest for a moment and come up with a plan. I wished I knew what was pursuing me so that I could better figure out how to defend myself. If it was a wolf or a bear, then I needed to climb a tree. If it was a man, then I needed to find a sharp stick and defend myself. But it seemed to be both human and beast. It seemed to have the senses of an animal. It could hear me from a distance and smell my scent in the air. But it could also speak. The creature had called my name. At least I thought it had called to me. But I knew that had to just be terror fueling my imagination. It was probably a stray dog that had gone feral and was hungry. I probably looked like an easy target. All I needed to do was climb a tree and bide my time. Once it was light out, I was sure I would be able to get back to the road and flag down a motorist. Lying on the ground, not moving, made me realize how cold it was outside. There was frost on the leaves all around me. My breath started to slow. I knew I had to do something. The beast was probably still looking for me. None of the trees around me had branches low enough for me to climb. I wondered how close I was to the river. The oak tree which was to be my rendezvous point with Jessie would be easy to mount. My heart throbbed at the thought of my love. Where was he? What had happened to him? If he was in the woods, then I needed to warn him about the creature. The idea of something horrible happening to Jessie frightened me as much as the beast in the woods. Getting to the oak tree was my best bet. Then I could climb to safety and warn Jessie if he was waiting there for me. I tried to think about the way I had run and the orientation of the river. My breathing was becoming more regularly and I felt like it was time to make a move. The small creatures that provide the night with its music had taken up their melodies again. It probably meant that the beast, whatever it was, had moved on in pursuit of some other dinner. With great trepidation, I got to my feet. And there he was. Jessie, my love, was standing no more than thirty yards away. I could see him silhouetted in the moonlight. “Jessie,” I called, my heart hammering loudly in my chest. “We have to get out of here. There’s something…” I started hurrying toward him. “I don’t know what it is, but there’s some creature in the woods.” Jessie came bounding toward me, eager to be by my side. I held my arms out to him. “We have to go,” I said, fighting back a sob of relief as his arms encircled me. “There’s someone else in the woods with us.” “I know,” he said. Looking up, I saw that it wasn’t Jessie who was embracing me. It was his brother, Daniel. “Oh,” I stammered, trying to pull away from him, my mind racing. “Did Jessie send you? There’s something in the woods. Something evil.” “I know,” he said again, a wolfish smile twisting his lips. “I think it might be me.” And then I saw his teeth glinting in the moonlight. They were long white daggers of ivory. I tried to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. “Please, by all means scream,” he told me. “It makes things so much better.” I felt limp in his arms, like a rabbit paralyzed by fear as it stares into the eyes of a snake. I caught a glimpse of his eyes and suddenly I understood what Lilly had meant. Jessie’s eyes had always appeared warm and kind to me. But his brother’s eyes where that of the detached predator. He was a shark ready to strike. Daniel wrenched my head to one side. “I’m going to enjoy this so much,” he whispered into my hair. And then he lowered his head and I felt a stinging at my neck. I realized with horror that Daniel had sunk his jagged teeth into my neck. He was drinking from me. He was drinking my blood. I tried to struggle. I willed my arms and legs to move, but they were awkward and lifeless. Tears sprang to my eyes with the sure conviction that I was going to die. Daniel was some kind of demon and he was sucking the life out of me. I thought of the note that I had forgotten to leave for Mama and Papa. It was still in my suitcase, lost somewhere in the woods. I was going to die and my family would never know what had happened to me. And what about Jessie? Did he know that his brother was Satan incarnate? Or was this the evil he always wanted to tell me about, but I refused to listen. I could no longer feel my legs and my hands were ice cold. Daniel was a vampire. He was a member of the undead and he needed human blood to live. That explained Arthur and the sticky, red goblets in his room. And then I realized something else; Jessie and his mother were probably vampires, too. That explained why they could never be out in the daytime. It explained a lot of things. Jessie had wanted to tell me. He’d tried to tell me his family’s secret many times. But I wouldn’t listen. I was too stupid to ever think that there was a problem our love couldn’t surmount. I was too naive to realize that such evil existed in the world. My darling Jessie was a vampire. And yet he loved me. There was no doubt in my mind that he loved me. My vision started to blur and I closed my eyes. The world only came into focus again when my body was jarred, quite painfully. I opened my eyes to see that I had been dropped into some kind of ditch. There was loose soil all around me. I tried to think of where I was. My brain felt fuzzy and slow. Town hall, I finally decided. A work crew was digging the foundation for town hall. Papa would find me. He would find my body in the morning and then my family would know I was dead. There was some comfort in that. I didn’t want them to spend the rest of their lives wondering. I could barely move, but I turned my head to see the man who had killed me standing at the lip of the deep hole where I lay. Just then the clouds drifted away from the moon and I was able to see Daniel more clearly. At a distance he looked so much like Jessie. Tears sprang to my eyes. I would never see my love again. Daniel started kicking dirt into the hole to cover my body. Small rocks and debris rained down on me. “Why?” bubbled to my lips. “Why are you doing this?” The vampire paused for a moment, cocking his head to one side as he considered his actions. “I thought I was doing it to protect the family,” he said. “I wasn’t going to let the Vanderlind name be besmirched by some cheap, little mortal. But now that you ask me, I realize that I’m doing it to teach my brother a lesson. Maybe next time he won’t be so eager to fall in love.” The world was growing dark again and it was a struggle for me to keep my eyes open. I had lost too much blood to do anything but die. Daniel started kicking more dirt on me and I curled into a ball and closed my eyes. “Good bye, Jessie,” I whispered, hoping the night breeze would carry my words to his ears. “Good bye, my love. I will miss you forever.” Epilogue Jessie I raced to the oak tree, but Colette wasn’t there. I searched the woods, then the streets of Tiburon, and then tried peeking in the windows of her family’s home. Colette was gone. It was as if she’d simply been plucked from the earth. For the next two years I searched for her, all night, every night, but she was nowhere to be found. I found her shoe, and an old tramp found some of her clothes in a small suitcase, but those were all the clues that were ever uncovered. My darling girl had vanished without a trace. Mrs. Denkler hung herself from the rafters in her private quarters two days after Colette disappeared. I think she blamed herself for delaying me. It wasn’t her fault, but part of me held her responsible. If only she hadn’t slammed shut the vault door. If only I’d insisted that I meet Colette under our apple tree instead of letting her walk alone at night. If only I’d left town like I’d intended, instead of wooing Colette and falling in love. I spent the next several decades hating myself and longing for the life Colette and I would never share. She was gone and, although I had not harmed her, I knew I was responsible for her death. If I hadn’t loved her, she would still be among the living, the sun shining on her tempestuous hair, the birds singing their morning music just for her. For many years I thought that maybe travel might help me forget the pain that was always present within me, but it did little to blunt the agony. And I found myself compelled to return home every fall. I knew I would never see my darling girl again, but I could not keep from searching for her. Year after year, I combed the woods in the fall, when the moon was full. I continued to do so decade after decade, even though it was obvious she was gone. I also carried the misery of having caused Colette’s family pain. Not knowing what had happened to their daughter must have been the worst part. I know it was for me. Or maybe it was better that way. I couldn’t judge; I only knew that I was doomed to live for eternity without the woman I loved. It was somewhere around the turn of the century that I began to feel a change. I hadn’t forgotten Colette, or stopped loving her, but the pain somehow shifted. It became a dull ache in the corners of my soul, rather than a tangible throb in my breast. I stopped going to Europe. Tiburon was my home. I even began to go out on occasion, strolling the town’s streets after sunset. Sometimes I would take in a film at the cinema, or drop by the library on Thursday nights, when it stayed open late. It felt good to traverse the streets where I knew Colette’s footsteps had fallen. Somehow it made me feel closer to her. One evening in the early fall, I felt an urge to reread The Great Gatsby. The castle library had a signed, first-edition, of course, but I wanted to hold a book that had been caressed by many hands. I was seated in a quiet corner of the library, just starting to become engrossed in the plot, when I heard the sound of two young women hurrying into the room. Glancing up, I had the shock of my life. There, standing before me, was Colette Gibson, just as fresh and young as the first day I saw her. My darling girl had come back to me.

Here are the first couple of chapters so that you can try before you buy. xo ~ Gayla Twist Broom with a View Prologue: When an Assassination Forces a Holiday “I don’t understand why someone who is two hundred years old should know all that much more than someone who is sixteen,” said Violet Popplewell to her mother. “There’s only a limited amount of things to know in this world.” Mrs. Popplewell gave a resigned sigh while her busy hands shuffled papers at her desk in her small office. “There’s no point arguing, Violet. Your great-aunt Vera is going with you, and that is that. I know she can be a little trying at times, but a girl your age cannot simply travel to an unknown city by herself. You must admit that. Especially with things being so unsettled. ” Violet considered brooding for a moment but fought the impulse. She was a practical girl, after all, and what can’t be mended must be borne. She returned to her room to make another attempt at packing. “Unsettled.” That was her mother’s word for impending war. The Archmage of Canterbury was dead. His body, entirely drained of blood, had been found with those of his wife and child in their private chambers. There was little doubt the assassin was a Vampire. Within twenty-four hours, rumors of a looming war had spread across England like a winter storm. It didn’t matter that there was no proof that Vampires were behind the murders or even condoned the act. Nor did it matter to Mrs. Popplewell that the dastardly deed had happened in London, which might as well have been a million miles from Gallows Road in the little corner of Surrey that was the Popplewells’ home. The British Isle was no longer deemed a safe place for young Witches to dwell. For Violet, who had rarely travelled even to London, visiting X, the mysterious city-state renowned for its magic, ought to have seemed a wondrous romantic journey. But most young ladies taking their first trip abroad had months to plan down to the smallest detail of the lace pattern on a handkerchief. New wardrobes were commissioned. Farewell parties were held. And Violet would enjoy none of those niceties. She was simply being shipped off, like a parcel, to be kept out of harm’s way. Violet surveyed the state of her bedroom, sighed, and set about attempting to create order from the general disarray. Her steamer trunks were bare, while clothes, shoes, books, and toiletries were strewn across every surface of the room. Earlier that morning, she had, in her haste, attempted to enchant her clothes to arrange themselves. But instead of compliantly settling into her trunks, the gowns had chased each other about the room in a colorful display of hide-and-go-seek. The stack of books she intended as her additional travelling companions had toppled across the floor, their pages flapping as if caught in a strong breeze. Her brush and comb had attacked her, snatching and dragging at her hair; she’d had to leave the room for three-quarters of an hour to give the spell a chance to wear off. It was no use; try though she might, magic never obeyed Miss Popplewell’s wishes the way she intended. Most children born to the Craft assumed that the world was their dollhouse, to be rearranged at their whim. But harnessing the unseen forces of the world was a tricky business full of hidden complications and unseen traps. And though almost an adult, Violet still struggled to bend the magical world to her will. She frequently found that the harder she tried, the more difficult it became to cast even the simplest spell. Her mother was constantly reminding the frustrated girl that most of their kind only truly mastered the Craft in their later years, when the tempestuous fires of youth had largely sputtered out. Yet Violet’s powers always seemed just inches from her grasp. Every once in a while, she would unexpectedly conjure extraordinary wonders. Unfortunately, these anomalies came without warning, and afterward, she could never remember what she had done differently. Perhaps it was the way she held her mouth. Standing in her disorderly room, Violet hesitantly reached into her pocket and felt the familiar handle of the old magic wand that had belonged to her grandmother. Many modern Crafters no longer relied on a wand to produce magic, but for the girl, wand work always seemed to yield the best results. She gripped it for a moment, deliberated, and then decided she couldn’t face another failure. Instead, she began the dull task of packing by hand. An hour later, all the necessities of life were neatly encapsulated in two large trunks at the foot of Violet’s bed. But her satisfaction was interrupted by a sound emanating from the next room—like two pelicans simultaneously trying to swallow the same fish. Ostensibly called the guest room, the chamber next to Violet’s was almost permanently occupied by her great-aunt, Vera Tartlette. The sound was one of indescribable vexation, which Aunt Vera invariably made when faced with a world-shattering crisis. Violet heard it at least twice a week. With a small sigh, she went to check on the situation. “Do not fret, my dear,” Aunt Vera began, her voice quavering. Violet entered the room with some trepidation. “I only need a few more moments to sort myself out, and then I’ll be in to help you directly.” The guest room was in far worse shape than Violet’s had been an hour earlier. Clothes, books, toiletries, and shoes all swirled haphazardly through the air. With a sweeping gesture, Vera would transfer a pile of undergarments to the bottom of her empty steamer trunk. Then, finding dissatisfaction with their placement, she’d whisk her hands to one side to remove them again. After that, the gowns would go in, only to be removed a moment later in the same fashion. All the while, Aunt Vera chattered continuously, either to Violet or to herself, weighing the advantages of taking each item versus the hazards of leaving it behind. Knowing as she spoke that she would only make things worse, Violet ventured, “Vera, the train does have a schedule to keep.” At this point, the elderly Witch was turning in circles in the center of the little room as though, by making eye contact with each item, she could fathom its every possible use into her head. But once she lost sight of the beaded gloves or motion sickness pastilles or whatever she was looking at, the item and its usefulness were crowded out by new ones. “Don’t bedevil me with schedules,” her aunt wailed impatiently as an airborne shoe nearly collided with a lit candle. “I said I would help you and I shall, but you really must leave me to my own packing first.” “For goodness sake.” Violet felt on the edge of exasperation with her great-aunt already, and they hadn’t even set out for the station. Drawing the old wand from her pocket, almost without thinking, she made three decisive strikes through the air. In a hailstorm of clothes, shoes, books, and papers, Vera’s possessions all found their proper place, and trunk lids slammed firmly shut. The room went still. Vera gazed in silence at the neatly arranged steamer trunks for several moments, as if trying to remember where she had left her knitting. Then she blinked and, turning her eyes to her young ward, said, “There now. Shall we see about your trunks?” Chapter 1: Witch Friendly Does Not Mean Witch Exclusive The city-state of X lay somewhere on the European continent, just at the invisible line that separated the western half, land of Witches, Sorcerers, and other Crafters, from the dark eastern half, realm of the Vampires. It stood before, or rather almost encrusting, Mount Drood, a craggy bluff that rose sharply above the rolling hills surrounding it and marked the beginning of the Alps. Half the city climbed the steep slope of Mt. Drood and crowned its peak, while the other half stood almost perpetually in its shadow. To say that Violet Popplewell had always dreamt of going to X was not to say that she had actually wanted to go. Quite the contrary; since she was a small child, tales of that magical city had filled her with unease. In anxiety-filled dreams, she would find herself wandering its labyrinthine streets while tall, windowless buildings frowned down upon her. Violet’s first glimpse of X in waking life was little different from her nocturnal visions. As their train pulled into the station in the deepening gloom of early evening, she caught glimpses of the city’s towers, black against the purple sky. She’d seen pictures of the famous edifices, but nothing could have prepared her for the soaring spires of stone, iron, and glass of a city built by magic. London, but for a tiny handful of magically enhanced buildings shrouded in spells of concealment, had nothing to compare. No building crafted by Mortals could hold a candle to these impossible structures. A mighty hall lined with pillars rested on the sculpted shoulders of a stone colossus. Staircases spiraled upwards, disappearing into the sky with no visible means of support or conclusion. Walkways, and even a road or two big enough to drive a carriage across, rested on impossibly slender, graceful arched pylons—when they weren’t resting on thin air. Here and there, immense trees grew, wrapping around buildings and then providing support for additional constructions. And buildings intertwined with the naked rock of the mountain so promiscuously that one couldn’t tell what was natural and what was Crafted. The train station was their first indication of the chaos that had gripped the city. Strangely, it had never occurred to Violet that she wasn’t the only magical being seeking refuge from the impending war. Travellers crowded the platform from end to end, and getting through the bustling swarm of humanity was like swimming through a hot, angry soup. It had been an exhausting journey of barely catching their train, then crossing the channel by ferry, and then a much lengthier train ride to X. Neither lady was in the mood to be jostled. Once on the street, Vera realised that she had left her notebook on the train and couldn’t remember the name of the guest house where they had a reservation, much less where it was located. Violet suggested they cast a seeking spell, which sent Vera into a loudly whispered tirade. “Cast a spell? Here, on the street, where we might be seen by anyone?” Violet hastened to remind her aunt that, “such cautions must surely be needless in X of all places.” Any Mortal living in this city who remained ignorant of magic must be deaf, blind, and terminally stupid. Raising her hands in reluctant preparation, Vera admitted with some trepidation, “I’m afraid it’s been well over a century since I last cast this particular spell.” Having spent all her life in Surrey, she had little opportunity to get lost. The incantation did not go well. Vera stumbled over the words in a barely audible voice, for fear of being overheard by the aforementioned blind deaf mute. Her trembling hands did not aid in the creation. By the time she reached the end of the third stanza, there was only a dim light pooling around their feet, leading nowhere discernible. Violet had no desire to embarrass her aunt, but she also did not wish to keep wandering around the darkened streets where who knows what kinds of magical creatures were lurking down every alley. The girl was quite sure she’d seen a man in a black cape slip from one shadow to the next as they approached. Sneaking her wand out of her pocket, Violet created a quick enhancement spell, which she cast towards her aunt and herself. The light around their feet began to gain power. An illuminated path appeared, leading them down the street. After only a block, the trail ended at the steps of the Pensione Belladonna. “There,” Vera said, brushing her hands against each other as if to remove some invisible soot. “That wasn’t so very difficult, now was it? There never really is any reason to panic.” They mounted the steps, and the man in the cape, who had been following them by way of the shadows, faded into the night. * * * * * * * * * “The proprietress had no call to deceive us,” Aunt Vera stated over dinner. “I don’t care how crowded the city has become. What does that have to do with our reservation?” Violet had no choice but to agree. On entering the musty guest house, they were quickly bustled down a narrow wooden staircase to a pair of basement rooms with bare stone walls. The floor was damp flagstone, and both chambers strongly smelled of mold. Instead of the panoramic view of the River Stygia they’d been promised, each room had a small, arched window near the ceiling that offered views of passersby from the ankles down. Violet cast her gaze across the dining table to the English faces who were just tucking into their evening meal. “Honestly, we may as well have stayed in Surrey,” she said with a sigh. “Except that there we’d be comfortable.” “And better provided for. This mutton is entirely flavorless,” Vera replied in a disapproving whisper. “I believe it’s been drained,” came a slow, creaking voice beside Vera. An elderly Witch with skin the color of parchment and matching hair had turned to address Vera with a smile that might have been sardonic. “Drained?” replied Vera. “You know. Of blood.” Vera’s neighbour had been introduced to them as Miss Abigail Fate, one of three sisters who had been staying in X for several months. Violet liked them immediately, but she was currently positioned at the table to hear very little of what the ladies said. They were, to the girl’s mind, the best sort of elderly women—dressed in soft, lavender clothes and smelling of rosewater, with sweet, reassuring voices and ready smiles. The only odd thing about them was their three matching pairs of smoked eyeglasses, which instantly brought to mind the nursery rhyme “Three Blind Mice.” Violet prayed she didn’t accidentally hum the tune aloud. Vera was in a position to hear Miss Abigail’s words quite clearly. “I’m sorry; I’m not sure what you mean,” Vera said, addressing the senior Witch. “For the Vampires,” Miss Fate said with a smile. One of her sisters leaned in to see down the length of the table, holding a pair of opera glasses to the lenses of her eyeglasses and peering through them. “It’s a cheap way of feeding both the Crafter and Vampire guests, you see,” said the sister in a hushed voice. “Vampire guests?” Vera asked, her eyes growing very round. It became immediately obvious to the Witch that two of the patrons of the Pensione Belladonna had plates that were noticeably bare. In contrast, their wine goblets were full to the brim. And not with the Proprietress’s weak Chianti but with a thicker liquid in the darkest shade of crimson. A little shiver ran up Vera’s spine, and she couldn’t keep her eyes from darting again in the direction of the two barren place settings. The elderly gentleman seated behind one of the plates seized the opportunity to say, “My dear lady, perhaps it’s true that this little haven is not everything one could wish, but what place on this earth is?” he asked with a smile. Violet had not held tight to the thread of the conversation, but she could detect nothing but kindness in the elder gentleman’s crinkled eyes. “Surely,” he went on, addressing Miss Tartlette, “you must have come away from your comfortable and familiar home because you found it wanting in some way. And now that you are here, all is strange, and the shortcomings are not familiar ones. But what is that? I’m sure you’ll find the wonders of the great city of X are worth a few inconveniences. In my humble opinion, we who seek to drink from the font of perfection must be forever thirsty. Wouldn’t you agree, Sebastian?” At this, the gentleman turned to his companion, an elegantly dressed and handsome young man, who remained silent, swirling his wine goblet listlessly. Undaunted, the older man returned his beaming gaze towards Vera. It was obvious from the gentlemen’s appearance that they were father and son. But where the old man’s brightly colored waistcoat strained over an advancing belly and gleaming strands of silver-grey adorned his widow’s peak, the young man’s frame was still slender, and his widow’s peak was black as jet, matching his linen suit. Where the father seemed almost childlike in his jovial eagerness, the son was as somber as the grave. But it was not a sinister somberness—more the appearance of someone suffering from a severe case of melancholia. In fact, the two were so comically unalike that Violet had to restrain herself from smirking at them. “I do not expect perfection from a pensione,” Vera indignantly replied to the elder of the pair, “but we were led to expect something quite different from what we got.” They had been introduced to the two gentlemen in a general way when they sat down at table, but Vera was discomfited to realize that she had forgotten their names and wasn’t sure of the correct etiquette under the circumstances. Did the introduction actually count? “We were promised two rooms on the top floor, with a view of the river and the cathedral,” Vera said to the table at large. “Ah, I see,” said the old gentleman. “I see the trouble. Alas, in the confusion of so many arrivals, my son and I ended up in exactly two such rooms.” Vera stiffened and retorted with a crisp, “How delightful for you. I do hope you enjoy them.” “My dear lady, you misunderstand me,” the gentleman went on. “My son and I have rooms on the top floor in full sun every morning. It won’t do at all, though we had resigned ourselves to make the best of it.” Violet could feel her aunt withdrawing into herself. Vera had no ability to deal with strangers who were overly forwards. She had turned her attention to diligently cutting her mutton into perfectly uniform bites. But the man seemed so kindly; Violet could not fathom why her aunt was always so suspicious. The girl saw no reason to snub him, so, replying for Vera, she said, “I wish we were so lucky.” “But you can be,” said he, lighting the room with the warmest smile she’d encountered since leaving Surrey. “Please, allow me to explain. We have no use for morning views. Sebastian and I far prefer to slumber in the comfortable darkness of a basement room and cultivate our perfect view from within. For we believe that if the sun rises in one’s heart, then no darkness can take it away. Isn’t that right, Sebastian?” The younger man persisted in his silence. “So what I propose is this.” The gentleman continued undaunted. “We can trade our rooms for yours. Then everyone would be happy.” Violet found his smile infectious and was unable to resist returning it when he directed it her way. She wanted to accept his kind offer at once, but she felt the restraining hand of her aunt pressing on her sleeve. “I’m afraid we couldn’t possibly,” Vera said in the slightly pinched voice she used when trying to keep her composure in extreme circumstances. Her eyes bulged slightly with anxiety as she fixed her gaze on her plate. “But my dear lady!” the old gentleman protested. “Surely you can see the mutual benefit of my proposal.” He turned to the young man seated next to him. “Won’t you explain it, Sebastian? You always explain things so much better than I.” “It would not be of any inconvenience,” Sebastian said in a deep, quiet voice. “It genuinely would be our preference as much as yours.” “No, no,” Vera insisted. “We absolutely couldn’t impose upon you. It’s quite out of the question.” She dabbed at the corners of her mouth with her napkin and pushed away from the table, abandoning the mutton upon which she had labored so carefully. “Come along, my dear,” she said to her niece. Confused and alarmed at her aunt appearing so outraged, Violet allowed herself to be led out of the dining room. She really couldn’t conceive of why Vera was so offended. At the door, Violet glanced back to see the old gentleman looking crestfallen. But the young man had finally lifted his eyes and caught hers in a gaze that she found difficult to interpret. * * * * * * * * * * Having retreated to the relative privacy of the sitting room, Violet turned furiously on her great-aunt. “What possible reason could there be for not accepting their offer? You yourself said that our dreadful rooms would be the death of you. You think you know all about proper etiquette, but in truth, you’re quite rude.” “I do not understand this city,” Vera muttered aloud. “I was told that this house was Witch friendly.” “Witch friendly does not mean Witch exclusive,” came a voice behind them. It was Miss Abigail Fate with her two sisters. They had followed Violet and Vera from dinner, concerned over the discomfort of the ladies. Miss Abigail shuffled into the room, guiding the other two and gazing about the sitting room through the opera glasses that her sister had been using at dinner. Violet hadn’t realized before how old and shrivelled the three of them actually were. So much so that, when they settled onto a small couch ideally meant for two, it accommodated them all with ease. “Are you speaking of Count Du Monde and his son?” the third Fate sister asked. She had not paid attention to the conversation at dinner, instead devoting herself entirely to the task of chewing her mutton with an enormous set of false teeth. “I’m not quite sure,” Vera confessed. “I’m afraid I didn’t quite catch their names. In any event, my young niece doesn’t understand how serious a thing it is to put ourselves in the debt of perfect strangers. Especially,” she said, her voice lowering, “that sort.” Violet felt a wave of exasperation. She was so tired of people telling her she didn’t understand the ways of the world just because she’d only been in it for the interval of sixteen years. Vera was being a prig, as far as she was concerned. The old gentleman and his son were perfectly amiable, just sitting there enjoying a glass of wine and eating their… Well, come to think of it, they weren’t eating anything. Their plates were noticeably bare. Violet’s eyes widened suddenly as realization dawned on her. “Just a moment!” she exclaimed. “You don’t mean to say that,” she began and then faltered. “That kindly old gentleman?” She shook her head, unable to get a grasp on it. “Surely not.” “I’m afraid so,” said the third Miss Fate, taking the opera glasses from her sister and raising them to her smoked spectacles. “This house has always been tolerant of Vampires. Though just now, the Du Mondes are the only two.” “Vampires?” Violet whispered, barely able to form her mouth around the word. The idea left her quite breathless. “Vampires,” said Vera, disapproval rolling off her tongue. “Not to worry. They’re the good sort of Vampires,” Miss Abigail assured them. “Well behaved and polite. Not at all the sort that go around biting people on the neck whenever the impulse strikes. We rather like them, don’t we, Hazel?” “Indeed, yes,” agreed the sister next to her. “Count Du Monde can be a little informal in his manner. But as far as Vampires go, they’re quite acceptable.” Vera drew herself up, her hand flying to the lace collar at her throat. “Well, I’m not willing to accept them. Just imagine, Witches and Vampires under the same roof. It’s too vulgar to contemplate.” She turned to her niece, who stood speechless at the news. “Violet, what would your mother think if she knew I’d let you stay in such an establishment?” “Well...” Violet began, not quite sure what anyone would think. She’d always known that there were Vampires in X. It was another wonder in a city full of wonders; Vampires and Witches coexisted peacefully within its walls. But it was her understanding that Vampires primarily dwelt in Night Town, the infamous under-city where Witches never dared tread. She had assumed that X was entirely segregated. In truth, she was as shocked as Vera by the idea of sharing a roof with the undead, the mortal enemy of all Witches, creatures with whom her kind had been at war since before history began. And yet, when she considered the phrase “the mortal enemy of all Witches” and placed it in her mind under a portrait of the amiable Count Du Monde, the resulting image could only be described as absurd. How could such a kindly old gentleman be a danger to anyone? Perhaps, Violet thought reluctantly, he was using Vampire glamour to beguile her, putting her off her guard. But she’d been taught that Witches were immune to Vampire enchantments. Regardless, the Count’s behaviour could hardly be called glamorous. Mortals who survived an encounter with a Vampire always described them as “wondrous, fascinating, luminous creatures, with eyes like impossibly deep pools in which one could drown.” The words “well meaning but terribly awkward” were never part of those accounts. Besides, the Misses Fate considered these Vampires perfectly acceptable dinner companions. And the Fate sisters were obviously very traditional Witches. So Violet didn’t see why Vera should be making such a fuss. Go here to keep reading Broom with a View xo ~ GT",

Colette reached up and caressed the heart. “I’ve never loved a gift more,” she told me. “I’m so glad,” was my reply. “You must promise me to always wear it. Especially at night,” I added. “Promise that you’ll never take it off.” “I’ll never take it off,” she assured me, pressing the pendant to her own heart. “But why especially at night?” she asked. “Oh.” I hadn’t even realized I’d urged her to do so. “I...” I stammered, scrambling for any plausible excuse. “I just worry about you, sometimes. You and your sister riding your bicycles home after the sun has gone down. I just feel like if you wear this pendant, then it will be like a good-luck token.” Colette bestowed me with another one of her lovely smiles. “I promise I’ll wear it always,” she said putting her arms around my neck to kiss me. It was challenging to kiss her with the silver being so close to my skin. The memory of the pain that had shot through my hands was still at the forefront of my brain. But none of that mattered if the little trinket kept my darling girl safe from harm. I would have walked out into the noon day sun for her. Something caught my attention and I quickly scanned the skies. It wasn’t so much a noise that had reached my ears, but more like a silence. It was the silence of a bird taking wing. Or a vampire rising into the sky. Chapter 39 Colette The next morning, I couldn’t have been happier as I gathered blossoms for Jessie’s sick brother. The vivid wildflowers of summer had been replaced by the hardy sunflowers and Queen Ann’s lace of fall. The pendant hanging around my neck sent little shivers of happiness up my spine every time it brushed against my skin. The chain was long enough that I could tuck the pendant under the bodice of my dress and it wasn’t too visible with the heart nestling between my breasts. With the sun warming my face, I closed my eyes and thought of Jessie. His kisses filled me with an anticipation that I found challenging to suppress. I so desperately wanted to be with him in every way. I wanted to lie in bed with him, our bodies pressed together, smelling his warm-penny breath. I wanted to know what it was to be a woman and how it felt to be with him as my man. A little shiver of desire crept up my spine. Was seventeen too young to get married, if you knew you were truly in love? “How many flowers does one sick boy need?” Lilly called out as she coasted her bicycle to a stop. I opened my eyes and looked down, releasing a small laugh. I’d been enjoying the humming of the bees, and the grasses gently tugging at my skirt, so much that I hadn’t realized the enormous size of the bouquet I was holding. “What’s that?” Lilly asked as I was putting the flowers in my bicycle’s basket. She reached forward, touching the silver heart dangling from my neck and making it sway. “Oh.” I took half a step backward and covered the pendent with my hand. I guess it had slipped out of the top of my dress when I was bending over to pluck the flowers. “It’s…” I stammered. “Where’d you get it?” Lilly wanted to know. I had no explanation for her. All I could do was stare at her, wide-eyed. My sister’s face grew hard. “Did he give it to you?” I nodded my head. “For my birthday.” “I thought that was over,” Lilly said in a tight voice as she remounted her bicycle. “No,” I told her, also climbing on mine. “It’s definitely not over.” “I hope he hasn’t taken advantage of you,” Lilly said. “That’s usually what happens when the rich boy starts sniffing around the maid.” “It’s nothing like that,” I exclaimed. “You sound like Mama.” Lilly shrugged. “She’s right about a lot of things.” “She wasn’t right about Lev Wilson,” I pointed out as I pushed down on a pedal to get my bike rolling. “She still thinks he’s a nice boy.” “Just be careful,” my sister said, following me. “He’s always been a gentleman,” I insisted, not wanting to say his name out loud for some reason. “That’s not what I’m talking about,” Lilly told me. “At least not completely.” “What, then?” I asked over my shoulder. “I don’t know.” She rode for a few moments in silence. “There’s just something so very peculiar about the Vanderlind family. I don’t like their eyes.” “What about their eyes?” I asked. I loved gazing into Jessie’s eyes. “Their eyes all are the same color,” Lilly said. “Gray. And they’re all so cold... Sometimes it makes me think they’re dead inside, the blank grayness of their eyes.” Lilly was being ridiculous. Jessie was so loving and passionate and wonderful. He couldn’t have been more alive. “Don’t pester me with those,” Mrs. Denkler said when she saw the enormous bouquet I had gathered. “Just take them upstairs. And don’t bother Arthur.” At that point I had taken the flowers up to Arthur’s room numerous times, but the housekeeper always felt the need to warn me that the Vanderlind invalid needed to be left alone. Lilly was right, I thought as I arranged the blossoms in a vase. I had gone a little overboard with my flower gathering that morning. I needed a much larger vase than usual and I could barely see around it at I tottered up the stairs. At the top of the steps, as I peered through the flowers as thick as shrubbery, I thought I saw a figure slipping out of Arthur’s room. Moving my head to one side of the arrangement, I had a clearer view, but I was only able to catch a glimpse of Daniel heading around a corner at the end of the hall. I thought maybe he glanced back at me, but then again, maybe he didn’t. I made my way over to Arthur’s door and set the overfilled vase on the ground. As I pulled my arms away from the arrangement, the flowers expanded and pushed the door to the room open several inches. I froze, not sure what to do. The door was always firmly shut and Mrs. Denkler had warned us in no uncertain terms that we were to never bother Arthur under any circumstances. Did I close the door or leave it open? It was hard to know which was best. After giving it some quick thought, I decided I would just ease the door closed as quietly as possible. The family wanted Arthur to have privacy, after all. I meant to just gently tug the door shut and go back downstairs, but I couldn’t help glancing inside as I reached for the knob. And then I pulled up short. The room appeared to be empty. I guess I had been expecting a large hospital bed and a young man propped up on a pile of pillows, with a nurse tending to him, and some tubes coming out of his arm. But there was no bed, no nurse, not even a young man. At least there wasn’t a young man that I could see. The portion of the room that I could view through the crack in the door was bereft of any furniture. I felt something cold run through me. Glancing up, I double-checked that I was standing in front of the correct door, the one with the bird over it. What was going on? I felt the urge to open the door the entirely, but I also felt like I should just pretend that nothing happened and hurry back down the stairs. Indecision kept me glued to the floor, right at the threshold of the room, for several seconds. I thought about Jessie and how he had tried numerous times to confess his family’s sins to me, but I wouldn’t let him. Then, although my curiosity was killing me, I took hold of the doorknob and eased the door shut. “Is it what you were expecting?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She was standing right behind me and I was barely able to suppress a shriek. “I wasn’t expecting anything,” I told her, backing away from the door a few steps. “When I put the vase down, some of the flowers popped the door open, so I thought I should pull it shut.” Mrs. Denkler frowned. “Don’t lie to me, young lady. I saw you leaving the room. You had yourself a right good snoop.” “I didn’t,” I insisted. “I promise. All I did was stand here for a moment and then try to close the door.” The housekeeper looked like she was on the verge of believing me, when her eyes alighted on my neck. “What’s this?” she demanded, snatching at the pendant that Jessie had given me. “Didn’t I make myself perfectly clear on your first day that you are to wear no personal adornments whatsoever?” “I’m sorry, Mrs. Denkler,” I blurted. “I do remember you telling us, but…” “And silver, nonetheless,” she said, yanking at the chain and causing my head to jerk forward. “What in the world were you thinking?” “I’m sorry,” I said again. “It’s just…” She pulled at the chain another time. “Why on God’s green earth would you wear this?” she demanded. “I have to wear it,” I told her, trying to pry her hand open as she clutched at the locket. “I was told to wear it. Now let go or the clasp is going to break.” “Told to wear it?” she all but shouted. “And who, pray tell, told you to wear it?” “Jessie Vanderlind.” The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. Mrs. Denkler stopped yanking on the pendant, but she did not let go. “Jessie Vanderlind?” she repeated, her eyes wide as if she was having trouble understanding the words. Then she focused on me and gave a sneer of a smile. “Well,” she said, slowly. “Haven’t you been up to all kinds of little tricks? And right under my nose. I should have known better than to hire the likes of you.” The old lady laughed. “And here I thought you were just some good little girl. Oh, so very nice, always gathering flowers for a sick boy.” She jerked on the chain again and I clutched at her hand to stop her from breaking it. “Little did I realize you were just doing it to suck-up. How dare you even think you had a chance of winning the heart of someone like Jessie Vanderlind?” Angry tears filled my eyes. “Why shouldn’t I? He’s good and he’s kind. He loves me and I love him.” “Love?” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed with a rueful laugh. “You are such a little fool.” She looked my face over, closely. “You have no idea what’s going on. Do you? He hasn’t told you a thing.” No, Jessie hadn’t told me he loved me. Not in so many words. Or at least not in a language that I understood. But I knew it in my heart every time he looked at me. I felt it every time we kissed. “He does love me,” I insisted, practically clawing at her hand, but the old woman had a grip like a vice. This elicited more laughter from Mrs. Denkler. “You are such a fool. Someone like Jessie doesn’t know how to love.” She gave me a shake. “That part of him died when he was made.” “No,” I insisted, trying to push her off of me. Her words made no sense. “He loves me. I know he does. And I love him. I love Jessie Vanderlind.” “You have no idea what it takes to love a member of this family,” Mrs. Denkler hissed. “You don’t even know who the Vanderlinds really are. If he loves you so much, then why hasn’t he told you the truth about his family?” “He’s tried,” I insisted. “He’s tried dozens of times, but I wouldn’t let him.” She froze for a moment, her eyes looking quite wild. “I believe you,” she said. “But that makes things worse. Just wait until I tell his grandfather.” “His grandfather is dead,” I whimpered. “Mr. Vanderlind is dead.” “He will never be dead!” Mrs. Denkler shouted. “Do you hear me?” she demanded, giving me another good shake. “A man like that can never die!” “Stop it,” I cried, thrashing against her might, as well as her words. “Leave me alone,” I wailed, using all my strength to wrench myself free. But she yanked me back in the other direction. The clasp of the pendant finally snapping under the strain. I ended up falling forward and crashing through the door to Arthur’s room. I lay there, groaning for a moment. The castle’s floor was hard stone and the wind had been knocked out of me. My elbow throbbed and I let out a sharp whimper when I tried to push myself up. Through a blur of pain, I took in the room. It was, as I’d gleaned through the crack in the door, almost completely devoid of furniture. At the far end of the room there was some type of appliance. It looked like a large icebox, or some kind of new, fancy refrigerator. There was also a small sideboard laid out with rows of clean goblets on one side and dirty on the other. The dirty glasses were coated with the remnants of something that was red and looked sticky. A few flies circled lazily around the soiled crystal. The flowers I had gathered yesterday had been placed to the left of the sideboard, out of the way. “Where’s Arthur?” I asked, cradling my injured arm. Mrs. Denkler just stood there, looking down at me, clutching Jessie’s pendent in her fist. “There is no Arthur,” she told me. “Now get up.” Reaching down, she grabbed me by the shoulders and hauled me to my feet. “I don’t understand,” I said, feeling tearful again. “What happened to him?” “Nothing happened to him,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “You are such a stupid child. Isn’t it obvious?” “No.” I shook my head, covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to look at the room. I didn’t want to see the soiled goblets, all sticky and red. The housekeeper drew a sharp breath, her hands at her sides, balled into such tight fists that her knuckles were white. And then she sighed, her hands releasing, Jessie’s gift slipped through her fingers and onto the floor. “Arthur was sent to New York last week,” she said, her voice becoming much softer. I could tell she was trying to be reassuring. “There’s a clinic there. They think they might have a cure.” “But where are all of his things?” I asked, glancing around at the empty room. “He took everything with him,” she informed me. “He might be there for awhile.” “But…” I couldn’t stop shaking. “Why are you still taking blood donations if Arthur’s not here?” I forced myself not to glance in the direction of the large refrigerator at the far end of the room. “I’ve seen people lining up outside the clinic door, just like usual.” “It’s because…” Mrs. Denkler smoothed her hands over her skirt and I could tell she was casting about for an explanation. “It’s because so many people in the town have come to depend on earning a few extra dollars from donating blood.” She folded her hands in front of her and looked me in the eye. “The family didn’t want to take that money away from people in need. So all the blood is going to local hospitals.” She nodded her head, indicating the back of the castle. “You’ve seen the ambulances drive up and haul the blood away.” “Oh... “I forced myself to stop trembling. “Yes. I hadn’t thought of that. It’s very good of the Vanderlinds to provide such a service.” I forced myself not to think about the soiled goblets on the sideboard. I knew no good would come from asking their purpose. “Yes, they are a great family,” Mrs. Denkler said with conviction. “I’ve never met finer.” “I’m sorry for causing trouble,” I said, trying to stand up straight, but still feeling the need to clutch my elbow; it throbbed with a deep ache. I had to wonder if it was broken. “It’s just when I set the flowers down, the door popped open. That’s all.” “I understand,” Mrs. Denkler said in a voice that was almost kind. “It’s usually locked. I guess someone was careless and left it open.” She stepped forward and touched me on the shoulder. “You’ve had a rough day and I think you should go home now. I’ll have one of the chauffeurs take you home in the car.” “But what about my sister?” I asked, almost afraid to leave Lilly there without me. “And my bicycle?” “I’ll request one of the larger cars,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “There will be ample room to put your bicycle in the back. As for your sister, I’ll tell her you weren’t feeling well so I sent you home.” “Thank you,” I said in a choked whisper, staring hard at the floor. I wanted to ask to take Jessie’s gift with me, but she was staring at me too intently. “I need you to think very closely about what you’ve seen here today,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I need you to think about your relationship with Jessie Vanderlind. I understand that he’s a very handsome young man and I’m sure he can be charming when he chooses, but I hope you also understand that pursuing such a relationship might not be such a healthy choice for a young girl like you.” She reached out and squeezed my shoulder again, this time in a much firmer grip. “You might want to consider seeking other employment, if working here at the castle makes you uncomfortable.” The strength of her grip increased, making me squirm under its pressure. “But mind me when I tell you not to discuss what you’ve seen here,” she said. “About Arthur. The good people of Tiburon don’t need to know anything more about him. If the blood donations were to stop, then that could make things very unpleasant for a great many people.” Chapter 40 Jessie Mother, Emily and I were sitting in the dining hall, enjoying our evening repast when Daniel stalked in. We were used to him being moody and entitled, so his attitude was no surprise, but his presence seemed to fill the very air with disapproval. “Is there something you want to share with us?” Mother asked. “Am I to guess that there is something going on?” Knowing Mother, she just wanted to get on with whatever criticism Daniel was about to rain down on us. “Why don’t you ask him what’s going on?” Daniel said, thrusting his chin in my direction. “It’s called diner,” I said, lifting my goblet for his benefit. “Maybe you should have some. It might make you feel better.” Emily was seated next to mother, enjoying a meal of roasted pork and mashed sweet potatoes. I hated when Daniel had one of his little temper tantrums in front of her. She was at an impressionable age and I didn’t want her to think that she had to tolerate such poor behavior from a man. She kept her head bent to her meal, but I knew she was observing our exchange through her lashes. “It case you haven’t noticed,” Daniel said, continuing to address our mother, “your second son has been diddling with one of the housemaids.” If this came as a surprise to Mother, she did not react as if it was. She simply regarded Daniel with a calm expression on her face. “And you feel that Jessie’s activities somehow affect you?” “It could have damning repercussions for all of us,” he exclaimed. “I don’t see why he couldn’t just go to a cat house if he wants some pretty little mortal to toy with.” “He’s not toying with her,” Emily said, straightening up from her meal. “He’s in love with her.” She looked over at me, her eyes glowing. “And she is completely in love with him.” “That’s completely preposterous,” Daniel practically shouted. “No Vanderlind would soil himself by falling in love with a mortal girl.” Mother turned to look at me, her eyes filled with curiosity, but also encouragement. “Is this true, Jessie? Have you fallen in love with a mortal?” “Yes,” I said, addressing my mother, but steadfastly staring at my brother. “I am in love with Colette Gibson. She is a mortal young woman who works as a maid in this house.” “I knew it,” Daniel all but howled. “I knew you were too soft-hearted. You’ll bring shame to us all. You disgust me.” “Daniel, that’s hardly called for,” our mother chastised him. “And besides, falling in love is the best sort of news. It’s a reason to celebrate.” “Your son admits to being in love with a mortal and you think that’s good news?” Daniel was aghast. “Excuse me, but I really don’t want to be staked in my coffin because of his foolishness. God only knows how much he’s told her about our family.” “I haven’t told her anything,” I said, rising so quickly from my chair that it tipped over. “I’ve actually wanted to tell her. I thought I owed her the truth. But she refused to hear it. She said that she wanted to get to know me and not have her feelings influenced by any dark secrets the Vanderlinds might be concealing.” “She’s obviously just a little gold digger,” Daniel insisted. “She shows you the shapeliness of her ankle and suddenly you fancy yourself in love.” I wanted to fly across the room and smash my brother in the face. But I also knew that he probably wanted me to lose my temper and I wasn’t going to play his game. “I am in love,” I told him. “I know that’s an emotion you don’t easily understand, but just because you’ve never felt love doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.” “At least I know better than to fall in love with some little trollop who probably only sees you as a meal ticket.” He rubbed his chin. “Or maybe that’s how you see her? Were you waiting for someone pure so you could slake both your lust and your appetite?” “Boys!” Mother thundered, slapping her palm down loudly on the table. “That is enough.” She turned to my brother. “Daniel, you are acting beyond ill-bred. Didn’t I raise you to have better manners than this?” “Yes, Mother,” Daniel said, immediately cowed by her displeasure. “I’m glad you realize that,” Mother said. “Now take a seat and let’s hear what your brother has to say.” She turned to me. “Jessie, it makes me so happy to hear that you’ve found someone you care about. And you obviously know that loving a mortal comes with many disadvantages, so I know you didn’t enter into this thing lightly.” Her gaze was steady, but also kind. “I’d like to know what your plans are. Do you think you’d like to turn this girl and make her your bride? Is she the type of young lady who would fare well as a vampire?” “I don’t know,” I had to admit. I loved Colette with every ounce of my soul and I wanted to be with her every moment of the day, but the idea of turning her into a member of the undead had never entered my mind. I loved her for who she was, not for who she might become. “I’d have to give it some thought.” “It’s actually something you should have thought about before you started pawing at her,” Daniel grumbled. “Daniel,” Mother said, sharply. Then she turned back to me. “If you’re truly in love with this girl, then her future is something you have to think about very carefully.” I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no shred of doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. I nodded to Mother. “I understand.” Chapter 41 Colette Mama came running out of the house, apron still tied around her waist, when she saw the big car pull into the driveway. “What happened?” she asked, racing down the steps. “Are you alright?” “I’m fine,” I told her. “Mostly fine. I slipped off a ladder while dusting and hurt my elbow.” My arm had actually stopped throbbing, so I knew it was going to be fine, but it was also a convenient excuse for why I’d left work early. “Here, let me help you into the house,” Mama said, putting her arm around me. “Do you think I should call Doctor Winters?” “No, I don’t think so,” I told her. “It’s probably just really bruised. I’m sure it’ll be better if we just use some ice.” We didn’t have any ice in the house, so Mama sent the chauffeur off to get some. He looked like he wanted to protest, but my mother didn’t give him the opportunity. Then she tucked me in bed and fussed over me, making sure I was comfortable. “Are you sure it’s just your elbow?” she asked, once I was situated. “You seem very upset.” “I’m still a little rattled from the fall,” I assured her. “The castle floors are really hard and I was worried I was going to crack my head.” Mama kissed my head several times just to ward off the horrible thoughts that had obviously entered her brain. “I’m glad you’re alright. But let’s keep an eye on that arm of yours. If it swells more or the pain starts increasing, then I think we should call Dr. Winters anyway. Better safe than sorry.” After letting my mother fuss a bit more, I feigned sleepiness and she left the room. I loved my mother dearly and felt comforted by having her there with me, but I also needed time alone to think. Did Arthur exist? That was a big question that I had no way of answering. The state of his room indicated that he didn’t. Even if he had left for a clinic in New York, then there would still have been some remnants of his having stayed in the room for months on end. There would have been clothes, or leftover medical equipment. And he probably wouldn’t have taken all of his furniture with him. Not if he intended to return to his family home. No, there was nothing to indicate that Arthur had ever been a real person. If I believed that the Vanderlinds did not have a hemophiliac son, then that left a gaping question in need of an explanation. What did they do with the blood? That evening my arm felt much better, yet I didn’t go downstairs for dinner. I didn’t feel like I could face my family. Mama accommodated me by bringing a tray to my room, even though I had very little appetite. “What happened to you today?” Lilly whispered to me, once our bedroom light was off and we were both tucked in our beds. “I slipped and fell,” I told her. “You know how hard the floors are in the castle.” “Mama seems to think you fell off a ladder in the library,” she said. “But I know that’s not true.” Falling off a ladder seemed like such an easy excuse when the chauffeur drove me home. I had forgotten that Lilly would immediately see it for a lie. “I just slipped when I went to take the flowers upstairs,” I told her. Lilly was silent for a moment. “Was Jessie there when you fell?” “No,” I assured her. “But Mrs. Denkler was.” It took a long time for my sister to fall asleep. She knew I was lying about how I’d been injured, but she didn’t pester me for the truth. I was tempted to tell her anyway. I was confused and frightened. I wanted to talk to someone. I wanted someone I trusted to tell me I was being foolish and that there was probably a reasonable explanation for everything. Plus Lilly and I had always shared our secrets, ever since we were little girls. It was a struggle not to tell her, but I knew if I did, then she would tell Mama and Papa. And then we would be forced to give up our positions at the castle. And I would probably never see Jessie again. After more than an hour, my sister’s breathing took on the steady rhythm of the sleeper. But I stayed tucked in my bed, paralyzed with indecisiveness. I loved Jessie. There was no doubt in my mind that I loved him. But that didn’t mean I wasn’t afraid. Finally I couldn’t stand it any longer and I slipped out of bed. Castle gossip being what it was, Jessie had probably already heard about my accident. I wondered how much Mrs. Denkler had told the family about my Arthur discovery. Was Jessie outside the house waiting for me at that very moment? I wouldn’t go outside. Mrs. Denkler had frightened me enough to make that an impossibility. But I had to know if he was out there. Stealing across the room, I pressed myself against the wall, right next to the window. I had to know if he was outside, but I didn’t want him to see me. Our room was dark and the moon was getting close to full. I doubted Jessie would be able to see me, but I still only pulled the curtain aside just enough to peep out. It was difficult for me to see anything on the lawn in the middle of the night. I could make out the apple tree where Jessie and I spent so many wonderful nights arm-in-arm. The tree’s leaves were changing color and falling to the ground. I felt a pang in my chest. I wondered if there was any way I could give Jessie up. I would have to leave my position at the castle, but I had to leave that anyway, once the school was reopened. Ending my secret love affair with Jessie Vanderlind would break my heart. But I knew deep down that it was also probably the smartest thing I could do. No good could come from me being sucked deeper and deeper into whatever dark secret the Vanderlinds were hiding. And then Jessie stepped out of the shadows and looked up at the window where I stood. I thought the darkness would conceal me, but it was obvious that he could see me plain as day. His hair was ruffled and his dark coat billowed around his legs as the wind kicked up. I couldn’t move. All thoughts of my own safety vanished from my mind. All I wanted to do was to run to Jessie, to be with Jessie. Pushing the curtain aside, I pressed one hand against the window’s glass. Jessie took another step forward in response. “What are you doing?” Lilly called from her bed. “What are you looking at out there?” “Nothing,” I told her, hastily stepping away from the window. “I just saw something. I thought there was a fox in the yard, but I think it’s probably just the neighbor’s dog.” “Well, get back in bed,” she told me. “Aren’t you freezing?” “No,” I told her, shaking my head. I hadn’t even noticed the cold. I did not want to go to work the next day, so I claimed that my arm was still too painful to do any polishing or dusting. And it did still hurt quite a bit when I tried to move it. The truth was that I didn’t know what to make of my emotions and working in the castle all day wasn’t going to help me figure them out. Whenever I was anywhere close to Jessie, all I wanted to do was be with him. I needed to have my head clear so I could think things out. Of course I regretted my decision just as soon as Mama left to drive Lilly over in the car. At least when I was in the castle, there was always the hope of a chance-encounter with Jessie. I had no hope of seeing him while sulking around the house all day. But why did I want to see him so desperately? Being away from Jessie felt almost physically painful. But I also felt like I was losing my mind. Was this how everyone my age felt when they fell in love? Was this how Lilly felt about Walter? I went out for a walk to try to clear my head. “You’re so restless today. Do you have a fever?” Mama asked when we sat down for lunch. She pressed her lips to my forehead. “No, you feel just fine.” “I didn’t sleep well last night,” I told her. “I think I’m just overtired.” The day seemed to stretch on forever. I began to look forward to Lilly returning home from work in the hope that she had some news of Jessie. Maybe Emily had spoken to her or maybe Mrs. Denkler had a message for me. But when my sister got home there was nothing. It had apparently been just an ordinary day of dusting and polishing. By the time the sun started to set, I’d worked myself up into a mental state of torment. I began to understand why Guinevere had locked herself away in a convent because she couldn’t deal with how she felt about Lancelot while still being married to the king. As night drew in, I came to a conclusion. Being with Jessie was wrong. I could feel it in my gut that there was danger in the castle. But that didn’t keep me from loving him. I spent hours tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep, but fearing to look out the window. And then, when I finally did manage to close my eyes, I had a tortuous dream where Jessie and I were in love, but I was prohibited from marrying him. Instead I was packed off in a horse drawn carriage and sent far away. The last I saw of Jessie was his figure fading in the distance as he watched the coach carry me off. “How do you feel?” Mama asked when I came downstairs the next morning. “Better,” I told her, but that was only part of the truth. Yes, my arm did feel quite a bit better. — It was only a little sore. — But I actually felt better because I had come to a decision. It was true that I had been frightened by what Mrs. Denkler partially revealed to me about the Vanderlind family. There was obviously a secret there much darker than I had ever imagined. My mind couldn’t even begin to fathom what it might be. But I also knew that nothing could stop me from loving Jessie. If, for some reason, I was never to see him again, I would still love him just as passionately until the day I died as I did at that very moment. I knew I was barely seventeen and these were crazy thoughts for someone my age, but I felt my love for him deep in my soul. It was like it had always been there. Meeting him for the first time had just awoken those feelings from hibernation. I walked into town that afternoon with something on my mind. Would Jessie forgive me for the way I behaved? How could I let him know that I didn’t care about his family’s curse; I loved him for being him. As I strolled along, I stopped to look in the window of Houghton’s and then an idea came to me. The jewelry store was closed on Sundays, but I knew Mr. Houghton lived in the rooms above the shop, so I took a chance and rang the bell. “Yes, young lady?” Mr. Houghton said, peering out of a window on the second floor. He was an older man who lived by himself and had no family. His white hair stuck out on either side of his balding head so that he reminded me of how I’d always imagined Kris Kringle. “Sorry to bother you,” I called up to him. “But I need to buy a present and I have to have it for tonight.” Mr. Houghton was kind enough to open his store just for me. I had been earning good money for the whole summer, but giving most of it to Mama and Papa, so I didn’t have much to spend. There was a gold plated pocket watch that I thought Jessie might like, even though pocket watches were quickly going out of fashion. I had enough money for the watch itself, but not enough for any engraving. Mr. Houghton looked at me from over the top of his bifocals and said, “I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I’m running a Sunday special. Today only, engraving is free.” It took me several minutes to think of just the right words. When I had decided, Mr. Houghton engraved them on the inside of the watch cover. He wrote: Our love is timeless. All of my heart, Lettie As I walked home, Jessie’s present concealed in the pocket of my coat, I wondered if Jessie would come see me that night. I didn’t know if he was angry with me or hurt by my behavior. All I knew was I had to speak to Jessie Vanderlind and earn his forgiveness. Chapter 30 Colette “Did you know you were in love with Walter the first time you met him?” I asked as Lilly and I got ready for bed. My sister had been brushing her hair in front of the mirror and she paused as she thought about it. “I knew that I thought he was good looking,” she told me. “I knew right away that I found him attractive.” “But how long until you knew you were in love with him?” I persisted as I wiggled into my nightgown. “And who says I am in love with Walter?” she asked, giving me a coy look over her shoulder. “Oh, come on, Lilly,” I told her. “How long until you knew you were in love?” “Not that long,” she admitted. “I knew that I liked him a whole lot and then one day I just knew it was love. I think I really knew it at the dance when, instead of trying to defend Lev’s behavior, he was instantly trying to think of another way to get us home. That’s when I knew I wanted to marry him.” I took a moment to digest the fact that my sister knew she wanted to marry Walter Bennett. “And you think you’d feel differently if he’d rushed to Lev’s defense and said some horrible excuse like, ‘boys will be boy,’ or something like that?” Lilly frowned a little. “I don’t know. I’d like to think that I would. But I also know Walter, and he would never say anything so aweful. That’s a big part of the reason why I love him.” I envied Lilly. Her love for Walter seemed so simple. They loved each other and one day they would get married. There was no disease. There was no difference in social position. There wasn’t some dark family curse keeping them apart. “Are in love?” Lilly asked. Her question caught me by surprise. I wanted to tell her yes. I wanted to share that I was madly in love with Jessie Vanderlind and that he was in love with me. It didn’t feel right to keep my feelings from her, even thought I’d been fighting for the last few days to keep them from myself. “I don’t know,” I told her, after giving it some thought. “Things are complicated.” Lilly shook her head. “If the first word out of your mouth wasn’t yes, then you’re not in love. That’s not how love feels.” I pulled down the blankets on my bed and climbed in. “I guess you would know.” “Well, I’m glad if you’re not,” she said, reaching over to switch off the lamp that sat on a small table between our two beds. “I mean, I want you to be in love, but not with that Vanderlind boy. I know he’s beautiful, but there’s something not right with that family. I don’t know what it is, but there’s obviously something not quite right.” I thought about Lilly’s words as I waited for her to fall asleep. My first impulse had been to admit to her that I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. In fact, I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. But I was still reluctant to tell her. Maybe it was because I knew Lilly would disapprove. Maybe it was because I wasn’t sure of Jessie’s feelings. We’d never said I love you, but I had no doubt about my feelings. Once Lilly’s breathing became regular, I put on my robe and slipped outside. I didn’t know if Jessie was going to be there, but I was ready to wait all night. As I hurried across the lawn, Jessie stepped out of the shadows and caught me in his arms. “Oh, Jessie,” I exclaimed in a loud whisper, my voice practically startled out of me. “What happened?” he asked, a concerned frown pulling at the corners of his mouth. “Mrs. Denkler said she had to send you home on Friday. And then I saw you in the window Friday night, but you didn’t come out.” “I went upstairs to leave Arthur’s flowers in the hallway, but his door popped open a few inches,” I told him, taking strength from the fact that his arms were still around me. “I went to pull it closed, but then Mrs. Denkler came up and accused me of looking in the room.” “Oh,” Jessie said, looking even graver than he had before. “And then she saw the pendant you gave me and she grew very angry. We’re not allowed to wear any personal adornment at work and she tried to rip it form my neck. I stumbled and ended up falling into the room,” I confessed. “I saw what was in there. And what wasn’t.” “And what did Mrs. Denkler say to you?” he asked, cautiously. “She said that Arthur had been sent to a clinic in New York,” I admitted. “And that it would be a very bad thing for the town if the blood donations were to stop.” Jessie took me by the shoulders and held me slightly away from him so he could look into my eyes. “I should have never let this happen,” he said. “I should have just kept away, even with how I feel about you.” “No,” I told him, shaking my head. “If you feel anything for me like I feel about you, then that would have been impossible.” “I feel more for you than I ever imagined I could.” His eyes searched mine. “But I need to explain,” Jessie said, furrowing his forehead as he struggled with some dark burden that I knew he was reluctant to share. “I need to tell you about my family.” “Please don’t,” I said, closing the gap between us. “Not now. I know that there is some horrible secret that you hide from the world. But I don’t want to know. Not yet. I just want to love you, and know that you love me, and not worry about whatever your family really does with the blood for Arthur.” “I love you,” Jessie whispered, his voice hoarse. “I’ve loved you since before I even met you. I can’t begin to explain how, but it’s true.” “I know,” I told him. “I feel the exact same way.” “But still,” he went on. “This secret of my family’s... It’s much worse than you can possibly imagine.” “Please don’t,” I told him, touching his perfect lips to stop his words. “Don’t tell me you love me and then spoil it all in the next breath. Let me just enjoy this moment.” He nodded his head slightly. “I have something for you,” I said, suddenly feeling shy. Jessie was from an incredibly wealthy family. The watch I had purchased for him was only made of gold plate. “What is it?” he asked, sensing my sudden reluctance. “It’s not much,” I admitted, pulling the small package form the pocket of my robe. He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it. “If it’s from you, then I shall cherish it forever,” he assured me. I carefully observed his face as he unwrapped the watch and read the engraving. “It’s wonderful,” he said, and I could tell he was sincere. “The engraving alone means the world to me.” “I meant every word,” I told him. “I’m not sure how, but our love does feel timeless. At least it does for me.” “It does for me,” he quickly assured me. “I know that I’ll never stop loving you.” And then he dropped to one knee and took my hand. “There’s a question I need to ask you.” Chapter 42 Jessie “She left?” I asked, frowning at my little sister. “Yes,” Emily said, nodding a few times. “Mrs. Denkler sent her home in a car.” My impulse was to rush over to the Gibson house immediately to see if Colette was alright, but the sun was still shining in the sky so I wouldn’t have made it very far. “Do you have any idea what happened?” I asked, both of my hands clenched at my sides with the frustration of my impotence. “All I know is that Colette went upstairs to deliver the flowers that she brought. Mrs. Denkler followed her.” Emily shifted from foot to foot, obviously feeling anxious as well. “And then Denkie was dragging Colette downstairs by the arm and ordering the chauffeur to bring the car around to the back to take her home.” I ran my hand through my hair a few times. “Do you think it had anything to do with Arthur?” I asked. “I don’t know.” Emily looked alarmed. She knew how important it was to keep the family’s unfortunate situation a secret. “That’s the only thing I can think it might be.” Quickly, I sought Mrs. Denkler, finding her in her sitting room, having a cup of tea. “What happened to Colette?” I asked. “Who?” she asked, frowning slightly, as if trying to place the name. “Colette Gibson,” I said for clarity. “I heard that she had to go home for the day.” “Oh, you mean Miss Gibson, the housemaid,” she said, setting down her cup. “Yes, I think we may no longer be in need of Miss Gibson’s services.” “What in the world happened?” I asked. I needed some sort of explanation because my imagination was running wild. “Someone apparently left the door to Arthur’s room unlocked and it popped open. I’m afraid she saw into the room,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “I heard she was injured,” I pressed. “She stumbled and may have hurt her arm,” the housekeeper admitted. “But it was just a little bump. Nothing of consequence.” “But what did you tell her?” I asked. “How did you explain Arthur’s absence?” She gave a small shrug, as if she couldn’t understand my concern. “I said that he had left last week for a clinic in New York.” “And she believed you?” I demanded. “I see no reason why she wouldn’t believe me,” Mrs. Denkler said with the conviction of a person who was used to never being questioned. “I think she found the soiled goblets a bit disconcerting, and she did have a few questions as to why we were still paying people for their blood. But I explained that it was healthier for the town if the donations continued.” I stared at the housekeeper for several seconds, trying to decide if she was being intentionally obtuse. “Are you saying that you purposely frightened the girl?” Mrs. Denkler shook her head. “Girls like that are never frightened. Not even when it’s obvious that they should be.” She gave me a penetrating look with eyes as hard as flint. “She’s the kind of girl who always makes trouble in a great house. I should have seen that. I would have never hired her, but...” She paused for a moment with a far-away look in her eyes and then shook her head. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll release her from her position tomorrow and that will be the end of it.” “You will do no such thing,” I informed her. The housekeeper put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “I have a responsibility to run this house in the manner that it was run when your grandfather was alive. He never tolerated nonsense from the staff. Especially the kind of nonsense I suspect has been going on for the past few months.” She gave me a significant look. “The Vanderlind reputation must be upheld.” “You have an obligation to do as you are told, Mrs. Denkler,” I informed her. “You are not above being released from your position. Just remember that.” Mrs. Denkler’s eyes bulged with surprise and she clutched at the lace on her high collar. “You wouldn’t,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been the housekeeper for the castle since before you were born.” Her eyes were glistening and I saw that she was actually fighting back tears. “You’re right, Denkie,” I told her, squeezing her shoulder to be reassuring. “I wouldn’t. But let’s not fight over this. Just make sure that Miss Gibson remains employed here and we’ll say nothing else about it.” The tears were instantly replaced by Mrs. Denkler’s customary shrewd appearance. “You want the maid to stay a maid. I understand.” That was not my point, by any means, but I didn’t want to argue with her any longer. The rest of the day passed at a snail’s pace. I was practically climbing the walls. As soon as the sun dipped below the horizon, I was out the door. And outside Colette’s window a few minutes after that, concealing myself in the long shadows of the backyard. It was foolish to arrive so early. My skin was throbbing with the pain of the dwindling sunlight and Colette wouldn’t be expecting me until much later, if she was expecting me at all. But I had to be near here. I had to know that she wasn’t injured in any way. I had to know if she still loved me, or if she now considered me some kind of fiend. As the minutes slowly dragged by, I grew increasingly anxious about Colette’s affections. I’d only known her for a few short months, but her feelings for me were the axis upon which my whole world turned. If Mrs. Denkler had revealed more than she’d admitted, or if Colette was able to surmise the truth from what she saw in Arthur’s room, then there was a strong possibility that I would never hold my dear girl in my arms again. It would be a harsh reality, but one that I would more than likely have to face. I only wished that I had been the one to tell her about the curse that my grandfather had spread to all of us. That would have been the noble thing to do. Instead I just kept ignoring the truth because I so desperately wanted to be with her. If only I hadn’t caught scarlet fever. If only Grandfather had been a better man. But such was my life. I had to accept the fact that fate was a cruel master. The light in Colette’s bedroom came on as the hour approached ten and then went off again shortly thereafter. I knew that Colette shared a room with her sister and that she had to wait until Lilly had fallen asleep. I stood by our apple tree and waited, my eyes glued to the window. An hour ticked past and there was no movement that I could discern. As the second hour got underway, I saw the curtain twitch and caught a glimpse of Colette’s hair. She probably assumed she was concealed by the darkness of her room, but I could see her as plain as day. Stepping away from the tree, I stood on the lawn, looking up at her. Moving the curtain aside, Colette looked down at me. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from her. She was just so lovely; it ripped at my heart not to be able to take her in my arms. But she wasn’t moving. She wasn’t coming down to be by my side. She just stood there, safe behind the walls of her family’s home, and stared at me. Did she know the full truth? Or had she simply guessed that the secret that I’d been on the verge of telling her so many times was much worse than she’d ever imagined. I knew she hadn’t completely turned against me. If she had, then she wouldn’t have been standing there with her palm pressed against the glass. Lilly must have awoken and drawn Colette’s attention because she suddenly turned away and then disappeared from view. I stood on the lawn for most of the rest of the night, but Colette did not return to the window. I knew she wouldn’t, but I found it almost impossible to leave. I decided to sleep in my coffin that dawn. It wasn’t my usual custom, but I felt like I needed walls around me or I might explode. I hated that I was a vampire. I felt desperate to escape the prison of being a member of the undead. I longed for the simple pleasures of mortality, like holding Colette’s hand while strolling in the sunshine. “What’s this I hear about housemaids sneaking into Arthur’s room?” Daniel demanded as he stalked into the dining hall the next evening. “I knew we should have never hired anyone local.” “I think you’re being a bit overdramatic, darling,” Mother said, setting down her goblet. “One of the maids got a peek into Arthur’s room because someone left the door unlocked. But Mrs. Denkler explained it all away, so there’s no need to get your nose bent out of shape.” “Well, I think we should fire her anyway,” Daniel said, helping himself to a crystal goblet and filling it from a carafe on the table. “Or maybe get rid of her altogether. One can never be too cautious about these things.” “You will not touch one hair on her head!” I found myself snarling from my seat on the other side of the table. It was a ridiculous thing to have said. Mother was making light of the problem and that was probably the best course of action. But Daniel was so cavalier about ending the life of the girl I loved, that I found it hard to control my temper. “Oh,” my brother said with an amused smirk. “Was it the little trollop who Jessie’s been toying with? Well, this does add an intriguing twist to the evening.” “She’s not a trollop and I haven’t been toying with her,” I informed him, knowing full well that I was rising to the bait. Daniel cocked an eyebrow and took on a superior tone. “So what have you decided to do with the girl?” he asked. “Don’t leave us all in suspense.” “I’ve decided that I’m going to ask her to marry me,” I said, glaring straight back into his eyes. “You can’t!” Daniel practically shrieked. “The undead can’t marry the living. The Bishops would never stand for it.” “They would if I conjoin with her,” I said, keeping my own voice steady. “And that is what I intend to do.” “Conjoin?!” Daniel sounded like I had just offered him a slug of poison. “You know some little trollop for a few weeks and you decide you want to be with her forever?” “Yes,” I said, firmly. “Then just turn her, you fool!” my brother exclaimed. “That’s the reasonable thing to do. You can’t bond yourself for eternity to someone who is going to get old and gray while you’re still in your prime. That’s insanity.” “That’s love,” our mother said in a much quieter voice. Daniel swung around to face her. “You’re not helping!” he shouted. “Watch your tone,” she said to him. Then, turning to me, Mother said, “Sweetheart, you know that if you conjoin with a mortal, then you can never be with anyone else, not for the rest of eternity. You wouldn’t be able to be with your own kind.” “Not that a vampiress would have you,” Daniel said with a sneer. “You would probably be shunned from vampire society,” Mother pointed out. “And what would you do after she passed away?” It was a thought so painful to me that I had trouble even thinking about it. “I don’t know.” “You make me sick,” my brother said. “Thinking you’re in love... You’ve been going to the damn theater too often. You’re not in love. You don’t know anything about it.” I shrugged my shoulders. “It’s the way I feel.” “But you’re only seventeen,” Mother insisted. “How do you know it’s the way you will always feel?” “Turn her,” Daniel said. “If you don’t like her as a vampiress, you can always stake her and be done with it.” “Daniel,” Mother exclaimed. “I hope you are being facetious.” My brother gave her a flat look. “What would you have me say? He can’t conjoin with her. That would bring shame to all of us. I’m not going to be ostracized from all good society just because Jessie has a crush.” “It’s more than a crush,” I assured him. “Much more.” “Oh, save your romantic pap for the mortal,” Daniel snarled. “I don’t buy any of it.” “I’m sorry you feel that way,” I told him, “but I’m not changing my mind.” “Mother,” Daniel said, turning to face her. “Are you going to stand for this nonsense?” Our mother lifted her hands, palms up, in dismay. “The heart wants what the heart wants.” “I think the family’s honor should come before Jessie’s foolish notions of love.” I knew Daniel and I would never see eye-to-eye, so I addressed our mother when I said, “I want to go before the Bishops and explain my position.” “You will do no such thing,” Daniel snapped, shoving between us and getting right up in my face. “I won’t let you.” I gave him a steady look. “It’s not up to you.” “I am the head of this family now,” Daniel said, sticking his chin in the air. This caused me to grin. “Only in your own mind.” “Mother, are you going to allow him to do this?” Daniel whined. “Both of you need to stop,” she said in her most no-nonsense tone. “I think we should wait and allow cooler heads to prevail. Daniel, you need to stop thinking you’re in charge. I had quite enough of that from your grandfather.” Turning to me, she said, “And you need to slow down. This is a monumental decision and it shouldn’t be made on just one day’s sleep.” “But...” I intended to protest that I hadn’t made the decision lightly, but Mother held up her hand. “Daniel is right in that this decision will affect all of us, so I ask that you not do anything too hastily.” Reaching up, she caressed my cheek and looked into my eyes. “I know you don’t take love lightly,” she told me, “but I think a little patience is called for. A few months delay won’t mean the end of the world. And right now I think you really need some perspective.” “You’re wrong,” I said. “Both of you. The love I feel for Colette is different than anything I ever imagined. It’s as if my life only really began when I met her.” “I can’t stay here and listen to this nonsense,” Daniel growled. “I’m going upstairs to pack a bag. If Jessie’s going to ruin the family, I’m sure not going to stand around and watch it.” He glanced at our mother. “I’m going to New York. Call me when you’ve talk some sense into him.” If it had been only Daniel who was against me, then I would have simply ignored him. But I had always heeded the advice of my mother. I knew she had my best interest in mind. If she thought I needed time to reconsider, then I needed to take some time. Daniel was as good as his word. He left the castle later that night. I was happy to see the back of him. I didn’t need him glowering at me and complaining about the honor of the family. Families survived scandal all the time. It was true that conjoining with a mortal was something that would probably ostracize me from the undead world, but I found that the more I thought about it, the less I cared. I’d never wanted to be part of the undead world. “You won’t have enough time to make it to New York,” Mother said, as Daniel was headed out the door. “I’ll overnight in Cleveland,” he said, giving her a brusque kiss on the cheek. “I just need to get out of here before I ram a stake through Jessie’s romantic heart.” “It’s probably best that you go for a little while,” she said, leading him to the door. “Have a safe flight.” “Update me when my little brother has come to his senses,” he said, sparing me a withering glance and then disappearing into the night. It was painful, but I didn’t go to see Colette that night. My brain became too full of pink champagne bubbles whenever I was near her. I desperately wanted to fly along the river to try to clear my head. But I knew if I went outside, then I would suddenly find myself in Colette’s yard. So I stuck to the castle, spending most of the night in my room. My isolation was a special kind of torture, with my thoughts being constantly filled by Colette. I wanted to see her so desperately, and yet I had no idea if she wanted to see me. I spent another day in my coffin, practically tearing apart the upholstery. All I could think about was Colette. How could she possibly have won my heart so easily? And how could I ever give her up? Ending my romance with Colette Gibson and then leaving Tiburon for the next couple of decades would be the right thing to do. Turning her into a member of the undead would be the selfish thing to do. And conjoining with Colette for the rest of her life, and the rest of my eternity, would be the foolish thing to do. I knew all of that. The only problem was; I didn’t know which option to choose. I couldn’t see clearly which was the right path to take. By the time the sun was starting to set and I climbed out of my coffin for the evening, I knew only one thing for sure; I had to see her. I took special care dressing that evening. It was possibly the last time I would ever see my darling girl and I wanted to look my best. I put on a dark gray suit and even went so far as to decorate my lapel with a red carnation. I took my fill of blood and then slipped out of the castle without a word to anyone. I was undecided in my actions, but I didn’t want Mother or Emily to interfere. I was grateful Daniel had left. Just knowing he was in New York made me feel less on edge. As I flew along, I resolved that I had to confess. I had to explain everything to Colette and then let the cards fall where they may. She deserved to know what I was. She deserved to know the truth. Chapter 43 Colette “Colette Gibson,” Jessie said, looking up at me with his fathomless gray eyes. “Will you marry me?” “Yes,” I said, as soon as the words had passed through his perfect lips. I probably should have hesitated. I probably should have taken some time to think it over. But I didn’t want to. Every fiber of my being wanted to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I didn’t care that his family was hiding some dark, morbid secret. That had nothing to do with Jessie. That had nothing to do with our love. Jessie sprang to his feet and swept me up in his arms. Under his long coat, he was wearing some type of dark suit. There was a red flower in his lapel. He had come dressed for the occasion and I wished that I was wearing something besides my nightgown and wrapper. But then he washed all my awkwardness away by saying, “You’ve made the happiest man in the world.” And then he kissed me. It was a kiss that both filled me with heat and made me shiver. “Should we go to your family? Or should I speak to your father alone?” Jessie asked. “How are things like this handled in your country?” “I...” I stammered. I had no idea what to tell him. I wanted to be his bride, but I knew my family would insist upon a lengthy engagement and I wanted to be with Jessie that very instant. “I think we should elope.” It was as if dark clouds filled Jessie’s eyes. “Why?” he asked. “Because I can’t wait to be your wife,” I explained. “Every second I’m away from you feels like an eternity.” “But your family...” he began. “I know,” I told him. “I hate to cause my parents any grief, but once they see how happy I am as Mrs. Jessie Vanderlind, then I know they’ll forgive us for running off.” Jessie frowned. “It wouldn’t be honorable,” he said. “We’re already starting our life together with too many secrets. And if you would only let me...” “Don’t,” I said, stopping his lips with a kiss. “I know you have your secrets, but share them with me when we are husband and wife.” “When?” he asked, burying his face in my hair. “If we are to be wed, then I want it to be this instant.” “Tomorrow night,” I told him. “We can sneak down the Tiburon to Yontville and wake up the Justice of the Peace. Then I can call my family in the morning and tell them the good news.” The clouds parted from Jessie’s brow. “I love you Colette Gibson,” he told me. “I can’t believe you want to be my wife.” “I’ve never wanted anything more in the world,” I assured him. Then I thought of something. “What about your family?” I asked. He was quiet for a moment. “What about them?” “Will they approve of us?” I put a hand to my cheek at the thought of how they would react. “I can’t imagine they will.” A rich young man running off with the maid was not something fine families usually found appealing. “I hate to think of your family disliking me. And I don’t want them to think that I’m some kind of...” I fought off the urge to say gold digger. “My sister already adores you,” Jessie assured me, squeezing me in his arms. “And my mother will love you just as soon as I tell her that you are my bride.” “What about your brothers?” I asked, with some hesitancy. “What about Arthur and Daniel?” “Arthur is...” he began. “Arthur is someone we don’t have to worry about.” He shook his head and then continued with, “And Daniel left for New York last evening. We don’t expect him back for at least a month.” And then he kissed me again, a deep, penetrating kiss that I felt all the way down to my toes. “I don’t think I can wait that long,” I said, my breath catching in my throat with anticipation. “Tomorrow evening then,” he said, running his fingertips across my cheek, down my neck and to my collarbone. His caress sent shivers through my whole body. “Where shall we rendezvous? Shall I meet you here, by our favorite apple tree?” “No,” I said, thinking it over. I hated deceiving my family. It would be an emotional challenge for me to sneak off, if only for less than a day. And when I came home again, I would no longer be a girl. I would be a married woman. I wanted to leave the house by myself. I wanted to say goodbye to my present life and step away from childhood all on my own. “I’ll meet you at the castle,” I finally told him. Jessie was about to say something in protest, but I stopped him by adding, “I mean outside the castle, in the woods out there along the river. If you can arrange a boat, then we can row down to the next town.” Jessie probably could have arranged a car, but a boat sounded so much more romantic. “Are you sure that’s what you want?” Jessie asked. “It will be dark. I would feel better accompanying you.” “No, this is something I have to do on my own,” I assured him. “And besides, Tiburon is perfectly safe, day or night. We haven’t had so much as a robbery since I can remember.” “But...” Jessie tried protesting again. “How will you get there? On your bicycle? What kind of bridegroom would I be if I allowed that to happen?” “Don’t you worry about me,” I said, patting him on the forearm to assure him. “You just focus on finding a boat that doesn’t leak. Our elopement will be a lot less romantic if we ended up getting soaked.” “Shall we meet at midnight?” he asked. I nodded. “Midnight,” I repeated. “But shouldn’t we choose an exact spot? Do you know of an old tree or something? How will we find each other?” Jessie gave it some thought. “There’s that large oak tree by the water’s edge. The one where the boughs hang way out over the water.” I knew the exact tree. “Sure,” I told him. “It’s got a rope swing. In the summer, kids use it all the time for swimming.” “Oh.” Jessie frowned a little. “I’m not sure that there’s a rope swing.” “I think we’re probably talking about the same tree, but maybe we should pick someplace else, just in case.” “Don’t worry,” Jessie assured me, bending slightly to nuzzle my hair. “No matter where you are, I’ll always be able to find you.” Chapter 44 Colette I begged off from work for another day. I needed time alone in the room I shared with Lilly to prepare for my elopement, and I couldn’t exactly pack with my family around. My mother frowned when I told her that I was staying home. “If you’re still in pain, then maybe we really should call the doctor.” “I don’t think that’s necessary,” I said. “I’m sure by tomorrow I’ll be right as rain.” Mama reached up and laid her hand against my cheek, looking into my eyes. “Are you sure that’s all it is?” she asked. “It’s just a sore arm. Nothing else is bothering you?” “No.” I shook my head back and forth a few times. “Nothing at all.” I’d always been an obedient daughter and never given my parents much grief. They were good parents and I knew they loved me, so it seemed only fair to show them the same consideration. Not telling them about my engagement to Jessie was one of the most difficult things I’d ever done. But I knew if I told them, then they would want me to wait. They’d insist that I finished high school and get to know Jessie better. But I wouldn’t wait. I couldn’t wait. Being in Jessie’s arms, sharing a life together, was all I could think about. Papa needed to get out the door bright and early to make sure everything was running smoothly on the town hall project. They were going to pour the foundation soon and he wanted to make sure it was done right. Mama was going to drop him off and then drive over to meet up with a few of her old school friends who live in the next town. They got together for a luncheon a few times a year. This was perfect for my plans because it left me with the house to myself for a few hours until Mama returned. Even though I was still in my nightgown when my parents were about to leave, I ran downstairs to give both of them a hug and a kiss goodbye. “You’re being awfully affectionate this morning,” Papa remarked as I took a moment to give him a second squeeze. “Am I?” I asked, putting my arms around Mama and hugging her again, too. “I just wanted to let you know how much I love you.” Mama gave me a kiss on the head. “We love you too, you silly girl. Are you sure you don’t feel well enough to go to work? You seem to be full of energy and I wouldn’t want you to lose your position.” Gingerly moving my elbow up and down, I said, “It still hurts a little, but I’m sure I’ll be fine in another day if I just take it easy.” After they left, pulling the door closed behind them, I turned around to find Lilly sitting on the stairs, watching me. “What are you up to, Lettie?” she asked, suspicion in her eyes. “Nothing,” I assured her. “I’m just letting my arm heal.” “Is that all it is?” she asked, getting to her feet. “Because you’re acting awfully funny.” “No, I’m not,” I insisted. “If you want to give your notice at the castle, then I’m all for it,” she said. “Papa has his town hall job and then he’ll work on the school. We don’t have to keep working there. Our family’s doing fine now.” Her comment surprised me. “Don’t you like working at the castle?” “If I’m being completely honest, no,” she said. “The work is fine, but the family makes me uncomfortable. There’s something about them that’s just not right. You can see it in their eyes.” “They all have beautiful eyes,” I insisted. I couldn’t bear to hear Jessie criticized. “No.” Lilly shook her head. “They all have cold eyes. Dead eyes. Like the eyes of a shark.” “You’re being ridiculous,” I told her. “And you’re only saying that because of the color. The Vanderlinds can’t help it that their eyes are gray.” “I suppose,” Lilly said. “But I still don’t like it there. I heard that Mrs. Zucker’s cousin isn’t working out at the store. They’re going to be hiring again and I’m thinking of asking for my old job back.” My first impulse was to tell her not to do it. I couldn’t imagine leaving the castle, even if I wasn’t betrothed to Jessie. But then I thought about how odd it would be if Lilly was still working there as a maid while I was Jessie’s wife. “Maybe you should,” I told her. “That might be a good idea, seeing that you don’t like it.” “I’ll ask for you, too,” my sister told me. “I think it would be better if we left the castle together.” “Thank you,” I said, giving her a hug. “I love you, Lilly.” “I love you, too,” she said, pulling away from me while giving me another suspicious look. “But I wish I understood why you are acting so strangely.” After Lilly left for work, it didn’t take me long to decide on my wedding trousseau. I wanted to wear my organdy dress as my bridal gown, but it was still torn from my encounter with Lev Wilson. I decided on my green dress with the white flowers. It was of a light fabric, so I knew I’d probably be chilly, but once Jessie and I were together, he could put his arms around me and keep me warm. I positioned the dress and my favorite hat, the straw one with the silk daisies on it, toward the front of the closet. That way it would be easier to retrieve my clothes without disturbing my sister. After that I pulled a small suitcase down from the closet shelf, flipped it open on the bed, and packed my prettiest nightgown. I knew I would also need something to wear the next morning, so I added a sweater and a wool skirt, along with some warm tights and a few toiletries. There was still my toothbrush and a few other items, but I thought I would slip those things in at the last minute, so that no one in my family would notice anything missing. Taking a seat at my desk, I pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and found a pen. I didn’t want my family to panic when they found my bed empty in the morning. That wouldn’t be a nice thing to do to them. So I thought I would write a note, just to assure everyone that I was fine and in no danger. It would lessen the surprise when Jessie and I called the next morning as newlyweds, but it was better not to make my parents worry. Dear Family, I’m sorry for keeping this secret from you, but Jessie Vanderlind and I have fallen in love. In fact, by the time you read this note, I will already be his wife. I apologize for sneaking off and eloping in this way, but I know you would counsel me to wait to get married until we’re both a little older. I’m afraid I love Jessie too much to delay. I hope you’ll forgive me, once you see how happy he makes me. He truly is the most wonderful man I have ever met. We’ll call you when we get up. Please don’t worry until then. I’m sure Jessie will take good care of me. I love you all very much. Lettie It was just as I was signing my name when I heard the front door open and close. Snatching the note off my desk, I tossed it into the suitcase, on top of my clothes. Snapping the lid shut, I quickly tucked the whole thing under my bed. “Lettie,” I heard my mother call as she was climbing the stairs. A moment later she was poking her head in the door. “Hi, Mama,” I said. “What are you doing back so soon?” “I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said, pulling the pin from her hat. “After dropping your father off, I drove half way there before I realized the luncheon isn’t until next week.” Chapter 45 Jessie I’d already worn my favorite suit when I’d proposed to Colette, so I felt at a bit of a loss for proper wedding attire. I wondered if it would be considered bad manners to wear the suit again for the ceremony. My next choice was to wear my tuxedo, but I decided against that pretty quickly. I sincerely doubted Colette had a wedding dress tucked away in her closet and it wouldn’t do to be dressed fancier than the bride. I did have a blue suit that I’d been told was becoming, but I couldn’t seem to find it anywhere in my closet. After an extensive search, I discovered it crumpled on the floor. It must have not been hung up properly when the household contents were unpacked. It definitely needed a good pressing. When I’d flown back from Lettie’s, I’d spent the rest of the night searching for a boat. My mother had plans to get a couple of small boats for the castle, but no one had gotten around to ordering them yet. Most people who used the river had already taken their boats out of the water in anticipation of the first big freeze. I had to soar up and down the river for a few hours until a small rowboat, pulled up on the bank and turned over to dry, caught my eye. It wasn’t the most attractive of conveyances, but I hoped that Colette would find it romantic. By the time I’d towed it back to the castle and hid it in the woods, the sun was preparing to rise. As I hurried inside, the sunlight had already starting to lighten the sky, making my skin ache. I had to laugh at my own stupidity. I didn’t want to be such a distracted bridegroom that I ended up inadvertently roasting myself. Once I was safe inside the walls of the castle, I found that I was inordinately tired. But there were still so many things that I had to get done. I had to choose my wedding suit. I had to figure out a plan to avoid the sun once we’d been officially wed. I loved Lettie more than I loved my own life, but it would be a terrible shock for her to see her new husband burn to a crisp the morning after her wedding. I also needed to find some type of ring for my darling girl. I intended to have her real wedding ring specially crafted, but there wasn’t time at the moment. I would just have to go through the family vault and find a temporary ring adequate for the ceremony. My head throbbed and I realized I was hungry. I hurried to Arthur’s room and helped myself to one of the blood packets in the refrigerator. Packing had to wait, I decided as I finished my meal. I needed time to rest. The knowledge that Colette would soon be my bride must have put me at ease because I quickly found the repose that was usually so elusive. When I finally opened my eyes again, the sun had set on another day. I immediately leapt to my feet and started packing, which led to the dilemma about which suit to wear. I rang for a maid and handed her the blue suit. “I need this pressed right away,” I told her. “Bring it to me just as soon as it’s ready.” And then I headed to the vault, where we kept quite a bit of the family jewelry. The vault was a large room in the dungeon that Grandfather had converted into a walk-in safe. Three of its walls were stone and the fourth was a large, metal door with a combination lock. It would be foolhardy for a mortal to steal from vampires, but we saw no reason to subject the servants to temptation. Especially with so much jewelry around. We could easily lose dozens of pieces and never even notice for a few decades, if ever. Once I opened the vault, I was faced with a real challenge. What was an appropriate ring for a girl like Lettie? I dug through boxes upon boxes of jewelry, putting rings aside that I thought might be a possibility, but nothing seemed quite right. I knew that Lettie came from a good family, but she wasn’t used to the wealth of a family like the Vanderlinds. I didn’t want to overwhelm her with a giant diamond, but I didn’t want to insult her with a ring of no consequence. It was just impossible to put everything I felt for Miss Gibson into one tiny piece of jewelry. “You wanted to see me?” Mrs. Denkler asked, appearing in the vault’s doorway. “What?” I had been so absorbed in finding the right piece of jewelry that I hadn’t even heard her approaching. “One of the maids said you were looking for me,” she said, her eyes flitting over the pile of jewelry in front of me. “Is there something I can help you find?” “No, that’s quite alright,” I assured her. “This is…” I couldn’t think of an excuse for why I was combing through diamond rings. “I didn’t send for you,” I finally managed to say. “I just wanted my blue suit pressed.” “One of the maids is doing it now,” she said. “Is there a special occasion?” “No, no,” I assured her. “I just found my blue suit crumpled on the floor of my closet and I want it pressed.” “The maid said you wanted it right away,” she said, persisting in knowing why I was acting so suspiciously. “I’d like it done,” I told her. “Whoever hung up my clothes made a poor job of it.” “I apologize,” the housekeeper said. “I will see to it that whoever is responsible has their pay docked.” “Please don’t do that,” I said, not wanting to cause trouble for somebody else, just to conceal my own secret activities. “It’s not necessary. It’s really just the one suit.” “I believe your brother has a blue suit of similar style. If you like, I could ask him if you may borrow it. The two of you are about the same size,” she said. “Daniel is in New York,” I told her. “Isn’t he?” Mrs. Denkler gave a brief look of surprise. “Oh, yes. That’s right. I’d forgotten.” She stared at me for a moment. “May I ask if there is a specific ring you are searching for? I have all the jewelry catalogued. Perhaps I can help.” “No,” I snapped, tired of her meddling. “I’m fine. I just want to look through the vault in peace.” Mrs. Denkler stared at me for another moment, her mouth opening to say something and then shutting again, the words unsaid. Finally, she decided on, “You know that my first priority in this world is your family.” “I know,” I told her, feeling a little guilty for being short-tempered. “You’ve proven your loyalty many times. “May I at least know if you’ve eaten recently,” she asked. “I could bring you something, if you’re hungry.” “No, thank you,” I told her. “I ate just before I came down here.” “I understand,” she said. “And I hope that someday you’ll understand why I have to do this.” And then she slammed the vault door shut. Chapter 46 Colette The moon was full in the sky as I walked along the edge of the road with my hat clamped on my head and my suitcase under my arm. It was a bright evening with a real hunter’s moon illuminating everything with the unearthly quality of moon glow. It took forever for Lilly to fall asleep. She kept wanting to talk about leaving the castle and going back to Zucker’s. She was doing her best to get me excited about the plan. More than once I was on the verge of confessing the truth, but something always held me back. I was afraid she would go immediately to Mama and Papa so that they would stop me from leaving. I couldn’t have that. I couldn’t have Jessie standing alone in the woods, wondering what had happened to me. It was better to leave my family the note and call them in the morning when I was a new bride. Finally Lilly’s breathing became steady and I slipped out of bed. Gathering up my clothes and suitcase, I crept out into the hall before dressing. That way if Lilly woke up, she wouldn’t catch me in the act. She would probably just assume I was using the water closet. Saying goodbye to my girlhood home was difficult. I had to brush away more than one tear. It was only the thought of Jessie that gave me the strength to leave my family. Thinking of him spurred me onward. I had slipped out of the house and was far down the road before I remembered that the note was still in my suitcase. I’d forgotten to leave it. My family would not know what had happened to me. The thought of how worried my mother would be almost turned my feet around. But then I looked at my watch and saw that it was getting close to midnight. And I still had a very long way to walk. I resolved that I would have to get up very early and give my parents a call. That way they would only have a few minutes of worry, if any at all. I walked along, trying to hurry. It was a long way to the castle on foot. I don’t know why I didn’t tell Jessie to come get me. Then we would be walking arm-in-arm. I should have at least taken my bicycle. At the rate I was going, I wouldn’t rendezvous with Jessie until one in the morning. I spied an obliging bike on the porch of a house and decided I had to borrow it. I made sure to memorize the address and location of the house so I could return the bicycle the next day. I didn’t like the idea of taking it without permission, but time was of the essence and I hadn’t thought my plan out very clearly. Riding made things go much faster. There was even a basket on the front of the bicycle, so I balanced my suitcase there. It was a cool evening, but I was pedaling as quickly as my legs would take me. Stopping for a moment, I stripped my coat off so I wouldn’t break into a sweat. My green dress felt very thin in the night air, but I didn’t want to elope with Jessie while covered in sweat. When I reached the turnoff for the castle, I tucked the borrowed bicycle behind some trees. I didn’t want anyone else to borrow it before I had a chance to return it to its owners. Then I headed down the road toward the castle on foot with my suitcase in my hand and my coat over my arm. The night air had gone from chilly to cold, but I wanted to make sure I had fully cooled down from my ride before putting on my coat again. As the castle came into view, I stopped for a moment to take it in. I was about to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I would be his bride. Soon the castle would be my home. It felt so very right to me, like it was somehow meant-to-be. “Destiny,” I murmured to the wind. I turned left off the road, crossed a portion of the expanse of lawn that led up to the Vanderlind estate, and then started making my way through the woods. The full moon was helpful with my progress, but it was still slow going. There wasn’t enough light for me to see my watch, but I began to fear that I was late. I tried going faster, but my feet kept getting tripped up by rocks and fallen branches. I thought if I went too quickly I would twist an ankle. Jessie would just have to be patient. The deeper I went into the woods, the darker things became. I could no longer see the castle to my right and was only vaguely aware that the public road was somewhere off to my left. Not many people stayed up past midnight in Tiburon, and they definitely weren’t out driving around. I was starting to feel very alone and wished, not for the first time, that I had agreed to Jessie meeting me at my house. I had to keep going, I decided. The sooner I got to the river, the sooner I would be in Jessie’s arms. The sound of a twig snapping caused me to freeze for a moment, straining to listen. “Jessie?” I asked in a small voice. I heard nothing after that, so I kept going, quickening my pace, even though it made me stumble. Another twig snapped, but I didn’t stop. It was probably just a raccoon, or maybe even a skunk out for a midnight stroll, but I was getting spooked. I started to run. Not a flat-out sprint, but faster than a jog. “Colette.” I stopped suddenly, thinking I’d heard somebody call my name. “Jessie?” I called back. “Is that you?”I strained to hear my fiancé’s reply, but all that reached my ears was another twig snapping. I instantly knew it wasn’t Jessie. He would not toy with me. If it was him in the woods, then he would say something. He wasn’t the kind of man who took delight in terrifying a girl. Someone or something was following me. And it knew my name. Chapter 47 Jessie “Mrs. Denkler! Open the damn door! Mrs. Denkler!” I shouted, hammering on the metal until my fists were bloody. I stopped, allowing my hands a moment to heal. Our housekeeper must have gone crazy. That was the only explanation that entered my head. Why would she possibly lock me in the vault? What excuse could she offer for such behavior? I heard the sound of something scraping along the stone floor. I had to assume it was still Mrs. Denkler on the other side. “Mrs. Denkler,” I said in an elevated voice, but without shouting. “Why are you doing this?” When she still didn’t answer I said, “Denkie, please tell me. What’s going on?” “I have too much respect for your family to allow you to do what I think you’re planning on doing,” the housekeeper informed me in a calm voice. If I was still a mortal, I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear her, but my undead ears could distinguish every word. “And just what is it that you think I’m planning on doing?” I asked. “You’re running off to marry that mortal girl,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone. “The pretty one who works here as a maid.” And then, mostly to herself, she added, “This is all my fault. I should have never hired her.” Banging against the metal door was a futile gesture, but the rest of the walls were made out of stone. I knew that striking a stone wall would hurt, but I thought there was a chance I could break through one of them and get out of the vault that way. I couldn’t stand the thought of Colette being alone in the woods, thinking that I had abandoned her. Assessing the room and its orientation in the castle, I thought the wall to the right of the door was probably my best bet. Taking a deep breath to steel myself against the pain, I drew back my arm and punched the wall with all of my might. A shriek of pain escaped my lips, but I ignored it. Once the pain started to subside, I clenched my other fist and struck the wall again in the same spot. A small bit of dust drifted into the air, but the rocks were still solid and the mortar, so recently applied, didn’t crumble. “What are you doing in there?” the housekeeper asked. “Trying to get out,” I told her through clenched teeth as I cradled my hand. “You don’t have to be so dramatic,” she said. “I’ll let you out eventually. I’m just waiting until the trollop is out of the picture.” “She’ll never be out of the picture,” I informed her. “Not with the way I feel about her. I will love her for the rest of her life, and then for the rest of mine.” There was silence on the other side of the door, so I added, “Do you understand me?” My words were only met with more silence. I tried to calm myself. Beating my fists against the wall wasn’t getting me anywhere. Colette would be upset, but once I was free, I would find her and explain what had happened. She would understand that I didn’t intentionally stand her up. We could always elope in a night or two, once she had forgiven me. But I hated the thought of my darling girl in tears. I hated the thought of hurting her. And I didn’t want her to be in the woods all alone. Tiburon was a safe community, but you never knew if there was a wayward tramp or rabid dog that might be wandering the woods in the dark. I should have never agreed to let Colette walk by herself. I should have insisted that I meet her outside her home so that we could head to the river together. “Mrs. Denkler, you need to open the door right now,” I said in the calmest voice I could muster. “It’s not your place to tell me what to do and what not to do.” “So you admit that you intend to run away with her?” she asked. “Do you plan on turning the little tramp?” I kicked the wall in frustration. “She’s not a tramp,” I snarled, my voice ragged with pain as I waited for my foot to heel. “She’s the most wonderful girl in the world. And yes, I am going to marry her. I will conjoin with her. Whether you like it or not.” “But not turn her?” Mrs. Denkler asked. “You’ll leave her bound to her mortal coil?” “No, I will not turn her,” I admitted. “That is something I will never do.” “But she’ll age,” Mrs. Denkler insisted. “She’ll grow old and gray. The beauty you see now is only temporary. Her life will end and you will still be young and fresh. Why not just turn her, if you love her so much?” “Because I love her too much to do that to her,” I said, pressing my forehead against the vault door. “Loving someone means doing what’s right for her, not just what makes you happy.” And then I knew that I couldn’t marry Colette without telling her the complete truth about my family. I couldn’t bind her to me without her knowing that I was a vampire. She would try to stop me from confessing, but I loved her too much to keep the secret from her until we were wed. “Haven’t you ever loved someone like that?” I asked, stepping away from the door. My hands were fully healed, but I knew battering them against the walls would get me nowhere. I had to persuade Mrs. Denkler to open the door. “Haven’t you ever loved someone so much that you would do anything for him?” “But Colette is mortal,” Mrs. Denkler said again, her voice sounding unsure. “And you are a vampire. Some day she will die. Then what will you do?” It was a question I had asked myself many times. “I will spend eternity cherishing her memory.” There was a long pause, and then I heard the sound of the combination lock being turned. Slowly, the door cracked open. “I loved your grandfather like that,” Mrs. Denkler said, avoiding my eye as I stepped out of the vault. “I would have done anything for him. But he didn’t feel the same way about me. So I became this,” she said, raising her hands and then letting them fall to her side. “I became his servant.” “But why?” I asked. “At least it allowed me to be near him and see him every day. It allowed me to help raise his family, even if none of you are my own.” “But he offered to turn you,” I said. “I heard him do it. More than once.” The housekeeper shook her head. “He only did that once I was old and the bloom of my youth was gone. He only started making the offer when he knew I wouldn’t accept it.” I stared at her, horrified. For Grandfather to torture her in that way was unforgivable. And yet she was still devoted to him. “I’m sorry,” I told her. It was the only thing I could think of to say. Reaching forward, she pressed a hand to my forearms. “I’m sorry for what I did,” she went on. “I was so worried about protecting the Vanderlind name that I forgot to protect you.” “It’s alright,” I said, patting her hand. “I understand. But now I have to go.” “Go,” she told me. “You must hurry. I only hope it’s not too late.” I was halfway down the hall before the real meaning of her words filter through to my brain. “Too late?” I paused to ask. Mrs. Denkler gave me a strangled look. “I mean, I hope she isn’t mad at you for being late.” I gave her a smile. “I just hope I can find a way to earn her forgiveness.” Chapter 48 Colette My lungs were burning and I had to stop for a moment to catch my breath. My hat was gone, my suitcase was gone, and I was terrified because I knew I was not alone. There was something out there, stalking me through the trees. I thought I’d heard it say my name, but that was impossible because whatever was chasing me wasn’t human. The sound of some leaves rustling behind me gave me a start and I started running again. I knew I was headed deeper into the woods and away from the road. I knew the creature was flushing me away from my only chance to flag down a passing car or signal someone in a nearby house. Branches tore at my dress and ripped out my hair. One of my shoes got stuck in the mud and was pulled from my foot. A few steps after that and my other foot got tangled in a tree root and I fell to the ground with a sob. I freed my leg, but did not immediately get to my feet again. I needed to calm down. I needed to catch my breath. There was a large log next to where I’d fallen and it afforded me some protection from the eyes of the predator that was pursuing me. I just needed to rest for a moment and come up with a plan. I wished I knew what was pursuing me so that I could better figure out how to defend myself. If it was a wolf or a bear, then I needed to climb a tree. If it was a man, then I needed to find a sharp stick and defend myself. But it seemed to be both human and beast. It seemed to have the senses of an animal. It could hear me from a distance and smell my scent in the air. But it could also speak. The creature had called my name. At least I thought it had called to me. But I knew that had to just be terror fueling my imagination. It was probably a stray dog that had gone feral and was hungry. I probably looked like an easy target. All I needed to do was climb a tree and bide my time. Once it was light out, I was sure I would be able to get back to the road and flag down a motorist. Lying on the ground, not moving, made me realize how cold it was outside. There was frost on the leaves all around me. My breath started to slow. I knew I had to do something. The beast was probably still looking for me. None of the trees around me had branches low enough for me to climb. I wondered how close I was to the river. The oak tree which was to be my rendezvous point with Jessie would be easy to mount. My heart throbbed at the thought of my love. Where was he? What had happened to him? If he was in the woods, then I needed to warn him about the creature. The idea of something horrible happening to Jessie frightened me as much as the beast in the woods. Getting to the oak tree was my best bet. Then I could climb to safety and warn Jessie if he was waiting there for me. I tried to think about the way I had run and the orientation of the river. My breathing was becoming more regularly and I felt like it was time to make a move. The small creatures that provide the night with its music had taken up their melodies again. It probably meant that the beast, whatever it was, had moved on in pursuit of some other dinner. With great trepidation, I got to my feet. And there he was. Jessie, my love, was standing no more than thirty yards away. I could see him silhouetted in the moonlight. “Jessie,” I called, my heart hammering loudly in my chest. “We have to get out of here. There’s something…” I started hurrying toward him. “I don’t know what it is, but there’s some creature in the woods.” Jessie came bounding toward me, eager to be by my side. I held my arms out to him. “We have to go,” I said, fighting back a sob of relief as his arms encircled me. “There’s someone else in the woods with us.” “I know,” he said. Looking up, I saw that it wasn’t Jessie who was embracing me. It was his brother, Daniel. “Oh,” I stammered, trying to pull away from him, my mind racing. “Did Jessie send you? There’s something in the woods. Something evil.” “I know,” he said again, a wolfish smile twisting his lips. “I think it might be me.” And then I saw his teeth glinting in the moonlight. They were long white daggers of ivory. I tried to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. “Please, by all means scream,” he told me. “It makes things so much better.” I felt limp in his arms, like a rabbit paralyzed by fear as it stares into the eyes of a snake. I caught a glimpse of his eyes and suddenly I understood what Lilly had meant. Jessie’s eyes had always appeared warm and kind to me. But his brother’s eyes where that of the detached predator. He was a shark ready to strike. Daniel wrenched my head to one side. “I’m going to enjoy this so much,” he whispered into my hair. And then he lowered his head and I felt a stinging at my neck. I realized with horror that Daniel had sunk his jagged teeth into my neck. He was drinking from me. He was drinking my blood. I tried to struggle. I willed my arms and legs to move, but they were awkward and lifeless. Tears sprang to my eyes with the sure conviction that I was going to die. Daniel was some kind of demon and he was sucking the life out of me. I thought of the note that I had forgotten to leave for Mama and Papa. It was still in my suitcase, lost somewhere in the woods. I was going to die and my family would never know what had happened to me. And what about Jessie? Did he know that his brother was Satan incarnate? Or was this the evil he always wanted to tell me about, but I refused to listen. I could no longer feel my legs and my hands were ice cold. Daniel was a vampire. He was a member of the undead and he needed human blood to live. That explained Arthur and the sticky, red goblets in his room. And then I realized something else; Jessie and his mother were probably vampires, too. That explained why they could never be out in the daytime. It explained a lot of things. Jessie had wanted to tell me. He’d tried to tell me his family’s secret many times. But I wouldn’t listen. I was too stupid to ever think that there was a problem our love couldn’t surmount. I was too naive to realize that such evil existed in the world. My darling Jessie was a vampire. And yet he loved me. There was no doubt in my mind that he loved me. My vision started to blur and I closed my eyes. The world only came into focus again when my body was jarred, quite painfully. I opened my eyes to see that I had been dropped into some kind of ditch. There was loose soil all around me. I tried to think of where I was. My brain felt fuzzy and slow. Town hall, I finally decided. A work crew was digging the foundation for town hall. Papa would find me. He would find my body in the morning and then my family would know I was dead. There was some comfort in that. I didn’t want them to spend the rest of their lives wondering. I could barely move, but I turned my head to see the man who had killed me standing at the lip of the deep hole where I lay. Just then the clouds drifted away from the moon and I was able to see Daniel more clearly. At a distance he looked so much like Jessie. Tears sprang to my eyes. I would never see my love again. Daniel started kicking dirt into the hole to cover my body. Small rocks and debris rained down on me. “Why?” bubbled to my lips. “Why are you doing this?” The vampire paused for a moment, cocking his head to one side as he considered his actions. “I thought I was doing it to protect the family,” he said. “I wasn’t going to let the Vanderlind name be besmirched by some cheap, little mortal. But now that you ask me, I realize that I’m doing it to teach my brother a lesson. Maybe next time he won’t be so eager to fall in love.” The world was growing dark again and it was a struggle for me to keep my eyes open. I had lost too much blood to do anything but die. Daniel started kicking more dirt on me and I curled into a ball and closed my eyes. “Good bye, Jessie,” I whispered, hoping the night breeze would carry my words to his ears. “Good bye, my love. I will miss you forever.” Epilogue Jessie I raced to the oak tree, but Colette wasn’t there. I searched the woods, then the streets of Tiburon, and then tried peeking in the windows of her family’s home. Colette was gone. It was as if she’d simply been plucked from the earth. For the next two years I searched for her, all night, every night, but she was nowhere to be found. I found her shoe, and an old tramp found some of her clothes in a small suitcase, but those were all the clues that were ever uncovered. My darling girl had vanished without a trace. Mrs. Denkler hung herself from the rafters in her private quarters two days after Colette disappeared. I think she blamed herself for delaying me. It wasn’t her fault, but part of me held her responsible. If only she hadn’t slammed shut the vault door. If only I’d insisted that I meet Colette under our apple tree instead of letting her walk alone at night. If only I’d left town like I’d intended, instead of wooing Colette and falling in love. I spent the next several decades hating myself and longing for the life Colette and I would never share. She was gone and, although I had not harmed her, I knew I was responsible for her death. If I hadn’t loved her, she would still be among the living, the sun shining on her tempestuous hair, the birds singing their morning music just for her. For many years I thought that maybe travel might help me forget the pain that was always present within me, but it did little to blunt the agony. And I found myself compelled to return home every fall. I knew I would never see my darling girl again, but I could not keep from searching for her. Year after year, I combed the woods in the fall, when the moon was full. I continued to do so decade after decade, even though it was obvious she was gone. I also carried the misery of having caused Colette’s family pain. Not knowing what had happened to their daughter must have been the worst part. I know it was for me. Or maybe it was better that way. I couldn’t judge; I only knew that I was doomed to live for eternity without the woman I loved. It was somewhere around the turn of the century that I began to feel a change. I hadn’t forgotten Colette, or stopped loving her, but the pain somehow shifted. It became a dull ache in the corners of my soul, rather than a tangible throb in my breast. I stopped going to Europe. Tiburon was my home. I even began to go out on occasion, strolling the town’s streets after sunset. Sometimes I would take in a film at the cinema, or drop by the library on Thursday nights, when it stayed open late. It felt good to traverse the streets where I knew Colette’s footsteps had fallen. Somehow it made me feel closer to her. One evening in the early fall, I felt an urge to reread The Great Gatsby. The castle library had a signed, first-edition, of course, but I wanted to hold a book that had been caressed by many hands. I was seated in a quiet corner of the library, just starting to become engrossed in the plot, when I heard the sound of two young women hurrying into the room. Glancing up, I had the shock of my life. There, standing before me, was Colette Gibson, just as fresh and young as the first day I saw her. My darling girl had come back to me.

Here are the first couple of chapters so that you can try before you buy. xo ~ Gayla Twist Broom with a View Prologue: When an Assassination Forces a Holiday “I don’t understand why someone who is two hundred years old should know all that much more than someone who is sixteen,” said Violet Popplewell to her mother. “There’s only a limited amount of things to know in this world.” Mrs. Popplewell gave a resigned sigh while her busy hands shuffled papers at her desk in her small office. “There’s no point arguing, Violet. Your great-aunt Vera is going with you, and that is that. I know she can be a little trying at times, but a girl your age cannot simply travel to an unknown city by herself. You must admit that. Especially with things being so unsettled. ” Violet considered brooding for a moment but fought the impulse. She was a practical girl, after all, and what can’t be mended must be borne. She returned to her room to make another attempt at packing. “Unsettled.” That was her mother’s word for impending war. The Archmage of Canterbury was dead. His body, entirely drained of blood, had been found with those of his wife and child in their private chambers. There was little doubt the assassin was a Vampire. Within twenty-four hours, rumors of a looming war had spread across England like a winter storm. It didn’t matter that there was no proof that Vampires were behind the murders or even condoned the act. Nor did it matter to Mrs. Popplewell that the dastardly deed had happened in London, which might as well have been a million miles from Gallows Road in the little corner of Surrey that was the Popplewells’ home. The British Isle was no longer deemed a safe place for young Witches to dwell. For Violet, who had rarely travelled even to London, visiting X, the mysterious city-state renowned for its magic, ought to have seemed a wondrous romantic journey. But most young ladies taking their first trip abroad had months to plan down to the smallest detail of the lace pattern on a handkerchief. New wardrobes were commissioned. Farewell parties were held. And Violet would enjoy none of those niceties. She was simply being shipped off, like a parcel, to be kept out of harm’s way. Violet surveyed the state of her bedroom, sighed, and set about attempting to create order from the general disarray. Her steamer trunks were bare, while clothes, shoes, books, and toiletries were strewn across every surface of the room. Earlier that morning, she had, in her haste, attempted to enchant her clothes to arrange themselves. But instead of compliantly settling into her trunks, the gowns had chased each other about the room in a colorful display of hide-and-go-seek. The stack of books she intended as her additional travelling companions had toppled across the floor, their pages flapping as if caught in a strong breeze. Her brush and comb had attacked her, snatching and dragging at her hair; she’d had to leave the room for three-quarters of an hour to give the spell a chance to wear off. It was no use; try though she might, magic never obeyed Miss Popplewell’s wishes the way she intended. Most children born to the Craft assumed that the world was their dollhouse, to be rearranged at their whim. But harnessing the unseen forces of the world was a tricky business full of hidden complications and unseen traps. And though almost an adult, Violet still struggled to bend the magical world to her will. She frequently found that the harder she tried, the more difficult it became to cast even the simplest spell. Her mother was constantly reminding the frustrated girl that most of their kind only truly mastered the Craft in their later years, when the tempestuous fires of youth had largely sputtered out. Yet Violet’s powers always seemed just inches from her grasp. Every once in a while, she would unexpectedly conjure extraordinary wonders. Unfortunately, these anomalies came without warning, and afterward, she could never remember what she had done differently. Perhaps it was the way she held her mouth. Standing in her disorderly room, Violet hesitantly reached into her pocket and felt the familiar handle of the old magic wand that had belonged to her grandmother. Many modern Crafters no longer relied on a wand to produce magic, but for the girl, wand work always seemed to yield the best results. She gripped it for a moment, deliberated, and then decided she couldn’t face another failure. Instead, she began the dull task of packing by hand. An hour later, all the necessities of life were neatly encapsulated in two large trunks at the foot of Violet’s bed. But her satisfaction was interrupted by a sound emanating from the next room—like two pelicans simultaneously trying to swallow the same fish. Ostensibly called the guest room, the chamber next to Violet’s was almost permanently occupied by her great-aunt, Vera Tartlette. The sound was one of indescribable vexation, which Aunt Vera invariably made when faced with a world-shattering crisis. Violet heard it at least twice a week. With a small sigh, she went to check on the situation. “Do not fret, my dear,” Aunt Vera began, her voice quavering. Violet entered the room with some trepidation. “I only need a few more moments to sort myself out, and then I’ll be in to help you directly.” The guest room was in far worse shape than Violet’s had been an hour earlier. Clothes, books, toiletries, and shoes all swirled haphazardly through the air. With a sweeping gesture, Vera would transfer a pile of undergarments to the bottom of her empty steamer trunk. Then, finding dissatisfaction with their placement, she’d whisk her hands to one side to remove them again. After that, the gowns would go in, only to be removed a moment later in the same fashion. All the while, Aunt Vera chattered continuously, either to Violet or to herself, weighing the advantages of taking each item versus the hazards of leaving it behind. Knowing as she spoke that she would only make things worse, Violet ventured, “Vera, the train does have a schedule to keep.” At this point, the elderly Witch was turning in circles in the center of the little room as though, by making eye contact with each item, she could fathom its every possible use into her head. But once she lost sight of the beaded gloves or motion sickness pastilles or whatever she was looking at, the item and its usefulness were crowded out by new ones. “Don’t bedevil me with schedules,” her aunt wailed impatiently as an airborne shoe nearly collided with a lit candle. “I said I would help you and I shall, but you really must leave me to my own packing first.” “For goodness sake.” Violet felt on the edge of exasperation with her great-aunt already, and they hadn’t even set out for the station. Drawing the old wand from her pocket, almost without thinking, she made three decisive strikes through the air. In a hailstorm of clothes, shoes, books, and papers, Vera’s possessions all found their proper place, and trunk lids slammed firmly shut. The room went still. Vera gazed in silence at the neatly arranged steamer trunks for several moments, as if trying to remember where she had left her knitting. Then she blinked and, turning her eyes to her young ward, said, “There now. Shall we see about your trunks?” Chapter 1: Witch Friendly Does Not Mean Witch Exclusive The city-state of X lay somewhere on the European continent, just at the invisible line that separated the western half, land of Witches, Sorcerers, and other Crafters, from the dark eastern half, realm of the Vampires. It stood before, or rather almost encrusting, Mount Drood, a craggy bluff that rose sharply above the rolling hills surrounding it and marked the beginning of the Alps. Half the city climbed the steep slope of Mt. Drood and crowned its peak, while the other half stood almost perpetually in its shadow. To say that Violet Popplewell had always dreamt of going to X was not to say that she had actually wanted to go. Quite the contrary; since she was a small child, tales of that magical city had filled her with unease. In anxiety-filled dreams, she would find herself wandering its labyrinthine streets while tall, windowless buildings frowned down upon her. Violet’s first glimpse of X in waking life was little different from her nocturnal visions. As their train pulled into the station in the deepening gloom of early evening, she caught glimpses of the city’s towers, black against the purple sky. She’d seen pictures of the famous edifices, but nothing could have prepared her for the soaring spires of stone, iron, and glass of a city built by magic. London, but for a tiny handful of magically enhanced buildings shrouded in spells of concealment, had nothing to compare. No building crafted by Mortals could hold a candle to these impossible structures. A mighty hall lined with pillars rested on the sculpted shoulders of a stone colossus. Staircases spiraled upwards, disappearing into the sky with no visible means of support or conclusion. Walkways, and even a road or two big enough to drive a carriage across, rested on impossibly slender, graceful arched pylons—when they weren’t resting on thin air. Here and there, immense trees grew, wrapping around buildings and then providing support for additional constructions. And buildings intertwined with the naked rock of the mountain so promiscuously that one couldn’t tell what was natural and what was Crafted. The train station was their first indication of the chaos that had gripped the city. Strangely, it had never occurred to Violet that she wasn’t the only magical being seeking refuge from the impending war. Travellers crowded the platform from end to end, and getting through the bustling swarm of humanity was like swimming through a hot, angry soup. It had been an exhausting journey of barely catching their train, then crossing the channel by ferry, and then a much lengthier train ride to X. Neither lady was in the mood to be jostled. Once on the street, Vera realised that she had left her notebook on the train and couldn’t remember the name of the guest house where they had a reservation, much less where it was located. Violet suggested they cast a seeking spell, which sent Vera into a loudly whispered tirade. “Cast a spell? Here, on the street, where we might be seen by anyone?” Violet hastened to remind her aunt that, “such cautions must surely be needless in X of all places.” Any Mortal living in this city who remained ignorant of magic must be deaf, blind, and terminally stupid. Raising her hands in reluctant preparation, Vera admitted with some trepidation, “I’m afraid it’s been well over a century since I last cast this particular spell.” Having spent all her life in Surrey, she had little opportunity to get lost. The incantation did not go well. Vera stumbled over the words in a barely audible voice, for fear of being overheard by the aforementioned blind deaf mute. Her trembling hands did not aid in the creation. By the time she reached the end of the third stanza, there was only a dim light pooling around their feet, leading nowhere discernible. Violet had no desire to embarrass her aunt, but she also did not wish to keep wandering around the darkened streets where who knows what kinds of magical creatures were lurking down every alley. The girl was quite sure she’d seen a man in a black cape slip from one shadow to the next as they approached. Sneaking her wand out of her pocket, Violet created a quick enhancement spell, which she cast towards her aunt and herself. The light around their feet began to gain power. An illuminated path appeared, leading them down the street. After only a block, the trail ended at the steps of the Pensione Belladonna. “There,” Vera said, brushing her hands against each other as if to remove some invisible soot. “That wasn’t so very difficult, now was it? There never really is any reason to panic.” They mounted the steps, and the man in the cape, who had been following them by way of the shadows, faded into the night. * * * * * * * * * “The proprietress had no call to deceive us,” Aunt Vera stated over dinner. “I don’t care how crowded the city has become. What does that have to do with our reservation?” Violet had no choice but to agree. On entering the musty guest house, they were quickly bustled down a narrow wooden staircase to a pair of basement rooms with bare stone walls. The floor was damp flagstone, and both chambers strongly smelled of mold. Instead of the panoramic view of the River Stygia they’d been promised, each room had a small, arched window near the ceiling that offered views of passersby from the ankles down. Violet cast her gaze across the dining table to the English faces who were just tucking into their evening meal. “Honestly, we may as well have stayed in Surrey,” she said with a sigh. “Except that there we’d be comfortable.” “And better provided for. This mutton is entirely flavorless,” Vera replied in a disapproving whisper. “I believe it’s been drained,” came a slow, creaking voice beside Vera. An elderly Witch with skin the color of parchment and matching hair had turned to address Vera with a smile that might have been sardonic. “Drained?” replied Vera. “You know. Of blood.” Vera’s neighbour had been introduced to them as Miss Abigail Fate, one of three sisters who had been staying in X for several months. Violet liked them immediately, but she was currently positioned at the table to hear very little of what the ladies said. They were, to the girl’s mind, the best sort of elderly women—dressed in soft, lavender clothes and smelling of rosewater, with sweet, reassuring voices and ready smiles. The only odd thing about them was their three matching pairs of smoked eyeglasses, which instantly brought to mind the nursery rhyme “Three Blind Mice.” Violet prayed she didn’t accidentally hum the tune aloud. Vera was in a position to hear Miss Abigail’s words quite clearly. “I’m sorry; I’m not sure what you mean,” Vera said, addressing the senior Witch. “For the Vampires,” Miss Fate said with a smile. One of her sisters leaned in to see down the length of the table, holding a pair of opera glasses to the lenses of her eyeglasses and peering through them. “It’s a cheap way of feeding both the Crafter and Vampire guests, you see,” said the sister in a hushed voice. “Vampire guests?” Vera asked, her eyes growing very round. It became immediately obvious to the Witch that two of the patrons of the Pensione Belladonna had plates that were noticeably bare. In contrast, their wine goblets were full to the brim. And not with the Proprietress’s weak Chianti but with a thicker liquid in the darkest shade of crimson. A little shiver ran up Vera’s spine, and she couldn’t keep her eyes from darting again in the direction of the two barren place settings. The elderly gentleman seated behind one of the plates seized the opportunity to say, “My dear lady, perhaps it’s true that this little haven is not everything one could wish, but what place on this earth is?” he asked with a smile. Violet had not held tight to the thread of the conversation, but she could detect nothing but kindness in the elder gentleman’s crinkled eyes. “Surely,” he went on, addressing Miss Tartlette, “you must have come away from your comfortable and familiar home because you found it wanting in some way. And now that you are here, all is strange, and the shortcomings are not familiar ones. But what is that? I’m sure you’ll find the wonders of the great city of X are worth a few inconveniences. In my humble opinion, we who seek to drink from the font of perfection must be forever thirsty. Wouldn’t you agree, Sebastian?” At this, the gentleman turned to his companion, an elegantly dressed and handsome young man, who remained silent, swirling his wine goblet listlessly. Undaunted, the older man returned his beaming gaze towards Vera. It was obvious from the gentlemen’s appearance that they were father and son. But where the old man’s brightly colored waistcoat strained over an advancing belly and gleaming strands of silver-grey adorned his widow’s peak, the young man’s frame was still slender, and his widow’s peak was black as jet, matching his linen suit. Where the father seemed almost childlike in his jovial eagerness, the son was as somber as the grave. But it was not a sinister somberness—more the appearance of someone suffering from a severe case of melancholia. In fact, the two were so comically unalike that Violet had to restrain herself from smirking at them. “I do not expect perfection from a pensione,” Vera indignantly replied to the elder of the pair, “but we were led to expect something quite different from what we got.” They had been introduced to the two gentlemen in a general way when they sat down at table, but Vera was discomfited to realize that she had forgotten their names and wasn’t sure of the correct etiquette under the circumstances. Did the introduction actually count? “We were promised two rooms on the top floor, with a view of the river and the cathedral,” Vera said to the table at large. “Ah, I see,” said the old gentleman. “I see the trouble. Alas, in the confusion of so many arrivals, my son and I ended up in exactly two such rooms.” Vera stiffened and retorted with a crisp, “How delightful for you. I do hope you enjoy them.” “My dear lady, you misunderstand me,” the gentleman went on. “My son and I have rooms on the top floor in full sun every morning. It won’t do at all, though we had resigned ourselves to make the best of it.” Violet could feel her aunt withdrawing into herself. Vera had no ability to deal with strangers who were overly forwards. She had turned her attention to diligently cutting her mutton into perfectly uniform bites. But the man seemed so kindly; Violet could not fathom why her aunt was always so suspicious. The girl saw no reason to snub him, so, replying for Vera, she said, “I wish we were so lucky.” “But you can be,” said he, lighting the room with the warmest smile she’d encountered since leaving Surrey. “Please, allow me to explain. We have no use for morning views. Sebastian and I far prefer to slumber in the comfortable darkness of a basement room and cultivate our perfect view from within. For we believe that if the sun rises in one’s heart, then no darkness can take it away. Isn’t that right, Sebastian?” The younger man persisted in his silence. “So what I propose is this.” The gentleman continued undaunted. “We can trade our rooms for yours. Then everyone would be happy.” Violet found his smile infectious and was unable to resist returning it when he directed it her way. She wanted to accept his kind offer at once, but she felt the restraining hand of her aunt pressing on her sleeve. “I’m afraid we couldn’t possibly,” Vera said in the slightly pinched voice she used when trying to keep her composure in extreme circumstances. Her eyes bulged slightly with anxiety as she fixed her gaze on her plate. “But my dear lady!” the old gentleman protested. “Surely you can see the mutual benefit of my proposal.” He turned to the young man seated next to him. “Won’t you explain it, Sebastian? You always explain things so much better than I.” “It would not be of any inconvenience,” Sebastian said in a deep, quiet voice. “It genuinely would be our preference as much as yours.” “No, no,” Vera insisted. “We absolutely couldn’t impose upon you. It’s quite out of the question.” She dabbed at the corners of her mouth with her napkin and pushed away from the table, abandoning the mutton upon which she had labored so carefully. “Come along, my dear,” she said to her niece. Confused and alarmed at her aunt appearing so outraged, Violet allowed herself to be led out of the dining room. She really couldn’t conceive of why Vera was so offended. At the door, Violet glanced back to see the old gentleman looking crestfallen. But the young man had finally lifted his eyes and caught hers in a gaze that she found difficult to interpret. * * * * * * * * * * Having retreated to the relative privacy of the sitting room, Violet turned furiously on her great-aunt. “What possible reason could there be for not accepting their offer? You yourself said that our dreadful rooms would be the death of you. You think you know all about proper etiquette, but in truth, you’re quite rude.” “I do not understand this city,” Vera muttered aloud. “I was told that this house was Witch friendly.” “Witch friendly does not mean Witch exclusive,” came a voice behind them. It was Miss Abigail Fate with her two sisters. They had followed Violet and Vera from dinner, concerned over the discomfort of the ladies. Miss Abigail shuffled into the room, guiding the other two and gazing about the sitting room through the opera glasses that her sister had been using at dinner. Violet hadn’t realized before how old and shrivelled the three of them actually were. So much so that, when they settled onto a small couch ideally meant for two, it accommodated them all with ease. “Are you speaking of Count Du Monde and his son?” the third Fate sister asked. She had not paid attention to the conversation at dinner, instead devoting herself entirely to the task of chewing her mutton with an enormous set of false teeth. “I’m not quite sure,” Vera confessed. “I’m afraid I didn’t quite catch their names. In any event, my young niece doesn’t understand how serious a thing it is to put ourselves in the debt of perfect strangers. Especially,” she said, her voice lowering, “that sort.” Violet felt a wave of exasperation. She was so tired of people telling her she didn’t understand the ways of the world just because she’d only been in it for the interval of sixteen years. Vera was being a prig, as far as she was concerned. The old gentleman and his son were perfectly amiable, just sitting there enjoying a glass of wine and eating their… Well, come to think of it, they weren’t eating anything. Their plates were noticeably bare. Violet’s eyes widened suddenly as realization dawned on her. “Just a moment!” she exclaimed. “You don’t mean to say that,” she began and then faltered. “That kindly old gentleman?” She shook her head, unable to get a grasp on it. “Surely not.” “I’m afraid so,” said the third Miss Fate, taking the opera glasses from her sister and raising them to her smoked spectacles. “This house has always been tolerant of Vampires. Though just now, the Du Mondes are the only two.” “Vampires?” Violet whispered, barely able to form her mouth around the word. The idea left her quite breathless. “Vampires,” said Vera, disapproval rolling off her tongue. “Not to worry. They’re the good sort of Vampires,” Miss Abigail assured them. “Well behaved and polite. Not at all the sort that go around biting people on the neck whenever the impulse strikes. We rather like them, don’t we, Hazel?” “Indeed, yes,” agreed the sister next to her. “Count Du Monde can be a little informal in his manner. But as far as Vampires go, they’re quite acceptable.” Vera drew herself up, her hand flying to the lace collar at her throat. “Well, I’m not willing to accept them. Just imagine, Witches and Vampires under the same roof. It’s too vulgar to contemplate.” She turned to her niece, who stood speechless at the news. “Violet, what would your mother think if she knew I’d let you stay in such an establishment?” “Well...” Violet began, not quite sure what anyone would think. She’d always known that there were Vampires in X. It was another wonder in a city full of wonders; Vampires and Witches coexisted peacefully within its walls. But it was her understanding that Vampires primarily dwelt in Night Town, the infamous under-city where Witches never dared tread. She had assumed that X was entirely segregated. In truth, she was as shocked as Vera by the idea of sharing a roof with the undead, the mortal enemy of all Witches, creatures with whom her kind had been at war since before history began. And yet, when she considered the phrase “the mortal enemy of all Witches” and placed it in her mind under a portrait of the amiable Count Du Monde, the resulting image could only be described as absurd. How could such a kindly old gentleman be a danger to anyone? Perhaps, Violet thought reluctantly, he was using Vampire glamour to beguile her, putting her off her guard. But she’d been taught that Witches were immune to Vampire enchantments. Regardless, the Count’s behaviour could hardly be called glamorous. Mortals who survived an encounter with a Vampire always described them as “wondrous, fascinating, luminous creatures, with eyes like impossibly deep pools in which one could drown.” The words “well meaning but terribly awkward” were never part of those accounts. Besides, the Misses Fate considered these Vampires perfectly acceptable dinner companions. And the Fate sisters were obviously very traditional Witches. So Violet didn’t see why Vera should be making such a fuss. Go here to keep reading Broom with a View xo ~ GT",

      "content": "“It looks lovely on you,” I told her. The happiness she exuded quickly made me forget about the pain coursing through my hands. Colette reached up and caressed the heart. “I’ve never loved a gift more,” she told me. “I’m so glad,” was my reply. “You must promise me to always wear it. Especially at night,” I added. “Promise that you’ll never take it off.” “I’ll never take it off,” she assured me, pressing the pendant to her own heart. “But why especially at night?” she asked. “Oh.” I hadn’t even realized I’d urged her to do so. “I...” I stammered, scrambling for any plausible excuse. “I just worry about you, sometimes. You and your sister riding your bicycles home after the sun has gone down. I just feel like if you wear this pendant, then it will be like a good-luck token.” Colette bestowed me with another one of her lovely smiles. “I promise I’ll wear it always,” she said putting her arms around my neck to kiss me. It was challenging to kiss her with the silver being so close to my skin. The memory of the pain that had shot through my hands was still at the forefront of my brain. But none of that mattered if the little trinket kept my darling girl safe from harm. I would have walked out into the noon day sun for her. Something caught my attention and I quickly scanned the skies. It wasn’t so much a noise that had reached my ears, but more like a silence. It was the silence of a bird taking wing. Or a vampire rising into the sky. Chapter 39 Colette The next morning, I couldn’t have been happier as I gathered blossoms for Jessie’s sick brother. The vivid wildflowers of summer had been replaced by the hardy sunflowers and Queen Ann’s lace of fall. The pendant hanging around my neck sent little shivers of happiness up my spine every time it brushed against my skin. The chain was long enough that I could tuck the pendant under the bodice of my dress and it wasn’t too visible with the heart nestling between my breasts. With the sun warming my face, I closed my eyes and thought of Jessie. His kisses filled me with an anticipation that I found challenging to suppress. I so desperately wanted to be with him in every way. I wanted to lie in bed with him, our bodies pressed together, smelling his warm-penny breath. I wanted to know what it was to be a woman and how it felt to be with him as my man. A little shiver of desire crept up my spine. Was seventeen too young to get married, if you knew you were truly in love? “How many flowers does one sick boy need?” Lilly called out as she coasted her bicycle to a stop. I opened my eyes and looked down, releasing a small laugh. I’d been enjoying the humming of the bees, and the grasses gently tugging at my skirt, so much that I hadn’t realized the enormous size of the bouquet I was holding. “What’s that?” Lilly asked as I was putting the flowers in my bicycle’s basket. She reached forward, touching the silver heart dangling from my neck and making it sway. “Oh.” I took half a step backward and covered the pendent with my hand. I guess it had slipped out of the top of my dress when I was bending over to pluck the flowers. “It’s…” I stammered. “Where’d you get it?” Lilly wanted to know. I had no explanation for her. All I could do was stare at her, wide-eyed. My sister’s face grew hard. “Did he give it to you?” I nodded my head. “For my birthday.” “I thought that was over,” Lilly said in a tight voice as she remounted her bicycle. “No,” I told her, also climbing on mine. “It’s definitely not over.” “I hope he hasn’t taken advantage of you,” Lilly said. “That’s usually what happens when the rich boy starts sniffing around the maid.” “It’s nothing like that,” I exclaimed. “You sound like Mama.” Lilly shrugged. “She’s right about a lot of things.” “She wasn’t right about Lev Wilson,” I pointed out as I pushed down on a pedal to get my bike rolling. “She still thinks he’s a nice boy.” “Just be careful,” my sister said, following me. “He’s always been a gentleman,” I insisted, not wanting to say his name out loud for some reason. “That’s not what I’m talking about,” Lilly told me. “At least not completely.” “What, then?” I asked over my shoulder. “I don’t know.” She rode for a few moments in silence. “There’s just something so very peculiar about the Vanderlind family. I don’t like their eyes.” “What about their eyes?” I asked. I loved gazing into Jessie’s eyes. “Their eyes all are the same color,” Lilly said. “Gray. And they’re all so cold... Sometimes it makes me think they’re dead inside, the blank grayness of their eyes.” Lilly was being ridiculous. Jessie was so loving and passionate and wonderful. He couldn’t have been more alive. “Don’t pester me with those,” Mrs. Denkler said when she saw the enormous bouquet I had gathered. “Just take them upstairs. And don’t bother Arthur.” At that point I had taken the flowers up to Arthur’s room numerous times, but the housekeeper always felt the need to warn me that the Vanderlind invalid needed to be left alone. Lilly was right, I thought as I arranged the blossoms in a vase. I had gone a little overboard with my flower gathering that morning. I needed a much larger vase than usual and I could barely see around it at I tottered up the stairs. At the top of the steps, as I peered through the flowers as thick as shrubbery, I thought I saw a figure slipping out of Arthur’s room. Moving my head to one side of the arrangement, I had a clearer view, but I was only able to catch a glimpse of Daniel heading around a corner at the end of the hall. I thought maybe he glanced back at me, but then again, maybe he didn’t. I made my way over to Arthur’s door and set the overfilled vase on the ground. As I pulled my arms away from the arrangement, the flowers expanded and pushed the door to the room open several inches. I froze, not sure what to do. The door was always firmly shut and Mrs. Denkler had warned us in no uncertain terms that we were to never bother Arthur under any circumstances. Did I close the door or leave it open? It was hard to know which was best. After giving it some quick thought, I decided I would just ease the door closed as quietly as possible. The family wanted Arthur to have privacy, after all. I meant to just gently tug the door shut and go back downstairs, but I couldn’t help glancing inside as I reached for the knob. And then I pulled up short. The room appeared to be empty. I guess I had been expecting a large hospital bed and a young man propped up on a pile of pillows, with a nurse tending to him, and some tubes coming out of his arm. But there was no bed, no nurse, not even a young man. At least there wasn’t a young man that I could see. The portion of the room that I could view through the crack in the door was bereft of any furniture. I felt something cold run through me. Glancing up, I double-checked that I was standing in front of the correct door, the one with the bird over it. What was going on? I felt the urge to open the door the entirely, but I also felt like I should just pretend that nothing happened and hurry back down the stairs. Indecision kept me glued to the floor, right at the threshold of the room, for several seconds. I thought about Jessie and how he had tried numerous times to confess his family’s sins to me, but I wouldn’t let him. Then, although my curiosity was killing me, I took hold of the doorknob and eased the door shut. “Is it what you were expecting?” Mrs. Denkler asked. She was standing right behind me and I was barely able to suppress a shriek. “I wasn’t expecting anything,” I told her, backing away from the door a few steps. “When I put the vase down, some of the flowers popped the door open, so I thought I should pull it shut.” Mrs. Denkler frowned. “Don’t lie to me, young lady. I saw you leaving the room. You had yourself a right good snoop.” “I didn’t,” I insisted. “I promise. All I did was stand here for a moment and then try to close the door.” The housekeeper looked like she was on the verge of believing me, when her eyes alighted on my neck. “What’s this?” she demanded, snatching at the pendant that Jessie had given me. “Didn’t I make myself perfectly clear on your first day that you are to wear no personal adornments whatsoever?” “I’m sorry, Mrs. Denkler,” I blurted. “I do remember you telling us, but…” “And silver, nonetheless,” she said, yanking at the chain and causing my head to jerk forward. “What in the world were you thinking?” “I’m sorry,” I said again. “It’s just…” She pulled at the chain another time. “Why on God’s green earth would you wear this?” she demanded. “I have to wear it,” I told her, trying to pry her hand open as she clutched at the locket. “I was told to wear it. Now let go or the clasp is going to break.” “Told to wear it?” she all but shouted. “And who, pray tell, told you to wear it?” “Jessie Vanderlind.” The words were out of my mouth before I could stop them. Mrs. Denkler stopped yanking on the pendant, but she did not let go. “Jessie Vanderlind?” she repeated, her eyes wide as if she was having trouble understanding the words. Then she focused on me and gave a sneer of a smile. “Well,” she said, slowly. “Haven’t you been up to all kinds of little tricks? And right under my nose. I should have known better than to hire the likes of you.” The old lady laughed. “And here I thought you were just some good little girl. Oh, so very nice, always gathering flowers for a sick boy.” She jerked on the chain again and I clutched at her hand to stop her from breaking it. “Little did I realize you were just doing it to suck-up. How dare you even think you had a chance of winning the heart of someone like Jessie Vanderlind?” Angry tears filled my eyes. “Why shouldn’t I? He’s good and he’s kind. He loves me and I love him.” “Love?” Mrs. Denkler exclaimed with a rueful laugh. “You are such a little fool.” She looked my face over, closely. “You have no idea what’s going on. Do you? He hasn’t told you a thing.” No, Jessie hadn’t told me he loved me. Not in so many words. Or at least not in a language that I understood. But I knew it in my heart every time he looked at me. I felt it every time we kissed. “He does love me,” I insisted, practically clawing at her hand, but the old woman had a grip like a vice. This elicited more laughter from Mrs. Denkler. “You are such a fool. Someone like Jessie doesn’t know how to love.” She gave me a shake. “That part of him died when he was made.” “No,” I insisted, trying to push her off of me. Her words made no sense. “He loves me. I know he does. And I love him. I love Jessie Vanderlind.” “You have no idea what it takes to love a member of this family,” Mrs. Denkler hissed. “You don’t even know who the Vanderlinds really are. If he loves you so much, then why hasn’t he told you the truth about his family?” “He’s tried,” I insisted. “He’s tried dozens of times, but I wouldn’t let him.” She froze for a moment, her eyes looking quite wild. “I believe you,” she said. “But that makes things worse. Just wait until I tell his grandfather.” “His grandfather is dead,” I whimpered. “Mr. Vanderlind is dead.” “He will never be dead!” Mrs. Denkler shouted. “Do you hear me?” she demanded, giving me another good shake. “A man like that can never die!” “Stop it,” I cried, thrashing against her might, as well as her words. “Leave me alone,” I wailed, using all my strength to wrench myself free. But she yanked me back in the other direction. The clasp of the pendant finally snapping under the strain. I ended up falling forward and crashing through the door to Arthur’s room. I lay there, groaning for a moment. The castle’s floor was hard stone and the wind had been knocked out of me. My elbow throbbed and I let out a sharp whimper when I tried to push myself up. Through a blur of pain, I took in the room. It was, as I’d gleaned through the crack in the door, almost completely devoid of furniture. At the far end of the room there was some type of appliance. It looked like a large icebox, or some kind of new, fancy refrigerator. There was also a small sideboard laid out with rows of clean goblets on one side and dirty on the other. The dirty glasses were coated with the remnants of something that was red and looked sticky. A few flies circled lazily around the soiled crystal. The flowers I had gathered yesterday had been placed to the left of the sideboard, out of the way. “Where’s Arthur?” I asked, cradling my injured arm. Mrs. Denkler just stood there, looking down at me, clutching Jessie’s pendent in her fist. “There is no Arthur,” she told me. “Now get up.” Reaching down, she grabbed me by the shoulders and hauled me to my feet. “I don’t understand,” I said, feeling tearful again. “What happened to him?” “Nothing happened to him,” Mrs. Denkler snapped. “You are such a stupid child. Isn’t it obvious?” “No.” I shook my head, covering my face with my hands. I didn’t want to look at the room. I didn’t want to see the soiled goblets, all sticky and red. The housekeeper drew a sharp breath, her hands at her sides, balled into such tight fists that her knuckles were white. And then she sighed, her hands releasing, Jessie’s gift slipped through her fingers and onto the floor. “Arthur was sent to New York last week,” she said, her voice becoming much softer. I could tell she was trying to be reassuring. “There’s a clinic there. They think they might have a cure.” “But where are all of his things?” I asked, glancing around at the empty room. “He took everything with him,” she informed me. “He might be there for awhile.” “But…” I couldn’t stop shaking. “Why are you still taking blood donations if Arthur’s not here?” I forced myself not to glance in the direction of the large refrigerator at the far end of the room. “I’ve seen people lining up outside the clinic door, just like usual.” “It’s because…” Mrs. Denkler smoothed her hands over her skirt and I could tell she was casting about for an explanation. “It’s because so many people in the town have come to depend on earning a few extra dollars from donating blood.” She folded her hands in front of her and looked me in the eye. “The family didn’t want to take that money away from people in need. So all the blood is going to local hospitals.” She nodded her head, indicating the back of the castle. “You’ve seen the ambulances drive up and haul the blood away.” “Oh... “I forced myself to stop trembling. “Yes. I hadn’t thought of that. It’s very good of the Vanderlinds to provide such a service.” I forced myself not to think about the soiled goblets on the sideboard. I knew no good would come from asking their purpose. “Yes, they are a great family,” Mrs. Denkler said with conviction. “I’ve never met finer.” “I’m sorry for causing trouble,” I said, trying to stand up straight, but still feeling the need to clutch my elbow; it throbbed with a deep ache. I had to wonder if it was broken. “It’s just when I set the flowers down, the door popped open. That’s all.” “I understand,” Mrs. Denkler said in a voice that was almost kind. “It’s usually locked. I guess someone was careless and left it open.” She stepped forward and touched me on the shoulder. “You’ve had a rough day and I think you should go home now. I’ll have one of the chauffeurs take you home in the car.” “But what about my sister?” I asked, almost afraid to leave Lilly there without me. “And my bicycle?” “I’ll request one of the larger cars,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “There will be ample room to put your bicycle in the back. As for your sister, I’ll tell her you weren’t feeling well so I sent you home.” “Thank you,” I said in a choked whisper, staring hard at the floor. I wanted to ask to take Jessie’s gift with me, but she was staring at me too intently. “I need you to think very closely about what you’ve seen here today,” Mrs. Denkler said. “I need you to think about your relationship with Jessie Vanderlind. I understand that he’s a very handsome young man and I’m sure he can be charming when he chooses, but I hope you also understand that pursuing such a relationship might not be such a healthy choice for a young girl like you.” She reached out and squeezed my shoulder again, this time in a much firmer grip. “You might want to consider seeking other employment, if working here at the castle makes you uncomfortable.” The strength of her grip increased, making me squirm under its pressure. “But mind me when I tell you not to discuss what you’ve seen here,” she said. “About Arthur. The good people of Tiburon don’t need to know anything more about him. If the blood donations were to stop, then that could make things very unpleasant for a great many people.” Chapter 40 Jessie Mother, Emily and I were sitting in the dining hall, enjoying our evening repast when Daniel stalked in. We were used to him being moody and entitled, so his attitude was no surprise, but his presence seemed to fill the very air with disapproval. “Is there something you want to share with us?” Mother asked. “Am I to guess that there is something going on?” Knowing Mother, she just wanted to get on with whatever criticism Daniel was about to rain down on us. “Why don’t you ask him what’s going on?” Daniel said, thrusting his chin in my direction. “It’s called diner,” I said, lifting my goblet for his benefit. “Maybe you should have some. It might make you feel better.” Emily was seated next to mother, enjoying a meal of roasted pork and mashed sweet potatoes. I hated when Daniel had one of his little temper tantrums in front of her. She was at an impressionable age and I didn’t want her to think that she had to tolerate such poor behavior from a man. She kept her head bent to her meal, but I knew she was observing our exchange through her lashes. “It case you haven’t noticed,” Daniel said, continuing to address our mother, “your second son has been diddling with one of the housemaids.” If this came as a surprise to Mother, she did not react as if it was. She simply regarded Daniel with a calm expression on her face. “And you feel that Jessie’s activities somehow affect you?” “It could have damning repercussions for all of us,” he exclaimed. “I don’t see why he couldn’t just go to a cat house if he wants some pretty little mortal to toy with.” “He’s not toying with her,” Emily said, straightening up from her meal. “He’s in love with her.” She looked over at me, her eyes glowing. “And she is completely in love with him.” “That’s completely preposterous,” Daniel practically shouted. “No Vanderlind would soil himself by falling in love with a mortal girl.” Mother turned to look at me, her eyes filled with curiosity, but also encouragement. “Is this true, Jessie? Have you fallen in love with a mortal?” “Yes,” I said, addressing my mother, but steadfastly staring at my brother. “I am in love with Colette Gibson. She is a mortal young woman who works as a maid in this house.” “I knew it,” Daniel all but howled. “I knew you were too soft-hearted. You’ll bring shame to us all. You disgust me.” “Daniel, that’s hardly called for,” our mother chastised him. “And besides, falling in love is the best sort of news. It’s a reason to celebrate.” “Your son admits to being in love with a mortal and you think that’s good news?” Daniel was aghast. “Excuse me, but I really don’t want to be staked in my coffin because of his foolishness. God only knows how much he’s told her about our family.” “I haven’t told her anything,” I said, rising so quickly from my chair that it tipped over. “I’ve actually wanted to tell her. I thought I owed her the truth. But she refused to hear it. She said that she wanted to get to know me and not have her feelings influenced by any dark secrets the Vanderlinds might be concealing.” “She’s obviously just a little gold digger,” Daniel insisted. “She shows you the shapeliness of her ankle and suddenly you fancy yourself in love.” I wanted to fly across the room and smash my brother in the face. But I also knew that he probably wanted me to lose my temper and I wasn’t going to play his game. “I am in love,” I told him. “I know that’s an emotion you don’t easily understand, but just because you’ve never felt love doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.” “At least I know better than to fall in love with some little trollop who probably only sees you as a meal ticket.” He rubbed his chin. “Or maybe that’s how you see her? Were you waiting for someone pure so you could slake both your lust and your appetite?” “Boys!” Mother thundered, slapping her palm down loudly on the table. “That is enough.” She turned to my brother. “Daniel, you are acting beyond ill-bred. Didn’t I raise you to have better manners than this?” “Yes, Mother,” Daniel said, immediately cowed by her displeasure. “I’m glad you realize that,” Mother said. “Now take a seat and let’s hear what your brother has to say.” She turned to me. “Jessie, it makes me so happy to hear that you’ve found someone you care about. And you obviously know that loving a mortal comes with many disadvantages, so I know you didn’t enter into this thing lightly.” Her gaze was steady, but also kind. “I’d like to know what your plans are. Do you think you’d like to turn this girl and make her your bride? Is she the type of young lady who would fare well as a vampire?” “I don’t know,” I had to admit. I loved Colette with every ounce of my soul and I wanted to be with her every moment of the day, but the idea of turning her into a member of the undead had never entered my mind. I loved her for who she was, not for who she might become. “I’d have to give it some thought.” “It’s actually something you should have thought about before you started pawing at her,” Daniel grumbled. “Daniel,” Mother said, sharply. Then she turned back to me. “If you’re truly in love with this girl, then her future is something you have to think about very carefully.” I was in love with Colette Gibson. There was no shred of doubt in my mind. But what kind of life could we have together, coming from our two different worlds? I couldn’t imagine turning Colette into one of us, the undead. To do something like that would have been like painting over a masterpiece. I wanted Colette for who she was, not to simply turn her into somebody new. But I couldn’t let things keep going on the way they were going. I had to make a decision or the fates would make one for me. I nodded to Mother. “I understand.” Chapter 41 Colette Mama came running out of the house, apron still tied around her waist, when she saw the big car pull into the driveway. “What happened?” she asked, racing down the steps. “Are you alright?” “I’m fine,” I told her. “Mostly fine. I slipped off a ladder while dusting and hurt my elbow.” My arm had actually stopped throbbing, so I knew it was going to be fine, but it was also a convenient excuse for why I’d left work early. “Here, let me help you into the house,” Mama said, putting her arm around me. “Do you think I should call Doctor Winters?” “No, I don’t think so,” I told her. “It’s probably just really bruised. I’m sure it’ll be better if we just use some ice.” We didn’t have any ice in the house, so Mama sent the chauffeur off to get some. He looked like he wanted to protest, but my mother didn’t give him the opportunity. Then she tucked me in bed and fussed over me, making sure I was comfortable. “Are you sure it’s just your elbow?” she asked, once I was situated. “You seem very upset.” “I’m still a little rattled from the fall,” I assured her. “The castle floors are really hard and I was worried I was going to crack my head.” Mama kissed my head several times just to ward off the horrible thoughts that had obviously entered her brain. “I’m glad you’re alright. But let’s keep an eye on that arm of yours. If it swells more or the pain starts increasing, then I think we should call Dr. Winters anyway. Better safe than sorry.” After letting my mother fuss a bit more, I feigned sleepiness and she left the room. I loved my mother dearly and felt comforted by having her there with me, but I also needed time alone to think. Did Arthur exist? That was a big question that I had no way of answering. The state of his room indicated that he didn’t. Even if he had left for a clinic in New York, then there would still have been some remnants of his having stayed in the room for months on end. There would have been clothes, or leftover medical equipment. And he probably wouldn’t have taken all of his furniture with him. Not if he intended to return to his family home. No, there was nothing to indicate that Arthur had ever been a real person. If I believed that the Vanderlinds did not have a hemophiliac son, then that left a gaping question in need of an explanation. What did they do with the blood? That evening my arm felt much better, yet I didn’t go downstairs for dinner. I didn’t feel like I could face my family. Mama accommodated me by bringing a tray to my room, even though I had very little appetite. “What happened to you today?” Lilly whispered to me, once our bedroom light was off and we were both tucked in our beds. “I slipped and fell,” I told her. “You know how hard the floors are in the castle.” “Mama seems to think you fell off a ladder in the library,” she said. “But I know that’s not true.” Falling off a ladder seemed like such an easy excuse when the chauffeur drove me home. I had forgotten that Lilly would immediately see it for a lie. “I just slipped when I went to take the flowers upstairs,” I told her. Lilly was silent for a moment. “Was Jessie there when you fell?” “No,” I assured her. “But Mrs. Denkler was.” It took a long time for my sister to fall asleep. She knew I was lying about how I’d been injured, but she didn’t pester me for the truth. I was tempted to tell her anyway. I was confused and frightened. I wanted to talk to someone. I wanted someone I trusted to tell me I was being foolish and that there was probably a reasonable explanation for everything. Plus Lilly and I had always shared our secrets, ever since we were little girls. It was a struggle not to tell her, but I knew if I did, then she would tell Mama and Papa. And then we would be forced to give up our positions at the castle. And I would probably never see Jessie again. After more than an hour, my sister’s breathing took on the steady rhythm of the sleeper. But I stayed tucked in my bed, paralyzed with indecisiveness. I loved Jessie. There was no doubt in my mind that I loved him. But that didn’t mean I wasn’t afraid. Finally I couldn’t stand it any longer and I slipped out of bed. Castle gossip being what it was, Jessie had probably already heard about my accident. I wondered how much Mrs. Denkler had told the family about my Arthur discovery. Was Jessie outside the house waiting for me at that very moment? I wouldn’t go outside. Mrs. Denkler had frightened me enough to make that an impossibility. But I had to know if he was out there. Stealing across the room, I pressed myself against the wall, right next to the window. I had to know if he was outside, but I didn’t want him to see me. Our room was dark and the moon was getting close to full. I doubted Jessie would be able to see me, but I still only pulled the curtain aside just enough to peep out. It was difficult for me to see anything on the lawn in the middle of the night. I could make out the apple tree where Jessie and I spent so many wonderful nights arm-in-arm. The tree’s leaves were changing color and falling to the ground. I felt a pang in my chest. I wondered if there was any way I could give Jessie up. I would have to leave my position at the castle, but I had to leave that anyway, once the school was reopened. Ending my secret love affair with Jessie Vanderlind would break my heart. But I knew deep down that it was also probably the smartest thing I could do. No good could come from me being sucked deeper and deeper into whatever dark secret the Vanderlinds were hiding. And then Jessie stepped out of the shadows and looked up at the window where I stood. I thought the darkness would conceal me, but it was obvious that he could see me plain as day. His hair was ruffled and his dark coat billowed around his legs as the wind kicked up. I couldn’t move. All thoughts of my own safety vanished from my mind. All I wanted to do was to run to Jessie, to be with Jessie. Pushing the curtain aside, I pressed one hand against the window’s glass. Jessie took another step forward in response. “What are you doing?” Lilly called from her bed. “What are you looking at out there?” “Nothing,” I told her, hastily stepping away from the window. “I just saw something. I thought there was a fox in the yard, but I think it’s probably just the neighbor’s dog.” “Well, get back in bed,” she told me. “Aren’t you freezing?” “No,” I told her, shaking my head. I hadn’t even noticed the cold. I did not want to go to work the next day, so I claimed that my arm was still too painful to do any polishing or dusting. And it did still hurt quite a bit when I tried to move it. The truth was that I didn’t know what to make of my emotions and working in the castle all day wasn’t going to help me figure them out. Whenever I was anywhere close to Jessie, all I wanted to do was be with him. I needed to have my head clear so I could think things out. Of course I regretted my decision just as soon as Mama left to drive Lilly over in the car. At least when I was in the castle, there was always the hope of a chance-encounter with Jessie. I had no hope of seeing him while sulking around the house all day. But why did I want to see him so desperately? Being away from Jessie felt almost physically painful. But I also felt like I was losing my mind. Was this how everyone my age felt when they fell in love? Was this how Lilly felt about Walter? I went out for a walk to try to clear my head. “You’re so restless today. Do you have a fever?” Mama asked when we sat down for lunch. She pressed her lips to my forehead. “No, you feel just fine.” “I didn’t sleep well last night,” I told her. “I think I’m just overtired.” The day seemed to stretch on forever. I began to look forward to Lilly returning home from work in the hope that she had some news of Jessie. Maybe Emily had spoken to her or maybe Mrs. Denkler had a message for me. But when my sister got home there was nothing. It had apparently been just an ordinary day of dusting and polishing. By the time the sun started to set, I’d worked myself up into a mental state of torment. I began to understand why Guinevere had locked herself away in a convent because she couldn’t deal with how she felt about Lancelot while still being married to the king. As night drew in, I came to a conclusion. Being with Jessie was wrong. I could feel it in my gut that there was danger in the castle. But that didn’t keep me from loving him. I spent hours tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep, but fearing to look out the window. And then, when I finally did manage to close my eyes, I had a tortuous dream where Jessie and I were in love, but I was prohibited from marrying him. Instead I was packed off in a horse drawn carriage and sent far away. The last I saw of Jessie was his figure fading in the distance as he watched the coach carry me off. “How do you feel?” Mama asked when I came downstairs the next morning. “Better,” I told her, but that was only part of the truth. Yes, my arm did feel quite a bit better. — It was only a little sore. — But I actually felt better because I had come to a decision. It was true that I had been frightened by what Mrs. Denkler partially revealed to me about the Vanderlind family. There was obviously a secret there much darker than I had ever imagined. My mind couldn’t even begin to fathom what it might be. But I also knew that nothing could stop me from loving Jessie. If, for some reason, I was never to see him again, I would still love him just as passionately until the day I died as I did at that very moment. I knew I was barely seventeen and these were crazy thoughts for someone my age, but I felt my love for him deep in my soul. It was like it had always been there. Meeting him for the first time had just awoken those feelings from hibernation. I walked into town that afternoon with something on my mind. Would Jessie forgive me for the way I behaved? How could I let him know that I didn’t care about his family’s curse; I loved him for being him. As I strolled along, I stopped to look in the window of Houghton’s and then an idea came to me. The jewelry store was closed on Sundays, but I knew Mr. Houghton lived in the rooms above the shop, so I took a chance and rang the bell. “Yes, young lady?” Mr. Houghton said, peering out of a window on the second floor. He was an older man who lived by himself and had no family. His white hair stuck out on either side of his balding head so that he reminded me of how I’d always imagined Kris Kringle. “Sorry to bother you,” I called up to him. “But I need to buy a present and I have to have it for tonight.” Mr. Houghton was kind enough to open his store just for me. I had been earning good money for the whole summer, but giving most of it to Mama and Papa, so I didn’t have much to spend. There was a gold plated pocket watch that I thought Jessie might like, even though pocket watches were quickly going out of fashion. I had enough money for the watch itself, but not enough for any engraving. Mr. Houghton looked at me from over the top of his bifocals and said, “I don’t know if I mentioned it, but I’m running a Sunday special. Today only, engraving is free.” It took me several minutes to think of just the right words. When I had decided, Mr. Houghton engraved them on the inside of the watch cover. He wrote: Our love is timeless. All of my heart, Lettie As I walked home, Jessie’s present concealed in the pocket of my coat, I wondered if Jessie would come see me that night. I didn’t know if he was angry with me or hurt by my behavior. All I knew was I had to speak to Jessie Vanderlind and earn his forgiveness. Chapter 30 Colette “Did you know you were in love with Walter the first time you met him?” I asked as Lilly and I got ready for bed. My sister had been brushing her hair in front of the mirror and she paused as she thought about it. “I knew that I thought he was good looking,” she told me. “I knew right away that I found him attractive.” “But how long until you knew you were in love with him?” I persisted as I wiggled into my nightgown. “And who says I am in love with Walter?” she asked, giving me a coy look over her shoulder. “Oh, come on, Lilly,” I told her. “How long until you knew you were in love?” “Not that long,” she admitted. “I knew that I liked him a whole lot and then one day I just knew it was love. I think I really knew it at the dance when, instead of trying to defend Lev’s behavior, he was instantly trying to think of another way to get us home. That’s when I knew I wanted to marry him.” I took a moment to digest the fact that my sister knew she wanted to marry Walter Bennett. “And you think you’d feel differently if he’d rushed to Lev’s defense and said some horrible excuse like, ‘boys will be boy,’ or something like that?” Lilly frowned a little. “I don’t know. I’d like to think that I would. But I also know Walter, and he would never say anything so aweful. That’s a big part of the reason why I love him.” I envied Lilly. Her love for Walter seemed so simple. They loved each other and one day they would get married. There was no disease. There was no difference in social position. There wasn’t some dark family curse keeping them apart. “Are in love?” Lilly asked. Her question caught me by surprise. I wanted to tell her yes. I wanted to share that I was madly in love with Jessie Vanderlind and that he was in love with me. It didn’t feel right to keep my feelings from her, even thought I’d been fighting for the last few days to keep them from myself. “I don’t know,” I told her, after giving it some thought. “Things are complicated.” Lilly shook her head. “If the first word out of your mouth wasn’t yes, then you’re not in love. That’s not how love feels.” I pulled down the blankets on my bed and climbed in. “I guess you would know.” “Well, I’m glad if you’re not,” she said, reaching over to switch off the lamp that sat on a small table between our two beds. “I mean, I want you to be in love, but not with that Vanderlind boy. I know he’s beautiful, but there’s something not right with that family. I don’t know what it is, but there’s obviously something not quite right.” I thought about Lilly’s words as I waited for her to fall asleep. My first impulse had been to admit to her that I was in love with Jessie Vanderlind. In fact, I wanted to shout it from the rooftops. But I was still reluctant to tell her. Maybe it was because I knew Lilly would disapprove. Maybe it was because I wasn’t sure of Jessie’s feelings. We’d never said I love you, but I had no doubt about my feelings. Once Lilly’s breathing became regular, I put on my robe and slipped outside. I didn’t know if Jessie was going to be there, but I was ready to wait all night. As I hurried across the lawn, Jessie stepped out of the shadows and caught me in his arms. “Oh, Jessie,” I exclaimed in a loud whisper, my voice practically startled out of me. “What happened?” he asked, a concerned frown pulling at the corners of his mouth. “Mrs. Denkler said she had to send you home on Friday. And then I saw you in the window Friday night, but you didn’t come out.” “I went upstairs to leave Arthur’s flowers in the hallway, but his door popped open a few inches,” I told him, taking strength from the fact that his arms were still around me. “I went to pull it closed, but then Mrs. Denkler came up and accused me of looking in the room.” “Oh,” Jessie said, looking even graver than he had before. “And then she saw the pendant you gave me and she grew very angry. We’re not allowed to wear any personal adornment at work and she tried to rip it form my neck. I stumbled and ended up falling into the room,” I confessed. “I saw what was in there. And what wasn’t.” “And what did Mrs. Denkler say to you?” he asked, cautiously. “She said that Arthur had been sent to a clinic in New York,” I admitted. “And that it would be a very bad thing for the town if the blood donations were to stop.” Jessie took me by the shoulders and held me slightly away from him so he could look into my eyes. “I should have never let this happen,” he said. “I should have just kept away, even with how I feel about you.” “No,” I told him, shaking my head. “If you feel anything for me like I feel about you, then that would have been impossible.” “I feel more for you than I ever imagined I could.” His eyes searched mine. “But I need to explain,” Jessie said, furrowing his forehead as he struggled with some dark burden that I knew he was reluctant to share. “I need to tell you about my family.” “Please don’t,” I said, closing the gap between us. “Not now. I know that there is some horrible secret that you hide from the world. But I don’t want to know. Not yet. I just want to love you, and know that you love me, and not worry about whatever your family really does with the blood for Arthur.” “I love you,” Jessie whispered, his voice hoarse. “I’ve loved you since before I even met you. I can’t begin to explain how, but it’s true.” “I know,” I told him. “I feel the exact same way.” “But still,” he went on. “This secret of my family’s... It’s much worse than you can possibly imagine.” “Please don’t,” I told him, touching his perfect lips to stop his words. “Don’t tell me you love me and then spoil it all in the next breath. Let me just enjoy this moment.” He nodded his head slightly. “I have something for you,” I said, suddenly feeling shy. Jessie was from an incredibly wealthy family. The watch I had purchased for him was only made of gold plate. “What is it?” he asked, sensing my sudden reluctance. “It’s not much,” I admitted, pulling the small package form the pocket of my robe. He lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it. “If it’s from you, then I shall cherish it forever,” he assured me. I carefully observed his face as he unwrapped the watch and read the engraving. “It’s wonderful,” he said, and I could tell he was sincere. “The engraving alone means the world to me.” “I meant every word,” I told him. “I’m not sure how, but our love does feel timeless. At least it does for me.” “It does for me,” he quickly assured me. “I know that I’ll never stop loving you.” And then he dropped to one knee and took my hand. “There’s a question I need to ask you.” Chapter 42 Jessie “She left?” I asked, frowning at my little sister. “Yes,” Emily said, nodding a few times. “Mrs. Denkler sent her home in a car.” My impulse was to rush over to the Gibson house immediately to see if Colette was alright, but the sun was still shining in the sky so I wouldn’t have made it very far. “Do you have any idea what happened?” I asked, both of my hands clenched at my sides with the frustration of my impotence. “All I know is that Colette went upstairs to deliver the flowers that she brought. Mrs. Denkler followed her.” Emily shifted from foot to foot, obviously feeling anxious as well. “And then Denkie was dragging Colette downstairs by the arm and ordering the chauffeur to bring the car around to the back to take her home.” I ran my hand through my hair a few times. “Do you think it had anything to do with Arthur?” I asked. “I don’t know.” Emily looked alarmed. She knew how important it was to keep the family’s unfortunate situation a secret. “That’s the only thing I can think it might be.” Quickly, I sought Mrs. Denkler, finding her in her sitting room, having a cup of tea. “What happened to Colette?” I asked. “Who?” she asked, frowning slightly, as if trying to place the name. “Colette Gibson,” I said for clarity. “I heard that she had to go home for the day.” “Oh, you mean Miss Gibson, the housemaid,” she said, setting down her cup. “Yes, I think we may no longer be in need of Miss Gibson’s services.” “What in the world happened?” I asked. I needed some sort of explanation because my imagination was running wild. “Someone apparently left the door to Arthur’s room unlocked and it popped open. I’m afraid she saw into the room,” Mrs. Denkler informed me. “I heard she was injured,” I pressed. “She stumbled and may have hurt her arm,” the housekeeper admitted. “But it was just a little bump. Nothing of consequence.” “But what did you tell her?” I asked. “How did you explain Arthur’s absence?” She gave a small shrug, as if she couldn’t understand my concern. “I said that he had left last week for a clinic in New York.” “And she believed you?” I demanded. “I see no reason why she wouldn’t believe me,” Mrs. Denkler said with the conviction of a person who was used to never being questioned. “I think she found the soiled goblets a bit disconcerting, and she did have a few questions as to why we were still paying people for their blood. But I explained that it was healthier for the town if the donations continued.” I stared at the housekeeper for several seconds, trying to decide if she was being intentionally obtuse. “Are you saying that you purposely frightened the girl?” Mrs. Denkler shook her head. “Girls like that are never frightened. Not even when it’s obvious that they should be.” She gave me a penetrating look with eyes as hard as flint. “She’s the kind of girl who always makes trouble in a great house. I should have seen that. I would have never hired her, but...” She paused for a moment with a far-away look in her eyes and then shook her head. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll release her from her position tomorrow and that will be the end of it.” “You will do no such thing,” I informed her. The housekeeper put her hands on her hips and glared at me. “I have a responsibility to run this house in the manner that it was run when your grandfather was alive. He never tolerated nonsense from the staff. Especially the kind of nonsense I suspect has been going on for the past few months.” She gave me a significant look. “The Vanderlind reputation must be upheld.” “You have an obligation to do as you are told, Mrs. Denkler,” I informed her. “You are not above being released from your position. Just remember that.” Mrs. Denkler’s eyes bulged with surprise and she clutched at the lace on her high collar. “You wouldn’t,” she exclaimed. “I’ve been the housekeeper for the castle since before you were born.” Her eyes were glistening and I saw that she was actually fighting back tears. “You’re right, Denkie,” I told her, squeezing her shoulder to be reassuring. “I wouldn’t. But let’s not fight over this. Just make sure that Miss Gibson remains employed here and we’ll say nothing else about it.” The tears were instantly replaced by Mrs. Denkler’s customary shrewd appearance. “You want the maid to stay a maid. I understand.” That was not my point, by any means, but I didn’t want to argue with her any longer. The rest of the day passed at a snail’s pace. I was practically climbing the walls. As soon as the sun dipped below the horizon, I was out the door. And outside Colette’s window a few minutes after that, concealing myself in the long shadows of the backyard. It was foolish to arrive so early. My skin was throbbing with the pain of the dwindling sunlight and Colette wouldn’t be expecting me until much later, if she was expecting me at all. But I had to be near here. I had to know that she wasn’t injured in any way. I had to know if she still loved me, or if she now considered me some kind of fiend. As the minutes slowly dragged by, I grew increasingly anxious about Colette’s affections. I’d only known her for a few short months, but her feelings for me were the axis upon which my whole world turned. If Mrs. Denkler had revealed more than she’d admitted, or if Colette was able to surmise the truth from what she saw in Arthur’s room, then there was a strong possibility that I would never hold my dear girl in my arms again. It would be a harsh reality, but one that I would more than likely have to face. I only wished that I had been the one to tell her about the curse that my grandfather had spread to all of us. That would have been the noble thing to do. Instead I just kept ignoring the truth because I so desperately wanted to be with her. If only I hadn’t caught scarlet fever. If only Grandfather had been a better man. But such was my life. I had to accept the fact that fate was a cruel master. The light in Colette’s bedroom came on as the hour approached ten and then went off again shortly thereafter. I knew that Colette shared a room with her sister and that she had to wait until Lilly had fallen asleep. I stood by our apple tree and waited, my eyes glued to the window. An hour ticked past and there was no movement that I could discern. As the second hour got underway, I saw the curtain twitch and caught a glimpse of Colette’s hair. She probably assumed she was concealed by the darkness of her room, but I could see her as plain as day. Stepping away from the tree, I stood on the lawn, looking up at her. Moving the curtain aside, Colette looked down at me. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from her. She was just so lovely; it ripped at my heart not to be able to take her in my arms. But she wasn’t moving. She wasn’t coming down to be by my side. She just stood there, safe behind the walls of her family’s home, and stared at me. Did she know the full truth? Or had she simply guessed that the secret that I’d been on the verge of telling her so many times was much worse than she’d ever imagined. I knew she hadn’t completely turned against me. If she had, then she wouldn’t have been standing there with her palm pressed against the glass. Lilly must have awoken and drawn Colette’s attention because she suddenly turned away and then disappeared from view. I stood on the lawn for most of the rest of the night, but Colette did not return to the window. I knew she wouldn’t, but I found it almost impossible to leave. I decided to sleep in my coffin that dawn. It wasn’t my usual custom, but I felt like I needed walls around me or I might explode. I hated that I was a vampire. I felt desperate to escape the prison of being a member of the undead. I longed for the simple pleasures of mortality, like holding Colette’s hand while strolling in the sunshine. “What’s this I hear about housemaids sneaking into Arthur’s room?” Daniel demanded as he stalked into the dining hall the next evening. “I knew we should have never hired anyone local.” “I think you’re being a bit overdramatic, darling,” Mother said, setting down her goblet. “One of the maids got a peek into Arthur’s room because someone left the door unlocked. But Mrs. Denkler explained it all away, so there’s no need to get your nose bent out of shape.” “Well, I think we should fire her anyway,” Daniel said, helping himself to a crystal goblet and filling it from a carafe on the table. “Or maybe get rid of her altogether. One can never be too cautious about these things.” “You will not touch one hair on her head!” I found myself snarling from my seat on the other side of the table. It was a ridiculous thing to have said. Mother was making light of the problem and that was probably the best course of action. But Daniel was so cavalier about ending the life of the girl I loved, that I found it hard to control my temper. “Oh,” my brother said with an amused smirk. “Was it the little trollop who Jessie’s been toying with? Well, this does add an intriguing twist to the evening.” “She’s not a trollop and I haven’t been toying with her,” I informed him, knowing full well that I was rising to the bait. Daniel cocked an eyebrow and took on a superior tone. “So what have you decided to do with the girl?” he asked. “Don’t leave us all in suspense.” “I’ve decided that I’m going to ask her to marry me,” I said, glaring straight back into his eyes. “You can’t!” Daniel practically shrieked. “The undead can’t marry the living. The Bishops would never stand for it.” “They would if I conjoin with her,” I said, keeping my own voice steady. “And that is what I intend to do.” “Conjoin?!” Daniel sounded like I had just offered him a slug of poison. “You know some little trollop for a few weeks and you decide you want to be with her forever?” “Yes,” I said, firmly. “Then just turn her, you fool!” my brother exclaimed. “That’s the reasonable thing to do. You can’t bond yourself for eternity to someone who is going to get old and gray while you’re still in your prime. That’s insanity.” “That’s love,” our mother said in a much quieter voice. Daniel swung around to face her. “You’re not helping!” he shouted. “Watch your tone,” she said to him. Then, turning to me, Mother said, “Sweetheart, you know that if you conjoin with a mortal, then you can never be with anyone else, not for the rest of eternity. You wouldn’t be able to be with your own kind.” “Not that a vampiress would have you,” Daniel said with a sneer. “You would probably be shunned from vampire society,” Mother pointed out. “And what would you do after she passed away?” It was a thought so painful to me that I had trouble even thinking about it. “I don’t know.” “You make me sick,” my brother said. “Thinking you’re in love... You’ve been going to the damn theater too often. You’re not in love. You don’t know anything about it.” I shrugged my shoulders. “It’s the way I feel.” “But you’re only seventeen,” Mother insisted. “How do you know it’s the way you will always feel?” “Turn her,” Daniel said. “If you don’t like her as a vampiress, you can always stake her and be done with it.” “Daniel,” Mother exclaimed. “I hope you are being facetious.” My brother gave her a flat look. “What would you have me say? He can’t conjoin with her. That would bring shame to all of us. I’m not going to be ostracized from all good society just because Jessie has a crush.” “It’s more than a crush,” I assured him. “Much more.” “Oh, save your romantic pap for the mortal,” Daniel snarled. “I don’t buy any of it.” “I’m sorry you feel that way,” I told him, “but I’m not changing my mind.” “Mother,” Daniel said, turning to face her. “Are you going to stand for this nonsense?” Our mother lifted her hands, palms up, in dismay. “The heart wants what the heart wants.” “I think the family’s honor should come before Jessie’s foolish notions of love.” I knew Daniel and I would never see eye-to-eye, so I addressed our mother when I said, “I want to go before the Bishops and explain my position.” “You will do no such thing,” Daniel snapped, shoving between us and getting right up in my face. “I won’t let you.” I gave him a steady look. “It’s not up to you.” “I am the head of this family now,” Daniel said, sticking his chin in the air. This caused me to grin. “Only in your own mind.” “Mother, are you going to allow him to do this?” Daniel whined. “Both of you need to stop,” she said in her most no-nonsense tone. “I think we should wait and allow cooler heads to prevail. Daniel, you need to stop thinking you’re in charge. I had quite enough of that from your grandfather.” Turning to me, she said, “And you need to slow down. This is a monumental decision and it shouldn’t be made on just one day’s sleep.” “But...” I intended to protest that I hadn’t made the decision lightly, but Mother held up her hand. “Daniel is right in that this decision will affect all of us, so I ask that you not do anything too hastily.” Reaching up, she caressed my cheek and looked into my eyes. “I know you don’t take love lightly,” she told me, “but I think a little patience is called for. A few months delay won’t mean the end of the world. And right now I think you really need some perspective.” “You’re wrong,” I said. “Both of you. The love I feel for Colette is different than anything I ever imagined. It’s as if my life only really began when I met her.” “I can’t stay here and listen to this nonsense,” Daniel growled. “I’m going upstairs to pack a bag. If Jessie’s going to ruin the family, I’m sure not going to stand around and watch it.” He glanced at our mother. “I’m going to New York. Call me when you’ve talk some sense into him.” If it had been only Daniel who was against me, then I would have simply ignored him. But I had always heeded the advice of my mother. I knew she had my best interest in mind. If she thought I needed time to reconsider, then I needed to take some time. Daniel was as good as his word. He left the castle later that night. I was happy to see the back of him. I didn’t need him glowering at me and complaining about the honor of the family. Families survived scandal all the time. It was true that conjoining with a mortal was something that would probably ostracize me from the undead world, but I found that the more I thought about it, the less I cared. I’d never wanted to be part of the undead world. “You won’t have enough time to make it to New York,” Mother said, as Daniel was headed out the door. “I’ll overnight in Cleveland,” he said, giving her a brusque kiss on the cheek. “I just need to get out of here before I ram a stake through Jessie’s romantic heart.” “It’s probably best that you go for a little while,” she said, leading him to the door. “Have a safe flight.” “Update me when my little brother has come to his senses,” he said, sparing me a withering glance and then disappearing into the night. It was painful, but I didn’t go to see Colette that night. My brain became too full of pink champagne bubbles whenever I was near her. I desperately wanted to fly along the river to try to clear my head. But I knew if I went outside, then I would suddenly find myself in Colette’s yard. So I stuck to the castle, spending most of the night in my room. My isolation was a special kind of torture, with my thoughts being constantly filled by Colette. I wanted to see her so desperately, and yet I had no idea if she wanted to see me. I spent another day in my coffin, practically tearing apart the upholstery. All I could think about was Colette. How could she possibly have won my heart so easily? And how could I ever give her up? Ending my romance with Colette Gibson and then leaving Tiburon for the next couple of decades would be the right thing to do. Turning her into a member of the undead would be the selfish thing to do. And conjoining with Colette for the rest of her life, and the rest of my eternity, would be the foolish thing to do. I knew all of that. The only problem was; I didn’t know which option to choose. I couldn’t see clearly which was the right path to take. By the time the sun was starting to set and I climbed out of my coffin for the evening, I knew only one thing for sure; I had to see her. I took special care dressing that evening. It was possibly the last time I would ever see my darling girl and I wanted to look my best. I put on a dark gray suit and even went so far as to decorate my lapel with a red carnation. I took my fill of blood and then slipped out of the castle without a word to anyone. I was undecided in my actions, but I didn’t want Mother or Emily to interfere. I was grateful Daniel had left. Just knowing he was in New York made me feel less on edge. As I flew along, I resolved that I had to confess. I had to explain everything to Colette and then let the cards fall where they may. She deserved to know what I was. She deserved to know the truth. Chapter 43 Colette “Colette Gibson,” Jessie said, looking up at me with his fathomless gray eyes. “Will you marry me?” “Yes,” I said, as soon as the words had passed through his perfect lips. I probably should have hesitated. I probably should have taken some time to think it over. But I didn’t want to. Every fiber of my being wanted to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I didn’t care that his family was hiding some dark, morbid secret. That had nothing to do with Jessie. That had nothing to do with our love. Jessie sprang to his feet and swept me up in his arms. Under his long coat, he was wearing some type of dark suit. There was a red flower in his lapel. He had come dressed for the occasion and I wished that I was wearing something besides my nightgown and wrapper. But then he washed all my awkwardness away by saying, “You’ve made the happiest man in the world.” And then he kissed me. It was a kiss that both filled me with heat and made me shiver. “Should we go to your family? Or should I speak to your father alone?” Jessie asked. “How are things like this handled in your country?” “I...” I stammered. I had no idea what to tell him. I wanted to be his bride, but I knew my family would insist upon a lengthy engagement and I wanted to be with Jessie that very instant. “I think we should elope.” It was as if dark clouds filled Jessie’s eyes. “Why?” he asked. “Because I can’t wait to be your wife,” I explained. “Every second I’m away from you feels like an eternity.” “But your family...” he began. “I know,” I told him. “I hate to cause my parents any grief, but once they see how happy I am as Mrs. Jessie Vanderlind, then I know they’ll forgive us for running off.” Jessie frowned. “It wouldn’t be honorable,” he said. “We’re already starting our life together with too many secrets. And if you would only let me...” “Don’t,” I said, stopping his lips with a kiss. “I know you have your secrets, but share them with me when we are husband and wife.” “When?” he asked, burying his face in my hair. “If we are to be wed, then I want it to be this instant.” “Tomorrow night,” I told him. “We can sneak down the Tiburon to Yontville and wake up the Justice of the Peace. Then I can call my family in the morning and tell them the good news.” The clouds parted from Jessie’s brow. “I love you Colette Gibson,” he told me. “I can’t believe you want to be my wife.” “I’ve never wanted anything more in the world,” I assured him. Then I thought of something. “What about your family?” I asked. He was quiet for a moment. “What about them?” “Will they approve of us?” I put a hand to my cheek at the thought of how they would react. “I can’t imagine they will.” A rich young man running off with the maid was not something fine families usually found appealing. “I hate to think of your family disliking me. And I don’t want them to think that I’m some kind of...” I fought off the urge to say gold digger. “My sister already adores you,” Jessie assured me, squeezing me in his arms. “And my mother will love you just as soon as I tell her that you are my bride.” “What about your brothers?” I asked, with some hesitancy. “What about Arthur and Daniel?” “Arthur is...” he began. “Arthur is someone we don’t have to worry about.” He shook his head and then continued with, “And Daniel left for New York last evening. We don’t expect him back for at least a month.” And then he kissed me again, a deep, penetrating kiss that I felt all the way down to my toes. “I don’t think I can wait that long,” I said, my breath catching in my throat with anticipation. “Tomorrow evening then,” he said, running his fingertips across my cheek, down my neck and to my collarbone. His caress sent shivers through my whole body. “Where shall we rendezvous? Shall I meet you here, by our favorite apple tree?” “No,” I said, thinking it over. I hated deceiving my family. It would be an emotional challenge for me to sneak off, if only for less than a day. And when I came home again, I would no longer be a girl. I would be a married woman. I wanted to leave the house by myself. I wanted to say goodbye to my present life and step away from childhood all on my own. “I’ll meet you at the castle,” I finally told him. Jessie was about to say something in protest, but I stopped him by adding, “I mean outside the castle, in the woods out there along the river. If you can arrange a boat, then we can row down to the next town.” Jessie probably could have arranged a car, but a boat sounded so much more romantic. “Are you sure that’s what you want?” Jessie asked. “It will be dark. I would feel better accompanying you.” “No, this is something I have to do on my own,” I assured him. “And besides, Tiburon is perfectly safe, day or night. We haven’t had so much as a robbery since I can remember.” “But...” Jessie tried protesting again. “How will you get there? On your bicycle? What kind of bridegroom would I be if I allowed that to happen?” “Don’t you worry about me,” I said, patting him on the forearm to assure him. “You just focus on finding a boat that doesn’t leak. Our elopement will be a lot less romantic if we ended up getting soaked.” “Shall we meet at midnight?” he asked. I nodded. “Midnight,” I repeated. “But shouldn’t we choose an exact spot? Do you know of an old tree or something? How will we find each other?” Jessie gave it some thought. “There’s that large oak tree by the water’s edge. The one where the boughs hang way out over the water.” I knew the exact tree. “Sure,” I told him. “It’s got a rope swing. In the summer, kids use it all the time for swimming.” “Oh.” Jessie frowned a little. “I’m not sure that there’s a rope swing.” “I think we’re probably talking about the same tree, but maybe we should pick someplace else, just in case.” “Don’t worry,” Jessie assured me, bending slightly to nuzzle my hair. “No matter where you are, I’ll always be able to find you.” Chapter 44 Colette I begged off from work for another day. I needed time alone in the room I shared with Lilly to prepare for my elopement, and I couldn’t exactly pack with my family around. My mother frowned when I told her that I was staying home. “If you’re still in pain, then maybe we really should call the doctor.” “I don’t think that’s necessary,” I said. “I’m sure by tomorrow I’ll be right as rain.” Mama reached up and laid her hand against my cheek, looking into my eyes. “Are you sure that’s all it is?” she asked. “It’s just a sore arm. Nothing else is bothering you?” “No.” I shook my head back and forth a few times. “Nothing at all.” I’d always been an obedient daughter and never given my parents much grief. They were good parents and I knew they loved me, so it seemed only fair to show them the same consideration. Not telling them about my engagement to Jessie was one of the most difficult things I’d ever done. But I knew if I told them, then they would want me to wait. They’d insist that I finished high school and get to know Jessie better. But I wouldn’t wait. I couldn’t wait. Being in Jessie’s arms, sharing a life together, was all I could think about. Papa needed to get out the door bright and early to make sure everything was running smoothly on the town hall project. They were going to pour the foundation soon and he wanted to make sure it was done right. Mama was going to drop him off and then drive over to meet up with a few of her old school friends who live in the next town. They got together for a luncheon a few times a year. This was perfect for my plans because it left me with the house to myself for a few hours until Mama returned. Even though I was still in my nightgown when my parents were about to leave, I ran downstairs to give both of them a hug and a kiss goodbye. “You’re being awfully affectionate this morning,” Papa remarked as I took a moment to give him a second squeeze. “Am I?” I asked, putting my arms around Mama and hugging her again, too. “I just wanted to let you know how much I love you.” Mama gave me a kiss on the head. “We love you too, you silly girl. Are you sure you don’t feel well enough to go to work? You seem to be full of energy and I wouldn’t want you to lose your position.” Gingerly moving my elbow up and down, I said, “It still hurts a little, but I’m sure I’ll be fine in another day if I just take it easy.” After they left, pulling the door closed behind them, I turned around to find Lilly sitting on the stairs, watching me. “What are you up to, Lettie?” she asked, suspicion in her eyes. “Nothing,” I assured her. “I’m just letting my arm heal.” “Is that all it is?” she asked, getting to her feet. “Because you’re acting awfully funny.” “No, I’m not,” I insisted. “If you want to give your notice at the castle, then I’m all for it,” she said. “Papa has his town hall job and then he’ll work on the school. We don’t have to keep working there. Our family’s doing fine now.” Her comment surprised me. “Don’t you like working at the castle?” “If I’m being completely honest, no,” she said. “The work is fine, but the family makes me uncomfortable. There’s something about them that’s just not right. You can see it in their eyes.” “They all have beautiful eyes,” I insisted. I couldn’t bear to hear Jessie criticized. “No.” Lilly shook her head. “They all have cold eyes. Dead eyes. Like the eyes of a shark.” “You’re being ridiculous,” I told her. “And you’re only saying that because of the color. The Vanderlinds can’t help it that their eyes are gray.” “I suppose,” Lilly said. “But I still don’t like it there. I heard that Mrs. Zucker’s cousin isn’t working out at the store. They’re going to be hiring again and I’m thinking of asking for my old job back.” My first impulse was to tell her not to do it. I couldn’t imagine leaving the castle, even if I wasn’t betrothed to Jessie. But then I thought about how odd it would be if Lilly was still working there as a maid while I was Jessie’s wife. “Maybe you should,” I told her. “That might be a good idea, seeing that you don’t like it.” “I’ll ask for you, too,” my sister told me. “I think it would be better if we left the castle together.” “Thank you,” I said, giving her a hug. “I love you, Lilly.” “I love you, too,” she said, pulling away from me while giving me another suspicious look. “But I wish I understood why you are acting so strangely.” After Lilly left for work, it didn’t take me long to decide on my wedding trousseau. I wanted to wear my organdy dress as my bridal gown, but it was still torn from my encounter with Lev Wilson. I decided on my green dress with the white flowers. It was of a light fabric, so I knew I’d probably be chilly, but once Jessie and I were together, he could put his arms around me and keep me warm. I positioned the dress and my favorite hat, the straw one with the silk daisies on it, toward the front of the closet. That way it would be easier to retrieve my clothes without disturbing my sister. After that I pulled a small suitcase down from the closet shelf, flipped it open on the bed, and packed my prettiest nightgown. I knew I would also need something to wear the next morning, so I added a sweater and a wool skirt, along with some warm tights and a few toiletries. There was still my toothbrush and a few other items, but I thought I would slip those things in at the last minute, so that no one in my family would notice anything missing. Taking a seat at my desk, I pulled out a fresh sheet of paper and found a pen. I didn’t want my family to panic when they found my bed empty in the morning. That wouldn’t be a nice thing to do to them. So I thought I would write a note, just to assure everyone that I was fine and in no danger. It would lessen the surprise when Jessie and I called the next morning as newlyweds, but it was better not to make my parents worry. Dear Family, I’m sorry for keeping this secret from you, but Jessie Vanderlind and I have fallen in love. In fact, by the time you read this note, I will already be his wife. I apologize for sneaking off and eloping in this way, but I know you would counsel me to wait to get married until we’re both a little older. I’m afraid I love Jessie too much to delay. I hope you’ll forgive me, once you see how happy he makes me. He truly is the most wonderful man I have ever met. We’ll call you when we get up. Please don’t worry until then. I’m sure Jessie will take good care of me. I love you all very much. Lettie It was just as I was signing my name when I heard the front door open and close. Snatching the note off my desk, I tossed it into the suitcase, on top of my clothes. Snapping the lid shut, I quickly tucked the whole thing under my bed. “Lettie,” I heard my mother call as she was climbing the stairs. A moment later she was poking her head in the door. “Hi, Mama,” I said. “What are you doing back so soon?” “I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said, pulling the pin from her hat. “After dropping your father off, I drove half way there before I realized the luncheon isn’t until next week.” Chapter 45 Jessie I’d already worn my favorite suit when I’d proposed to Colette, so I felt at a bit of a loss for proper wedding attire. I wondered if it would be considered bad manners to wear the suit again for the ceremony. My next choice was to wear my tuxedo, but I decided against that pretty quickly. I sincerely doubted Colette had a wedding dress tucked away in her closet and it wouldn’t do to be dressed fancier than the bride. I did have a blue suit that I’d been told was becoming, but I couldn’t seem to find it anywhere in my closet. After an extensive search, I discovered it crumpled on the floor. It must have not been hung up properly when the household contents were unpacked. It definitely needed a good pressing. When I’d flown back from Lettie’s, I’d spent the rest of the night searching for a boat. My mother had plans to get a couple of small boats for the castle, but no one had gotten around to ordering them yet. Most people who used the river had already taken their boats out of the water in anticipation of the first big freeze. I had to soar up and down the river for a few hours until a small rowboat, pulled up on the bank and turned over to dry, caught my eye. It wasn’t the most attractive of conveyances, but I hoped that Colette would find it romantic. By the time I’d towed it back to the castle and hid it in the woods, the sun was preparing to rise. As I hurried inside, the sunlight had already starting to lighten the sky, making my skin ache. I had to laugh at my own stupidity. I didn’t want to be such a distracted bridegroom that I ended up inadvertently roasting myself. Once I was safe inside the walls of the castle, I found that I was inordinately tired. But there were still so many things that I had to get done. I had to choose my wedding suit. I had to figure out a plan to avoid the sun once we’d been officially wed. I loved Lettie more than I loved my own life, but it would be a terrible shock for her to see her new husband burn to a crisp the morning after her wedding. I also needed to find some type of ring for my darling girl. I intended to have her real wedding ring specially crafted, but there wasn’t time at the moment. I would just have to go through the family vault and find a temporary ring adequate for the ceremony. My head throbbed and I realized I was hungry. I hurried to Arthur’s room and helped myself to one of the blood packets in the refrigerator. Packing had to wait, I decided as I finished my meal. I needed time to rest. The knowledge that Colette would soon be my bride must have put me at ease because I quickly found the repose that was usually so elusive. When I finally opened my eyes again, the sun had set on another day. I immediately leapt to my feet and started packing, which led to the dilemma about which suit to wear. I rang for a maid and handed her the blue suit. “I need this pressed right away,” I told her. “Bring it to me just as soon as it’s ready.” And then I headed to the vault, where we kept quite a bit of the family jewelry. The vault was a large room in the dungeon that Grandfather had converted into a walk-in safe. Three of its walls were stone and the fourth was a large, metal door with a combination lock. It would be foolhardy for a mortal to steal from vampires, but we saw no reason to subject the servants to temptation. Especially with so much jewelry around. We could easily lose dozens of pieces and never even notice for a few decades, if ever. Once I opened the vault, I was faced with a real challenge. What was an appropriate ring for a girl like Lettie? I dug through boxes upon boxes of jewelry, putting rings aside that I thought might be a possibility, but nothing seemed quite right. I knew that Lettie came from a good family, but she wasn’t used to the wealth of a family like the Vanderlinds. I didn’t want to overwhelm her with a giant diamond, but I didn’t want to insult her with a ring of no consequence. It was just impossible to put everything I felt for Miss Gibson into one tiny piece of jewelry. “You wanted to see me?” Mrs. Denkler asked, appearing in the vault’s doorway. “What?” I had been so absorbed in finding the right piece of jewelry that I hadn’t even heard her approaching. “One of the maids said you were looking for me,” she said, her eyes flitting over the pile of jewelry in front of me. “Is there something I can help you find?” “No, that’s quite alright,” I assured her. “This is…” I couldn’t think of an excuse for why I was combing through diamond rings. “I didn’t send for you,” I finally managed to say. “I just wanted my blue suit pressed.” “One of the maids is doing it now,” she said. “Is there a special occasion?” “No, no,” I assured her. “I just found my blue suit crumpled on the floor of my closet and I want it pressed.” “The maid said you wanted it right away,” she said, persisting in knowing why I was acting so suspiciously. “I’d like it done,” I told her. “Whoever hung up my clothes made a poor job of it.” “I apologize,” the housekeeper said. “I will see to it that whoever is responsible has their pay docked.” “Please don’t do that,” I said, not wanting to cause trouble for somebody else, just to conceal my own secret activities. “It’s not necessary. It’s really just the one suit.” “I believe your brother has a blue suit of similar style. If you like, I could ask him if you may borrow it. The two of you are about the same size,” she said. “Daniel is in New York,” I told her. “Isn’t he?” Mrs. Denkler gave a brief look of surprise. “Oh, yes. That’s right. I’d forgotten.” She stared at me for a moment. “May I ask if there is a specific ring you are searching for? I have all the jewelry catalogued. Perhaps I can help.” “No,” I snapped, tired of her meddling. “I’m fine. I just want to look through the vault in peace.” Mrs. Denkler stared at me for another moment, her mouth opening to say something and then shutting again, the words unsaid. Finally, she decided on, “You know that my first priority in this world is your family.” “I know,” I told her, feeling a little guilty for being short-tempered. “You’ve proven your loyalty many times. “May I at least know if you’ve eaten recently,” she asked. “I could bring you something, if you’re hungry.” “No, thank you,” I told her. “I ate just before I came down here.” “I understand,” she said. “And I hope that someday you’ll understand why I have to do this.” And then she slammed the vault door shut. Chapter 46 Colette The moon was full in the sky as I walked along the edge of the road with my hat clamped on my head and my suitcase under my arm. It was a bright evening with a real hunter’s moon illuminating everything with the unearthly quality of moon glow. It took forever for Lilly to fall asleep. She kept wanting to talk about leaving the castle and going back to Zucker’s. She was doing her best to get me excited about the plan. More than once I was on the verge of confessing the truth, but something always held me back. I was afraid she would go immediately to Mama and Papa so that they would stop me from leaving. I couldn’t have that. I couldn’t have Jessie standing alone in the woods, wondering what had happened to me. It was better to leave my family the note and call them in the morning when I was a new bride. Finally Lilly’s breathing became steady and I slipped out of bed. Gathering up my clothes and suitcase, I crept out into the hall before dressing. That way if Lilly woke up, she wouldn’t catch me in the act. She would probably just assume I was using the water closet. Saying goodbye to my girlhood home was difficult. I had to brush away more than one tear. It was only the thought of Jessie that gave me the strength to leave my family. Thinking of him spurred me onward. I had slipped out of the house and was far down the road before I remembered that the note was still in my suitcase. I’d forgotten to leave it. My family would not know what had happened to me. The thought of how worried my mother would be almost turned my feet around. But then I looked at my watch and saw that it was getting close to midnight. And I still had a very long way to walk. I resolved that I would have to get up very early and give my parents a call. That way they would only have a few minutes of worry, if any at all. I walked along, trying to hurry. It was a long way to the castle on foot. I don’t know why I didn’t tell Jessie to come get me. Then we would be walking arm-in-arm. I should have at least taken my bicycle. At the rate I was going, I wouldn’t rendezvous with Jessie until one in the morning. I spied an obliging bike on the porch of a house and decided I had to borrow it. I made sure to memorize the address and location of the house so I could return the bicycle the next day. I didn’t like the idea of taking it without permission, but time was of the essence and I hadn’t thought my plan out very clearly. Riding made things go much faster. There was even a basket on the front of the bicycle, so I balanced my suitcase there. It was a cool evening, but I was pedaling as quickly as my legs would take me. Stopping for a moment, I stripped my coat off so I wouldn’t break into a sweat. My green dress felt very thin in the night air, but I didn’t want to elope with Jessie while covered in sweat. When I reached the turnoff for the castle, I tucked the borrowed bicycle behind some trees. I didn’t want anyone else to borrow it before I had a chance to return it to its owners. Then I headed down the road toward the castle on foot with my suitcase in my hand and my coat over my arm. The night air had gone from chilly to cold, but I wanted to make sure I had fully cooled down from my ride before putting on my coat again. As the castle came into view, I stopped for a moment to take it in. I was about to marry Jessie Vanderlind. I would be his bride. Soon the castle would be my home. It felt so very right to me, like it was somehow meant-to-be. “Destiny,” I murmured to the wind. I turned left off the road, crossed a portion of the expanse of lawn that led up to the Vanderlind estate, and then started making my way through the woods. The full moon was helpful with my progress, but it was still slow going. There wasn’t enough light for me to see my watch, but I began to fear that I was late. I tried going faster, but my feet kept getting tripped up by rocks and fallen branches. I thought if I went too quickly I would twist an ankle. Jessie would just have to be patient. The deeper I went into the woods, the darker things became. I could no longer see the castle to my right and was only vaguely aware that the public road was somewhere off to my left. Not many people stayed up past midnight in Tiburon, and they definitely weren’t out driving around. I was starting to feel very alone and wished, not for the first time, that I had agreed to Jessie meeting me at my house. I had to keep going, I decided. The sooner I got to the river, the sooner I would be in Jessie’s arms. The sound of a twig snapping caused me to freeze for a moment, straining to listen. “Jessie?” I asked in a small voice. I heard nothing after that, so I kept going, quickening my pace, even though it made me stumble. Another twig snapped, but I didn’t stop. It was probably just a raccoon, or maybe even a skunk out for a midnight stroll, but I was getting spooked. I started to run. Not a flat-out sprint, but faster than a jog. “Colette.” I stopped suddenly, thinking I’d heard somebody call my name. “Jessie?” I called back. “Is that you?”I strained to hear my fiancé’s reply, but all that reached my ears was another twig snapping. I instantly knew it wasn’t Jessie. He would not toy with me. If it was him in the woods, then he would say something. He wasn’t the kind of man who took delight in terrifying a girl. Someone or something was following me. And it knew my name. Chapter 47 Jessie “Mrs. Denkler! Open the damn door! Mrs. Denkler!” I shouted, hammering on the metal until my fists were bloody. I stopped, allowing my hands a moment to heal. Our housekeeper must have gone crazy. That was the only explanation that entered my head. Why would she possibly lock me in the vault? What excuse could she offer for such behavior? I heard the sound of something scraping along the stone floor. I had to assume it was still Mrs. Denkler on the other side. “Mrs. Denkler,” I said in an elevated voice, but without shouting. “Why are you doing this?” When she still didn’t answer I said, “Denkie, please tell me. What’s going on?” “I have too much respect for your family to allow you to do what I think you’re planning on doing,” the housekeeper informed me in a calm voice. If I was still a mortal, I probably wouldn’t have been able to hear her, but my undead ears could distinguish every word. “And just what is it that you think I’m planning on doing?” I asked. “You’re running off to marry that mortal girl,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone. “The pretty one who works here as a maid.” And then, mostly to herself, she added, “This is all my fault. I should have never hired her.” Banging against the metal door was a futile gesture, but the rest of the walls were made out of stone. I knew that striking a stone wall would hurt, but I thought there was a chance I could break through one of them and get out of the vault that way. I couldn’t stand the thought of Colette being alone in the woods, thinking that I had abandoned her. Assessing the room and its orientation in the castle, I thought the wall to the right of the door was probably my best bet. Taking a deep breath to steel myself against the pain, I drew back my arm and punched the wall with all of my might. A shriek of pain escaped my lips, but I ignored it. Once the pain started to subside, I clenched my other fist and struck the wall again in the same spot. A small bit of dust drifted into the air, but the rocks were still solid and the mortar, so recently applied, didn’t crumble. “What are you doing in there?” the housekeeper asked. “Trying to get out,” I told her through clenched teeth as I cradled my hand. “You don’t have to be so dramatic,” she said. “I’ll let you out eventually. I’m just waiting until the trollop is out of the picture.” “She’ll never be out of the picture,” I informed her. “Not with the way I feel about her. I will love her for the rest of her life, and then for the rest of mine.” There was silence on the other side of the door, so I added, “Do you understand me?” My words were only met with more silence. I tried to calm myself. Beating my fists against the wall wasn’t getting me anywhere. Colette would be upset, but once I was free, I would find her and explain what had happened. She would understand that I didn’t intentionally stand her up. We could always elope in a night or two, once she had forgiven me. But I hated the thought of my darling girl in tears. I hated the thought of hurting her. And I didn’t want her to be in the woods all alone. Tiburon was a safe community, but you never knew if there was a wayward tramp or rabid dog that might be wandering the woods in the dark. I should have never agreed to let Colette walk by herself. I should have insisted that I meet her outside her home so that we could head to the river together. “Mrs. Denkler, you need to open the door right now,” I said in the calmest voice I could muster. “It’s not your place to tell me what to do and what not to do.” “So you admit that you intend to run away with her?” she asked. “Do you plan on turning the little tramp?” I kicked the wall in frustration. “She’s not a tramp,” I snarled, my voice ragged with pain as I waited for my foot to heel. “She’s the most wonderful girl in the world. And yes, I am going to marry her. I will conjoin with her. Whether you like it or not.” “But not turn her?” Mrs. Denkler asked. “You’ll leave her bound to her mortal coil?” “No, I will not turn her,” I admitted. “That is something I will never do.” “But she’ll age,” Mrs. Denkler insisted. “She’ll grow old and gray. The beauty you see now is only temporary. Her life will end and you will still be young and fresh. Why not just turn her, if you love her so much?” “Because I love her too much to do that to her,” I said, pressing my forehead against the vault door. “Loving someone means doing what’s right for her, not just what makes you happy.” And then I knew that I couldn’t marry Colette without telling her the complete truth about my family. I couldn’t bind her to me without her knowing that I was a vampire. She would try to stop me from confessing, but I loved her too much to keep the secret from her until we were wed. “Haven’t you ever loved someone like that?” I asked, stepping away from the door. My hands were fully healed, but I knew battering them against the walls would get me nowhere. I had to persuade Mrs. Denkler to open the door. “Haven’t you ever loved someone so much that you would do anything for him?” “But Colette is mortal,” Mrs. Denkler said again, her voice sounding unsure. “And you are a vampire. Some day she will die. Then what will you do?” It was a question I had asked myself many times. “I will spend eternity cherishing her memory.” There was a long pause, and then I heard the sound of the combination lock being turned. Slowly, the door cracked open. “I loved your grandfather like that,” Mrs. Denkler said, avoiding my eye as I stepped out of the vault. “I would have done anything for him. But he didn’t feel the same way about me. So I became this,” she said, raising her hands and then letting them fall to her side. “I became his servant.” “But why?” I asked. “At least it allowed me to be near him and see him every day. It allowed me to help raise his family, even if none of you are my own.” “But he offered to turn you,” I said. “I heard him do it. More than once.” The housekeeper shook her head. “He only did that once I was old and the bloom of my youth was gone. He only started making the offer when he knew I wouldn’t accept it.” I stared at her, horrified. For Grandfather to torture her in that way was unforgivable. And yet she was still devoted to him. “I’m sorry,” I told her. It was the only thing I could think of to say. Reaching forward, she pressed a hand to my forearms. “I’m sorry for what I did,” she went on. “I was so worried about protecting the Vanderlind name that I forgot to protect you.” “It’s alright,” I said, patting her hand. “I understand. But now I have to go.” “Go,” she told me. “You must hurry. I only hope it’s not too late.” I was halfway down the hall before the real meaning of her words filter through to my brain. “Too late?” I paused to ask. Mrs. Denkler gave me a strangled look. “I mean, I hope she isn’t mad at you for being late.” I gave her a smile. “I just hope I can find a way to earn her forgiveness.” Chapter 48 Colette My lungs were burning and I had to stop for a moment to catch my breath. My hat was gone, my suitcase was gone, and I was terrified because I knew I was not alone. There was something out there, stalking me through the trees. I thought I’d heard it say my name, but that was impossible because whatever was chasing me wasn’t human. The sound of some leaves rustling behind me gave me a start and I started running again. I knew I was headed deeper into the woods and away from the road. I knew the creature was flushing me away from my only chance to flag down a passing car or signal someone in a nearby house. Branches tore at my dress and ripped out my hair. One of my shoes got stuck in the mud and was pulled from my foot. A few steps after that and my other foot got tangled in a tree root and I fell to the ground with a sob. I freed my leg, but did not immediately get to my feet again. I needed to calm down. I needed to catch my breath. There was a large log next to where I’d fallen and it afforded me some protection from the eyes of the predator that was pursuing me. I just needed to rest for a moment and come up with a plan. I wished I knew what was pursuing me so that I could better figure out how to defend myself. If it was a wolf or a bear, then I needed to climb a tree. If it was a man, then I needed to find a sharp stick and defend myself. But it seemed to be both human and beast. It seemed to have the senses of an animal. It could hear me from a distance and smell my scent in the air. But it could also speak. The creature had called my name. At least I thought it had called to me. But I knew that had to just be terror fueling my imagination. It was probably a stray dog that had gone feral and was hungry. I probably looked like an easy target. All I needed to do was climb a tree and bide my time. Once it was light out, I was sure I would be able to get back to the road and flag down a motorist. Lying on the ground, not moving, made me realize how cold it was outside. There was frost on the leaves all around me. My breath started to slow. I knew I had to do something. The beast was probably still looking for me. None of the trees around me had branches low enough for me to climb. I wondered how close I was to the river. The oak tree which was to be my rendezvous point with Jessie would be easy to mount. My heart throbbed at the thought of my love. Where was he? What had happened to him? If he was in the woods, then I needed to warn him about the creature. The idea of something horrible happening to Jessie frightened me as much as the beast in the woods. Getting to the oak tree was my best bet. Then I could climb to safety and warn Jessie if he was waiting there for me. I tried to think about the way I had run and the orientation of the river. My breathing was becoming more regularly and I felt like it was time to make a move. The small creatures that provide the night with its music had taken up their melodies again. It probably meant that the beast, whatever it was, had moved on in pursuit of some other dinner. With great trepidation, I got to my feet. And there he was. Jessie, my love, was standing no more than thirty yards away. I could see him silhouetted in the moonlight. “Jessie,” I called, my heart hammering loudly in my chest. “We have to get out of here. There’s something…” I started hurrying toward him. “I don’t know what it is, but there’s some creature in the woods.” Jessie came bounding toward me, eager to be by my side. I held my arms out to him. “We have to go,” I said, fighting back a sob of relief as his arms encircled me. “There’s someone else in the woods with us.” “I know,” he said. Looking up, I saw that it wasn’t Jessie who was embracing me. It was his brother, Daniel. “Oh,” I stammered, trying to pull away from him, my mind racing. “Did Jessie send you? There’s something in the woods. Something evil.” “I know,” he said again, a wolfish smile twisting his lips. “I think it might be me.” And then I saw his teeth glinting in the moonlight. They were long white daggers of ivory. I tried to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. “Please, by all means scream,” he told me. “It makes things so much better.” I felt limp in his arms, like a rabbit paralyzed by fear as it stares into the eyes of a snake. I caught a glimpse of his eyes and suddenly I understood what Lilly had meant. Jessie’s eyes had always appeared warm and kind to me. But his brother’s eyes where that of the detached predator. He was a shark ready to strike. Daniel wrenched my head to one side. “I’m going to enjoy this so much,” he whispered into my hair. And then he lowered his head and I felt a stinging at my neck. I realized with horror that Daniel had sunk his jagged teeth into my neck. He was drinking from me. He was drinking my blood. I tried to struggle. I willed my arms and legs to move, but they were awkward and lifeless. Tears sprang to my eyes with the sure conviction that I was going to die. Daniel was some kind of demon and he was sucking the life out of me. I thought of the note that I had forgotten to leave for Mama and Papa. It was still in my suitcase, lost somewhere in the woods. I was going to die and my family would never know what had happened to me. And what about Jessie? Did he know that his brother was Satan incarnate? Or was this the evil he always wanted to tell me about, but I refused to listen. I could no longer feel my legs and my hands were ice cold. Daniel was a vampire. He was a member of the undead and he needed human blood to live. That explained Arthur and the sticky, red goblets in his room. And then I realized something else; Jessie and his mother were probably vampires, too. That explained why they could never be out in the daytime. It explained a lot of things. Jessie had wanted to tell me. He’d tried to tell me his family’s secret many times. But I wouldn’t listen. I was too stupid to ever think that there was a problem our love couldn’t surmount. I was too naive to realize that such evil existed in the world. My darling Jessie was a vampire. And yet he loved me. There was no doubt in my mind that he loved me. My vision started to blur and I closed my eyes. The world only came into focus again when my body was jarred, quite painfully. I opened my eyes to see that I had been dropped into some kind of ditch. There was loose soil all around me. I tried to think of where I was. My brain felt fuzzy and slow. Town hall, I finally decided. A work crew was digging the foundation for town hall. Papa would find me. He would find my body in the morning and then my family would know I was dead. There was some comfort in that. I didn’t want them to spend the rest of their lives wondering. I could barely move, but I turned my head to see the man who had killed me standing at the lip of the deep hole where I lay. Just then the clouds drifted away from the moon and I was able to see Daniel more clearly. At a distance he looked so much like Jessie. Tears sprang to my eyes. I would never see my love again. Daniel started kicking dirt into the hole to cover my body. Small rocks and debris rained down on me. “Why?” bubbled to my lips. “Why are you doing this?” The vampire paused for a moment, cocking his head to one side as he considered his actions. “I thought I was doing it to protect the family,” he said. “I wasn’t going to let the Vanderlind name be besmirched by some cheap, little mortal. But now that you ask me, I realize that I’m doing it to teach my brother a lesson. Maybe next time he won’t be so eager to fall in love.” The world was growing dark again and it was a struggle for me to keep my eyes open. I had lost too much blood to do anything but die. Daniel started kicking more dirt on me and I curled into a ball and closed my eyes. “Good bye, Jessie,” I whispered, hoping the night breeze would carry my words to his ears. “Good bye, my love. I will miss you forever.” Epilogue Jessie I raced to the oak tree, but Colette wasn’t there. I searched the woods, then the streets of Tiburon, and then tried peeking in the windows of her family’s home. Colette was gone. It was as if she’d simply been plucked from the earth. For the next two years I searched for her, all night, every night, but she was nowhere to be found. I found her shoe, and an old tramp found some of her clothes in a small suitcase, but those were all the clues that were ever uncovered. My darling girl had vanished without a trace. Mrs. Denkler hung herself from the rafters in her private quarters two days after Colette disappeared. I think she blamed herself for delaying me. It wasn’t her fault, but part of me held her responsible. If only she hadn’t slammed shut the vault door. If only I’d insisted that I meet Colette under our apple tree instead of letting her walk alone at night. If only I’d left town like I’d intended, instead of wooing Colette and falling in love. I spent the next several decades hating myself and longing for the life Colette and I would never share. She was gone and, although I had not harmed her, I knew I was responsible for her death. If I hadn’t loved her, she would still be among the living, the sun shining on her tempestuous hair, the birds singing their morning music just for her. For many years I thought that maybe travel might help me forget the pain that was always present within me, but it did little to blunt the agony. And I found myself compelled to return home every fall. I knew I would never see my darling girl again, but I could not keep from searching for her. Year after year, I combed the woods in the fall, when the moon was full. I continued to do so decade after decade, even though it was obvious she was gone. I also carried the misery of having caused Colette’s family pain. Not knowing what had happened to their daughter must have been the worst part. I know it was for me. Or maybe it was better that way. I couldn’t judge; I only knew that I was doomed to live for eternity without the woman I loved. It was somewhere around the turn of the century that I began to feel a change. I hadn’t forgotten Colette, or stopped loving her, but the pain somehow shifted. It became a dull ache in the corners of my soul, rather than a tangible throb in my breast. I stopped going to Europe. Tiburon was my home. I even began to go out on occasion, strolling the town’s streets after sunset. Sometimes I would take in a film at the cinema, or drop by the library on Thursday nights, when it stayed open late. It felt good to traverse the streets where I knew Colette’s footsteps had fallen. Somehow it made me feel closer to her. One evening in the early fall, I felt an urge to reread The Great Gatsby. The castle library had a signed, first-edition, of course, but I wanted to hold a book that had been caressed by many hands. I was seated in a quiet corner of the library, just starting to become engrossed in the plot, when I heard the sound of two young women hurrying into the room. Glancing up, I had the shock of my life. There, standing before me, was Colette Gibson, just as fresh and young as the first day I saw her. My darling girl had come back to me.

Here are the first couple of chapters so that you can try before you buy. xo ~ Gayla Twist Broom with a View Prologue: When an Assassination Forces a Holiday “I don’t understand why someone who is two hundred years old should know all that much more than someone who is sixteen,” said Violet Popplewell to her mother. “There’s only a limited amount of things to know in this world.” Mrs. Popplewell gave a resigned sigh while her busy hands shuffled papers at her desk in her small office. “There’s no point arguing, Violet. Your great-aunt Vera is going with you, and that is that. I know she can be a little trying at times, but a girl your age cannot simply travel to an unknown city by herself. You must admit that. Especially with things being so unsettled. ” Violet considered brooding for a moment but fought the impulse. She was a practical girl, after all, and what can’t be mended must be borne. She returned to her room to make another attempt at packing. “Unsettled.” That was her mother’s word for impending war. The Archmage of Canterbury was dead. His body, entirely drained of blood, had been found with those of his wife and child in their private chambers. There was little doubt the assassin was a Vampire. Within twenty-four hours, rumors of a looming war had spread across England like a winter storm. It didn’t matter that there was no proof that Vampires were behind the murders or even condoned the act. Nor did it matter to Mrs. Popplewell that the dastardly deed had happened in London, which might as well have been a million miles from Gallows Road in the little corner of Surrey that was the Popplewells’ home. The British Isle was no longer deemed a safe place for young Witches to dwell. For Violet, who had rarely travelled even to London, visiting X, the mysterious city-state renowned for its magic, ought to have seemed a wondrous romantic journey. But most young ladies taking their first trip abroad had months to plan down to the smallest detail of the lace pattern on a handkerchief. New wardrobes were commissioned. Farewell parties were held. And Violet would enjoy none of those niceties. She was simply being shipped off, like a parcel, to be kept out of harm’s way. Violet surveyed the state of her bedroom, sighed, and set about attempting to create order from the general disarray. Her steamer trunks were bare, while clothes, shoes, books, and toiletries were strewn across every surface of the room. Earlier that morning, she had, in her haste, attempted to enchant her clothes to arrange themselves. But instead of compliantly settling into her trunks, the gowns had chased each other about the room in a colorful display of hide-and-go-seek. The stack of books she intended as her additional travelling companions had toppled across the floor, their pages flapping as if caught in a strong breeze. Her brush and comb had attacked her, snatching and dragging at her hair; she’d had to leave the room for three-quarters of an hour to give the spell a chance to wear off. It was no use; try though she might, magic never obeyed Miss Popplewell’s wishes the way she intended. Most children born to the Craft assumed that the world was their dollhouse, to be rearranged at their whim. But harnessing the unseen forces of the world was a tricky business full of hidden complications and unseen traps. And though almost an adult, Violet still struggled to bend the magical world to her will. She frequently found that the harder she tried, the more difficult it became to cast even the simplest spell. Her mother was constantly reminding the frustrated girl that most of their kind only truly mastered the Craft in their later years, when the tempestuous fires of youth had largely sputtered out. Yet Violet’s powers always seemed just inches from her grasp. Every once in a while, she would unexpectedly conjure extraordinary wonders. Unfortunately, these anomalies came without warning, and afterward, she could never remember what she had done differently. Perhaps it was the way she held her mouth. Standing in her disorderly room, Violet hesitantly reached into her pocket and felt the familiar handle of the old magic wand that had belonged to her grandmother. Many modern Crafters no longer relied on a wand to produce magic, but for the girl, wand work always seemed to yield the best results. She gripped it for a moment, deliberated, and then decided she couldn’t face another failure. Instead, she began the dull task of packing by hand. An hour later, all the necessities of life were neatly encapsulated in two large trunks at the foot of Violet’s bed. But her satisfaction was interrupted by a sound emanating from the next room—like two pelicans simultaneously trying to swallow the same fish. Ostensibly called the guest room, the chamber next to Violet’s was almost permanently occupied by her great-aunt, Vera Tartlette. The sound was one of indescribable vexation, which Aunt Vera invariably made when faced with a world-shattering crisis. Violet heard it at least twice a week. With a small sigh, she went to check on the situation. “Do not fret, my dear,” Aunt Vera began, her voice quavering. Violet entered the room with some trepidation. “I only need a few more moments to sort myself out, and then I’ll be in to help you directly.” The guest room was in far worse shape than Violet’s had been an hour earlier. Clothes, books, toiletries, and shoes all swirled haphazardly through the air. With a sweeping gesture, Vera would transfer a pile of undergarments to the bottom of her empty steamer trunk. Then, finding dissatisfaction with their placement, she’d whisk her hands to one side to remove them again. After that, the gowns would go in, only to be removed a moment later in the same fashion. All the while, Aunt Vera chattered continuously, either to Violet or to herself, weighing the advantages of taking each item versus the hazards of leaving it behind. Knowing as she spoke that she would only make things worse, Violet ventured, “Vera, the train does have a schedule to keep.” At this point, the elderly Witch was turning in circles in the center of the little room as though, by making eye contact with each item, she could fathom its every possible use into her head. But once she lost sight of the beaded gloves or motion sickness pastilles or whatever she was looking at, the item and its usefulness were crowded out by new ones. “Don’t bedevil me with schedules,” her aunt wailed impatiently as an airborne shoe nearly collided with a lit candle. “I said I would help you and I shall, but you really must leave me to my own packing first.” “For goodness sake.” Violet felt on the edge of exasperation with her great-aunt already, and they hadn’t even set out for the station. Drawing the old wand from her pocket, almost without thinking, she made three decisive strikes through the air. In a hailstorm of clothes, shoes, books, and papers, Vera’s possessions all found their proper place, and trunk lids slammed firmly shut. The room went still. Vera gazed in silence at the neatly arranged steamer trunks for several moments, as if trying to remember where she had left her knitting. Then she blinked and, turning her eyes to her young ward, said, “There now. Shall we see about your trunks?” Chapter 1: Witch Friendly Does Not Mean Witch Exclusive The city-state of X lay somewhere on the European continent, just at the invisible line that separated the western half, land of Witches, Sorcerers, and other Crafters, from the dark eastern half, realm of the Vampires. It stood before, or rather almost encrusting, Mount Drood, a craggy bluff that rose sharply above the rolling hills surrounding it and marked the beginning of the Alps. Half the city climbed the steep slope of Mt. Drood and crowned its peak, while the other half stood almost perpetually in its shadow. To say that Violet Popplewell had always dreamt of going to X was not to say that she had actually wanted to go. Quite the contrary; since she was a small child, tales of that magical city had filled her with unease. In anxiety-filled dreams, she would find herself wandering its labyrinthine streets while tall, windowless buildings frowned down upon her. Violet’s first glimpse of X in waking life was little different from her nocturnal visions. As their train pulled into the station in the deepening gloom of early evening, she caught glimpses of the city’s towers, black against the purple sky. She’d seen pictures of the famous edifices, but nothing could have prepared her for the soaring spires of stone, iron, and glass of a city built by magic. London, but for a tiny handful of magically enhanced buildings shrouded in spells of concealment, had nothing to compare. No building crafted by Mortals could hold a candle to these impossible structures. A mighty hall lined with pillars rested on the sculpted shoulders of a stone colossus. Staircases spiraled upwards, disappearing into the sky with no visible means of support or conclusion. Walkways, and even a road or two big enough to drive a carriage across, rested on impossibly slender, graceful arched pylons—when they weren’t resting on thin air. Here and there, immense trees grew, wrapping around buildings and then providing support for additional constructions. And buildings intertwined with the naked rock of the mountain so promiscuously that one couldn’t tell what was natural and what was Crafted. The train station was their first indication of the chaos that had gripped the city. Strangely, it had never occurred to Violet that she wasn’t the only magical being seeking refuge from the impending war. Travellers crowded the platform from end to end, and getting through the bustling swarm of humanity was like swimming through a hot, angry soup. It had been an exhausting journey of barely catching their train, then crossing the channel by ferry, and then a much lengthier train ride to X. Neither lady was in the mood to be jostled. Once on the street, Vera realised that she had left her notebook on the train and couldn’t remember the name of the guest house where they had a reservation, much less where it was located. Violet suggested they cast a seeking spell, which sent Vera into a loudly whispered tirade. “Cast a spell? Here, on the street, where we might be seen by anyone?” Violet hastened to remind her aunt that, “such cautions must surely be needless in X of all places.” Any Mortal living in this city who remained ignorant of magic must be deaf, blind, and terminally stupid. Raising her hands in reluctant preparation, Vera admitted with some trepidation, “I’m afraid it’s been well over a century since I last cast this particular spell.” Having spent all her life in Surrey, she had little opportunity to get lost. The incantation did not go well. Vera stumbled over the words in a barely audible voice, for fear of being overheard by the aforementioned blind deaf mute. Her trembling hands did not aid in the creation. By the time she reached the end of the third stanza, there was only a dim light pooling around their feet, leading nowhere discernible. Violet had no desire to embarrass her aunt, but she also did not wish to keep wandering around the darkened streets where who knows what kinds of magical creatures were lurking down every alley. The girl was quite sure she’d seen a man in a black cape slip from one shadow to the next as they approached. Sneaking her wand out of her pocket, Violet created a quick enhancement spell, which she cast towards her aunt and herself. The light around their feet began to gain power. An illuminated path appeared, leading them down the street. After only a block, the trail ended at the steps of the Pensione Belladonna. “There,” Vera said, brushing her hands against each other as if to remove some invisible soot. “That wasn’t so very difficult, now was it? There never really is any reason to panic.” They mounted the steps, and the man in the cape, who had been following them by way of the shadows, faded into the night. * * * * * * * * * “The proprietress had no call to deceive us,” Aunt Vera stated over dinner. “I don’t care how crowded the city has become. What does that have to do with our reservation?” Violet had no choice but to agree. On entering the musty guest house, they were quickly bustled down a narrow wooden staircase to a pair of basement rooms with bare stone walls. The floor was damp flagstone, and both chambers strongly smelled of mold. Instead of the panoramic view of the River Stygia they’d been promised, each room had a small, arched window near the ceiling that offered views of passersby from the ankles down. Violet cast her gaze across the dining table to the English faces who were just tucking into their evening meal. “Honestly, we may as well have stayed in Surrey,” she said with a sigh. “Except that there we’d be comfortable.” “And better provided for. This mutton is entirely flavorless,” Vera replied in a disapproving whisper. “I believe it’s been drained,” came a slow, creaking voice beside Vera. An elderly Witch with skin the color of parchment and matching hair had turned to address Vera with a smile that might have been sardonic. “Drained?” replied Vera. “You know. Of blood.” Vera’s neighbour had been introduced to them as Miss Abigail Fate, one of three sisters who had been staying in X for several months. Violet liked them immediately, but she was currently positioned at the table to hear very little of what the ladies said. They were, to the girl’s mind, the best sort of elderly women—dressed in soft, lavender clothes and smelling of rosewater, with sweet, reassuring voices and ready smiles. The only odd thing about them was their three matching pairs of smoked eyeglasses, which instantly brought to mind the nursery rhyme “Three Blind Mice.” Violet prayed she didn’t accidentally hum the tune aloud. Vera was in a position to hear Miss Abigail’s words quite clearly. “I’m sorry; I’m not sure what you mean,” Vera said, addressing the senior Witch. “For the Vampires,” Miss Fate said with a smile. One of her sisters leaned in to see down the length of the table, holding a pair of opera glasses to the lenses of her eyeglasses and peering through them. “It’s a cheap way of feeding both the Crafter and Vampire guests, you see,” said the sister in a hushed voice. “Vampire guests?” Vera asked, her eyes growing very round. It became immediately obvious to the Witch that two of the patrons of the Pensione Belladonna had plates that were noticeably bare. In contrast, their wine goblets were full to the brim. And not with the Proprietress’s weak Chianti but with a thicker liquid in the darkest shade of crimson. A little shiver ran up Vera’s spine, and she couldn’t keep her eyes from darting again in the direction of the two barren place settings. The elderly gentleman seated behind one of the plates seized the opportunity to say, “My dear lady, perhaps it’s true that this little haven is not everything one could wish, but what place on this earth is?” he asked with a smile. Violet had not held tight to the thread of the conversation, but she could detect nothing but kindness in the elder gentleman’s crinkled eyes. “Surely,” he went on, addressing Miss Tartlette, “you must have come away from your comfortable and familiar home because you found it wanting in some way. And now that you are here, all is strange, and the shortcomings are not familiar ones. But what is that? I’m sure you’ll find the wonders of the great city of X are worth a few inconveniences. In my humble opinion, we who seek to drink from the font of perfection must be forever thirsty. Wouldn’t you agree, Sebastian?” At this, the gentleman turned to his companion, an elegantly dressed and handsome young man, who remained silent, swirling his wine goblet listlessly. Undaunted, the older man returned his beaming gaze towards Vera. It was obvious from the gentlemen’s appearance that they were father and son. But where the old man’s brightly colored waistcoat strained over an advancing belly and gleaming strands of silver-grey adorned his widow’s peak, the young man’s frame was still slender, and his widow’s peak was black as jet, matching his linen suit. Where the father seemed almost childlike in his jovial eagerness, the son was as somber as the grave. But it was not a sinister somberness—more the appearance of someone suffering from a severe case of melancholia. In fact, the two were so comically unalike that Violet had to restrain herself from smirking at them. “I do not expect perfection from a pensione,” Vera indignantly replied to the elder of the pair, “but we were led to expect something quite different from what we got.” They had been introduced to the two gentlemen in a general way when they sat down at table, but Vera was discomfited to realize that she had forgotten their names and wasn’t sure of the correct etiquette under the circumstances. Did the introduction actually count? “We were promised two rooms on the top floor, with a view of the river and the cathedral,” Vera said to the table at large. “Ah, I see,” said the old gentleman. “I see the trouble. Alas, in the confusion of so many arrivals, my son and I ended up in exactly two such rooms.” Vera stiffened and retorted with a crisp, “How delightful for you. I do hope you enjoy them.” “My dear lady, you misunderstand me,” the gentleman went on. “My son and I have rooms on the top floor in full sun every morning. It won’t do at all, though we had resigned ourselves to make the best of it.” Violet could feel her aunt withdrawing into herself. Vera had no ability to deal with strangers who were overly forwards. She had turned her attention to diligently cutting her mutton into perfectly uniform bites. But the man seemed so kindly; Violet could not fathom why her aunt was always so suspicious. The girl saw no reason to snub him, so, replying for Vera, she said, “I wish we were so lucky.” “But you can be,” said he, lighting the room with the warmest smile she’d encountered since leaving Surrey. “Please, allow me to explain. We have no use for morning views. Sebastian and I far prefer to slumber in the comfortable darkness of a basement room and cultivate our perfect view from within. For we believe that if the sun rises in one’s heart, then no darkness can take it away. Isn’t that right, Sebastian?” The younger man persisted in his silence. “So what I propose is this.” The gentleman continued undaunted. “We can trade our rooms for yours. Then everyone would be happy.” Violet found his smile infectious and was unable to resist returning it when he directed it her way. She wanted to accept his kind offer at once, but she felt the restraining hand of her aunt pressing on her sleeve. “I’m afraid we couldn’t possibly,” Vera said in the slightly pinched voice she used when trying to keep her composure in extreme circumstances. Her eyes bulged slightly with anxiety as she fixed her gaze on her plate. “But my dear lady!” the old gentleman protested. “Surely you can see the mutual benefit of my proposal.” He turned to the young man seated next to him. “Won’t you explain it, Sebastian? You always explain things so much better than I.” “It would not be of any inconvenience,” Sebastian said in a deep, quiet voice. “It genuinely would be our preference as much as yours.” “No, no,” Vera insisted. “We absolutely couldn’t impose upon you. It’s quite out of the question.” She dabbed at the corners of her mouth with her napkin and pushed away from the table, abandoning the mutton upon which she had labored so carefully. “Come along, my dear,” she said to her niece. Confused and alarmed at her aunt appearing so outraged, Violet allowed herself to be led out of the dining room. She really couldn’t conceive of why Vera was so offended. At the door, Violet glanced back to see the old gentleman looking crestfallen. But the young man had finally lifted his eyes and caught hers in a gaze that she found difficult to interpret. * * * * * * * * * * Having retreated to the relative privacy of the sitting room, Violet turned furiously on her great-aunt. “What possible reason could there be for not accepting their offer? You yourself said that our dreadful rooms would be the death of you. You think you know all about proper etiquette, but in truth, you’re quite rude.” “I do not understand this city,” Vera muttered aloud. “I was told that this house was Witch friendly.” “Witch friendly does not mean Witch exclusive,” came a voice behind them. It was Miss Abigail Fate with her two sisters. They had followed Violet and Vera from dinner, concerned over the discomfort of the ladies. Miss Abigail shuffled into the room, guiding the other two and gazing about the sitting room through the opera glasses that her sister had been using at dinner. Violet hadn’t realized before how old and shrivelled the three of them actually were. So much so that, when they settled onto a small couch ideally meant for two, it accommodated them all with ease. “Are you speaking of Count Du Monde and his son?” the third Fate sister asked. She had not paid attention to the conversation at dinner, instead devoting herself entirely to the task of chewing her mutton with an enormous set of false teeth. “I’m not quite sure,” Vera confessed. “I’m afraid I didn’t quite catch their names. In any event, my young niece doesn’t understand how serious a thing it is to put ourselves in the debt of perfect strangers. Especially,” she said, her voice lowering, “that sort.” Violet felt a wave of exasperation. She was so tired of people telling her she didn’t understand the ways of the world just because she’d only been in it for the interval of sixteen years. Vera was being a prig, as far as she was concerned. The old gentleman and his son were perfectly amiable, just sitting there enjoying a glass of wine and eating their… Well, come to think of it, they weren’t eating anything. Their plates were noticeably bare. Violet’s eyes widened suddenly as realization dawned on her. “Just a moment!” she exclaimed. “You don’t mean to say that,” she began and then faltered. “That kindly old gentleman?” She shook her head, unable to get a grasp on it. “Surely not.” “I’m afraid so,” said the third Miss Fate, taking the opera glasses from her sister and raising them to her smoked spectacles. “This house has always been tolerant of Vampires. Though just now, the Du Mondes are the only two.” “Vampires?” Violet whispered, barely able to form her mouth around the word. The idea left her quite breathless. “Vampires,” said Vera, disapproval rolling off her tongue. “Not to worry. They’re the good sort of Vampires,” Miss Abigail assured them. “Well behaved and polite. Not at all the sort that go around biting people on the neck whenever the impulse strikes. We rather like them, don’t we, Hazel?” “Indeed, yes,” agreed the sister next to her. “Count Du Monde can be a little informal in his manner. But as far as Vampires go, they’re quite acceptable.” Vera drew herself up, her hand flying to the lace collar at her throat. “Well, I’m not willing to accept them. Just imagine, Witches and Vampires under the same roof. It’s too vulgar to contemplate.” She turned to her niece, who stood speechless at the news. “Violet, what would your mother think if she knew I’d let you stay in such an establishment?” “Well...” Violet began, not quite sure what anyone would think. She’d always known that there were Vampires in X. It was another wonder in a city full of wonders; Vampires and Witches coexisted peacefully within its walls. But it was her understanding that Vampires primarily dwelt in Night Town, the infamous under-city where Witches never dared tread. She had assumed that X was entirely segregated. In truth, she was as shocked as Vera by the idea of sharing a roof with the undead, the mortal enemy of all Witches, creatures with whom her kind had been at war since before history began. And yet, when she considered the phrase “the mortal enemy of all Witches” and placed it in her mind under a portrait of the amiable Count Du Monde, the resulting image could only be described as absurd. How could such a kindly old gentleman be a danger to anyone? Perhaps, Violet thought reluctantly, he was using Vampire glamour to beguile her, putting her off her guard. But she’d been taught that Witches were immune to Vampire enchantments. Regardless, the Count’s behaviour could hardly be called glamorous. Mortals who survived an encounter with a Vampire always described them as “wondrous, fascinating, luminous creatures, with eyes like impossibly deep pools in which one could drown.” The words “well meaning but terribly awkward” were never part of those accounts. Besides, the Misses Fate considered these Vampires perfectly acceptable dinner companions. And the Fate sisters were obviously very traditional Witches. So Violet didn’t see why Vera should be making such a fuss. Go here to keep reading Broom with a View xo ~ GT",
