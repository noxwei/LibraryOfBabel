      "content": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS It is a welcome pleasure to reflect on entirely different forms of debt and exchange value than those covered in this book. In another world I would send each friend I’ve neglected to mention here a nice box of chocolates. Words aren’t enough, but for now they are a taste of my sincere gratitude to those who helped see me through this project. This book was inspired and nurtured by great conversations with very smart people, generous readers, and an abundance of external sources of optimism and humor. For many years I have been blessed with the brilliant likes of David Hernández and Jodi Kim; these two have always been my first line of intellectual support, reading numerous drafts, answering a thousand questions, and hearing out all of the turns in my thinking. In Sylvia Chan-Malik and Wes Yu I could not have asked for smarter interlocutors or more sustaining friendships. This work also benefited from the inspiration and wisdom of longtime friends and coconspirators Dory Nason, Danika Medak-Saltzman, and Ofelia Cuevas. Years have passed since my days as a graduate student, but I remain indebted to my professors at UC Berkeley. I continue to be in awe of the brilliance and grace of my dissertation adviser, Sau-ling Wong; the instincts and generosity of Elaine Kim; and the friendship and steadfast support of Michael Omi. And a long-overdue thanks must go to Chris Nealon, not least for encouraging me to read Moishe Postone’s Time, Labor, and Social Domination , which became an indispensable anchor for this book. Networks across the United States and Canada were crucial for providing intellectual spaces for the development of my ideas. Mount Holyoke College has been an incredibly generative place to carry out this work, and I’m grateful to my wonderful colleagues in the English department for their supportive engagement over the years. I owe a special debt to Nigel Alderman, Don Weber, Amy Martin, and Elizabeth Young for all of their wise counsel in both research and teaching. Likewise, I am grateful for my colleagues in the Five College Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program for all of the intellectual sustenance they provided. The Connecticut Valley has been an unexpectedly vibrant cultural space, and it has been my pure fortune to have had the opportunity to cross paths with Asha Nadkarni, Diana Yoon, Manu Vimalassery, Jane Degenhardt, Sujani Reddy, Ronaldo Wilson, Tony Tiongson, Siraj Ahmed, Floyd Cheung, and Cathy Schlund-Vials. In Southern California I have cherished the limitless generosity, wisdom, and friendship of Mariam Lam, Setsu Shigematsu, Keith Camacho, and Dylan Rodríguez. Beyond nation-state lines, I am grateful for my fellow Asian Canadianists Chris Lee, Rob Ho, Marie Lo, Henry Yu, Thy Phu, Lily Cho, Guy Beauregard, and Andy Yan. I don’t see them enough, but our conversations over the years have taught me so much about the country that Richard Rodriguez once referred to as “the largest country that doesn’t exist.” Extra-special thanks goes to my editor Courtney Berger for her openness, encouragement, and amazing professional acumen. She is simply the best. I am similarly indebted to the anonymous reviewers for their indispensable editorial advice on the manuscript, as well as to the peer reviewers of an earlier version of the second chapter, which appeared as “Tseng Kwong Chi and the Eugenic Landscape” in American Quarterly 65.1 (2013). I close with thanks to my dear family. I am ever amazed by my talented mother, Yumie Kono; I’m grateful to her for infusing my life with beauty and art. My father, George Day, has continually uplifted me with his humor, optimism, and generosity. Heartfelt appreciation goes to Jack Day, Wendy Lynwood, Donna Day, and the rest of the Day, Kono, and Hernández clans for their love and support. Finally, I am grateful to David Hernández and our daughter, Tei, for a home life that is equal parts love and pure fun. This book is for them.",

      "content": "INTRODUCTION THE NEW JEWS Settler Colonialism and the Personification of Capitalism No Jew can smell out with keener instinct an opportunity where money can be made to grow than can a Chinaman. —Atlantic Monthly , 1900 Racial Capital In August 2012, Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney issued a public apology for purging an image of a female Asian scientist from the newly designed one-hundred-dollar polymer banknote. She was replaced by a “Caucasian-looking woman” 1 who is seen peering through a microscope (figure I.1 ). In the foreground appears a bottle of insulin that symbolizes nationalist ingenuity through medical innovation. Based on internal reports obtained by the Canadian Press, the decision to remove the Asian scientist came in response to focus groups who previewed the design in Montreal and Charlottetown and felt that her Asian appearance “did not represent Canada” 2 and was “exclusionary . . . since the banknote didn’t represent other ethnicities.” 3 Although the bank declined requests to release the initial design to the public, a bank spokesperson indicated that the image of a “Caucasian-looking woman” was substituted to “restore neutral ethnicity.” 4 News of the bank’s decision met sharp criticism from Asian advocacy groups, particularly the Chinese Canadian National Council, who criticized the bank and urged it to stop “‘erasing’ visible minorities from Canada’s money.” 5 FIGURE I.1 One-hundred-dollar Canadian bill, Bank of Canada. This controversy highlights this book’s central focus on the interplay of Asian racialization, capitalism, and settler colonialism that, as I will develop below, reveals an economic modality that links constructions of the Asian and the Jew. At first glance, the controversy sheds light on the ever-simmering tension between race and national culture in Canada. In particular, the bank’s equation of a “Caucasian-looking woman” with race “neutrality” exposes the normativity of whiteness in an officially multicultural nation. That an erased woman of color’s body serves as the battleground for adjudicating cultural legitimacy participates in a long-standing objectification of nonwhite female bodies as litmus tests of racial, gender, sexual, and here national normativity and deviance. 6 The Chinese Canadian National Council’s admonishment attempts to bare these contradictions but ultimately endorses the superimposing of multicultural iconography onto capital. Even US-based blogger Phil “Angry Asian Man” Yu weighed in on the politics of representation, calling the controversy “racebending on a banknote.” 7 In response to focus group members who objected to the Asian scientist for being too stereotypical, Yu remarks, “Sure there is a stereotype of Asians excelling in math or science. But let’s be real. The reason why people didn’t want an Asian-looking woman on the $100 bill is because an Asian-looking woman couldn’t possibly represent a face of Canada. Thus, the rush to redesign her with more Caucasian features.” 8 For the Chinese Canadian National Council, “Angry Asian Man,” and countless other bloggers and YouTube vloggers, the controversy’s significance turns on the variable race of the scientist against the assumed stability of the money form of capital as a representation of nation. To restore the “Asian-looking” characteristics to the scientist would, by extension, restore equilibrium between race and nation. But what seems to be missing from this discussion is the peculiar intersection of race and money—of race as a form of money, or vice versa. How do we understand the variability of money as capitalist (rather than solely nationalist) fetish and its own racialized personas? For the purposes of this book, the controversy dramatizes ways that Asian North Americans are uncomfortably associated with capital. More benign expressions of this association arise out of recognition of the upward economic mobility of Asians in North America over the twentieth century, which, at least temporarily, secured Asian Canadian representation on the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill and have earned Asian Americans the title of the “new Jews.” 9 Both expressions refer to the increasing affluence and assimilation of a historically excluded minority. In the case of the Asian-Jewish analogy, Matthew Frye Jacobson’s discussion of the evolution of Jewish American immigrant identity from a non-Anglo-Saxon to a Caucasian social position in the nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries emphasizes the progressive and linear orientation of the analogy. 10 This progressive emphasis is amplified in the 2012 Pew Research Center study “The Rise of Asian America,” which reported that Asians were the highest-income (earning 33 percent more than median-income households), best-educated, and fastest-growing racial group in the United States. 11 Despite numerous scholarly objections to the Pew Research Center’s failure to identify the extended configuration of most Asian households, the high-cost urban residential concentration of those families, and the pronounced income disparities between Asian ethnicities, 12 these facts have had little countervailing influence on the mainstream perception that Asians are more hurt than helped by affirmative action policies. Moreover, from Thomas Friedman’s recommendation that US children adopt the competitive traits of their Chinese and Indian counterparts 13 to Québec politician François Legault’s declaration that “kids in Québec should work harder, like Asians,” 14 the attributes of Asians in Asia and North America are to be ignored at one’s economic peril. Coupled with the benign recognition of Asian North American educational and economic achievement are more unsettling aspects of the Asian-Jewish analogy. For instance, Los Angeles Times reporter Gregory Rodriguez emphasizes how “the Jewish comparison has a dark side.” 15 According to Rodriguez, the victorious narrative of the civil rights movement has contributed to the misguided belief that “economic status rises as prejudice decreases, and vice versa . . . [and] that bias is always targeted downward at the weakest and the most vulnerable in society.” 16 In other words, the Asian-Jewish analogy should not be read as an indication of what Susan Koshy refers to as a “morphing of race into ethnicity,” 17 a theory stating that Asians in North America have evolved from discriminated racial minority to assimilated ethnic group over the twentieth century. Rather, according to Rodriguez, the Asian-Jewish analogy compels recognition of the economic contexts of modern anti-Semitism, which he characterizes as “distrust or disdain of Jews [which] can sometimes be motivated by envy or resentment of an identifiably separate group that’s significantly wealthier than the population at large.” 18 The economic conflation of Asians and Jews has a long history, explains Jonathan Freedman, who notes that “like Jews, Chinese merchants were traditionally active throughout East and South Asia and faced—again like Jews—resentment, discrimination, and even the occasional pogrom as a result.” 19 Intersecting expressions of industriousness, greed, and evil have been infused in popular culture representations of both groups in Europe and North America, from novelist George Du Maurier’s 1895 creation of the Jewish-descended Svengali to novelist Sax Rohmer’s 1921 invention of Fu Manchu. 20 Both characters are perverse, evil geniuses who aspire to world domination. Turning back to the controversy over the one-hundred-dollar bill, the bank’s initial effort to present an image that promotes Canadian medical innovation through the figure of the Asian Canadian scientist aligns Asian subjects with capital in more abstract, nonhuman ways. In particular, the characteristics of the model minority stereotype—educated, disciplined, obedient—embodied by the Asian Canadian scientist increasingly emphasize economic over human attributes. As Helen Jun explains, the model minority represents the ideal neoliberal subject who manifests the qualities she refers to as “human capital,” a term coined by economist Gary Becker in the 1960s to emphasize the role that education plays in adding value to labor. 21 As human capital, the individual is regarded as an “enterprise” driven by market values who embodies an “infinite capacity for ‘self-development.’” 22 Jun draws the connection between neoliberal capital and the racialization of Asian Americans in ways that can be extended to the Canadian context: We can see that the neoliberal theory of human capital and its notion of individual enterprise and self-regulation are not merely evident in Asian American model minority discourse but are also key tenets by which Asian American racial difference came to be defined in the post-1965 period. The centrality of educational achievement and the importance of family in contemporary discourses of Asian American racial difference are no mere coincidence, as neoliberal theories of human capital championed education and parenting as the most critical investments promising the highest rates of return. 23 What this passage highlights is how key aspects of model minority discourse are reflected in Asian American racialization as a form of market-driven instrumentality. Further bridging market instrumentality and racial form, the Bank of Canada’s “Asian-looking” banknote takes Jun’s notion of Asian American human capital to another level by symbolically removing the “human.” Projected onto the one-hundred-dollar bill, the Asian Canadian scientist is not merely a form of human capital but a representation of capital itself. Moreover, the eventual jettisoning of her image suggests that she signified an offensive form of capital that had to be “neutralized” by whiteness. As the personification of bad capital, the rejected “Asian-looking” one-hundred-dollar bill evokes prior economic modalities that have shaped Asian racialization. For instance, Colleen Lye’s discussion of pre-1942 expressions of anti-Japanese sentiment in California agriculture demonstrates how economic resentment toward Japanese farmers is represented through the sphere of monopoly capitalism. In the naturalist fiction she examines, Lye notes how the “homogenizing evils of monopoly are entirely displaced onto sinister Japanese characters.” 24 It is the “inorganic quality of the Asiatic body” 25 that manifests the “intangibly abstract” threat of finance capital. 26 Reflecting on the role of economic tropes embedded in racist representations of Japanese American success in agriculture in the early twentieth century, a success mirrored by Japanese Canadians in the British Columbia fishing industry, Lye points to what she calls the “economism of Asiatic racial form—a form in which economic interests are not masked but are the primary medium of race’s historical expression.” 27 The Canadian hundred-dollar-bill controversy is a heightened expression of this economism of racial form insofar as the dehumanized economism of the Asian simultaneously represents the personification of capital. What precedes the economism of Asian racial form is the similarly destructive economism historically attributed to Jews, highlighting more disturbing implications of the “New Jews” appellation. In his essay “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism,” Moishe Postone focuses on the secular elements of anti-Semitism that flourished under National Socialism in Germany, illustrating a historical process by which Jews became associated with the abstract evils of capitalism. Because Jews had long been segregated in finance and interest-generating sectors of European society, traditional anti-Semitism identified them as owners of money. Perhaps the most notorious literary example of traditional anti-Semitism is Shakespeare’s Shylock, the sinister usurer in The Merchant of Venice , whose penalty for late payment is nothing short of a pound of flesh. However, by the nineteenth century, modern anti-Semitism not only identified Jews as the owners of money but “held [them] responsible for economic crises and identified [them] with the range of social restructuring and dislocation resulting from rapid industrialization: explosive urbanization, the decline of traditional social classes and strata, the emergence of a large, increasingly organized industrial proletariat.” 28 In short, as Postone explains, “They [Jews] became the personification of the intangible, destructive, immensely powerful, and international domination of capital as a social form.” 29 Here the attributes of “abstractness, intangibility, universality, mobility” 30 that are associated with Jews are striking in their resonance with characteristic forms of Asian racialization in North America. The racial signifiers of inscrutability, perpetual foreignness, transnational mobility, and flexibility similarly register the abstract features of Asian racialization that this book aligns with the evolution of settler colonial capitalism in North America. The controversy over the Bank of Canada’s initial design of the one-hundred-dollar bill and the “new Jews” analogy may suggest that Asian racialization has entered a new historical phase. Indeed, the model minority stereotype seems far afield from the historical repertoire of yellow perilism denoting disease, vice, and destruction. But rather than expressions associated with two distinct phases, “yellow peril” and the “model minority” stereotype function as complementary aspects of the same form of racialization, in which economic efficiency is the basis for exclusion or assimilation. This book therefore engages in the task of demonstrating how the contemporary economism of Asian racial form does not represent a break from the past but rather is part of a continuum of settler colonial capitalism and its racial formations. Building on scholarship that examines the economic modalities of “Asiatic racial form” depicted in the interplay of art and policy by white producers, 31 I focus on contemporary Asian American and Asian Canadian literature and visual culture as a transnational genealogy of settler colonialism’s capitalist logics. What Asian North American cultural producers reveal in their rearticulation of settler colonial mythologies is how capitalism operates as a system of representation that is objective but immaterial, immanent but subject to resignification. My methodology is influenced by Marx’s dialectical method, which emphasizes dynamic relations rather than causation to illuminate the dualities and contradictions that emerge from capitalism. I am similarly guided by Fredric Jameson’s argument that the most important task of cultural interpretation is to reveal a work’s “political unconscious.” 32 In this spirit, I look to ways that Asian North American cultural production similarly magnifies settler colonial mythologies to reveal a system of representation that reproduces the logic of capitalism. The expansive, transnational scope of the archive also offers a framework for highlighting patterns and convergences across settler colonial borders. This book’s primary thesis is that Asian North American literature and visual culture present a genealogy of settler colonialism that magnifies a key logic of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic anticapitalism is the misperception of the appearance of capitalist relations for their essence, a misperception that stems from Marx’s notion of the fetish. As Neil Levi points out, what romantic anticapitalism “solves is a problem of representation . . . possess[ing] an intrinsically aesthetic dimension.” 33 As an aesthetic dimension, therefore, Asians give human shape to the abstract circuits of capitalism that have “no concrete manifestation, that are quite literally unrepresentable .” 34 In the manner that Jews came to personify processes internal to finance capital under National Socialism, I argue that the Asian subject in North America personifies abstract processes of value formation anchored by labor. From the economic efficiency associated with Asian racialization, denigrated as “cheap” labor in the nineteenth century and valued as “efficient” in the twenty-first, Asian North American cultural production magnifies the manner through which Asians are aligned with “abstract labor,” a concept that anchors Marx’s labor theory of value. It is from the vantage of abstract labor, as Dipesh Chakrabarty also notes, that capitalism is both reconstituted and potentially subverted. Let me elaborate on this connection between race and abstract labor, which I would argue is a key logic of what Cedric Robinson calls “racial capitalism.” 35 In particular, by giving material and symbolic weight to the category of abstract labor, my project diverges from the important work of scholars such as Lisa Lowe, David Roediger, and others who have argued that capitalism has profited from labor not by rendering it abstract but by producing racialized difference. For instance, in Lowe’s critique of the labor theory of value, she hones in on Marx’s homogenizing definition of “abstract labor ‘as the use value which confronts money posited as capital, labour is not this or another labour, but labour pure and simple , abstract labour; absolutely indifferent to its particular specificity.’” 36 Her point is to demonstrate that capital has profited from the specifically gendered and racialized character of labor, qualities that are far from indistinguishable or abstract. She presents the notion of abstract labor as the erroneous basis of an equally flawed conception of abstract citizenship in the political sphere: Abstract labor, subject to capitalist rationalization and the logic of equivalence through wages, is the adjunct of the formal political equality granted through rights and representation by the state. Yet in the history of the United States, capital has maximized its profits not through rendering labor “abstract” but precisely through the social productions of “difference,” of restrictive particularity and illegitimacy marked by race, nation, geographical origins, and gender. The law of value has operated, instead, by creating, preserving, and reproducing the specifically racialized and gendered character of labor power. 37 In short, she writes, “Asian immigrants and Asian Americans have been neither ‘abstract labor’ nor ‘abstract citizens.’” 38 David Roediger extends this line of argument, asserting that “far from flattening difference by buying undifferentiated units of labor power, US management studiously bought into inequality, preserving and continually recreating race.” 39 While my project is in harmony with the claim that capitalism produces racialized difference, I propose that these differentiating effects are not in contradiction with Marx’s formulation of abstract labor. What is missing from Lowe’s and Roediger’s critiques of abstract labor is a recognition of its dialectical relation to concrete labor. Concrete labor represents the racial, gendered, and qualitatively distinct form of actual labor that is rendered abstract as a value expression. Where I locate the principal violence of capitalism is in the very way it abstracts (or renders homogeneous as commensurable units of labor) highly differentiated gendered and racialized labor in order to create value . It is therefore the law of value that obscures the racial and gendered character of labor power. For value itself is what necessitates what we could characterize as the metaphoric process of turning particular labor into quantifiable units of abstract labor. So in response to the suggestion that racialized labor is irreducible to the conception of abstract labor because of its gendered and racial particularity, no value would be produced if this were the case. Rather, all commodity-determined labor plays a socially mediating role that is structured by time. Capital maximizes profit by controlling time: socially necessary labor time. Nothing prevents the exploitation of racial and gendered labor from being a “social necessity” that determines average labor time. Indeed, one core logic of the settler colonial mode of production I explore in this book centers on the systematic exploitation of a racialized, gendered, and sexualized alien labor force. The structuring role of time is precisely the reason that capitalism is an abstract form of domination, what Petrus Liu characterizes as “impersonal domination.” 40 This doesn’t mean that we don’t daily bear witness to brutal working conditions or the near enslavement of racialized and gendered labor; rather, the very violence of labor abstraction, what Richard Godden calls “the founding moment of abstraction,” 41 is what subsumes the horrors of highly differentiated labor into an abstracted quantity that is commensurable with all other things. It is the duplicity of value as a social relation that Marx denounces, such that “the various proportions in which different kinds of labour are reduced to simple labour as their unit of measurement are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers.” 42 To put it another way, we don’t control the products of our labor; we are controlled by the products of our labor. Therefore, while I agree that capitalism produces racialized difference, this book defines social differentiation as a form of destructive abstraction anchored by a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic Anticapitalism The historical processes that encode a romanticized distinction between concrete and abstract social relations grow out of Marx’s identification of an internalized duality within the commodity. Romantic anticapitalism’s confusion over the appearance and essence of the commodity is what Marx refers to as its “fetishism.” While a focus on the fetishism of the commodity appears initially removed from the realm of race and social relations, the commodity is foundational to Marx’s labor theory of value, which structures social—and hence race, gender, and sexual—relations within a capitalist mode of production. The chief effect of this fetishism is the appearance of capitalist social relations as antinomical: that an antinomy or opposition exists between concrete and abstract realms of society. Under a romantic anticapitalist view, what is real, sensory, or “thingly” is the tree in your backyard, the dusty work boots by the door, the reliable pickup truck in the driveway. These make up the concrete realm. What is unnatural, nonthingly, or intangible is capital accumulation, surplus-value, and money. These form the abstract realm. Therefore, as Levi clarifies, “romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of the antinomy.” 43 The antinomical view that characterizes romantic anticapitalism glorifies the concrete dimension while casting as evil the abstract domination of capitalism. In particular, the specific power attributed to Jews under National Socialism anthropomorphizes the internal workings of the commodity itself. What is remarkable is how the traits of mobility, abstractness, immateriality, and universality that modern anti-Semitism identifies with Jews are the very same characteristics that Marx uses to describe the commodity’s value dimension. However, as Postone clarifies, “this [value] dimension—like the supposed power of the Jews—does not appear as such, rather always in the form of a material carrier, such as the commodity. The carrier thus has a ‘double character’—value and use-value.” 44 In other words, what romantic anticapitalism misunderstands is that value, while seemingly abstract, is nonetheless objectified within the concrete, sensory form of the commodity during the exchange process. Pulling away the veil of the fetish will reveal that commodities are above all the representations (carriers) of social processes that are objectified in things, and as Marx puts it, “its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing.” 45 The main secret hidden within the commodity is that it comprises a duality of abstract and concrete dimensions. In a section of volume 1 of Capital titled “The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities,” Marx explains that the commodity internalizes two aspects: (a) use-value (a thing of use) and (b) exchange value (the exchangeability of that thing). Here we can observe a distinction between these two characteristics of the commodity; a use-value is concrete in a material sense—a table, for instance—but exchange value is abstract and immaterial in the sense that we can’t see or touch it. Dissecting the labor that produces the commodity, Marx continues by saying that “labour, too, has a dual character insofar as [when] it finds its expression in value, it no longer possesses the same characteristics as when it is the creator of use-values.” 46 Unpacking this distinction, concrete labor refers to a specific activity—whether hammering or cooking—that produces a use-value. On the other, it is “abstract labor” that objectifies a commodity’s value. Before we move on, we can pause to observe a fundamental point about value, which is that it is immaterial but objective : 47 “We may twist and turn a single commodity as we wish; it remains impossible to grasp it as a thing possessing value. . . . Commodities possess an objective character as values only in so far as they are all expressions of an identical social substance, human labor.” 48 Like gravity, value is invisible but real. What gives objectivity to the value of commodities, Marx asserts, is that they are products of human labor. A commodity’s value, therefore, is what Marx defines as “socially necessary labor time.” But what determines “social necessity”? This, it turns out, is part of the distinction between abstract and concrete labor. The main difference between concrete and abstract labor is temporal. The actual time it takes to produce a commodity in the case of concrete labor has no immediate bearing on a particular commodity’s value. If it did, a commodity would become more valuable the slower a worker labored to produce it, or as Marx puts it, a given product “would be more valuable the more unskillful and lazy the worker who produced it, because he would need more time to complete the article.” 49 Concrete labor will only tell us how well made a commodity is; it is the qualitative dimension of use-value. 50 On the other hand, abstract labor is a quantitative expression of value—it is an unfixed social average of human labor time. As Marx explains, “In the former case [of concrete labor] it was a matter of the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ of labour, in the latter [abstract labor] of the ‘how much,’ of the temporal duration of labor.” 51 Time is the ultimate measure of abstract labor and the magnitude of a commodity’s value. The quantity of time in abstract labor is not individual or provisional but socially necessary . Marx writes, “Socially necessary labour-time is the labour-time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society.” 52 From this view of the dual character of labor embodied in the commodity, we see how concrete labor is more directly aligned with the qualitative production of use-value, while abstract labor is more directly aligned with the quantitative dimension of value. While use-value and value are inseparable, internal features of each and every commodity, they nevertheless appear on the surface as discrete. Money generalizes the exchange of commodities and reinforces the fetishistic appearance that use-value and value are oppositional rather than part of the internal duality of the commodity. Marx historicizes money’s emergence through his discussion of commodity value. He explains that the only way we can determine the value of a commodity is when it is in motion: through its exchange with a different commodity. In a simple barter situation, I might exchange two forks for your bowl. The magnitude of value—the amount of socially necessary labor time—embedded in my forks and your bowl becomes visible (or objective) only in the exchange process. What we find is that your one bowl holds the equivalent value of my two forks; my two forks express the relative value of your one bowl. Over time certain commodities come to stand as the universal equivalent because they offer a stable measure of equivalent value. Historically, gold and other metals have played this role. So, rather than exchanging my two forks for your one bowl, I would give you two forks in exchange for an equivalent value in gold. While gold is useful for expressing equivalent value, carrying it around and circulating it can be cumbersome, which brings us to paper money. Paper money was once the representation of real gold held in a bank, but now it is a representation of floating value contained in a bundled commodity index. As a universal equivalent, the money commodity can be exchanged with any other commodity and express any another commodity’s value. Here’s the takeaway: after money generalizes the exchange of commodities, money seems solely an expression of value rather than of use-value (as a useful piece of colored paper with numbers on it, for example). Marx makes a further observation of the way the commodity’s internal duality is expressed externally: The internal opposition between use-value and value, hidden within the commodity, is therefore represented on the surface by an external opposition, i.e. by a relation between two commodities such that the one commodity, whose own value is supposed to be expressed, counts directly only as a use-value, whereas the other commodity, in which that value is to be expressed, counts directly only as exchange-value. Hence, the simple form of value of a commodity is the simple form of the appearance of the opposition between use-value and value which is contained within the commodity. 53 What this means is that the duality of use-value and value, which are internal characteristics of the commodity, are expressed externally as an opposition between commodities and money. The social consequences of how a binary rather than dialectical view of use-value and value is such that the use-value dimension appears empirically-grounded while the latter, value dimension appears ephemeral or abstract. Specifically, the dialectical tension between value and use-value in the commodity requires that its dual character be materially externalized in the value form, where it appears “doubled” as money (the manifest form of value) and the commodity (the manifest form of use-value). The effect of this externalization, as Postone elaborates, is that “the commodity, although it is a social form expressing both value and use-value, appears to contain only the latter, i.e., appears as purely material and ‘thingly’ ; money, on the other hand, then appears to be the sole repository of value , i.e., as the manifestation of the purely abstract, rather than as the externalized manifest form of the value dimension of the commodity itself.” 54 The point here is that even though a fork and money are both commodities that internalize use-value and value, the fork appears only as a concrete “thingly” use-value and the money as an abstract source of value. This illusory opposition is at the core of the commodity fetish, which disguises the actual basis of value, which is “socially necessary labor time.” A key aspect of the fetish, then, is the mystification of capitalist social relations that present themselves antinomically, as the opposition of the abstract and concrete . Within this antinomy, the social relations specific to capitalism appear as an opposition between the concreteness of labor, commodities, and nature, on one hand, and the abstractness of money and finance, on the other. Moreover, within this fetishistic antinomy, the very origins of value—socially necessary labor time—are completely repressed. In the nineteenth century, we can see how the social consequences of this antinomical view of capitalist social relations emerge and take on racial significance. As capitalism underwent rapid expansion, the externalization of abstract and concrete forms intrinsic to the commodity fetish became increasingly biologized and racialized in concert with prevailing socioscientific conceptions of the world. The proliferation of scientific racism with the rise of social Darwinism in the late nineteenth century is an example of how society and historical development were increasingly understood in biological terms, moving from a more mechanical or typological worldview in which events were a reflection of divine power and design to a more secularized, biologized worldview that naturalized an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Enduring features of romanticism, the aesthetic movement that emerged in the nineteenth century, exhibit such a biologized worldview in its human (and often racial and national) identification with the purity of the natural world, portrayed as the valorized antithesis to the negative influences of urbanization and industrialization. From the antimaterialism expressed in Henry David Thoreau’s excursion to Walden Pond in the nineteenth century to Christopher McCandless’s 1992 divestment of all symbols of material wealth—even setting fire to his remaining cash—for a life in the wilderness, 55 we can discern a romantic attachment to a revitalizing and pure construction of an unchanging nature, in contrast to the alienation attributed to capitalist modernity. Expressing the antinomy of concrete and abstract, nature therefore personifies concrete, perfected human relations against the social degeneration caused by the abstract circuits of capitalism. This antinomical view of capitalism finds acute biologized expression in the context of anti-Semitism. During Germany’s rapid industrialization in the nineteenth century, Jews were perceived as an all-powerful international conspiracy that orchestrated capitalism. Jews not only were identified with money but became a personification of the destructive nature and abstract domination of capital. In other words, the concrete side of this antinomy was naturalized and biologized as real, hardworking Germans. German labor and machines were glorified as concrete “counter principles to the abstract.” 56 Alternatively, the manifest abstract dimension of money and finance became biologized as the Jews. As Postone explains, “Jews were not merely identified with money, with the sphere of circulation, but with capitalism itself.” 57 Jews came to personify the “intangible, destructive, immensely powerful and international domination of capital as a social form.” 58 His insight here is to identify an anticapitalist element of National Socialism that, in misrecognizing the role of the antinomy in capitalism, strove to evacuate the world of the abstract dimensions of capitalism, which was seen as the source of all evil and oppression in the world. Jews were identified as controllers of money and thus misidentified as responsible for capitalism’s oppression, a misperception based on the erroneous notion that capitalist oppression was caused by money—despite the reality that money and commodity forms are relative expressions of value determined by socially necessary labor time. 59 Thus even though Jews were citizens, citizenship was once again deemed politically abstract compared to the more concrete notion of the nation defined by “common language, history, tradition, and religions.” 60 As Postone observes, “The only group in Europe which fulfilled the determination of citizenship as a purely political abstraction, were Jews following political emancipation in the nineteenth century. They were German or French citizens, but they were not really Germans or Frenchmen.” 61 Instead, they were of the nation only “abstractly, not concretely,” which was ultimately a fatal relation to the scourge of “capitalism” and the bourgeois state. Thus anti-Semitism solves a problem of representation by incorporating an aesthetic dimension that gives human form to the abstract circuits of capitalism. 62 As the controversy over the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill suggests, Asians too are associated with an abstract dimension of capitalism, but in a different sense. In the case of Jews, their conflation with the abstract domination of capitalism derived from their segregation in financial sectors of the economy. Alternatively, Asians have personified the abstract dimensions of capitalism through labor time . In the nineteenth-century context of Chinese railroad building in North America, the subject of chapter 1 , the connection between the Chinese and the abstract domination of capitalism evolved through their identification with a mode of efficiency that was aligned with a perverse temporality of domestic and social reproduction. In other words, the Chinese personified the quantitative sphere of abstract labor, which threatened the concrete, qualitative sphere of white labor’s social reproduction. It is from this view of labor’s socially mediating role that each chapter explores a different aspect of dominant settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism that triangulates Indigenous, alien, and settler positions. Settler colonialism reinforces this triangulation through a fundamental misperception of capitalism as an opposition between a concrete natural world and a destructively abstract, value-driven one that is personified as Asian. In the sections that follow I clarify the racial interplay of settler colonial exclusion and elimination that frames my analysis of Asian North America and the personification of capitalism. Settler Colonialism, or Postcolonial Colonialism In this book I make the claim that the racialization of capitalism emerges from the particular contours of settler colonialism in North America whose conditions are distinct from the geopolitical context out of which modern anti-Semitism arose in Europe. At its core, settler colonialism reflects the common social, cultural, and political racial destiny of a transnational configuration that Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds refer to simply as “white men’s countries.” 63 Beginning in the nineteenth century, the spread of whiteness in nations bordering the Pacific was “a transnational form of racial identification [that was] at once global in its power and personal in its meaning, the basis of geo-political alliance and a subjective sense of self.” 64 It was against the backdrop of Indigenous dispossession and the “problem” of Asian migration that settler colonial expansion could be justified through ideologies of liberal democracy. As Adam McKeown notes of the benevolence with which border controls were implemented, “The controls were created by white settler nations around the Pacific that saw themselves as the forefront of the liberal freedoms of the nineteenth century. . . . Modern border controls are not a remnant of an ‘illiberal’ political tradition, but a product of self-conscious pioneers of political freedoms and self-rule.” 65 Thus the patterns of Indigenous decimation and dispossession, racialized labor recruitment and exploitation, immigrant restriction, and internment are evolving elements that tie Canada and the United States to a racial destiny shared by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Indeed, as Lothrop Stoddard, a xenophobic proponent of transnational solidarity among white settler colonies, put it in the 1920s: “Nothing is more striking than the instinctive and instantaneous solidarity which binds together Australians and Afrikanders, Californians and Canadians, into a ‘sacred union’ at the mere whisper of Asiatic migration.” 66 The corresponding features of Asian racialization in settler colonies capture the moving spirit of settler colonialism: a formation that is transnational but distinctively national, similar but definitely not the same, repetitive but without a predictable rhythm, structural but highly susceptible to change, everywhere but hard to isolate. This is what we might call the music of settler colonialism. It is from the past, but never stops playing. Until recently, white settler colonialism has received far less attention than its “postcolonial” counterpart among the multiplicity of colonial configurations, past and present. 67 On one hand, postcolonialism is the term that has often been applied to franchise colonies—British India or the Dutch East Indies, for instance—regions where economic exploitation occurred without large-scale white settlement. While the postcolonial condition remains a nuanced subject of theoretical debate in terms of its history and enduring social, economic, and cultural impact, the formal end of British and Dutch imperial rule and colonial administration in the late 1940s initiated a complex process of decolonization that was encoded into the “post-” of postcolonialism. Settler colonialism, on the other hand, is effectively immune to the process of decolonization. As Ian Tyrell explains, “Settler societies represented a particularly complex and resilient form of European colonial expansion often not recognized as imperial conquest by its own agents precisely because they claimed to do more than extract wealth and then return to the metropolitan space.” 68 They are “breakaway” colonies insofar as they transfer the power of the metropolitan center to the periphery, subverting a normative logic of colonialism. 69 In the establishing of settler colonies, the primary objective was land acquisition, as Patrick Wolfe points out, rather than the surplus value gained by mixing Native labor with it. 70 Because white settlement was an intentional aspect of colonization in British North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, neither the revolutionary nor the nonrevolutionary processes of detaching from British imperial rule—becoming “postcolonial,” as it were—significantly altered or ended the colonial relationship between settlers and the Indigenous population. In many ways, as Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler reflect on the irony of revolutionary settler independence movements like the United States’, “settler counter-imperialism cannot, in any sense, be considered of an emancipatory nature, but rather as a defense for atavistic forms of exploitation which by this token take on a politically anachronistic stature as well.” 71 Therefore, in settler colonies, the diminishing role of an imperial metropole facilitated successive stages of Indigenous conquest that involved invasion, removal, relocation, reservation, assimilation, termination, 72 co-optation, and self-determination. This renders a paradoxical situation where, as Robert Young describes it, “the postcolonial operates simultaneously as the colonial.” 73 In other words, what Taiaiake Alfred calls a “paradigm of post-colonial colonialism” 74 is thus a defining feature of contemporary settler colonialism in North America. Triangulating Settler Colonialism While Asians have not held any prominence in popular media projections of settler national culture, which often erases or figuratively disguises Asians as infiltrating replicants or alien invaders, 75 the opposite has been true for Indigenous identities. As Scott Lauria Morgensen explains, the settler colonial imaginary is continually underwritten by Indigenous tropes that convey settler “conquest and incorporation of primitivity.” 76 Much like the way the 2011 feature film Cowboys and Aliens aligns cowboys and Indians with each other against an invading, technologically superior alien population—read Asian—settler identity is heavily invested in appropriating Indigeneity. This is a mode of white settler identification that Shari Huhndorf calls “going Native,” 77 which functions to cover over colonial invasion and reimagine a natural affiliation to the land. The erasure of the alien and the romantic identification with the Native are two sides of the settler colonial coin. By mapping out the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions, this book moves beyond a binary theory of settler colonialism, which is predominantly structured around an opposition between Indigenous peoples and settlers. While scholarship on the settler-Indigenous dialectic has been tremendously valuable, it often falls short of clarifying the role that nonwhite migration plays within such a framework or how it intersects with other aspects of white supremacy. Reflecting on what she calls the “indigenous-settler binary,” Andrea Smith similarly cautions that this “binary certainly exists, [but] our analysis of it is insufficient if not intersected with other logics of white supremacy.” 78 In particular, key questions over the status or role that racialized migrants play within white settler colonialism often remain unasked or avoided. In a binary framework of settler colonialism—where one is either a settler or an Indigenous person—are slaves, indentured laborers, or refugees “settlers,” despite the involuntary context of their migration to North America? If we observe Jared Sexton’s claim that “no amount of tortured logic could permit the analogy to be drawn between a former slave population and an immigrant population, no matter how low-flung the latter group,” 79 do descendants of slaves exceed the conceptualization of migrants more generally? These questions highlight some of the uncertainty that surrounds the nonwhite “alien” and the role of race within settler colonialism. As the cases below signal, slavery and the abject condition of blackness complicate a straightforward approach to settler colonialism organized around a central opposition between settlers and Indigenous peoples. More directly, the “settler” classification collapses important racial distinctions between various contexts of voluntary and forced migration into one homogeneous group of “occupiers.” Recent studies of settler colonialism that have given attention to Asian or other nonwhite, non-Indigenous cultures have often distinguished settler identity by the degree to which migration is intentional. Writing about Canadian settler imperialism, for example, Adam Barker notes the changing provenance of settlers: “[They are] often people of European descent, but in the contemporary sense Settler increasingly includes peoples from around the globe who intentionally come to live in occupied Indigenous territories to seek enhanced privileges.” 80 In essence, settler identity—regardless of race—is predicated on the intentionality of migration. For those who may not have intended to migrate, however, Barker is more circumspect: “Attempts to integrate discussions of hybrid identities (such as the descendants of African peoples brought to the Americas against their will, many refugees, or Settler Muslims who are increasingly targeted by the state and other racist Settlers) with Settler and Indigenous identities are complicated and beyond the scope of this inquiry.” 81 Complicating Barker’s view of voluntarism, Jodi Byrd’s theorization of settler colonialism accounts for the involuntary conditions of migration. She offers the term arrivant “to signify those people forced into the Americas through the violence of European and Anglo-American colonialism and imperialism around the globe.” 82 For Byrd, structures of coerced migration distinguish the arrivant from the settler. Alternatively, Patrick Wolfe forcefully opposes voluntaristic approaches that attempt to differentiate the settler from coerced migrant populations such as slaves. He maintains that “the opposition between Native and settler is a structural relationship rather than an effect of the will. . . . Neither I nor other settlers can will our way out of it, whether we want to or not.” 83 In particular, he draws on the Australian context in which unfree white convict labor was imported from Britain in order to pose the rhetorical question, “Does this mean that their descendants are not settlers?” 84 Given that Wolfe concedes that white convicts in Australia did not pass on the condition of their criminality to their offspring, this example fails as a comparative equivalent to a US history of African slavery. The very content of black racialization has been based on the exclusive and transferable condition of racial slavery. Moreover, in claiming that settler identity applies even to “enslaved people [who] immigrated against their will,” Wolfe implicitly preserves the voluntarism that he otherwise rejects in his construction of the slave as an “immigrant.” Such references to immigration project a set of voluntaristic assumptions onto widely divergent conditions of voluntary and forced migration that are central features of the United States’ specific configuration as a settler colony. In the contemporary context, the racialized vulnerability to deportation of undocumented, guest-worker, or other provisional migrant populations similarly exceed the conceptual boundaries that attend “the immigrant.” Our awareness of these distinctions does not absolve any of these groups from being willing or unwitting participants in a settler colonial structure that is driven to eliminate Indigenous people. However, folding them into a generalized settler position through voluntaristic assumptions constrains our ability to understand how their racialized vulnerability and disposability supports a settler colonial project. The most unequivocal work to define Asian migrants as “settlers of color” is the edited volume Asian Settler Colonialism: From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawai‘i . Referring specifically to Asian Americans in Hawai‘i, editor Candace Fujikane states clearly that “all Asians, including those who don’t have political power, are identified in this book as settlers who participate in US settler colonialism.” 85 Acknowledging the historical exploitation of Asian plantation labor in Hawai‘i, she argues that it is equally important to acknowledge the “ways that they [Asian migrants and their descendants] are beneficiaries of US settler colonialism” and how “early Asian settlers were both active agents in the making of their own histories and unwitting recruits swept into the service of empire.” 86 In this formulation it is not necessary for migrants of color to migrate “intentionally” to become settlers; rather, settler status is a mixture of both self-determination and structural contingency . As Fujikane puts it succinctly, “Colonial intent [does not] define the status of Asians as settlers but rather the historical context of US colonialism for which they unknowingly became a part.” 87 Furthermore, she also dispels the notion that Asians represent a “third space” outside the Indigenous-settler dialectic. She admits her previous subscription to this idea, but explains her change of thinking as follows: I was attempting to create a “third space” for Asians as another category of the oppressed in Hawai‘i. The attempt to ally [Asian] “locals” with “Natives,” however, created the illusion of a “shared” struggle without acknowledging that Asians have come to constitute the very political system that has taken away from Natives their rights as indigenous peoples. 88 In this view, given the political power that Asian Americans currently enjoy in Hawai‘i, they cannot be said to represent a stable third space that is exempted from the settler-Indigenous dialectic or positioned “with” Indigenous peoples and “against” settlers. While attributing a settler identity to Asians may be germane in a demographic context such as Hawai‘i, it nevertheless remains unclear whether such a settler identity is generalizable to the situation of Asian immigrant formations that exist elsewhere. Even though Fujikane stresses that political and economical subordination does not exempt Asian ethnic groups from participating as settlers in a colonial system—particularly Filipinos 89 —her emphasis on Asian demographic majority, dominant political representation, and economic power in Hawai‘i emphasizes how political and economic authority are nonetheless dominant features of settler colonial identity. 90 The importance of economic and political leverage embedded in this characterization of settler identity may explain the absence, for example, of comparable discussions of “black settler colonialism.” A case in point is the postemancipation recruitment of black “Buffalo Soldiers” in anti-Indian wars in the western United States and during the Philippine-American War. 91 The Buffalo Soldiers are a clear example of an oppressed group’s unwitting (and sometimes unwilling) participation in settler colonialism and imperial invasion, yet the continued economic and political subjugation of African Americans seems to exempt them from most theorizing on settler colonialism, as a “third space” or otherwise. Thus the settler status of racialized migrants to Indigenous lands outside Hawai‘i remains undetermined. In some ways, the conundrum of positioning Asian North Americans within settler states highlights broader inconsistencies that mediate theories of Asian racialization in North America and the role of race in a settler colonial context. Speaking to the racial ambiguity evoked by Asians in the United States, Colleen Lye encapsulates the racial condition of Asian Americans as “racial, racialized, but lacking the certainty of a racial formation.” 92 Remarking upon the surfeit of articles and monographs that focus either on Afro-Asian interracial contexts or on how Asian Americans disrupt conceptualizations of race anchored by a foundational opposition between black and white, Lye continues to observe the uncertainty of Asian racialization: Asian America’s attenuated relation to racial conceptualization can be seen in the extent to which critical focus on the Asian American is so often couched in terms of “needing to move beyond race as a matter of black and white.” The Asian American is more easily evoked as a third term to trouble binary habits of racial classification and analysis than to illustrate the genuine multiplicity of racial logics and racisms. 93 From sophisticated approaches to Asian American racialization such as Claire Jean Kim’s theory of Asian America’s triangulated relation to black and white, to Susan Koshy’s conception of a single hierarchical axis in which Asian Americans have moved progressively away from a racialization associated with blackness toward an ethnicization associated with whiteness, most theories of Asian racialization rely, according to Lye, on the “historical agency of a racism that is foundationally antiblack.” 94 However, the problem with this approach is that it constrains our ability to elaborate the specificity of Asian racialization that isn’t merely a by-product of a foundational antiblackness. As it stands, what Lye calls an “Asian American analogical dependency” fails to clarify the way contemporary expressions of political liberalism and white supremacy seem to diverge so starkly from those of the late nineteenth century and, importantly, leaves unanswered whether contemporary “Asian American mobility confirms the persistent power of white privilege or whether it represents the detachment of whiteness’s symbolic power from material power.” 95 The Canadian context only adds to this racial uncertainty, since the absence of a similarly foundational system of racial slavery has not, as “analogical” arguments might suggest, led to divergent forms of anti-Asian racism in Canada. Indeed, the racialization of Asian Americans and Asian Canadians has unfolded as a parallel evolution of yellow peril to model minority—from immigrant restriction and segregation, wartime internment of Japanese civilians, to the 1960s-era liberalization of immigration policy. This mirrored arc of Asian racialization, therefore, cannot be entirely attributable to an inherited legacy or second-order version of antiblack racism given the absence of a similar regime of plantation-based slavery in Canada. This is not to say that structural antiblackness did not play a role in conditioning Canada’s entrance into capitalist modernity; rather, the similar pattern of policies directed at Asians in Canada and the United States indicates forces that exceed those that shape the social construction of blackness. 96 To put it another way, a transnational framework contradicts an understanding of anti-Asian racism as solely derivative of a prototypical racialization of blackness. As I will argue, the vicissitudes of racialization are grounded in settler colonial logics. This book presents a theory of settler colonialism in North America that operates as a triangulation of symbolic positions that include the Native, the alien, and the settler. The distinctions between alien and settler are by no means stable or fixed but are meant to emphasize the role of territorial entitlement that distinguish them. What initially distinguishes the settler from the alien migrant, as Lorenzo Veracini offers, is that “not all migrations are settler migrations.” 97 This is both poignantly true and, for African slaves, a profound understatement. As Frank Wilderson describes transatlantic slavery, “From the very beginning, we were meant to be accumulated and die.” 98 Alternatively, on the other end of the spectrum, the alien may not only be complicit with the settler colonial regime but may eventually inherit its sense of sovereign territorial right, such as Asian settlers in Hawai‘i. 99 Acknowledging these inconsistencies, what I demonstrate in this book is that for slaves and racialized migrants, the degree of forced or voluntary migration or level of complicity with the settler state is ultimately secondary to their subordination under a setter colonial mode of production driven by the proprietorial logics of whiteness. In this light, highly differentiated populations of African slaves and Asian migrants historically represented alien rather than settler migrations. This shared status in no way implies an equivalence in the heterogeneous racial experience of African slaves and Asian migrants. Instead, it clarifies their historical relationship to North American land, which was as exclusive and excludable alien labor forces. Their unsovereign alien status was a precondition of their exploitation and intersects with the multiple economic logics that require and reproduce alien-ness in settler colonies. While African slaves represented a system of forced migration, unfree alien labor, and property—a form of biopolitical life that was “market alienable” 100 —the later recruitment of indentured and “free” Chinese labor incorporated provisionality, excludability, and deportability into the notion of alien-ness. The heterogeneously racialized alien is a unique innovation of settler colonialism. Race is thus an organizing principle of settler colonialism in North America, a principle that we neglect at the risk of relegating African slaves “to the position of the unthought” 101 and obscuring the persistence and evolution of Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation, where “conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part.” 102 The governing logic of white supremacy embedded in a settler colonial mode of production relies on and reproduces the exploitability, disposability, and symbolic extraterritoriality of a surplus alien labor force. Therefore, complicating an Indigenous-settler binary, this book’s focus on the settler colonial alien follows Byrd’s method of “disrupt[ing] the dialectics of settler/native, master/slave, colonizer/colonized.” 103 As I attempt to clarify below, what remains fundamental to this triangulated articulation of settler colonialism is how land and labor are constitutive features of heterogeneous processes of settler colonial racialization. Indigenous Land, Alien Labor The triangulation of Native, alien, and settler populations comes into view when we examine two subjects who are the most racially antithetical to one another: the African American alien and the Native North American. While some have argued that a race-based framework potentially subsumes the critical importance of Indigenous sovereignty, 104 this exploration highlights the role that land—and land sovereignty—plays in Indigenous racial formation and what Alfred refers to as the “racism that is the foundation and core of all colonial countries.” 105 As Patrick Wolfe highlights, the logics of exclusion and elimination have profoundly shaped the distinct racial destinies of colonized groups. In this formulation, the logic of exclusion operates as a barrier within national culture to protect and reinforce settlers’ social and political control. De jure and de facto practices of segregation, disenfranchisement, exclusion, exploitation, police brutality, detention, and imprisonment are some of the ways that the settler state asserts and maintains control over an internalized alien population. On the other hand, the logic of elimination is driven to eradicate an Indigenous population rather than controlling it through various exclusionary measures. Genocide and biological absorption are two contradictory—but complementary—means of extinguishing an Indigenous population: the first attempts to kill the population off, the second assimilates them out of existence. 106 It is worth pausing here to emphasize the dire consequences of assimilation for Indigenous populations, a process that may seem benign or even beneficial to other racialized groups. As Katherine Ellinghaus clarifies, “One of the outcomes of acknowledging the links between miscegenation, assimilation policies, and genocide is . . . an acknowledgment of the underlying biological, physical, bloody aspects of assimilation policies that demonstrate the terrifying resolve of settler governments to rid themselves of the Aboriginal or Indian problem one way or another.” 107 Exclusion and elimination are not discrete logics but operate on a moving spectrum of biopolitical violence. For instance, a logic of exclusion applied to Indigenous peoples, who were conferred US citizenship in 1924 but were still denied the right to vote in many states. 108 In Canada, a logic of exclusion denied the franchise to Indigenous nations until 1958, while a logic of elimination rendered this right of citizenship conditional on the abandonment of “Indian Status” and accompanying right to live on a reservation. In both Canada and the United States, logics of exclusion and elimination inform how Indigenous peoples are incarcerated at higher rates than other groups. 109 While these examples demonstrate how these logics often work in tandem, for Indigenous peoples a logic of exclusion is underscored by an overarching logic of elimination. For aliens, similarly, the eliminatory logics expressed through police-initiated murder or death-penalty sentencing of black men are tactics that simultaneously reinforce the exclusion and exclusivity of blackness. 110 In the following section I clarify how these logics operate when land and labor are at stake in the settler colony. My focus on the comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans draws more heavily on the United States than on Canada because the former has a longer national history, and that history presents a foundation that illuminates subsequent racial developments in both countries. Historically, a distinctive feature of settler colonialism was that the primary objective of settlers was to appropriate land alone rather than appropriate Indigenous labor to expropriate that land’s resources. This distinguishes settler colonialism from franchise colonialism—in British India, for example—where Indigenous labor was exploited to produce commodities and extract the land’s wealth. Wolfe explains, “Settler colonialism seeks to replace the natives on their land rather than extract surplus value by mixing their labor with a colony’s natural resources.” 111 Therefore the primary logic of settler colonialism is one of elimination, and land establishes the relationship Indigenous peoples have with the colonizer. This is not to say that Indigenous people either never constituted a labor force or have ceased to be one. Rather, while there are numerous historical examples of Indigenous labor in settler colonies, from factory work in canneries in British Columbia to Alaska, Indigenous recruitment into surplus labor (the subject of chapter 3 ) occurs “in spite of rather than as a result of the primary tendency of settler-colonial policy.” 112 This logic of elimination helps to contextualize the sequence of actions directed at Indigenous peoples whose primary objective was extermination. A snapshot of these directives in the United States include eastern removal; genocidal actions taken by the US Cavalry; the 1877 Dawes Severalty Act, which turned tribes into individual property owners and resulted in the loss of two-thirds of Indigenous land; assimilationist policies of urban relocation and boarding schools (“residential schools” in Canada); and policy on Indigenous “self-determination.” Despite the rhetorical shift in settler discourse that now celebrates Indigenous self-determination as fully incorporated citizens of the settler state through a discourse of reconciliation, this has largely involved implementing federal rather than Indigenous Nation–specific policies. As Glen Coulthard explains, “Although the semantics of the comprehensive claims policy have changed, the legal and political outcomes remain the same.” 113 Further, Federal Indian Identification Policy functions as a form of what Annette Jaimes terms “statistical elimination”: 114 the effective meaning of the state’s definition of “Indian” as a minimum of one-quarter blood quantum is that through intermarriage, Indians will eventually “be defined out of existence.” 115 In the Canadian context, Karrmen Crey refers to this form of racial engineering as the “two-generation cutoff.” 116 Thus if elimination meant physical relocation and/or death in the period preceding the implementation of the Dawes Act, elimination came to mean absorption in the period following it. While policy history in Canada differs, the spirit of elimination does not. 117 And though the treaty process remains subject to negotiation in Canada while Indigenous nations in the United States have sovereignty, the predictable and ongoing process of treaty revision and violation indicates that treaties function as strategic forms of state accommodation designed to appease rather than to concede blame or to compensate. 118 Despite formal differences, the practice of settler colonial elimination is more consistent in the two nations than not. If the primary relationship between settler colonizers and Indigenous populations is land, in the case of African slaves transported to the United States it is labor . Rather than exhibiting a governing logic of elimination, a logic of racial exclusion clarifies the form of colonial exploitation experienced by African Americans in antebellum and postemancipation contexts. Because the relationship between colonizers and slaves was primarily based on labor, the objective was not to eliminate that population but to increase it and, by extension, increase the property value of that exclusive labor force. Consequently, a logic of exclusion applies insofar as slavery was an inherited condition, which made blackness equivalent to slavery and racial admixture assignable to it. Distinguishing the logic of elimination and exclusion, Wolfe explains that whereas Indigenous women “became conduits to whiteness . . . black women came to augment white men’s property by incubating the additional slaves whom they fathered.” 119 While this logic of exclusion functioned to reproduce and grow a discrete population of slaves who became synonymous with the condition of blackness, blackness was not the only condition for enslaveability. For instance, Indigenous peoples were also enslaveable, a lesson that Spanish colonialism in Mexico teaches us. In the most successful regimes of slavery, however, among the most important features that rendered Africans most vulnerable to enslavement was their alienation , “not just the natal alienation that Orlando Patterson has made famous, since indigenous societies . . . have also had their children taken away, but the spatial alienation that slave transportation effected.” 120 The spatial alienation experienced by African slaves made them a more manageable population to control, to thwart insurrection and overthrow, and to prevent from escaping. This form of alienation therefore helps to distinguish, in the case of African Americans, the “alien” position from the Native and settler in a triangular framework. In the United States, African Americans are the original aliens. In the post–Civil War context, race came into full emergence; it was rooted in slavery but came to life during the shift to black emancipation. Not only did Reconstruction put whiteness into crisis—whiteness was also threatened by non-Anglo-Saxon immigration of Jews and southern and eastern Europeans. Shifting the terms of the logic of exclusion, race reinforced the barrier between whites and blacks that the institution of slavery formerly performed. In other words, race became amplified with the downfall of slavery because racial domination was an implicit feature of slavery. However, in the wake of emancipation and without the barrier of slavery to designate free from unfree labor, race became unambiguously natural, reinforcing an exclusively racial division between black and white populations. By extension, without the barrier that slavery performed, whiteness became the basis of racialized privilege after emancipation. What is significant is that emancipation reproduced for African Americans an anomalous condition that similarly characterized the experience of postfrontier “incorporated” Indigenous Nations. Although freed slaves did not become anomalous as labor—in the South they continued to represent a cheap and hyperexploitable labor force—they became, as Wolfe puts it, “juridically anomalous as equals.” 121 Since the settler colonial solution was to eliminate anomalous postfrontier Indigenous peoples through racial absorption, a key question arises: Why didn’t newly freed and anomalous African Americans follow the assimilative racialization of Indigenous peoples and become similarly “eliminated”? Historical attempts to colonize African Americans abroad or assimilate them into the white population point to endeavors to apply a logic of elimination to African Americans. However, given the socially engineered disproportion in the size of the black population vis-à-vis the Indigenous population, neither attempt was practical or, in the case of assimilation, imaginable. Elaborating on the difference between the population of post-emancipated slaves and Indigenous nations, Wolfe highlights the biopolitics of settler colonialism and its “calculated management of life”: 122 In this case, it represents the difference between one group of people who had survived a centuries-long genocidal catastrophe with correspondingly depleted numbers and another group who, as commodities had been preserved, their reproduction constituting a singularly primitive form of accumulation for their owners. 123 The hereditary nature of slavery, which fused slavery to blackness, was thus carried over into the postemancipation context to fuse blackness to an “unlimited power to contaminate.” Given that emancipated African Americans were neither “immigrants” who could be deported nor a population that could be eliminated through biological absorption, African Americans became an undisposable alien labor population, which accounts for the intensity through which subsequent generations of African Americans have been subject to a logic of exclusion where the only means of disposal is death. Furthermore, the force through which blackness was excluded during the Jim Crow era highlights a broader consolidation of whiteness—of Anglo-Saxons and Protestants at first, and eventually extending to other European ethnics 124 —and intensified nation-building in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In both Canada and the United States, “white nationalism” was the ideological and policy response to nonwhite immigration and black incorporation. The comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans highlights the heterogeneity of race that is anchored by a foundational distinction between land and labor. For Indigenous peoples of North America, race was always subject to dilution and disappearance. In both Canada and the United States, the biological constitution of Indigenous peoples was determined assimilable to whiteness. Describing this evolution in the logic of elimination, Wolfe explains that “mixed-bloodedness became the post-frontier version of the vanishing Indian.” 125 For African Americans, on the other hand, the “one-drop rule” relegated to blackness a biological permanence that would survive any amount of interracial mixing. Whereas mixed or light-skinned African Americans who passed as white frustrated the settler colonial racial regime, Indigenous people who assimilated to whiteness upheld it. Similarly, while Jim Crow and antimiscegenation laws kept the line between blacks and whites from blurring, interracial mixing was not only tolerated among Indigenous people but was often actively encouraged through policy. In the United States, the practice of “checkerboarding” during the administration of the Dawes Act (1887–1934) interpenetrated Indigenous reservations with white allotments to promote intermarriage and decrease eligible heirs to Native Title. 126 In Canada, prior to changes to the Indian Act in 1985, Indigenous women were “rewarded” with the loss of their status as “Registered Indians” for the prize of a white identity, not only if they married non-Native but non-Status men. 127 As distinct as these black and Native racial formations appear, they were still bound together by an overarching economic rationale of settler colonialism. First, for each group, race became more salient during the rise and development of industrial capitalism. For Indigenous nations, the logic of elimination became aggressively implemented as trading posts were eclipsed by industrial forms of economic production. In Canada, for instance, James Tulley explains that “the end of the British and French wars rendered the military alliances with the First Nations irrelevant. The shift from trade to settled agriculture and manufacture caused the trading treaties to decline . . . undermining Aboriginal economies and forcing Aboriginal peoples into relations of dependency.” 128 Being rendered anomalous by industrial modes of production thus signals the full onset of settler colonialism and, with it, a racial logic of elimination. In the case of African American slaves, their emancipation was contextualized by the growing challenges to plantation-based economies and the increasing demand for flexible, free labor for the emerging industrial economy. While plantation capitalism was still highly profitable before the Civil War, Southern plantations were increasingly challenged by their need to expand production into non-slave-holding states. 129 Nevertheless, in the absence of slavery, new demands of the industrial economy rendered postemancipation African Americans anomalous as people and gave rise to an intensified notion of race as a regime of social control. From the view of capitalist expansion that lies at the heart of settler colonialism, the divergent forms of racialization that Indigenous peoples of North America and African Americans have been subject to are entirely reconcilable. As Wolfe puts it unequivocally: “The simple undifferentiated product of the encounter between African labor and Indian law was European property.” 130 Mixing alien labor with Indigenous land to expand white property was the basis and objective of settler colonialism. Disposable/Undisposable Alien Labor and the Heterogeneity of Race As migrants to North America, Asians’ primary relationship to settler colonizers was historically based on labor. Similar to African Americans, Asians represented an alien labor force that mixed with Indigenous land to transform it into white property and capital. What comes to light from this framework is, yet again, the heterogeneity of race under settler colonialism. Rather than presenting a derivative model of Asian racialization that is based on a prototypical antiblackness, the vicissitudes of Asian racialization are primarily shaped by the evolving economic landscape of settler colonialism within a global economy. While African Americans and Asian North Americans share an alien status in a triangular framework, the divergent historical and economic contexts of Asian and African labor highlight the heterogeneity contained within an alien position. Asian labor migration to North America, as well as elsewhere in the Americas, occurred during the demise of plantation-based slave economies, a decline that began in the 1830s. Given shifting requirements of industrializing economies, which demanded a flexible rather than enslaved labor force, the economic context of Asian labor migration in the nineteenth century inoculated Asians from assuming the status of unfree labor. This distinction renders Asian aliens highly dependent, nevertheless, on the class of settler capitalists. This means, as Biermann and Kössler clarify, that “the migrant workers are not personally free, [although] their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 131 In addition, as Moon-Ho Jung explains, the historical importation of indentured Chinese labors to replace or supplement slave labor in the US South represented a period of dramatically destabilized labor relations that introduced new and reinvigorated conceptualizations of race and nation. 132 In this tumultuous economic context, Chinese labor migrants would assume none of the hereditary stain of slavery that defined blackness before emancipation or hereditary racialization that determined African American exclusion afterward. While the presence of African American slave labor was an important context for subsequent Asian-settler labor relations in the United States, the Canadian context demonstrates that parallel expressions of Asian racialization were not wholly contingent on the prior enslavement of black people; rather, they were overwhelmingly conditioned by industrial capitalism. Therefore, in the absence of plantation-based African slavery in Canada, the common denominator of Chinese laborers’ analogous experiences of exploitation and exclusion was their alien status rather than their proximity to a racialized notion of blackness. Because the industrial economy that Asian labor served did not require a permanent, reproducible, exclusive, and violently contained population of alien labor, as was the case under US slavery, the exclusionary tactics that Asians were subjected to never approximated those experienced by black slaves. 133 The projection of Asianness as a racial signifier of indelible, exclusively transferable attributes was less necessary as a strategy of containment. Unlike emancipated slaves, Asians could be excluded and eliminated from the nation-state. If the rise of industrial capitalism solidified biological notions of race that subjected Indigenous populations to eliminatory assimilation on the basis of the mutability of their blood, and black populations to Jim Crow exclusion based on the contaminating reach of their blood, the logic of exclusion ascribed alien-ness and spatial vulnerability not simply to Asian blood but to the entire Asian body. Because Asian bodies could be entirely excluded from the nation-state, Asian labor was susceptible to more volatile forms of domestic exclusion than those experienced by African Americans. As a result, the history of domestic segregation and antimiscegenation laws targeting Asians in North America—evoked by racial fears of biological contamination and contagion 134 —was more uneven than its African American counterpart. 135 A much more effective means of exclusion was through immigration control. A form of Jim Crow in a transnational context, immigration policy not only determined entry into the nation but could legally bar an immigrant from naturalizing, voting, owning and transferring property, and working. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds observe, “In drawing the global colour line, immigration restriction became a version of racial segregation on an international scale.” 136 To the extent that Asians were restricted or excluded from coming to North America until the mid-1960s, and because their deportability constituted a form of what David Hernández calls “lesser citizenship,” 137 the logic of exclusion employed the national border to segregate populations and maintain social control. In a settler colonial context, these variable, exclusionary logics have resulted in the heterogeneous racialization of the alien: the African American, whose indisposability in the settler state requires a heightened form of racialized exclusion as a form of domestic social control, and the Asian North American, whose disposability from the settler state produces a less fixed and more volatile racialization by virtue of the exclusionary power of immigration restriction. In this framework of abstract labor, Asian North Americans may appear “less racial”—to adapt Lye’s language—than African Americans or Indigenous populations, whose racial essences were expressed in the relative power of blood to contaminate or to erase a population, respectively. However, if Asian racialization produced a less blood-defined racial body, it is by virtue of the exclusionary, segregationist logics that were carried out in the extraterritorial arena of immigration control that inhibited Asian exposure to more sustained domestic logics of racial exclusion and elimination. In this context, race is not only a heterogeneous formation; it is also an expression of settler power whose capacity to racialize is not, as Jodi Melamed suggests, “reducible to biology, identity, or ontology.” 138 These factors laid the settler colonial groundwork for an understanding of the abstract racialization of the Asian alien that form this book’s central concern. While a logic of elimination functions to increase white property through the decimation of Indigenous populations who stand in the way of territorial expansion, a logic of exclusion serves industrial capitalism by furnishing a vulnerable labor force whose existence could be managed at the border. Bearing some similarity to the spatial segregation of prison inmates from inner cities, the border represents a geographical solution to manage surplus populations. 139 This focus does not discount the many other exercises of racialized domestic social control, which prevented, denied, or rescinded access to naturalization, labor, the franchise, property ownership, and, in the case of Japanese North American citizens interned during World War II, due process or freedom of mobility. My point is that each of these modes of domestic racial control served a broader logic of exclusion that is inherent in immigration restriction: to underscore and preserve Asians’ alien status by creating policy that exploited the volatility of an Asian presence. From the perspective of settler colonialism, we can build on this framework by clarifying the importance of spatial alienation (rather than Indigeneity) as a factor in the exploitation of a racialized labor force. In this light, a logic of exclusion is the prerequisite for the recruitment of alien labor, functioning either to reproduce an exclusive labor force in the case of African slaves or to render an Asian labor presence highly conditional to the demands of capital. Both are subject to forms of segregation, either on a national or international scale. As each of my chapters argues, this volatility is what makes it possible to view the Asian alien as the embodiment of the abstract evils of capitalism. By clarifying the evolving triangulation of Native, alien, and settler subject positions, my purpose has been to distinguish both the heterogeneity of race and the heterogeneity of alien racialization. This formation is uniquely tied to settler colonialism, which requires a disposable reserve army labor force. In the chapters that follow, I will situate this heterogeneous racial formation within a settler colonial logic of romantic anticapitalism that hypostatizes whiteness and sublates Asianness into abstract labor and the intangible, destructive dimension of capitalist relations. Chapter Overview In order to magnify the capitalist logics of settler colonialism that account for the striking parallels in US and Canadian policy directed at Asian ethnic groups, this book’s transnational focus draws on corresponding racial policy making at key turning points since the nineteenth century: Chinese railroad labor in the 1880s and subsequent immigrant restriction laws; the expansion of anti-Asian immigration restrictions in the 1920s; the relocation and internment of Japanese civilians during and after World War II; and the late 1960s neoliberalization of immigration policy. Because one of my goals is to reframe these historical touchstones where Chinese and Japanese populations figured predominantly, the majority of my examples are limited to this East Asian scope. However, because my project is aimed at presenting a theorization of the abstract economism of the Asian alien in a settler colonial framework rather than emphasize the ethnic particularity of any one group, I have strived to construct a flexible rather than ethnically determined model that can be expanded and adapted to accommodate the specific historical circumstances of Asian populations not covered in the book. In each chapter I explore Asian North American cultural production as a genealogical archive. As such I draw from Michel Foucault’s distinction between history and genealogy, one shaped by his principle that “knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting.” 140 Rather than the traditional approach to history as a linear and unified development—“an acquisition, a possession that grows and solidifies”—a genealogy is an “unstable assemblage of faults, fissures, and heterogeneous layers that threaten the fragile inheritor from within or from underneath.” 141 As such, genealogy opens up what Foucault calls a countermemory: “a transformation of history into a totally different time.” 142 To the three modalities of counter-memory that he identifies as parodic, dissociative, and sacrificial reworkings of history, I would like to add a fourth, a “postmemory,” in order to call attention to the affective register of racial genealogies. As Marianne Hirsch defines it, postmemory is a “very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 143 She further distinguishes postmemory and memory as follows: Postmemory characterizes the experiences of those who grow up dominated by narratives that preceded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated. 144 Such a conceptualization of postmemory applies to the contemporary Asian North American cultural production I examine in the sense that these works present less of a direct or experiential connection to historical events than a collective consciousness of Asian American and Asian Canadians who have grown up with settler narratives of national identity and belonging that have relegated the Asian as other. I further adapt the notion of postmemory to indicate a form of future memory, a memory yet to come, to capture the simultaneously utopian and apocalyptic capitalist futurity explored in Asian North American reconfigurations of history. Given that my primary focus is on the economic modalities of Asian racialization that are tied to capitalism, my goal is to demonstrate how an Asian North American cultural genealogy of settler colonialism does not simply oppose this economism but, rather, opens it up for further exposure. Laid bare, the symbolic infrastructure of this economism provides a window into what Dipesh Chakrabarty terms History 2, the relations “whose reproduction does not contribute to the reproduction of the logic of capital . . . [even though they] can actually be intimately intertwined with the relations that do.” 145 History 2 expresses the potential of countermemory to subvert the social relations embedded in History 1 that reproduce the logic of capital. Most of the chapters in the book feature a dialogue between literary and visual texts. The multimedia nature of the archive that grounds my analysis of each historical episode aims to meet two objectives. First, a starting point for this book is an understanding that the ideological expression of white settler colonialism and anti-Asian sentiment in North America is a multimedia projection that has glorified whiteness in artistic constructions of landscape and delimited racial belonging in textual definitions of citizenship. Therefore the multimedia archive of Asian North American cultural production in this book is a response to both the literary and visual form of these constructions. Related to this, the visual works I incorporate attempt to address the predominance of mainstream film and television constructions of Asians that evoke untrustworthiness, mystery, or deceitfulness and collectively reinforce the destructive, unrepresentable abstraction attributed to Asian bodies. The mystery and treachery often reinforced through the visuality of Asians in popular media are distinctive because they always point to something invisible and unseen, suggesting that the negative content of Asian racialization is something that we can’t see. The visual culture presented in this book thus offers imaginative responses to the challenge of visualizing the unrepresentable. Each chapter explores how settler colonialism negatively aligns Asians with an abstract dimension of capitalism through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism—that is, through romantic anticapitalism’s misperception that social relations are defined either as concrete, natural, visible, and hence noncapitalist or abstract, unnatural, invisible, and hence capitalist. Such a misperception of capitalism presents an ideal ideology for rationalizing and forgetting the settler colonial elimination of Native peoples and exploitation of alien labor. Thus what romantic anticapitalism offers is an ideological framework for settler colonialism to respond to economic and technological crises by imagining whiteness through indigenizing tropes of purity and organic connection to land that function to distort and deflect responsibility for capitalist modernity. As such, each chapter examines the expression of white settler romantic anticapitalism both to indigenize whiteness and to align Asians with the threateningly abstract economism of capitalism. The first chapter, “Sex, Time, and the Transcontinental Railway: Abstract Labor and the Queer Temporalities of History 2,” establishes the book’s foundational claim that the economism of Asian racialization arises from a temporal alignment of Chinese bodies with abstract labor, which has implications for what constitutes socially necessary labor time. This “abstract” racialization is reinforced by romantic anticapitalism, which projects an antinomical character of capitalist social relations expressed as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions. I examine how romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, pure, and organic dimensions of white labor and leisure time, while identifying capitalism solely with the abstract dimensions of the antinomy, which is personified by Chinese labor. The chapter begins with a reflection on a nineteenth-century sketch of a Chinese laborer’s profile surrounded by financial figures drawn by William Van Horne, president of the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR ). My interpretation of the sketch, whose provocative nature the CPR itself underscored by not granting me permission to reproduce in this book, sets the stage for clarifying the sexualized intersection of race and capitalism. In taking this direction I adapt Postone’s theorization of the secular, anticapitalist dimensions of modern anti-Semitism for understanding anti-Asian sentiment. Analyzing Richard Fung’s Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes alongside Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men , two works about Chinese labor on the transcontinental railroad, I explore the identity—or sameness—relation between Chinese labor, time, and money. Focusing on the range of gender and sexual substitutions represented in these texts, I argue that these works demonstrate how the abstract racialization of Asian alien labor is established through their alignment with a perverse temporality. While Fung’s and Kingston’s works expose the fungibility of alien labor conditioned by biologized notions of time, they also point to the queer potential of History 2 that resides within abstract labor but does not reproduce the logic of capitalism. Moreover, their contemporary approach to this history highlights the ongoing construction of racialized abstraction in the era of globalization—the new nineteenth century—which is the subject of chapter 4 . The second chapter, “Unnatural Landscapes: Romantic Anticapitalism and Alien Degeneracy,” builds on the first chapter’s focus on the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations—personified by Chinese labor—by turning its attention to the concrete dimension of capitalist social relations personified in artistic depictions of the settler landscape. Turning to the photographs of Tseng Kwong Chi and Jin-me Yoon, I argue that their photographic citations of 1920s- and 1930s-era landscape art parody its romanticization of whiteness-as-nature during a heightened period of Asian immigrant restriction. In particular, Tseng and Yoon respond to themes of regenerative whiteness and autochthonophilia—a term that refers to a settler colonial desire for and identification with Indigeneity—personified in the majestic landscapes by American artists Ansel Adams and Gutzon Borglum and Canadian artists Emily Carr and the Group of Seven. Disidentifying with the romanticization of the concrete, purifying landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs expose the politics of whiteness invested in the identification with nature and Indigeneity. Further developing the theme of perversity associated with abstract labor in chapter 1 , Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs highlight how Asian bodies evolve to denote a degenerative, antinatural force associated with the abstract dimension of romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical social universe. Chapter 3 , “Japanese Internment and the Mutation of Labor,” focuses on the consequences of an increasingly unnatural, mechanical abstraction of Asian racialization developed in the previous chapters. To help contextualize the expulsion, internment, and, in the case of Japanese Canadians, postwar relocation east of the Rocky Mountains, I suggest that the modes of abstraction attributed to Japanese agriculture and fishing labor in the United States and Canada contributed to the false impression that Japanese labor held a destructive control over the creation of relative surplus-value. I suggest that Japanese internment is neither reducible to prior modalities of Asian immigrant exclusion nor a rational expression of white accumulation by racial dispossession. Instead, I argue that Japanese internment turns on the association of Japanese labor with the modernizing displacements of technological innovation, which fed a perception that Japanese labor monopolized the creation of relative surplus-value. The chapter probes how the destructive power of Japanese labor was resignified after West Coast expulsion and relocation. Focusing on Joy Kogawa’s novel Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s video-memoir History and Memory , I examine how symbolic identification with Jewish persecution before the war shifted toward an identification with Native identities after relocation. This cross-racial identification with Native contexts evokes the neutralization of Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value and reconstitution as an ideal surplus labor force. The fourth chapter, “The New Nineteenth Century: Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism,” examines the persistent and evolving economism of Asian racialization in the postexclusion era, after the United States and Canada removed race-based immigration criteria in 1965 and 1967, respectively. Turning to Ken Lum’s multimedia works, including his sculpture on the roof of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , along with Karen Tei Yamashita’s novel Tropic of Orange , I track their works’ reconceptualizations of labor, migration, and political consciousness. Their works point to the capacity of the neoliberal border to recruit and restrict surplus labor populations from around the world while preserving the racialized abstractions that surround both high-tech, flexible Asian labor and working-class labor. As such, free trade becomes a further conduit for the fungibility of bodies as capital across borders and the continuing perils of abstract labor associated with the “new Jew.” Far from symbolizing multicultural inclusion, I suggest that the border is a central motor for the expanded fulfillment of a settler colonial mode of production that relies on a disposable migrant labor system. The epilogue, “The Revenge of the Iron Chink,” offers a meditation on an exhibition featuring an early twentieth-century fish-gutting machine called the “Iron Chink” located in my hometown of Victoria, British Columbia, personifying a racist slur. To explore its contemporary significance I turn to artist Tommy Ting’s reanimation of the Iron Chink in his 2012 sculpture Machine (Iron Chink, invented in 1903, found at the Gulf of Georgia Cannery in Steveston, British Columbia, refabricated in Beijing, China) . Examining how Ting’s sculpture recontextualizes the original machine, I reflect on aesthetic and biological dimensions of capitalism that I’ve tracked through the book. Probing the question of value in capitalism as the central motor of the metaphoric work of the fetish, I consider what it might mean to imagine human incommensurability in a world beyond commodity-determined labor.

      "content": "CHAPTER 1 SEX, TIME, AND THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD Abstract Labor and the Queer Temporalities of History 2 We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. —Henry David Thoreau Fungibility Figure 1.1 is the celebrated telegram sent by Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR ) president William Van Horne, an American from Chicago tasked with overseeing the construction of the CPR who became, according to Pierre Berton’s famous account, “more Canadian than any native.” 1 His telegram is addressed to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and announces the completion of the railroad in Craigellachie, British Columbia, on November 7, 1885. Unlike the well-known photograph of the ceremonial driving of the last spike, the focal point of the telegram is time: it is the hour and minutes—9:22 A.M .—that precisely mark the consolidation of the settler nation. The telegram, itself a representation of nineteenth-century advances in communications, symbolizes a new national temporality achieved through technological innovation. Van Horne was known to frequently draw pictures on the reverse side of these kinds of telegrams. On the back side of one of the few that survived is his sketch of a Chinese laborer’s facial profile, complete with a long tapered mustache. Surrounding the man’s face are a busy series of numerical calculations that seem indicative of Van Horne’s financial worries during the railroad’s construction. The CPR , now a multi-billion-dollar corporation, objected to the reproduction of the sketch in this book. 2 What’s interesting is that the grounds for the CPR ’s censorship of the image rested on the mere association of Van Horne with the Chinese man, suggesting a perverse content attributed to the sketched figure and its capacity to corrupt Van Horne’s reputation. This chapter probes exactly what constitutes this unnatural, obscene content and why it is out of sync with the settler temporality glorified on the face of Van Horne’s telegram to the prime minister. Probing the obscene content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man further, the juxtaposition of the human profile and numerical sums evokes the economic connection between Chinese railroad labor and their low wages. Drawing out the financial significance of the image, Margot Francis explains that Chinese labor was “indispensable to the CPR ’s early financial viability as their ‘cheap wages’ saved Andrew Onderdonk, the contractor for the western section of the line, between $3 and $5 million and allowed him to escape bankruptcy.” 3 The Chinese whom Onderdonk contracted to work the western section were recruited from San Francisco. Many of them had worked on the US transcontinental railroad, which had been completed over a decade earlier, in 1869. 4 Although Chinese labor in North America was vital to the completion of the transcontinental railroads, its profound irony, as Henry Yu observes, is “that the very railroads that Chinese laborers built made it easier and cheaper to transport the settlers who arrived afterwards and demanded that ‘the Chinese must go.’” 5 Although railroads were symbols of consolidation for the white nation, they were lines to exclusion for the Chinese laborers who helped build them. In 1885, the same year the CPR was completed, Canada passed its first immigration restriction policy through the Chinese Head Tax, designed to deter laboring classes. Originally set at $50, the tax rose prohibitively, to $100 by 1900 and $500 by 1903. Following completion of the US transcontinental railroad in 1869, the 1875 Page Act was the first federal immigration policy designed to deny entry to prostitutes, overwhelmingly targeting Chinese women on the basis of presumed sexual immorality. The passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 dramatically expanded this scope by restricting entry to all skilled and unskilled Chinese labor. The outcome of these immigration controls on both sides of the Canada-US border was the formation of “bachelor” communities that, as homosocial, nonreproductive spaces, reinforced fears of contagion and perversion associated with Chinese men. The reproductive restrictions imposed on the bachelor community was, in Foucault’s terms, part of the biopolitics of settler colonialism through its “calculated management of life.” 6 The very existence of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man also offers a stark contrast to the traditional iconography associated with the building of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. The now-famous photographs taken at Promontory, Utah, and Craigellachie, British Columbia, respectively, commemorate the technological feat of white labor, erasing the thousands of Chinese men who worked and died building the western sections of these railroads. As David Eng notes, “While more than ten thousand Chinese American male laborers were exploited for the building of the western portion of Central Pacific track, no one appears in the photograph commemorating its completion.” 7 Neither are any of the seventeen thousand Chinese laborers who worked the western section of the Canadian Pacific railroad identified in what Berton calls “the most famous photograph ever taken in Canada,” celebrating the union of eastern and western tracks in Canada. 8 Therefore, in the sense that Van Horne’s illustration retrieves a repressed aspect of Chinese labor in Canada, it offers us an alternative visual example that Francis suggests “troubles the narratives that posit that only white men were sufficiently enterprising to construct the rail that connected the nation.” 9 For the purposes of this chapter, what the missing sketch also brings to the fore is a relationship between the signifiers of race and capital that overshadowed railroad construction. The tension between these signifiers gave rise to the association of Chinese labor efficiency with social perversion and fed into romantic anticapitalism’s dehumanization of Chinese workers as abstract labor. Probing this visual interplay of race and capital, a less linear vision of Chinese labor emerges from Van Horne’s sketch. In addition to the causal significance of the Chinese face and calculations, insofar as Chinese labor was instrumental for securing the financial viability of the CPR , the juxtaposition of the Chinese profile and numerical figures also projects the sameness of an identity relation. In particular, the vertical lines of the Chinese man’s mustache in the sketch repeat the tally lines surrounding him, accentuating their symbolic resemblance and projecting a quality of mutability and interchangeability. This visual assonance evokes the peculiar fungibility of the Asian alien, a figure whose interchangeability as a value expression dramatizes the properties of money itself, Marx’s “universal equivalent,” against which everything is commensurable and exchangeable. Does such a resemblance between alien labor and the universal equivalence of money suggest that racialized labor takes on the abstract qualities of capital? In light of the 2012 controversy over the Asian scientist on the Canadian hundred-dollar bill discussed in the introductory chapter, Van Horne’s doodle achieves prototypical significance. By surrounding the Chinese man’s face with a series of financial calculations, what Van Horne’s sketch prompts is a reconsideration of the relation between the concrete and the abstract, the concrete specificity of racialized labor and the abstract, universal equivalence of money, which Marx describes as “a radical leveler [that] extinguishes all distinctions.” 10 Money “extinguishes all distinctions” because it is universally exchangeable with all other commodities, and “all other commodities make [money] the material embodiment of their uniform and universal form of value.” 11 Money is the conduit and expression of commensurability. However, Van Horne’s sketch opens a view of racialized labor as money. Rather than an exchange relation—of labor for money—his sketch evokes a substitution relation. Such a relation suggests a process whereby heterogeneous (i.e., racialized) labor takes on the appearance of something entirely different: the homogeneous substance of money, whose qualities are universally commensurable. Unequal labor takes on the appearance of symbolic equivalence. This chapter explores the implications of such a symbolic substitution, particularly in terms of how racialized labor becomes progressively abstract, moving from concrete reality to the spectral domain of capital. Of course, capitalism’s key operational logic is one of abstraction, dissolving difference into homogeneous, equivalent forms so they are commensurable—exchangeable. As Dipesh Chakrabarty summarizes, “The logic of capital sublates into itself the differences of history.” 12 The question, therefore, is why the concrete particularity of Chinese labor comes to express itself culturally as “abstract labor.” Does the cultural abstraction of Chinese labor offer new ways of understanding what Yu calls the “irony” of Chinese labor restrictions introduced after the completion of the transcontinental railroads? In particular, if value is based on “socially necessary” labor time, what factors constitute social necessity? This chapter draws on two Asian North American texts that shed light on social necessity through gendered and sexual temporalities of race, labor, and capitalism in the construction of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. Addressing themes of labor exploitation and gendered and sexualized exclusion, Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains,” from her experimental memoir China Men , and Richard Fung’s experimental video documentary Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes offer imaginative responses to Van Horne’s symbolic provocation of the identity relation between Chinese labor and money. Magnifying a converging theme of gender and sexual resignification and substitution in their texts, Kingston and Fung demonstrate, to quote Elizabeth Freeman, how “time has, indeed is , a body.” 13 Specifically, in their framing of racialized labor through the interplay of sexuality and temporality, I argue that Kingston and Fung queer the disembodying effects of an accelerating temporal logic of equivalence that constitutes abstract labor. What unites their distinct texts is a recurring theme of substitutions—of ventriloquism for “real” speech, of masturbation for “real” sex, of gay sex for straight sex, of Chinese alien labor for white labor, of maternalism for paternalism, and so on—which function collectively to expose how racial, sexual, and gender difference operates as a degraded substitute within the capitalist logics of white settler colonialism. These substitutions interrupt the accelerating capitalist temporality of railroad labor, which reorganizes the social necessity of a linear, rational, normative time of family, nation, and capital. If time is a body, it is a body subject to relentless disembodiment under capitalism. Yet, for these cultural producers, disembodiment provides an opening for queer resignification that reveals the destabilizing potential of abstract labor. They draw out the potential of Queer Marxism by exposing the tension between concrete labor and abstract labor time, what Petrus Liu identifies as the “incommensurability between the value of a human being and its formal exchangeability.” 14 As alien substitutes for “real labor,” I suggest that Kingston’s and Fung’s texts allegorize a process whereby alien labor is symbolically aligned with the fluctuating duration embedded in abstract labor, which establishes value, rather than the here-and-now world of concrete labor. As I elaborated in the introductory chapter, abstract labor represents a social average of labor time to produce a commodity in order to express its quantitative value during exchange, whereas concrete labor refers to the actual time and place of a specific laboring activity that expresses its qualitative use-value. Chakrabarty offers a useful clarification of abstract labor as a “performative, practical category.” 15 He explains that “abstract labor gave Marx a way of explaining how the capitalist mode of production managed to extract, out of peoples and histories that were all different, a homogenous and common unit for measuring human activity.” 16 Abstract labor is therefore an objective force made up of what Marx describes as a spectral, phantomlike substance: Let us now look at the residue of the products of labour. There is nothing left of them in each case but the same phantom-like objectivity ; there are merely congealed quantities of homogenous human labour, i.e. of human labour-power expended without regard to the form of its expenditure. All these things now tell us is that human labour-power has been expended to produce them, human labour is accumulated in them. As crystals of this social substance, which is common to them all, they are values—commodity values. 17 By aligning Chinese bodies with abstract labor, their labor represents human labor in the abstract . It is this phantomlike objectivity of alien labor that establishes a commodity’s value. White bodies, on the other hand, are symbolically associated with concrete labor, which establishes a commodity’s quality. Such a racial bifurcation of abstract and concrete labor is the work of the commodity fetish, which disguises the social relations behind the products of human labor. In terms of this book’s overarching claim, I argue that a key anchor of North American settler colonialism is an ideology of romantic anticapitalism that reifies a distinction between concrete and abstract social relations out of a misunderstanding of the dialectical nature of capitalism. Romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and pure, on one hand, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of social relations, on the other. It glorifies what it sees as the concrete realm of social relations: white labor, the family, and the train itself—a machine whose concreteness is biologized as the “iron horse.” Alternatively, Chinese bodies are in nearly exclusive alignment with quasi-mechanized labor temporality, excluded from normative social and domestic temporalities. Once Chinese labor is no longer needed, romantic anticapitalism performs an aesthetic function by giving Chinese shape to the unrepresentable: giving bodily form to the abstract, temporal domination of capitalism. In this sense, Chinese labor allegorizes the commensurating function of abstract labor that propels capitalism forward. However, as Chakrabarty notes, for Marx the universal category of abstract labor serves two functions: “It is both a description and a critique of capital.” 18 Following a Queer Marxist approach, this chapter will explore how abstract labor can pose such a critique. The focus on temporality in Kingston’s and Fung’s work also serves to dramatize the impact of industrial technology on conceptions of time in the nineteenth century. In particular, railroad construction was intimately linked to the speed-up and internationalization of uniform time through technological innovation, time-space compression, and the standardization of Greenwich Mean Time. Completing a process of temporal secularization that began in the Middle Ages, time’s progressive detachment from the cosmos and human events was achieved in this period of national expansion and consolidation by rail. No longer did biblical events structure and determine time, as they once did within traditional Jewish and Christian conceptions of history; rather, time became increasingly continuous, homogeneous, and independent of events. 19 Postone refers to this secularized temporality as “abstract time,” “an independent framework within which motion, events, and action occur . . . divisible into equal, constant, nonqualitative units.” 20 Indeed, the progress of abstract time as a dominant form of time parallels the development of capitalism as a socially metabolic totality. In the context of this shift to a more totalizing capitalist temporality, what Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate is how conceptions of time were racialized and sexualized. Indeed, as Petrus Liu specifies, it is a mistake to view socially necessary labor time as solely the mean labor time associated with technological developments but also in terms of its moral dimensions. He clarifies that “the value of a commodity is the amount of human labor embodied in it, but the value of the commodity of human labor is determined by moral and discursive operations outside the capitalist reproduction scheme.” 21 Therefore, on one hand, white labor productivity and its heteronormative reproduction become qualitative expressions of morality and rationality associated with time discipline. As Michael O’Malley explains, there was a need “to protect time’s virtue,” its chastity tied to “scientific discipline requiring years of patient courting to master.” 22 On the other, as I suggest in this chapter, Chinese labor becomes associated with the abstract, quantitative domination of labor time. This is what Postone describes as the “temporal dimension of the abstract domination that characterizes the structures of alienated social relations in capitalism.” 23 Exposing the racialized temporalities of the labor process under capitalism, Kingston and Fung return with queer temporal revisions of labor and reproduction. Time Travel Midway through Richard Fung’s video Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes , the camera draws in on a Chinese Canadian train steward scanning a magazine article titled “Canada’s Railway: A Symbol under Threat.” Several scenes later, the steward is engaged in a passionate kiss with Roger Kwong, a Chinese Canadian journalist for the magazine. After a slow-motion montage of hands caressing undressed bodies, the scene of the two men’s sexual encounter gives way to metaphorical expression through a cut to archival film footage taken from the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR ); the grainy blackand-white film transports the viewer around a bend and into a dark tunnel. Besides the discontinuous temporality staged by the juxtaposition of these two scenes—one fictional and contemporary, the other culled from a historical archive—their temporal dissonance is further accentuated by their distinct cinematic tempos . The sex scene is slow and methodical, while the train hurtles forward on a predetermined path. The possibility of the gay encounter, Fung suggests, is contingent on but temporally dislocated from the predictable linearity of CPR time. The video pushes temporality and sexuality together in a way that simultaneously emphasizes the temporality of racialized sexuality and the sexuality of time on the transcontinental railway. Sex on trains is certainly not isolated to experimental Asian Canadian documentaries such as Fung’s. Perhaps more obviously, the rapid sequence of the scenes above presents a queer citation to a film such as Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest (1959), in which the train similarly serves as a symbolic phallus. In Hitchcock’s version, the train that disappears into a tunnel also—and comically—references sex between Cary Grant’s and Eva Marie Saint’s characters. This kind of sexual symbolism has a long history in the popular culture of the railway. Since the nineteenth century, popular film and visual art representations have commonly depicted the sexuality of trains, which, as Lynne Kirby describes, is “most often as a double for male sexuality.” 24 As a mirrored projection of male virility over a fertile, feminine body, the train symbolizes either (and often both) the aggressively violent or consummating romance of territorial penetration and domestication. Inside the train, the compression of time and space have disorienting effects, such that chance and illicit encounters are not only possible but probable. Therefore, the railway’s temporal duality of social unpredictability and technological predictability nonetheless converge under a dominant symbolism of heterosexual consummation between technology and nature. In other words, the surprise or taboo sexual encounters between passengers who feel out of time and space are not anomalous to the predetermined, linear path of the railway because, as Hitchcock’s film demonstrates, the two lovers ultimately mirror the overarching theme of spatial consummation with their bodies—white heterosexual bodies are always in sync with the temporality of the railroad. But when we loop back to Fung’s CPR , the two strangers are Asian, and gay sex replaces heterosexual white consummation. Through this substitution, the video suggests that disrupting the train’s symbolism with an Asian “anal” tunnel is one reason that the Canadian railway may be “a symbol under threat.” Fung’s documentary diverges from the traditional “romance of the rails” by presenting a montage of narrative layers where, as Lisa Lowe observes, “the journey across geography spatializes a temporal exploration of an unknown past.” 25 Interwoven through the documentary are interviews, archival film and photographic images, dramatized historical scenes, and a fictional travelogue that follows Roger Kwong’s journey from Toronto to Vancouver aboard a CPR train. The documentary does not privilege any one narrative or temporal standpoint, emphasizing instead the interplay of power and narrativity—particularly the racial power embedded in the assembly of historical archives. As Margot Francis observes of the video’s back-and-forth movement between historical analysis and fictional travelogue, “The director suggests that he didn’t want viewers of the tape to feel too secure with either fiction or history.” 26 In its approach to race and sexuality, Fung adapts Michel Foucault’s argument in History of Sexuality that the late nineteenth century did not so much repress sexuality as give rise to a cultural “incitement to speak” about it, leading to a proliferation of discourses and disciplinary apparatuses. 27 Subtitled A History of Heroes , the video examines how it was anti-Chinese sentiment in the nineteenth century that was historically linked to the proliferation of discourses about sexual perversion—at the same time that whiteness was coalescing as a normative category of national citizenship. In Foucauldian fashion, Fung demonstrates how conceptions of racial and sexual normativity were secondary to and relied on racial and sexual otherness for definition. Rather than indict the conflation of racial otherness with sexual perversion, the video’s ironic treatment of perversity is exemplified in its title, Dirty Laundry : it seeks to rework the symbolic interplay of racialized sexuality and labor. Through Roger’s discovery of his great-grandfather’s ambiguous sexuality, the video clears a space outside the temporal frame of official history to identify with sexual fluidity. Moreover, Fung’s video playfully channels the eroticism of dirty laundry, which comes into play when an accidental spill initiates the sexual encounter between Roger and the railway steward. The combination of overlapping temporalities, self-conscious narration, and dramatic reversals and substitutions bring to light the queer modalities of racialized labor history. If we move south to the transcontinental railroad of Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains” in China Men , another Chinese railroad worker performs a different kind of queer identity forged out of temporal dislocation. Whether Ah Goong is wandering alone through the Sierra woods or sitting with his family at the dinner table, he has no qualms about baring his penis and subjecting it to worldly questioning. Contrary to the steel certainty of the train’s anthropomorphized virility, he continually wonders “what it was that it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 28 Scrutinizing the function and reproductive capacity of his body, Ah Goong presents a warped mirror of the train’s phallic symbolism. Far from the pleasures of queer sexuality that Fung’s steward enjoys, Ah Goong’s inward chastisement outwardly questions the relation between male sexuality and gender. His gender and sexual dislocations are reflected in the acute temporal dissonance he experiences as a laboring body. As he works, Ah Goong continually grasps for temporal anchoring while his observations become increasingly unhinged. After he spends three years tunneling through granite with a pickaxe, time becomes a tangible, animate form divorced from a coherent sense of reality: When he stumbled out, he tried to talk about time. “I felt time,” he said. “I saw time. I saw world.” He tried again, “I saw what’s real. I saw time, and it doesn’t move. If we break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway. You translators ought to tell the foreigners that.” 29 The temporality of granite is dissociated from reality and takes on a materiality that Ah Goong feels and sees. The linear, unidirectional pressures of Ah Goong’s labor time confront the seeming immobility of nature, because “it doesn’t move.” Labor time and natural time are presented as frustratingly out of sync with each other, and even if they “break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway.” These temporal disjunctures have alienating gendered and sexual effects on Ah Goong. The temporal alienation Ah Goong experiences during labor is reinforced by the waning influence of a cosmic temporality. For instance, his ritual observance of the summer reunion of the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy—the Altair and Vega star constellations—becomes increasingly irrelevant to him in the face of a new labor temporality. Looking up at the night sky, Ah Goong “saw the order in the stars,” 30 an astrological system that brings comfort because he recognizes them from China. He recounts the story of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy, in which two lovers are so enchanted with one another, “too happy,” that they neglect their work and are punished by the Queen of the Sky. She separates the lovers, “scratch[ing] a river between them.” Taking pity on them, the King of the Sky allows them a reunion once a year: “On the seventh day of the seventh month . . . magpies form a bridge for them to cross to each other.” 31 The discovery of the stars gives Ah Goong something to look forward to: “Every night he located Altair and Vega and gauged how much closer they had come since the night before.” 32 But after the first summer, astrological time seems increasingly disconnected from his own temporal existence. Ah Goong “felt less nostalgia at the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy. . . . The Cowboy’s one year away from his lady was no time at all.” 33 For Ah Goong, cosmic time is progressively divorced from the demands of earth-bound labor time, which, he observes, has kept some Chinese men working in the country for decades. Dispensing with his yearly celebration of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy’s reunion and, later, casting aside the temptations of a pitiful sex worker brought into the camp, Ah Goong’s gender and sexuality become progressively estranged from the consummating imperatives of the railway. He begins to masturbate on the job while lowered in a basket filled with gunpowder and fuses, declaring, “I am fucking the world!” 34 Later, after the railway is complete, he is filled with longing for his own child, a daughter: “He wished for a happy daughter. . . . She would sing for him and listen to him sing.” 35 He is deemed insane by his family, and is eventually lost after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. His consciousness is shaped by an indefinite temporality, and as I develop further in this chapter, it stands in sharp contrast to the gender and sexual imperatives of a consolidating capitalist temporality of the nineteenth century. Departing from an ordered, sequential, and linear vision of time, Fung and Kingston employ forms of substitution as openings for processes of resignification that reimagine time’s relation to race, sexuality, and labor. It is from the dislocated position of abject substitution that time’s normalizing function is exposed. Elizabeth Freeman notes how “one of the most obvious ways that sex meets temporality is in the persistent description of queers as temporally backward, though paradoxically dislocated from any specific historical moment.” 36 From the displaced vantage of the historically dislocated position of Chinese labor, therefore, Kingston and Fung’s texts denaturalize capitalist temporality while reimagining “how time makes bodies and subjects.” 37 As capitalism expands and increasingly regulates all aspects of labor and social life in the nineteenth century, we can discern how the morality and character-building activity of concrete labor both structures and reinforces the social and cultural structures of family and leisure. The temporality of the home, which schedules gendered activity, moral education, heterosexual reproduction, progress, and futurity, is thus a crucial regulator of the labor process. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts elucidate, the temporality of work and family become embodied by whiteness, a category imbued with morality, belonging, and social necessity. In contrast, the Chinese are identified with a perverse domesticity whose homosociality forecloses any sense of reproductive futurity. Excluded from the moral category of concrete labor, Chinese labor is instead associated with processes of valorization associated with productivity and time, an abstract force that injects temporal volatility into the concrete labor process. Personifying the capitalist adage “Time is money,” therefore, the substitutions present in Kingston and Fung’s texts expose the aesthetic function of romantic anticapitalism. That white labor appears more “concrete” than Chinese labor is one of the fetishized tropes of capitalism that, as Marx writes, “conceals the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual workers, by making those relations appear as relations between material objects, instead of revealing them plainly.” 38 In the following two sections I explore the way Fung and Kingston respond to the capitalist imperatives of temporal consolidation, one which aligns Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism while simultaneously subverting it. As personifications of the “phantom-like objectivity” 39 of abstract labor, the Chinese laborers of Kingston’s and Fung’s texts stage alternative temporalities, inserting a queer temporal vitality that animates Chakrabarty’s conception of History 2, a historical formation that he describes as the “excess that capital . . . always needs but can never quite control or domesticate.” 40 These are the vital forces that form a constant resistance to capital: “the abstract living labor—a sum of muscles, nerves, and consciousness/will—that, according to Marx, capital posits as its contradictory starting point all the time.” 41 Alien Labor as Dangerous Supplement During the three years that Ah Goong tunnels through granite mountain in China Men , he undergoes profound psychological disembodiment insofar as he becomes progressively unable to distinguish the tangible from the abstract. As he tunnels, his sensory ability becomes estranged, and his perception of the material world reflects his temporal imprisonment in labor, where “a mountain is the same as permanence and time”: 42 His eyes couldn’t see, his nose couldn’t smell; and now his ears were filled with the noise of hammering. This rock is what is real, he thought. This rock is what real is, not clouds or mist, which make mysterious promises, and when you go through them are nothing. 43 Ah Goong’s experience of temporal suspension against the impenetrability of rock bankrupts the hope or mystery suggested by “clouds or mist.” History is reduced to rock. Later, after the bosses replace pickaxes with dynamite, which “added more accidents and ways of dying,” 44 he is further disoriented in time. After blasting through a tunnel in winter, he begins to think that “it was the task of the human race to quicken the world, blast the freeze, fire it, redden it with blood.” 45 Experiencing the shift to the quickening pace of industrial time, Ah Goong tries to counteract the disjuncture of labor speed and the delay of the natural world: He had to change the stupid slowness of one sunrise and one sunset per day. He had to enliven the silent world with sound. “The rock,” he tried to tell the others. “The ice.” “Time.” 46 Responding to the asynchrony of labor time and natural time, Ah Goong attempts to resignify the natural world using the sound of words, which fail to signify new meaning. As natural time cleaves from the laboring body, the Chinese laborers who die from explosions become increasingly disembodied forms, “like puppets [who] made Ah Goong laugh crazily as if the arms and legs would come together again.” When he is suspended in his dynamite-lined basket, Ah Goong renders human life abstract: “Godlike, he watched men whose faces he could not see and whose screams he did not hear roll and bounce and slide like a handful of sprinkled gravel.” 47 From puppets to sprinkled gravel, human life is progressively stripped of vitality. As both witness to and subject of the disembodying effects of abstract time, Ah Goong articulates both the inadequacy and potential of the living body. As he lifts his hammer, he tells the men working beside him that “a man ought to be made of tougher material than flesh. . . . Skin is too soft.” 48 The impenetrability of the wall further underscores his corporeal lack: “Nothing happened to that gray wall. . . . It had no softer or weaker spots anywhere, the same hard gray.” 49 He remarks to his friends, “Our bones ought to be filled with iron.” 50 Ah Goong’s recognition of the dehumanizing demands of abstract labor time emphasizes a central contradiction of a capitalist mode of production. Within capitalism’s drive to accumulate by speeding up time and compressing space, its tendency is to replace human labor with machines, or “bones . . . filled with iron.” As Chakrabarty notes, “Capital is thus faced with its own contradiction: it needs abstract and living labor as the starting point in its cycle of self-reproduction, but it also wants to reduce to a minimum the quantum of living labor it needs.” 51 Thus, connecting this contradiction to History 2, we find that the crucial variable embedded within abstract labor—a variable that capitalism requires but continuously tries to eliminate—is human life itself, an innately conscious and willing indeterminate force. It is the capacity of being “living” that makes labor a potential source of resistance to capitalist abstraction. The resistance of vitalism, as Chakrabarty elucidates, is such that “life, in Marx’s analysis of capital, is . . . in a ‘standing fight’ against the process of abstraction that is constitutive of the category labor.” 52 Expressing a queer vitalism that upsets the reproduction of a capitalist temporality, Ah Goong’s performance of racialized labor as a sexual act queers the value-generating temporality of abstract labor. In the much-discussed scene of Ah Goong’s compulsion to masturbate while lowered in a basket filled with dynamite and declaring, “I am fucking the world,” he taps into the vital excess of abstract labor. In debates over the political registers of the scene, critics identify these acts as expressions of either sexual frustration or resistance. For Donald Goellnicht, his masturbation signals the “loss and frustration caused by emasculation” 53 in the face of sexual deprivations in the railroad labor camps, suggesting that his sexuality is a belated formation, foreclosed until an unknown future. On the other hand, as David Eng suggests, his autoerotic behavior can be interpreted as staging an act of resistance, “us[ing] his penis to make a statement of racial protest . . . to his devalued racial position in America.” 54 Tomo Hattori extends the resistant registers of masturbation, not as a “pathetic substitution for and failure to engage in ‘real’ sex,” 55 but as an expression of Ah Goong’s “critique of the heterosexual and masculinist pretensions of his masters.” 56 In this case, his masturbation represents a suspended challenge to the linear, reproductive frame of heterosexual consummation. Extending these analyses of his act’s resistant potential, I call attention to the notion of masturbation as dangerous supplement. In Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s privileging of speech over writing, nature over culture, and presence over absence, he pays special attention to Rousseau’s discussion of masturbation. In The Confessions , Rousseau expresses guilt over frequently succumbing to the compulsion to masturbate in the absence of his lover, Therese. He calls masturbation a “dangerous supplement,” 57 regarding the act as a secondary, subordinate addition to the primary and original act of sexual intercourse. But Derrida points to the double meaning of the supplement, as both supplying something that is missing and supplying something additional. Derrida’s insight is that the supplement is what sets the terms that make possible the privileged status of the first entity. Supplementarity is the manifestation of the deferral that deconstructs the integrity of the sexual act, which is assumed to be perfect and complete. Applying this notion of supplementarity to Ah Goong’s masturbatory “fucking” of the world, we can examine how his act ventriloquizes the dynamite’s literal “fucking” of the world. As a mode of writing, Ah Goong’s masturbation gives him discursive presence and embodiment that corrupts the logic of equivalence that capitalism extracts as abstract labor. Moreover, Ah Goong’s masturbation blurs the hierarchical distinction between work and play. Masturbation becomes an expression of queer vitalism that frustrates the homogeneity of abstract labor. Simultaneously, the queer vitalism he stages frustrates the capitalist logics of heterosexual reproduction. In his examination of nationalism and sexuality in the nineteenth century, George Mosse notes that masturbation was likened to “throwing money out the window,” 58 causing impotence and threatening depopulation. And given that masturbation activates, as Tomo Hattori explains, an “autoerotic homosexuality . . . [because] the onanist, as both the subject and object of erotic action, is the same gender as itself,” 59 Ah Goong’s sexual difference defies the logic of equivalence embedded in abstract labor while disidentifying with the capitalist project of national consummation. The queer vitalism of Ah Goong’s masturbation may also leverage a more dangerous supplementarity to the temporal domination of abstract labor than the labor strike he participates in. Animating the dehumanization of technological speed-up—whereby technology expands the exploitation of human labor—the Chinese workers are presented with a “four-dollar raise per month” that comes with the “‘opportunity to put in more time’ . . . ‘Two more hours per shift.’ Ten-hour shifts inside the tunnels.” 60 The “railroad demons” reason that “‘now that you have dynamite, the work isn’t so hard.’” 61 In response, the Chinese laborers recognize the temporal domination of abstract labor through the inhuman push to mechanize their bodies: “‘A human body can’t work like that.’ ‘The demons don’t believe this is a human body. This is a chinaman’s body.’” 62 Here the racialization of labor translates into a temporal embodiment of abstract labor. When the Chinese workers decide to resist by going on strike, the strike serves to halt the capitalist temporality of labor and becomes a supplementary form of leisure time. On strike, the men emerge as nonequivalents: The ones who were sleeping slept on and rose as late as they pleased. They bathed in streams and shaved their moustaches and wild bears. Some went fishing and hunting. The violinists tuned and played their instruments. The drummers beat theirs at the punchlines of jokes. The gamblers shuffled and played their cards and tiles. The smokers passed their pipes, and the drinkers bet for drinks by making figures with their hands. The cooks made party food. 63 However, rather than a dangerous supplement that destroys the coherent division of work and labor, the strike also serves as a kind of “obscene supplement,” which Slavoj Žižek defines as less a subversion of capitalism than “an obstacle which is simultaneously the ‘condition of possibility’ of the exercise of Power.” 64 The strike operates as an obscene supplement in the sense that the China Men’s victory is a qualified one. The foremen eventually grant a four-dollar raise without lengthening the working day, but this is far less than the fourteen-dollar increase the Chinese laborers demanded. Because the Irish workers refused to join the strike, rejecting their invitation by calling the Chinese strikers “Cheap John Chinaman,” 65 Chinese labor remains aligned with the temporal domination of abstract labor. The strike ultimately serves to uphold rather than undermine capitalism by safeguarding the vital human limits of abstract labor time. Thus when the strike is over, there is no celebration. The China Men merely resume their work within a capitalist temporality. Kingston writes, “The China Men went back to work quietly. No use singing and shouting over a compromise and losing nine days’ work.” 66 In this case, abstract labor functions less as History 2 than as History 1, which Chakrabarty defines as “the past ‘established’ by capital because History 1 lends itself to the reproduction of capitalist relationships.” 67 Ultimately, Kingston presents the irony of capitalism’s demand for equivalence and substitution performed by fungible alien labor. When the railroad is complete, race complicates the logic of endless substitution—of alien supplementarity—by projecting the concreteness of white railroad laborers through photographs and commemorative celebration at Promontory, Utah, in 1869. The white workers declare that “only Americans could have done it.” 68 Chinese labor remains abstract and, as such, invisible: “Ah Goong does not appear in railroad photographs.” 69 As Eng clarifies, here “American emphatically does not include Chinese , as the China Men are driven out and their racialized labor is transformed into an abstracted whiteness.” 70 Kingston emphasizes these processes of abstraction and performative substitution at the completion ceremony when a Chinese worker becomes what Eng calls a “body double” 71 for the white man who drives in the commemorative last spike: “A white demon in a top hat tap-tapped on the gold spike, and pulled it back out. Then one China Man held the real spike, the steel one, and another hammered it in.” 72 In this scene Kingston reverses the projections of abstraction and concreteness. Here we see that the steel, as an inferior supplement to gold, is what constitutes the “real.” The Chinese man who hammers it in is as concrete as the steel that consummates the nation, while the golden spike and the white man remain abstract, fetishized symbols of value. As Eng explains, the scene “underscores the splitting of the real from representation, of reality from the ways it is reconfigured in the laminating photograph that memorializes the event.” 73 By dramatizing the role of representation in romanticized projections of concrete white labor, Kingston allegorizes the way racial difference can be sublated into an abstract supplement of white labor while also serving an aesthetic function by giving Chinese form to the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality that is otherwise unrepresentable. Unlike Kingston’s text, Dirty Laundry ’s focus is less on the actual labor process entailed in railroad construction in Canada from 1881 to 1885 than its aftermath. In particular, Fung’s video provides a complementary view of the ideological forces behind Ah Goong’s experience of “The Driving Out” 74 that follows the completion ceremony at Promontory. When Chinese labor is no longer indispensable, Ah Goong realizes, “It was dangerous to stay.” 75 What Fung’s video explores is how abstract labor becomes aligned with racialized perversity and vice that fuels the ideological basis for expulsion, making it “dangerous to stay.” Incorporating themes of substitution, Dirty Laundry further reinforces the concrete attributes of white labor and abstract qualities of Chinese labor. In the video’s dramatization of sections of the 1885 Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration , we see how concrete white labor is associated with a normativity defined by temporal discipline that sets the parameters of work, leisure, and reproduction. At the same time, Chinese exclusion from normative temporalities of domestic life become manifestations of the destructive attributes of abstract labor. Personifying the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality, the Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration casts Chinese men as a destructive, perverse force that threatens the social order. As historian Dora Nipp, one of the video’s interviewees, explains, the railroad became a historical marker that separated abstract Chinese labor from perverse labor: “Initially when Chinese labor was needed for the labor, nothing bad was said about them. Once their labor was no longer welcome, then you hear about vices; you hear about prostitution, leprosy, all kinds of illnesses. . . . [Writers] dwelled on the exotic, the exaggerated, the evil.” The range of racial, gender, and sexual substitutions that Fung’s video explores offers a different view of the perversity that becomes associated with the abstract qualities of Chinese labor. Substitution, as repetition with a difference, becomes a visual theme that anchors the video’s fictional, archival, and documentary fragments. In particular, the visual refrain that interposes the entire video begins with a Chinese couple: the woman sitting behind her husband braiding his queue before he departs for Canada. The audio that accompanies the scene is of a woman’s voice that asks, “Who will braid your hair? Who will cook your rice? Who will wash your clothes? Who will warm your bed?” This scene undergoes multiple substitutions throughout the course of the video, establishing a core thematic refrain that frames the video’s other substitutions. In the first metamorphosis, the wife is replaced by a man, and it is a male voice that asks the series of questions that ends with “Who will warm your bed?” And when we fast-forward to the video’s conclusion, the scene depicts a contemporary lesbian couple without audio to accompany the scene. In light of the fungibility of abstract labor, one significance of these substitutions is that they redefine substitution not as interchangeability but as repetition with difference. Rather than the undifferentiated assemblage of muscles and nerves that constitute abstract labor—what Marx describes as “human labour-power in its fluid state” 76 —these substitutions highlight gender and sexual difference. Further, that the scene’s visual refrain occurs in an intimate domestic space where one lover is braiding the other’s hair reinforces the affective dimensions of abstract labor. The repetition of this scene of domesticity counteracts the perverse domesticity to which Chinese labor is consigned. Moreover, working against the fetishism that misrepresents the dual character of commodity-determined labor, one that constitutes a social universe characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions, the substitutions keep the viewer alert to the normative cues and expectations that buffer and conceal the truth of social relations. As I explore below, Fung’s substitutions present an allegory of racial fetishism that emerges around abstract alien labor. Employing different forms of substitution that emphasize the defensive attributes of whiteness, Fung’s video makes explicit connections between abstract labor and vice by drawing from the Royal Commission Report on Chinese Immigration . This was a report compiled in 1884 to study “objections to the influx of the Chinese People into Canada,” which, as Fung’s video notes, “leads to a Head Tax in 1885, the year the Canadian Pacific Railway is completed and Chinese labor is no longer needed.” The study’s primary methodology is to examine the Chinese restrictions in place in sister settler colonies, the United States and Australia, gathering “evidence” in Queensland and San Francisco by interviewing diverse classes of white male “witnesses” to testify on the subject of Chinese immigration. Among the array of subjects, Fung focuses on testimony that addresses Chinese labor and “sodomy,” a subject heading that appears in the actual report. Unlike the forms of substitution in Kingston’s China Men that align Chinese labor with the technological speed-up of abstract labor, Fung’s video uses substitution ironically to examine the fungibility of whiteness. It is from the position of generic whiteness that negative, perverse content is cast onto the Chinese embodiment of abstract labor. FIGURE 1.2 Miner (video still). From Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes by Richard Fung. Courtesy of the artist. A scene depicting a white miner’s metamorphosis into a senator dramatizes the class convergence of whiteness, which Francis describes as a performance of “authorial transvestism,” observing how the “the senator’s ventriloquism (transgressing the boundaries of class) functions in the interests of white racial dominance.” 77 The white miner (figure 1.2 ), clad in a dusty work shirt and suspenders, begins the monologue discussing his heteronormative duties and domestic comforts, which become grounds for him to question the moral citizenship of Chinese men. He explains that in terms of labor, all is equivalent, but the costs of reproducing their respective labors puts the white miner at a distinct disadvantage. By the conclusion of his speech, the white miner has undergone metamorphosis into Senator Jones of Nevada, dressed in a black suit and bowtie (figure 1.3 ). The content of the testimony reveals the immorality and degraded nature of abstract labor when transposed to the temporal sanctity of the domestic realm: FIGURE 1.3 Senator (video still). From Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes by Richard Fung. Courtesy of the artist. I have hopes to bring up my daughters to be good wives and faithful mothers, and offer my son better opportunities than I had myself. I cheerfully contribute to the support of schools, churches, charitable institutions, and other objects that enter into our daily life. But after I’ve maintained my family and performed these duties, not much is left of my wages when the week is ended. How is it with the Chinese? The Chinaman can do as much work underground as I can. He has no wife and family. He performs none of these duties. Forty or fifty of his kind can live in a house no larger than mine. He craves no variety of food. He has inherited no taste for comfort or for social enjoyment. Conditions that satisfy him and make him contented would make my life not worth living. The white miner and senator align the Chinese body exclusively with a homogenized labor disposition. A Chinese body does not have the capacity for domestic enjoyment, community engagement, or social reproduction, which threatens the temporal stability of “socially necessary labor time.” He continues to exaggerate the subhuman conditions of Chinese existence by commenting on the cramped living conditions, lack of enjoyable food, and lack of social taste, conditions that “would make my life not worth living.” It is precisely the deprivations of Chinese domesticity and civic life that render Chinese labor nonhuman and therefore unfair competition. When the miner transforms into Senator Jones of Nevada, the politician’s more confident voice and political status lend further legitimacy to the miner’s complaint. Adding an air of authority to the miner’s lamentations, Senator Jones makes a strong appeal against the Chinese: “The Chinaman comes in taking advantage of our skill, of our toil, and of our struggles, driving us from fields of industry which we have created and which our race alone can create.” Conveying the unity of whiteness through the substitution of the senator for the miner, their casting of Chinese men as a destructive labor form emphasizes the parasitic effects of abstract labor on a concrete white labor host. What is also significant in the testimony is the senator’s clear glorification of industrialization—the “fields of industry we have created and which our race alone can create”—emphasizes the concrete value of white labor’s “skill . . . toil . . . struggles.” This view of the white industrial laborer becomes the romantic anticapitalist counterpoint to the abstract status of Chinese labor who has no social value except to “take advantage.” Both the miner and the senator thus attribute a destructive power to the Chinese, one that is constituted by his nonsocial, parasitic, and abstract qualities. Fung’s subsequent dramatizations of testimony from the Royal Commission report incorporate experimental forms of bodily and textual substitution that emphasize processes of signification and resignification. As Roger thumbs through the section on sodomy, the testimonies of a detective, a San Francisco merchant, and a former resident of China come to life to reinforce the perversity attached to Chinese bodies, whose temporal otherness is constituted through figurative alignment with labor duration and social nonreproduction. Their testimony on sodomy is presented in a continuous sequence: Detective C. C. Cox: Cases of the most revolting crime came before them, for instance of which all details could if necessary be supplied with that of a man who cut out the penis of another who refused to submit to his degrading desires. San Francisco Merchant Thomas H. King: Sodomy is a habit. Sometimes thirty or forty boys leaving Hong Kong in apparently good health before arriving here will be found to be afflicted about the anus with venereal diseases. And on questioning the Chinese doctors, they admitted that it was a common practice among them. Six Years Resident of China John T. Tobin: I’ve never seen sodomy committed between men and men but I have seen it with beasts and detected them in the act with hogs, dogs, and ducks. But not in a great number of cases. The cumulative effect of these testimonies is to attach bestial perversity to the disembodied form of the Chinese male body. No longer simply the socially abstract and destructive figure that the miner and senator argue “takes advantage” of hardworking, civic-minded white men of industry, perversity becomes the manifest social attribute of the abstract power of the Chinese laborer, a perversity that John T. Tobin links to animals. As queer countermemory, the video offers a parody of this “revolting” trajectory of Chinese disembodiment that coalesces around a severed penis, an infected anus, and—more humorously—a duck’s rear accompanied by an audible “quack.” A later scene depicting a doctor’s defense of Chinese sexual morality captures the relation of substitution as signification at stake in the Royal Commission testimonies. The scene opens to Roger, who appears in the role of a nineteenth-century Chinese laborer. He is bare-chested and moves slowly into a darkened room. As he moves across the screen, the text of the Royal Commission is projected onto his body, while the edge of the screen is illuminated to showcase the testimony of Mr. E. Stevenson, MD , of Victoria, British Columbia. As Mr. Stevenson speaks, his words are projected onto Roger’s body. Mr. Stevenson offers an impassioned defense of the Chinese on the subject of their sexual morality: Gentlemen, you have heard several witnesses testify unfavorably on this Chinese question and they have said they infer so-and-so. And from the fact that so many Chinese males are here and so few Chinese females, it has been inferred by certain people that, I hesitate to say it, that sodomy was by them practiced. I stamp it a damnable slander. A man who so acts bears the mark of Cain not only on his forehead but all over him. The visual effect of character substitution, of redeploying Roger into the role of Chinese laborer, is to clarify Roger’s contemporary relationship to the past, to his sexually ambiguous great-grandfather who worked on the CPR , and to the nation’s history of sexuality. Substitution thus becomes a supplementary modality for Roger’s countermemorial connection to history and sexual identity—bringing forth Derrida’s notion of supplementarity as something that both replaces and adds to. On one level, Stevenson’s testimony defends the honor of the Chinese and draws not on myth but on the demographic realities of the tremendous disparity in the population ratio of Chinese men to Chinese women, which fostered the development of segregated “bachelor” communities in North America. However, on another level, Stevenson’s testimony remains tied to the earlier white witnesses’ condemnation of Chinese perversity in asserting his symbolic power over the sign of race. Whether for or against Chinese immigration, the Chinese body remains an abstract object onto which racial and sexual discourse are literally and figuratively projected. The pages from the Royal Commission report that are projected onto Roger’s body become the textual representation of the Chinese body. He becomes an abstract screen for the projection of textual content. Moreover, Stevenson’s reference to the mark of Cain adds another layer of irony to the system of signification. When he notes how the mark of Cain appears “not only on his forehead but all over him,” Stevenson amplifies the racial meaning of the mark, connecting sexual perversion to racial embodiment. As he speaks, Roger’s body moves slowly out of the darkness; he pauses to highlight Stevenson’s words “mark of . . . ,” which remain projected on his chest until the words disappear as he exits into partial lightness toward Stevenson (figure 1.4 ). As Roger’s character comes face to face with Stevenson, it becomes clear that Stevenson himself is a holographic projection, underscoring their divergent temporalities. He falls short of reaching Stevenson before becoming shrouded again by dark shadows. The ambiguity surrounding Roger’s disappearance back into darkness is such that it is unclear whether the darkness that envelops his body is itself the “mark of Cain” or is, instead, a form of representative absence—a moment of unsignification. In either case, as the personification of abstract labor, the sexualization of the Chinese racial body is the discursively constituted and ideological effect of the disciplinary apparatus of an intensifying capitalist temporality. Moreover, rather than sanitize the “dirty laundry” of Chinese labor, Fung undercuts the heteronormative recuperation of Chinese sexual otherness by highlighting instead the discursive constitution of racialized sexual perversion and its ideological effects. Fung is careful to contextualize the range of substitutions and modes of signification that emerge from these testimonies in a broader international context. Interspersed throughout the Royal Commission testimonies are frames of onscreen text. One indicates that “in 1885, the year Canada institutes the Head Tax, Britain criminalizes all sexual activity between men as ‘gross indecency.’” Several frames later, additional onscreen text reads, “In Germany in 1892, the word homosexuality is first used in public,” which is quickly followed by “Heterosexuality is coined later.” By presenting a larger international frame for the projection of perversity onto the Chinese in Canada, Fung highlights the historical intersection of industrial capitalism and the desire to sexualize labor difference. What the video suggests is that the Royal Commission report represents less a narrative of testimony than a genealogy of settler crisis that turns on shifting social relations brought on by the new temporalities of industrial capitalism.

Queer Temporalities of History 2 In contrast to the jubilant embodiment and incorporation contained in the white settler mythology of the transcontinental railway, China Men and Dirty Laundry incorporate temporal symbols of disembodied abstraction and social exclusion. In particular, the temporality of linear progress associated with railroad technology is suspended, fractured, and defamiliarized. These texts “see” and “feel” time, as Ah Goong proclaims. But though they exemplify the dehumanizing forces of capitalism’s abstraction of labor time, Kingston’s and Fung’s texts nevertheless reject the disciplinary temporality of normative kinship, linear progress, and reproduction. If “time is a body,” their bodies gesture to a temporal embodiment whose relations and modes of belonging unfold as History 2. As Chakrabarty states, “In the reproduction of its own life-process, capital encounters relationships that present it with double possibilities. . . . History 2’s are thus not pasts separate from capital; they are pasts that inhere in capital and yet interrupt and punctuate the run of capital’s own logic.” 78 Imagining relations that do not contribute to capital’s self-reproduction, Kingston and Fung present the queer temporalities of History 2. For Ah Goong, the embodiment of a queer temporality is anchored by maternal longing and matrilineality. In his repeated, self-directed questioning of the meaning or purpose of a man’s life, the literal and symbolic value of his penis leads him to gender resignification. During the Chinese railroad strike, Ah Goong wanders the forests pondering the value of masculinity symbolized by his penis: he “just looked at it, wondering what it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 79 Within the evolution of his gender resignification, Ah Goong questions not only the norms associated with masculine power but also the symbolic burdens he’s forced to contend with. His thoughts turn to the “rumor of an Injun woman called Woman Chief, who led a nomadic fighting tribe from the eastern plains as far as these mountains. She was so powerful that she had four wives and many horses.” 80 The juxtaposition of these seemingly unrelated reflections present to Ah Goong the quandary of settler colonialism. While Ah Goong never sees Woman Chief, the rumor of her existence displaces the gender, sexual, and spatial norms he associates with masculinity. Instead of expressing paternalistic control over a virginal, “empty” landscape, the Woman Chief’s defense of her land becomes an embodiment of matrilineal power. Having experienced the disembodied passages of alien labor time, Ah Goong’s disillusionment leads him to express a distinctly maternal and matrilineal reproductive desire that reverses the normative paternalism and reproductive logic of white settler colonialism. During the “driving out” of Chinese labor after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire conveys itself through an actively resignified gender lens. As he passes a farm, he finds an “imp child”; he stops and the baby crawls into his lap. He tells the child, “I wish you were my baby. . . . ‘My daughter,’ he said. ‘My son.’ He couldn’t tell whether it was a boy or a girl.” 81 Here Ah Goong’s reproductive desire follows a matrilineal arc because it operates outside the norms of blood lineage and paternal inheritance in which strict gender codes are embedded. Not knowing whether the child is a boy or a girl, Ah Goong displaces gender codes altogether. The disembodying temporality of railroad labor here productively disorients the iterative temporality on which gender construction relies. Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire comes into fullest relief after his return to China, when he attempts to substitute the fourth of his four sons with an unwanted baby girl born to neighbors down the road. Disappointed that he has only sons and jealous of his neighbors’ daughter, Ah Goong is considered insane, a “man who did not know the value of what he had” 82 with four sons. After secretly trading his son for the daughter, he feels that “with his soul he adopted her, full diaper and all.” 83 Later, when he is forced to return the girl, “Ah Goong clung to his baby as if she were holding him up.” 84 Without hope of realizing his reproductive desires, he rejects all sense of masculine propriety. It is this reproductive failure that causes him to begin “taking his penis out at the dinner table, worrying it, wondering at it, asking why it had given him four sons and no daughter, chastising it, asking it whether it were yet capable of producing the daughter of his dreams.” 85 He becomes a figure of parodic masculinity, whose frequent exhibitionism—“yank[ing] open that greatcoat—no pants” 86 —underscores the phallic unfulfillment of normative paternalistic kinship. But Ah Goong’s story doesn’t end with the pessimism of alien temporality; rather, it emphasizes its continual deferral of linear time. After his return to China, he embarks yet again for Gold Mountain and arrives in San Francisco. But here the linear trajectory of his narrative unravels, divorcing space from temporality. Kingston offers multiple narrative possibilities. In the first, Ah Goong is in an underground arsenal under Chinatown, “inside the earth,” 87 and is presumed to have died during the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906: “Some say he died falling into the cracking earth.” 88 In another version he is brought back to China because “he was not making money; he was a homeless wanderer, a shiftless, dirty, jobless man with matted hair, ragged clothes, and fleas all over his body. He ate out of garbage cans. He was a louse eaten by lice. A fleaman.” 89 The narrator offers a final possibility: “Maybe he hadn’t died in San Francisco, it was just his papers that burned.” 90 In this version he emerges from the “miraculous earthquake and fire,” 91 which burned down the Hall of Records so that “every China Man was reborn out of that fire a citizen.” 92 Ah Goong’s rebirth is accompanied by another birth: “He had been seen carrying a child out of the fire, a child of his own in spite of the laws against marrying.” 93 Each of these versions capture elements of Ah Goong’s temporal and spatial estrangement as an undisciplined subject of capitalist social relations: living underground, as a “homeless wanderer,” and finally as a father. This reorganization of time, space, and identity is further accentuated by the earthquake, a crisis event that will interfere with the discursive constitution of Chinese bodies as “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” In the final version, where Ah Goong emerges phoenixlike from the fire, he becomes an agent of resignification. As Eng notes, “Like the elimination of a single term in a sign chain, the burning of the Hall of Records—the literal destruction of these particular documents—demands a subsequent shift in meaning, a shift in the relational terms that attempt to shore up the historical ruins of the archive.” 94 The narrator surmises, “He had built a railroad out of sweat, why not have an American child out of longing?” 95 However, the fulfillment of his “longing” for kinship does not reproduce the temporal discipline of heteronormative reproduction; rather, it expresses a mode of belonging that symbolically fulfills his matrilineal desire. Ah Goong occupies a queer temporality in which alien survival and reproduction arise outside of the temporal discipline of settler capitalism. Countering the symbolic role of the child to reproduce normative logics and values of white life, what Lee Edelman refers to as the “absolute value of reproductive futurism,” Ah Goong’s “child out of longing” represents the potentiality of matrilineal desire and, against settler biopower, expresses an alien mode of survival. In the aftermath of the earthquake and fire, many of those kin relations will be impurely, discursively constituted as “paper sons.” As such, the alien child does not represent the guaranteed futurity of white settler colonialism but a potential deferral of patrilineal reproduction while promoting the fictive, queer kinship of alien longing as one temporality of History 2. The politics of embodiment are thus expressed in China Men through Ah Goong’s gender resignification, which rejects the paternalistic codes of setter territorialization and temporal discipline. At the same time, by foregrounding a matrilineal identity that values daughters and empowers women, Ah Goong expresses various desires that intersect with transgender embodiment. Expressing gender and sexual difference as modes of embodiment, he interrupts the stability of gender and its assumed correspondence to biological sex. As an articulation of transgender identifications, Ah Goong disrupts what Susan Stryker identifies as the presumed “‘wholeness’ of the body and ‘sameness’ of its sex . . . [as] socially constructed.” 96 Desiring a daughter, “fucking the world,” and berating his penis, Ah Goong confounds the equivalence of sex and gender, highlighting instead how “‘sex’ is a mash-up, a story we mix about how the body means, which parts matter most, and how they register in our consciousness or field of vision.” 97 In the context of nineteenth-century labor, Ah Goong’s transgender expression is significant in its disidentification with a notion of equivalence. In other words, his identity is not an expression of an abstract equivalence that can be substituted under the homogenizing process of labor under capitalism, where equality is an enforced condition of alienation. 98 Indeed, as David Harvey puts it: “There is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals; how the equality presupposed in the market exchange of things deludes us into a belief in the equality of persons.” 99 In Ah Goong’s performance of gender and sexual difference, he attaches the logic of equivalence that abstracts labor into homogeneous temporal units of human labor to a profoundly masculine logic. Moreover, in his rejection of the terms of equivalence that counteract the reproduction of capitalist logic, he embodies the potential of History 2. In Dirty Laundry the themes of embodiment, retrieval, and difference are captured in the idea of “family resemblance” that becomes part of the narrative frame for the video’s historical and fictional sections. The fictional travelogue centered on Roger brings together ideas of queer temporality in order to reanimate and embody Chinese Canadian history. What’s at stake in this history is presented as a mystery surrounding the sexual identity of his great-grandfather, whose framed picture Roger’s father has insisted he take along with him on his business trip. When he accidentally breaks the frame to reveal a hidden photographic portrait of his grandfather touching hands with another man, he is unsure how to interpret the photograph. The broken picture frame becomes a visual metaphor for what Lowe calls an “alternative mode of inquiry” that allows us to move beyond “the singular history that frames a particular image of Chinese immigrant labour . . . that memorializes the static, single artifact.” 100 But in the context of figurative and thematic substitutions that the video foregrounds, the hidden photograph presents a queer opening that works against the fetish to reveal rather than conceal the features of an alien labor temporality. The analysis of the mysterious photograph expands rather than contracts the range of historical possibilities that relate to Chinese sexuality and assumed perversion. Although Roger admits to the train steward that he doesn’t “know how to read” the revealed photograph, the Chinese steward responds, “This is normal in China. . . . Men hold hands.” As Francis observes, the steward’s reply raises the “question of how the ‘normal’ is constituted in different cultural contexts and historical eras.” 101 After they have sex, Roger asks the steward, “You know what you were saying about men holding hands. What does it mean?” The steward replies, “That they like each other, they’re brothers. . . . It’s a smart thing. If they’re lovers, no one asks any questions.” This “smart thing” is the illegibility of queer historiography. The video does not impose a teleology of queer becoming. In many ways, the linear direction of identity formation in the traditional bildungsroman is frustrated here. It is the unresolved, illegible queer history that animates Roger’s quest to engage in genealogy. The ambiguity of the great-grandfather’s sexuality is what is given ontological priority in the video as an expression of pre-Stonewall conceptions of sexual difference. As Nayan Shah underscores in one of the video’s interviews, “The whole notion that sexual identity is your identity, that somehow who you desire and who you sleep with and who you have sexual pleasures with somehow says something very revealing about you, is a completely new notion.” Just as Ah Goong’s gender resignification takes on a “perverse” relation to masculinist norms, the ambiguity of Roger’s great-grandfather’s sexual identity frustrates the growing “incitement to speak” that Foucault attributes to the rise of liberal individualism in the late nineteenth century. The point is, his great-grandfather’s sexual ambiguity, its deferral of concrete meaning, stands as the content of his difference. Here again, the emphasis on sexual difference frustrates a logic of equivalence that capitalism abstracts out of human labor. In the video’s final frame, the photograph comes to life as the great-grandfather and friend/lover walk out of the frame, away from the photographer’s studio backdrop. That the photographic subjects are roles played by Roger and the steward creates a correspondence between historical and contemporary notions of same-sex affiliation without collapsing contemporary sexual identities with what Francis describes as the “homosocial ambiguities of history.” 102 Rather, the substitution of Roger and the steward for their historical predecessors highlights the role of sexuality for reanimating abstract conceptions of labor and history. In its focus on family genealogy, the video offers a narrative of literal and figurative family resemblances that traces alternative modes of affiliation and belonging that do not reproduce capitalism’s disciplinary temporalities. As countermemory, Dirty Laundry rejects the iconicity of both the lonely Chinese bachelor and the sexually perverse Chinese body and replaces them with an empty stage that frustrates the reproductive, linear trajectory of History 1. My argument in this chapter has focused on the way Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate how the fusion of temporal otherness and sexual vice converge into a biological expression of abstract alien labor. Their experimental forms offer a new context for understanding why the first immigration laws in Canada and the United States were passed in the aftermath of railroad construction to prevent the infiltration and proliferation of abstract alien labor. Although a comparatively smaller population, the fact that Chinese students, diplomats, and merchants were exempted from immigration restriction laws in the United States and Canada exemplifies the way perversity was identified with the particular features of industrial labor within a capitalist mode of production. I have situated Kingston’s and Fung’s texts as responses to the celebrated temporality of the telegram that began this chapter that exposes the censored content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese laborer. This is the literal and figurative backside of the normative settler temporality celebrated on the face of the telegram. Against the homogenizing logic of racial equivalence, Kingston and Fung present queer recuperations of the “perverse” temporalities of alien labor within the consolidating logic of settler colonial capitalism. In their countermemories of the history of settler national unification by rail, their texts expose the logics of racialized alignment between alien bodies and abstract labor. Exploring queer temporalities of History 2, they counteract the logics of substitution as equivalence that reproduce a capitalist labor temporality of expanding the working day and speed-up. In the next chapter, I turn to the other side of the antinomical view of capitalist relations: romantic anticapitalism’s hypostatizing of the concrete, natural, thingly side of the antinomy. Drawing on the 1920s and 1930s as the apex of anti-Asian animosity and exclusionary immigration policy in both Canada and the United States, I explore the development of romantic anticapitalism, which expresses its racial animus toward the abstract Asian alien through an identification with the natural landscape and Indigeneity. Within a capitalist logic of settler colonialism, the Native and the land become biologized expressions of the concrete dimension of the social world.",

      "content": "CHAPTER 2 UNNATURAL LANDSCAPES Romantic Anticapitalism and Alien Degeneracy [Landscape] is like money: good for nothing in itself, but expressive of a potentially limitless reserve of value. —W. J. T. Mitchell, “Imperial Landscape” Undoing Landscape I begin this chapter with an unnatural scene: an old photograph of a tree surrounded by a crowd of onlookers (figure 2.1 ). It is nighttime. White men under gleaming hats stand with their hands in their pockets. On the left appear the blurred faces of a couple, walking arm in arm toward the camera. They are dressed as if they are on a date at the movies. Some of the bystanders look ahead, away from the camera, while others look back, impervious to the glare of the flash. There seems to be nothing aesthetically remarkable about the tree in the background except its sturdiness, emphasized by its proportional dominance, and its three solid branches jutting out like tines on a pitchfork. It turns out that the photograph is lying. What we do not see is that the occasion for the social gathering is the body of a lynched man who hangs from one of the tree’s branches. The photograph belongs to a series by artist Ken Gonzales-Day entitled Erased Lynching , in which he digitally removes the victim from the lynching scene. These are scenes that were captured and circulated on postcards in western states from 1850 to the 1930s, and most of the victims were not black. As Gonzales-Day explains, “Native Americans, Chinese, and Latinos of Mexican and Latin American descent were lynched in California . . . guided by anti-immigration sentiments, the fear of miscegenation, a deep frustration with the judicial system, or in combination with white supremacy.” 1 The vast majority of lynching victims he uncovered were of Latino descent. FIGURE 2.1 Ken Gonzales-Day, Erased Lynching , 2006. Courtesy of the artist. Gonzales-Day’s manipulation of lynching scenes is remarkable for the way it produces visibility out of erasure, inverting the power of the visual field. By shifting the spectacular nature of the lynched body onto the spectators, Erased Lynching moves the viewer’s attention to the visuality of lynching itself. Not only does it draw our attention to the expressions of the spectators, but we are also confronted by the cultural apparatus and circulation of lynching images, what Gonzales-Day refers to as the “aesthetics of the event, from the physical act to the creation of the lynching photograph and its progeny, the souvenir card, view card, and postcard.” 2 It also draws our attention back to the tree, whose former innocence is replaced by purposeful attributes of branch height and species—primarily native oak species 3 —that facilitated the mechanics of lynching. In addition, the large, life-size scale of Gonzales-Day’s photographic rendering serves to insert the contemporary viewer into the lynching scene, implicating us as consumers of the spectacle of racial violence and participants in their circulation. For the purposes of this chapter, Gonzales-Day’s photograph is significant not only for the way it counteracts the spectacle of the lynched racial body, but also for how it reverses the normative power we associate with landscape. The anchoring tree, as the primary subject of the viewing public, is stripped of the romanticism we attach to “scenery.” As a photograph rather than a painting, it communicates less the spiritual aesthetic of landscape than what Gonzales-Day describes as an artifact that “remains trapped somewhere between memento and evidence.” 4 In its inversion of the visual content of the image—rendering the white spectators, rather than the lynched body, as racial spectacle—Gonzales-Day exposes the power of perspective and subjective identification, elements that are intrinsic to the aesthetic technology of landscape. In manipulating viewers’ capacity to identify with the scene, Erased Lynching activates the notion of landscape as a medium rather than strictly a genre of art. This follows W. J. T. Mitchell’s insistence that we examine “not just what landscape ‘is’ or ‘means’ but what it does , how it works as a cultural practice.” 5 In this case, the landscape functions as both a witness and accomplice to racial violence. Following the last chapter’s focus on the racialization of Chinese workers as abstract labor, an economism that aligned Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism, this chapter probes how settler colonial constructions of the landscape express the other side of the antinomy: the concrete, thingly, natural dimension Postone describes as that which “appears as the variegated surface of immediate sensuous experience.” 6 While Asian labor personifies the abstract circuits of capitalism, settler colonial constructions of landscape express the opposite: the concrete, pure, and authentic noncapitalist dimension of nature. That the social world appears antinomical—that is, characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions—is a function of the fetish, which conceals the social relations behind products of human labor, repressing the duality of commodity-determined labor. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminated in the last chapter, Chinese labor was associated with a perverse temporality, one that rendered Chinese bodies fungible (like currency) and a signifier of moral corruption. As such, Chinese bodies occupied the abstract dimension of the antinomy, as subjects “abstracted from all particularity” 7 insofar as Chinese bodies are interchangeable with other Chinese bodies. White labor, on the other hand, was individual, tangible, concrete, and of social value. Postone describes this structure of social relations as a “quasi-natural opposition” of two objective worlds: “The relation of these two worlds of objectivity can then be construed as that of essence and appearance, or as that of an opposition (as has been expressed historically, for example, in the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought).” 8 Postone’s emphasis on the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought is particularly germane for our consideration of landscape, which is associated with both western romanticism and an imperialist aesthetic. As Mitchell observes, the Chinese antecedents of western landscape “flourished most notably at the height of Chinese imperial power and began to decline in the eighteenth century as China itself became an object of English fascination and appropriation at the moment England was beginning to experience itself as an imperial power.” 9 From this view, landscape can be seen to function as a fetish itself, “symptom[atic] of the rise and development of capitalism; the ‘harmony’ sought in landscape [can be] read as a compensation for and screening off of the actual violence perpetrated there.” 10 It is precisely because landscape appears real, natural, and thingly, rather than a way of seeing and a culturally mediated representation of nature, that it seems antithetical to the very circuits of capitalism and imperialism that Mitchell identifies with it. Here, as Postone clarifies, “the opposition of its abstract and concrete dimensions allows capitalism to be perceived and understood in terms of its abstract dimension alone; its concrete dimension can thereby be apprehended as noncapitalist.” 11 In other words, capitalism is understood in terms of its abstract dimension, noncapitalism (and anticapitalism) with its concrete dimension. Thus, building on the last chapter’s examination of settler exclusion of abstract alien labor because of its “perverse” alignment with capital, this chapter examines the settler identification with the western landscape and idealization of Native peoples as a further expression of the romantic anticapitalism of anti-Asian sentiment and the indigenizing project of settler colonialism. We will see how settler colonialism constructs a landscape that is simultaneously a site of Native erasure and a site of indigenizing purity and authenticity. In order to excavate the racial logics of landscape in a manner that foregrounds, as Gonzales-Day’s photograph does, the interplay of racial violence, settler identification, and landscape, I look to the landscape photography of Vancouver-based artist Jin-me Yoon and the late New York–based photographer Tseng Kwong Chi. As photographic countermemory, their re-envisioning of western landscapes in Canada and the United States identifies romantic anticapitalism as a key ideology of settler colonialism. Their respective photographs of Mount Rushmore, the Canadian Rockies, and the Pacific coast parody the conventions of landscape art of the 1920s and 1930s that were established by artists such as Ansel Adams, Gutzon Borglum, the Canadian Group of Seven, and Emily Carr. In doing so, Tseng and Yoon expose how romantic anticapitalism flourished during the height of anti-Asian immigration restriction to project a settler identification with a personified, Indigenous landscape. The way early twentieth-century artists anchored white settler identity in the landscape reflects contradictory identifications with the “Native” that effectively erased the history of conquest and dispossession while expressing nostalgia for a time before capitalist modernity. This romantic idealization of nature and the “noble savage” captures the settler valorization of the concrete realm of social relations under capitalism, particularly under conditions of rapid industrialization and economic flux leading up to and following the stock market crash of 1929. Within the romantic anticapitalist logics of settler colonialism, the valorization of the concrete over the abstract realms misconstrues the appearance of capitalist relations for their reality. As Neil Levi puts it, “Romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations.” 12 In this chapter I look at the way works by Tseng and Yoon emphasize how the eugenicism embedded in an expanding conception of whiteness increasingly appropriates Indigeneity as a mode of biologizing the landscape. I situate Tseng’s and Yoon’s parodic strategies of countermemory within the theoretical framework of disidentification articulated by José Esteban Muñoz. For Muñoz, disidentification works alternatively as an artistic process, a mode of performance, and a critical hermeneutic. It is a mode of “shuffling back and forth between reception and production.” 13 By highlighting disidentification as a frame for Tseng’s and Yoon’s artistic process and performance, I read their engagement with landscape neither as assimilative identification nor as a wholesale rejection of it. Neither is it, as Muñoz clarifies, an “apolitical middle ground.” 14 Rather, disidentification operates as a third mode of dealing with dominant ideology that emerges from the recognition that the subject is constituted inside ideology—that there is no privileged position outside ideology from which the subject can oppose its own formation—and that resistance can occur through “negotiations between desire, identification, and ideology.” 15 Disidentification, therefore, is about “recycling or reforming an object that has already been invested with powerful energy.” 16 Tseng’s and Yoon’s projections of their alien excess against a landscape of normative racial, cultural, and aesthetic values captures the political potential that Judith Butler further ascribes to the disidentificatory encounter, “this uneasy sense of standing under a sign to which one does and does not belong.” 17 By analyzing their engagement with the cultural values it activates, I propose that Tseng’s Expeditionary Series and Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven enact modes of parody that both recycle the dominant codes associated with the landscape and transform them with their racial excess. Their encounters perform a repetition with a racial difference. As British settler nations whose colonial objective was primarily land appropriation rather than the exploitation of Indigenous labor, 18 national identity in Canada and the United States has often been defined as a product of the landscape. As Angela Miller explains of the US context, the nineteenth-century landscape encapsulated “the nationalist myth—that the physical environment itself produced national character.” 19 Similarly, in the early twentieth century in Canada, as Erin Manning suggests, the “quest for national identity [was sought] through the image of the landscape . . . where the unity of states and citizens [was] constructed on the putative ethnic or racial identity of a nation, which, in turn, is anchored to the representation of landscape.” 20 As a vital source for the expression of national identity in both nations, the continuing appeal of landscape art into the early twentieth century was often coupled with disdain for the rise of modernism. In a revealing glimpse of such antimodernist sentiment, when the Group of Seven traveled to New York State in 1913, it was not to attend the influential exhibition of international modern art at the Armory Show but to attend an exhibition of traditional Scandinavian art. 21 Within the diverse media that form the landscapes by Adams, Borglum, the Group of Seven, and Carr, none ironize or subvert—as modernist art often does—nationalist subject matter or the hierarchy of high and popular cultural forms. Instead, their works contain a romantic reverence for and spiritual identification to land as a symbolic anchor for their aestheticized “defense” of national identity. Uncovering the eugenic and Indigenizing subtexts of romantic anticapitalism that are embedded in the settler landscape, I turn first to Tseng’s Expeditionary Series to explore its citations to US photographer Ansel Adams, the Group of Seven, and Mount Rushmore sculptor and architect Gutzon Borglum. I demonstrate how his photographs prompt a recognition of landscape as both a biopolitical expression of white supremacy and a personification of white male dominion. Such a personification of the land is precisely a form of what Postone refers to as the biologization of the concrete that constitutes “expressions of that antinomic fetish, which gives rise to the notion that the concrete is ‘natural,’ and which increasingly presents the socially ‘natural’ in such a way that it is perceived in biological terms.” 22 The final section of this chapter turns to Yoon’s photographic collage Group of Sixty-Seven , whose title makes reference both to the Group of Seven painters and to 1967, the year Canada removed racial barriers to immigration. This legislation was the Canadian corollary to the Hart-Celler Immigration Reform Act of 1965 in the United States, which similarly removed race-based immigration criteria. Building on Tseng’s parody of the eugenic whiteness of the landscape, Yoon’s project highlights the fusion of the Group of Seven’s eugenic ideology with Emily Carr’s own autochthonophilia and her intense desire to “go native.” 23 Thus, Group of Sixty-Seven exposes the eugenic ideology at the core of romantic anticapitalism and the contradictory logics of exclusion and elimination that condition the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions within settler colonialism in North America. Eugenic Landscapes In 1978 the artist Tseng Kwong Chi transformed himself from an invisible minority to a visible alien. His metamorphosis came about after an experience he had on a family lunch outing at a high-end New York restaurant. Respecting the restaurant’s dress code, Tseng arrived wearing the only suit he owned: a Chinese uniform he had purchased at a Montreal thrift store. To his amusement he was greeted by the restaurant’s staff and patrons as a Chinese Communist dignitary, much to the displeasure of his parents, who years earlier had escaped from Communist China. His sister, Muna Tseng, recalls the royal treatment her brother received at the restaurant, recounting, “When we arrived . . . the maître d’ took one look at [Tseng] and treated him like a V.I.P., a gentleman from the East, an emissary from Cathay. My parents were not amused.” 24 The attention he attracted at the restaurant nevertheless produced an artistic breakthrough that led Tseng to undergo a process of orientalization, beginning with his name, which went from Joseph Tseng to Tseng Kwong Chi. Completing his wardrobe with mirrored glasses and a clip-on “Slut for Art” ID badge, Tseng reinvented himself in the stereotypical role of the inscrutable and perpetually foreign Asian. It was an identity that his friend the choreographer Bill T. Jones described as “Chinese drag.” 25 Henceforth, in Chinese drag, he took to the streets of New York, gaining unparalleled access to exclusive social events, most famously in 1980 when he crashed the opening night of the Ch’ing dynasty costume exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum. There he mingled with the rich and famous, including Henry Kissinger, William F. Buckley Jr., and Yves Saint Laurent, who, as the art critic Grady Turner relates, “commended Tseng for his fluency in French and asked if he had served in the Chinese embassy in Paris.” 26 What Tseng realized during these experiences was the vastness of Westerners’ ignorance of Asians. Therefore, drawing on a persona that simultaneously evoked foreigner, visitor, tourist, alien, and imposter, he exploited that ignorance in his photographs, which offered surprising reconfigurations of clichéd tourist scenes in North America and around the world.

The Expeditionary Self-Portrait Series 1979–1989 . © Muna Tseng Dance Projects, Inc., New York. www.tsengkwongchi.com . In the diverse fields in which Tseng’s photographs have been analyzed, from performance studies to Asian American studies, the majority of critical attention has focused on the photographs from the earlier period of his East Meets West series, for their clever juxtaposition of caricatured foreignness and touristy familiarity of Western monuments and icons, such as the Statue of Liberty, Disneyland, and the Hollywood sign. Reflecting the historical moment, the series title aptly parodied the anticommunist sentiment being reignited in 1979, on the eve of the Reagan Revolution. What many critics found remarkable about his photographs, as Margo Machida explains, is that they “counter[ed] a long history of Orientalist painting and photography by explicitly re-representing the West as if seen through a possessive ‘Occidentalist’ gaze.” 27 In contrast to this reception, however, Tseng’s later photographs featured in the same series, renamed Expeditionary Series , have garnered less attention, perhaps because they appear attenuated from the overt culture clash staged in his earlier work. For instance, Tseng’s photographs of majestic US and Canadian landscapes, such as the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and the Rocky Mountains, have been described as offering more solitary explorations of the individual’s relation to nature, which his sister describes as “recalling Chinese landscape paintings of man balanced between sky and earth.” 28 Turner further marks the shift toward natural landscapes in Tseng’s series as evidence of a romantic turn in his oeuvre: [He] put aside the confrontational implications of the earlier title to concentrate on [his] own transformation from alien tourist to American explorer. . . . The Mao suit has become irrelevant. . . . He offers us brief glimpses of a Romantic figure, an artist who has put aside his disguise to revel in the sheer power of nature. 29 This chapter reconsiders this assessment by asking whether the concerns of the latter phase of his series are absent of “confrontational implications.” Rather than a romantic homage to nature’s sublimity, I interpret Tseng’s Expeditionary Series as a queer parody of the Western conventions associated with Canadian and American landscape art of the early twentieth century. Given that landscape art of this period was broadly concerned with honoring nature’s vitality and universalizing power, the intrusion of Tseng’s alien body is a sign not of life-affirming incorporation but of extravagant degeneration. Reading the managed interplay of life, degeneration, and death as a central feature of settler colonialism and projected onto nature, I argue that Tseng’s photographs animate the biopolitics of the settler landscape in Canada and the United States. In consideration of the vexed modalities of racial impersonation that Tseng’s work elicits in Chinese drag, Butler’s discussion of gender and drag performance is useful for highlighting the ambivalent agency of parodic recycling that surrounds his work. When Butler evaluates the subversive potential of drag to expose gender constructions through imitation, she locates gender transgression less in the volitional agency of the drag queen than with the drag performance itself: “[Drag] serves a subversive function to the extent that it reflects the mundane impersonations by which heterosexual ideal genders are performed and naturalized and undermines their power by effecting that exposure.” 30 In other words, drag allegorizes the imitative structure of gender, as a recycled copy that has no original. Butler’s theorization of gender and drag presents an opening for considering race through the terms of drag performance, without collapsing the distinctions between the processes of gendering and racialization—or disregarding their intersection. 31 In particular, both racialization and gendering are processes that are historically constituted through a racist and heterosexist system that reproduces itself through its iteration in bodies, institutions, and law. It is a system that both “precedes and exceeds” the intentions of the racialized and gendered subject. 32 In the case of Tseng’s photographs, although he taps into the symbolic construction of the Asian alien through his performance, Tseng does not invent or choose the terms of his own racialization. Thus, by engaging a disidentificatory hermeneutic, my reading of Tseng’s photographs harnesses the ambivalence of queer of color parody as an opportunity to further demystify and denaturalize what Muñoz calls the “universalizing ruse of dominant culture.” 33 At one level, this mode of reading registers Tseng’s deliberate efforts to choreograph the visual dissonance in the juxtaposition of two figurative constructions: the Chinese as alien and the settler nation as landscape. At another, my analysis also mines the unintentional gaps between parodic repetition and difference that magnify how, as a queer man of color in racial drag, he epitomizes what Chandan Reddy refers to as a “material nonequivalence” to the settler landscape as an alien abstraction against a concrete expression of nature. 34 It is in this spirit of disidentification that I draw on the way Tseng’s photographs evoke the conventions of landscape art produced in the 1920s by the Canadian Group of Seven painters, the American sculptor Gutzon Borglum, and the American photographer Ansel Adams. Comprising a significant portion of the 150 black-and-white photographs Tseng took from 1979 to 1989, the Expeditionary Series captures the variation and range of landscapes he photographed in North America and around the world. A Hong Kong–born Canadian immigrant who attended art school in Paris and lived his adult years in New York among a vibrant set of artists until his death from AIDS in 1990, 35 Tseng’s perception of the landscape in North America and elsewhere was undoubtedly informed by his transnational movements. Excavating the historical context surrounding his photographic references to North American landscapes of the 1920s, a generative period of landscape art in Canada and the United States, I focus on Tseng’s Seven Peaks Snowfield and Lake Moraine , both located in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, and Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. As “natural wonders” of the West, Banff National Park and Mount Rushmore are two sites firmly positioned in settler colonial mythologies of the North American landscape. Banff owes much of this popular mythology to the Group of Seven landscape painters who made Canada’s Western landscape a central subject of many of their paintings. In the United States this mythology is indebted to Gutzon Borglum, the architect behind the colossal sculpture of the four presidents’ faces at Mount Rushmore. With respect to the highly aestheticized quality of Tseng’s dramatic black-and-white photographs, they also recall the visually operatic Yosemite photographs of Ansel Adams. However, unlike Adams, Tseng disrupts the sublime tranquility of the natural landscape by inserting his caricatured body into the frame. Tseng engages with the mythic landscape as an artistic subject that was foundational for the legacy of the Group of Seven and Adams, as well as in terms of the way space and scale are crucial components of the visual impact of Mount Rushmore. Confronting the tangled strands of national history, artistic convention, and regenerative racial power that are projected onto these diverse landscapes, Tseng’s photographs capture what Mitchell calls the “dreamwork” of settler colonialism. 36 By putting his alien excess into racial tension with the landscape, Tseng’s parody of early twentieth-century landscape art brings to light a romantic idealization of nature that, in the context of North America, is infused with eugenic ideologies of white racial regeneration. Evolving out of social Darwinist theory, eugenics emerged in the late nineteenth century and grew in the early decades of the twentieth century with the support of both conservatives and progressives. As Daniel Kevles explains, “The progressives and the conservatives found common ground in attributing phenomena such as crime, slums, prostitution, and alcoholism primarily to biology and in believing that biology might be used to eliminate these discordances of modern, urban, industrial society.” 37 According to Kevles, racial thinking “played a major part in American and Canadian versions of this [eugenic] creed,” 38 based on fears raised from the influx of non–Anglo Saxon immigrants and the social degeneracy those groups were associated with. The 1920s and early 1930s represented the apex in the eugenics movement, with the passage of numerous eugenics sterilization laws—particularly in California, British Columbia, and Alberta—which inordinately targeted racial minorities and immigrants. 39 While the scientific justification for eugenics had waned slightly after World War I, eugenics nevertheless persisted in institutionalized forms. Knowledge of eugenics’ false claims did not, as Mary Coutts and Pat McCarrick explain, “decrease the pressure for legislation, judicial action, or immigration controls.” 40 Indeed, immigration restrictions directed at Chinese migrants to the United States and Canada coincided with the intensification of eugenic ideology from the nineteenth century into the twentieth. After passage of the 1875 Page Act, which effectively restricted the entry of Chinese women for their presumed sexual immorality, the United States passed its first race-based federal immigration restriction through the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was in effect from 1882 to 1943. In 1885 the Canadian government passed its own race-based immigration restriction through the Chinese Head Tax, a tax designed to deter Chinese migrants from entering Canada. By the mid-1920s, both Canada and the United States had intensified and expanded earlier restrictions on Chinese migrants. In Canada these measures extended restrictions to other Asian migrants and further deterred Chinese immigration through the passage of the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which excluded most classes of Chinese migrants until 1947. The United States, having also broadened restrictions to encompass other Asian migrants, passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which intensified previous race-based restrictions through its exclusion of most Asian ethnic groups and foreigners who were deemed “biologically inferior.” 41 The persistence and growth of anti-Asian policy from the 1880s to the 1940s reflects what Erika Lee refers to as the “hemispheric Orientalism” that took hold along the West Coast of North America. 42 Despite their nationalist pretensions, Canada and the United States were bound by a shared commitment to preserving the transnational power and normativity of whiteness. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds put it, the “project of whiteness was a paradoxical politics, at once transnational in its inspiration and identifications but nationalist in its method and goals.” 43 Fears over the degeneration of Anglo-Saxon stock were present in the art world as well. The Canadian Group of Seven painters reflected these anxieties over the diminishing strength of the white Nordic race in their painting, believing that the Canadian landscape held “replenishing power” that could disinfect what one member called a “low receptive reservoir into which pours the chaos of ages, the mixed concord and discord of many varied peoples.” 44 Employing tropes associated with hygiene and mental health, they put forward a mission to “clean this reservoir . . . or we will remain a confused people.” 45 In the US context, Deborah Bright draws out the anticapitalist basis of Ansel Adams’s romanticism, noting that his early twentieth-century photographs represented a “mixture of Progressive Era phobias about industrialization and encroaching alien populations with an equally conservative nostalgia for the myth of preindustrial organic society.” 46 Fears of white race suicide also informed Gutzon Borglum’s vision of Mount Rushmore, a colossal-scale sculptural project that he began in 1924 and did not live to see completed seventeen years later. Expressing his fears of miscegenation, he once wrote, “Here we have in the filtering of Asiatic and North African blood [into Europe] the complete vitiating of the vigor and intellect of the civilization existing in these once pure European peoples.” 47 Thus romantic, regenerative, and preservationist motifs were infused in North American landscape art of the period and reflected deep anxieties over the racial “health” of the industrializing settler nation. And despite the absence of human or nonwhite representation in many of these works, my analysis of these landscapes heeds Martin Berger’s assessment that in North American art since the nineteenth century, “a decidedly racialized perspective animated even those cultural products most removed from racial concerns.” 48 The hyperbolic orientalism of Tseng’s persona in the Expeditionary Series confronts these defensive logics embedded in the romanticized colonial landscape in ways that denaturalize the abstract, universalizing, and absorptive power of its conventions. As such, Tseng’s photographs tap into the historicism of parody, which Linda Hutcheon defines as “an inscription of the past in the present [that] embod[ies] and bring[s] to life actual historical tensions.” 49 In Chinese drag, Tseng’s exaggerated performance “mimes and renders hyperbolic” a host of normative race, gendered, and sexual conventions that are literally and figuratively naturalized in the landscape. 50 As the alien, the dissonance between his body and the landscape delineates the racialized abstraction of Asians and their symbolic excess to national culture. The Chinese male body in North America was historically constituted as nonreproductive, perverse, and feminized, which was reinforced through legal and extralegal restrictions on interracial intimacies, restrictions on the immigration of Chinese women, and aggressive enclosure in the domestic labor market. Thus the alien sexuality Tseng elicits can also be seen as the product of a biopolitical landscape whose regenerative energy is directed at the degeneration and exclusion of alien bodies. Moreover, as a queer artist who referred to himself as a “snow queen” because of his preference for white men, 51 Tseng’s queer white desire—a desire for incorporation into a white landscape of artists and gay culture—creates a productive tension with the gender and sexual objectification of the Asian body. The conflicted relations and identifications that Tseng’s photography stages capture a mode of disidentification that negotiates “between desire, identification, and ideology.” 52 Disrupting an exceptionalist imagining of Canada or the United States as a concrete, pristine wilderness, Tseng’s photographs reframe the settler colonial landscape as a racial borderland of symbolic violence. With the exception of a handful of photographs taken in British Columbia, the main focus of Tseng’s Canadian landscapes is the Rocky Mountains of Banff National Park in Alberta. Established in 1885 as Canada’s first national park and modeled after Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Banff National Park is one of the most iconic wilderness symbols of Canadian national identity. In Rob Shields’s analysis of Banff’s nationalist symbolism, he suggests that “Banff can serve as a metaphor for the Canadian condition: the peremptory Canadian self of the present clings to an image of a European past (or an ideal future) and refuses to confront the violence and paradox of its own making.” 53 In short, Banff reflects the worldview of European settlers who modeled the area after nineteenth-century European spas and tourist retreats. The city itself is named for a country seat on the northeast coast of Scotland between Aberdeen and Inverness, a name indicative of the vast colonial respatialization of Native territory. Resignified and repackaged in an endless series of tourist photographs and postcards, Banff conveys the purity of nature that contrasts with the impurities associated with the urban environment. What is evacuated from Banff’s symbolic repository is the displacement of First Nations peoples as the region’s original inhabitants. Native voices have largely been silenced, while their identities have been appropriated as tourist commodities that serve to authenticate the “naturalness” of the environment. The birth of Canada’s first national park in 1885 also coincides with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the transcontinental railroad responsible for the park’s creation. 54 As discussed in the last chapter, construction of the railroad employed thousands of Chinese railroad workers recruited from the United States, who tunneled through the most treacherous sections of British Columbia’s Fraser Canyon. Only after the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed did a Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration persuade the Canadian government to take measures to restrict the entry of Chinese migrants. As noted earlier, the government responded by enacting its first race-based immigration restriction, the Chinese Head Tax, which required that Chinese migrants pay $50 to disembark in Canada. By 1903 this sum had climbed to $500. Hence the very conditions of possibility for Banff’s pristine environment depended on appropriating and eliminating Indigenous peoples and exploiting and excluding aliens. Here, as in other settler states, elimination and exclusion are two ways that settler colonialism cuts both ways. 55 Despite the fact that Banff National Park is located in the valley of the Bow River in the southern part of Alberta, Banff’s snowy alpine landscape nevertheless evokes Canada’s nationalist identification with the North. Shelagh Grant explains that conceptualizations of the Canadian North have been informed by both British and American romantic idealizations of nature in the nineteenth century: “British aesthetic myth blended with American wilderness myth to reinforce a Romantic image of north.” 56 An integral feature of Canada’s national identity—showcased no less in the first verse of the national anthem, “O Canada, our true North strong and free”—the North is nonetheless a moving construction that is articulated through representations ranging from the Canadian arctic to Banff’s alpine elevation. The unfixed character of the North is what Sherrill E. Grace calls “magnetic north,” a “north whose parameters seem always to be shifting.” 57 The development of Canada’s northern identity is often attributed to the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven artists. An artist collective that rose to national fame in the 1920s and was credited with producing the first “national” art, their landscapes set out to reflect what they saw as an authentic Canadian spirit that was not derivative of European or American art traditions. Manning explains that “while the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven do not create the type of nationalism that is based on an ideology of the land, they do play a role in supporting the myth of the ‘great white north.’” 58 Drawing on tropes of purity, rugged masculine strength, and individualism, Group of Seven founder and spokesperson Lawren Harris saw the North as a spiritual realm untouched by history, humanity, or capitalist modernity. Harris writes in “The Story of the Group of Seven” that “what I was groping toward [was] Canada painted in her own spirit,” 59 and he elaborates the connections between race, nation, and northernness in his essay “Revelation of Art in Canada”: We are in the fringe of the great North and its living whiteness, its loneliness and replenishment, its resignations and release, its call and answer—its cleansing rhythms. It seems that the top of the continent is the spiritual flow that will ever shed clarity into the growing race of America, and we Canadians being closest to this source seem destined to produce an art somewhat different from our Southern fellows—an art more spacious, of a greater living quiet, perhaps of a more certain conviction of eternal values. 60 Harris’s conceptualization of a North equipped with the spiritual powers that could “cleanse” the nation through an interplay of “living whiteness” and “loneliness and replenishment” is indicative of his racial anxieties of immigrants who contributed to “the growing race of America.” Moreover, crafting an exceptionalist narrative around Canada as the most northerly nation in the Americas, Harris attributes to Canada a primary role as spiritual compass and regenerative source for the continent. Tseng’s Rocky Mountain landscapes contain sly allusions to a romantic conceptualization of wilderness as a purifying and regenerative national symbol that the Group of Seven idealized. For instance, Tseng’s Seven Peaks, Alberta, Canada, 1986 (figure 2.2 ) references the phallic majesty of mountains, trees, and icebergs that dominate the Group’s paintings. 61 Commenting on the Group’s authority over the Canadian landscape, Manning remarks that “for many years the quintessential Canadian landscape painting was an image of an unpopulated wilderness, with Tom Thomson’s ancient pine tree or Lawren Harris’s icebergs at the forefront.” 62 The Group’s tendency to position these natural subjects—mountains, trees, and icebergs—as visual anchors in their paintings has been well documented as reflecting heavily gendered ideas of nature. Towering mountains and trees were associated with a heroic masculinity that exercised their superiority over the changing, ephemeral, and feminized qualities of water and wind. A case in point is Harris’s renowned painting Mt. Lefroy , which depicts a large snowcapped mountain that evokes qualities of nobility, imperviousness to change, and purity and expresses, Berger states, “a distinctly masculine aesthetic.” 63 In particular, Mt. Lefroy ’s peak seems to almost puncture the overhead clouds, while light ripples away from the site of entry—as if to illuminate the nobility of the peak’s act of penetration. The connotations of forced sexual penetration and feminized submission are intentional, Joan Murray explains, given that Harris “believed in expressing sexuality in symbolic terms, and in his Lake Superior and Rockies subjects, the use of such semi-symbolic sexual imagery (penal [sic ] mountains and vaginal clouds) [is] overt.” 64 In Mt. Lefroy , masculine virility constitutes the power of the mountain and its domination of the feminine ephemera that lie below and hover overhead. These anthropomorphic motifs are consistent with the Group of Seven’s broader symbolic language, in which mountains and trees represent white, heterosexual, and paternal resistance to what Robert Linsley calls “inundation from below, and submission to the powers above . . . like a spike that is meant to pin together a stable identity out of spiritual, social, and sexual experiences that are all by nature transitory.” 65 The sturdy tree or towering mountain therefore celebrates a virile masculine individualism that is in constant tension with threatening lower elements that allegorized the Group’s fears, widespread in the 1920s and 1930s, about racial and ethnic mixing and the corresponding degeneration of a white, Nordic race. 66 Some of the racial implications of the Group’s landscapes come into further relief in the way Tseng’s photographs echo Adams’s environmentalist photography. Originating in the late nineteenth century, the American environmentalist movement regained momentum after World War I and bore the imprint of escalating eugenicist thought. In particular, eugenic ideology fused wilderness protection with white racial preservation through analogies that linked the degradation of the natural environment with the degeneration of the white race through miscegenation and rising nonwhite populations. Alexandra Minna Stern explains that during the 1920s, efforts to save redwood trees in California served as a “metaphor for defending race purity and ensuring the survival of white America.” 67 Inspired by Sierra Club founder John Muir, Bright explains, Adams “se[t] out to produce a photographic version of the nature publicist’s writings” and played an immense role in constructing an environmentally focused vision of the American landscape. 68 Despite the progressive agenda attributed to Adams’s landscapes, Bright points out that “the rugged western wilderness [was] a locus for the sentiments of white, middle-class Americans around nationalistic and ethnocentric ideals [that] cannot be overlooked in any discussion of the development of environmentally concerned photography.” 69 As such, the grandeur of Adams’s landscapes, analogous to the Group of Seven’s, could provide spiritual reassurance of the durability of the white race, its ability to persevere in the face of lower castes. Stern explains that eugenicists “profoundly shaped California’s landscapes” and subscribed to the belief—reflected in Adams’ and the Group of Seven’s regenerative narratives about nature—that “exposure to nature” was a “method of containing the worst and actualizing the best of human’s evolutionary and hereditary predispositions.” 70 Exemplified in Monolith (figure 2.3 ), the mountains and trees featured in Adams’s photography stood for what many conservationists viewed as the “stateliness, grandeur, and perseverance—represent[ing] the ‘great race.’” 71 Discussing the way conservationists collapsed distinctions between the redwood and white America, Stern writes: “Like Anglo-Saxon America, which was being engulfed by hordes of defectives and mongrels and menaced by the excessive breeding of undesirables, the redwood was imperiled by ‘race suicide’ from rampant logging, urban encroachment, and human ignorance.” 72 While mobilizing against the expropriation and destruction of natural resources was certainly a worthwhile cause, romantic anticapitalism framed the struggle in racial terms. For both the Group of Seven and Adams, racial ideologies could be invisibly projected onto the impermeable mountains in Banff and at Yosemite. As a cultural practice, then, the landscape aestheticized defensive racial ideologies of white supremacy. Tseng’s Seven Peaks also plays with what Linsley describes as the “great freeze out of Canadian painting” in the 1920s, 73 referring to the Group of Seven’s emphasis on snow and ice, and exhibits an attention to lighting that recalls Adams’s compositional details. However, the inclusion of Tseng’s body displaces the anchoring image of Harris’s and Adams’s trees and mountains. If these anchoring images symbolically project the white masculine mastery over inferior forces, Tseng’s body fails to convey a sense of stability, permanence, or purity associated with the landscape. Unlike the imposing and phallic tree or mountain peak, Tseng neither dominates the surrounding landscape nor stands, to quote Linsley’s assessment of Harris’s natural imagery, as “a spike meant to pin together a stable identity.” 74 Contrasting the whiteness of his snow-filled environment, Tseng’s body highlights his dissonance with the landscape. His isolation does not suggest a rugged individualism in symbolic struggle with the surrounding elements; rather, it evokes the incongruity of his alien body against the overwhelming whiteness of the natural background. As an evolving sign of yellow peril, moreover, Tseng’s body exposes the eugenic logics of purity present in the early twentieth-century landscapes he references. As an index of the abstract, degenerative value of nonreproductive, alien sexualities, he highlights the eugenic spirit of white racial reproduction and regeneration projected onto the landscape. Finally, dwarfed by the massive mountain peaks in the background, Tseng animates the desire for what Albert Boime calls a commanding “magisterial gaze” over the landscape, “the perspective of the [North] American on the heights searching for new worlds to conquer.” 75 Although the tradition of North American landscape art promotes what Berger identifies as a “natural affirmation of white culture” through a decidedly white male gaze, 76 Tseng’s gaze is largely unreadable behind his mirrored glasses. The direction of his gaze only points back to the camera and ultimately to the viewer. In this reversal, Tseng’s photographs highlight the racial limits of the landscape’s regenerative symbolism in its reflection of white settler identification with an uncorrupted nature that exists outside the circuits of capitalism. FIGURE 2.3 Monolith , 1927. Photograph by Ansel Adams. © 2014 The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. Tseng’s photograph of Moraine Lake (figure 2.4 ) also makes references to the intersecting discourses of northernness and tourism that produce Alberta’s national parks. His deliberate or unintentional misidentification of Lake Moraine’s location in the Northwest Territories—way, way up north—humorously underscores the north ness of its more southern location in Banff National Park. Commodified by Rocky Mountain tourists who frequent the lake and rent canoes, the most literal commodification of the lake occurred when the Bank of Canada issued twenty-dollar bills featuring the lake on the reverse side of the 1969 and 1978 bills (figure 2.5 ). The scene on the bill that Tseng perfectly captures is known as the “Twenty-Dollar View.” Tseng’s recreation scene flaunts the irony at the core of the Group of Seven’s conceptualization of nature. His photograph demonstrates that, far from a space untouched by modernity where a pure white wilderness exists as a refuge from corrupting human influences, Moraine Lake represents instead the capitalist conversion of Indigenous territory into tourist sites. The high aestheticism of the mundane tourist snapshot also amplifies what Jody Berland refers to as a form of “staged authenticity,” a concept derived from Dean MacCannell’s work on the western tourist to “describe the ways in which diverse regional cultures produce themselves as touristic objects.” 77 Berland goes on to explain that “because tourists seek new experience through interaction with the other . . . they place themselves in contact with personalities and spaces that seem to represent the inside of another culture but which in fact are carefully staged to represent that inside to outsiders.” 78 Tseng adds another parodic layer to the notion of staged authenticity insofar as his photograph confuses the relation between tourist and other. He is both tourist and other. Playing with the various codes of “authenticity” that produce the tourist site, the tourist, and the alien other, he reduces the scene’s commodified grandeur to a stage that dramatizes the fetishization of the imagined colonial encounter.

On a more humorous note, Tseng’s pose, with oar raised in midstroke, also evokes the figure of the wilderness sportsman. The sportsman movement began in Canada in the late nineteenth century and promoted an ideology of the wilderness that, analogous to the burgeoning conservation movement, represented a domain of white masculine regeneration. As Lynda Jessup explains, nineteenth-century landscape paintings that depicted sportsmen coincided with the rise of sportsman clubs that aimed to “revitaliz[e] manhood” against what they perceived were the “degenerative, emasculating, effects of capitalist modernity.” 79 The sportsman was thus the antithesis of the Chinese “bachelor” of the exclusion period, who exemplified respective racial and sexual threats to white labor and white female bourgeois respectability. Pictured as an unlikely sportsman, Tseng further underscores his exclusion from the regenerative scripts associated with this wilderness genre of masculinity. In stark contrast to the leisure associated with the sportsman’s wilderness enterprise, labor defined the lives of early twentieth-century Chinese male immigrants. As discussed in the first chapter, the colonial management of Asian reproduction was largely accomplished through immigration restriction, antimiscegenation law, and segregation practices that produced “bachelor societies” in Canada and the United States. The constraints on Chinese masculinity amounted to what David Eng calls “racial castration,” the “psychic and the material limits circumscribing Asian American male subjectivity.” 80 However, in Tseng’s adaptation of the iconic nationalist scene, his parody highlights foremost the commodification of nature while prompting recognition of the white racial investment in regenerative narratives embedded in its mythology. FIGURE 2.5 Twenty-dollar Canadian bill, 1969–1979 Series, Scenes of Canada . Bank of Canada. As a multisensory medium that expresses cultural values, the landscape can be “found” in Banff National Park and Yosemite or, as Mitchell outlines, “put there by the physical transformation of a place.” 81 Examining the latter, I turn to one of Tseng’s US landscapes, Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 (figure 2.6 ), to demonstrate how Tseng’s intrusion onto the patently manufactured natural landscape also prompts an excavation of the racial logics embedded in the “shrine of democracy.” Mount Rushmore, South Dakota is in many ways exemplary of the Expeditionary Series title in its engagement with the heroic forefathers of the nation and the monument’s fearless creator, Gutzon Borglum. Four presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt—were carved into stone in a project that took seventeen years from inception to completion. As the presidents set their gaze on the westward frontier, Tseng’s body faces the presidents. What does he see? FIGURE 2.6 Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 .

Since its completion in 1941, Mount Rushmore has become such an embedded symbol of US nationalism that Cher once admitted to believing that the monument was a naturally occurring rock formation. 82 Even for those who recognize the transparent constructedness of the rock landscape, the monument nevertheless appeals to similar ideals of authenticity and purity present in the Group of Seven’s landscape paintings. Fears over the potential degeneration of a superior “Nordic” race that were projected onto the landscape reflected the transnational currency of alarmist race theories in white settler nations. Similar to the Group of Seven, whose trees and icy mountains can be interpreted as personified symbols of white paternalistic dominion over the Canadian nation, Mount Rushmore’s granite rock face brings this symbolism to a literal realm in its depiction of the nation’s heroic “forefathers.” Borglum’s rock, a medium that expresses both impermeability and permanence, shares with the Group’s paintings a reverence for nature’s strength, stability, and resistance to change. As Borglum wrote of his intentions for the memorial, “The purpose of the memorial is to communicate the founding, expansion, preservation, and unification of the United States.” 83 Interestingly, although the Group’s landscapes and Borglum’s mountain sculpture represent spaces of spiritual relief and separation from alienating bureaucratic structures and the economic determinism associated with the city, their artistic undertakings would have been impossible without substantial government funding. And, similar to the Group’s romantic pursuit of the true North, Borglum fashioned himself as a rugged explorer who “discovered” the site in the Black Hills. During the memorial’s formal dedication ceremony in 1925, he climbed the vertical face of the mountain and planted a flag on its peak. Boime explains that in this feat “Borglum was emulating [John C.] Frémont’s dramatic unfurling of the flag on the summit of the Rockies.” 84 Thus Borglum and his monument provided for Tseng a rich corpus of heroic, white, masculine, and colonial associations to emulate in his own Expeditionary Series . If the effect of the Group of Seven’s paintings was to naturalize conquest by erasing human involvement in the landscape, Borglum’s Mount Rushmore was an even more explicit homage to the ideology of Manifest Destiny. Boime observes that the monument “allegorizes the idea of Manifest Destiny” in that all four presidents had a role in the myth of divine territorial intervention. 85 These included Washington’s extensive surveying of the frontier; Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase; Lincoln’s transcontinental railroad; and Roosevelt’s role in the conquest of New Spain and construction of the Panama Canal, which provided an expedient water route to Pacific markets. In short, the monument exemplifies Mitchell’s suggestion that the “rise of landscape” is intimately connected with imperial expansion. 86 Similar to his parodic engagement with the Group of Seven, Tseng’s pose and manipulation of scale recalls a romantic tradition of landscape art that privileges a single perspective. Mount Rushmore’s participation in this tradition is rendered to the point of exaggeration, captured in the monument’s grandiose point of view. This perspective epitomizes what Boime refers to as a “magisterial aesthetics,” one that reinforces an “imperial point of view that is often expressed in American landscape painting of the nineteenth century and that remains deeply embedded in the national consciousness.” 87 In Mount Rushmore, South Dakota , the elevated perspective of the gigantic presidents’ faces symbolizes their authority over the land they govern, which is contrasted with Tseng’s subordinated and ambiguous perspective. Reversing the direction of their magisterial gaze, Tseng’s body is turned away from the viewer, and his concealed face points upward toward the four presidents. And unlike in the earlier East Meets West phase of Tseng’s series, where he often blew up the scale of his body to give the impression he was a Godzilla-esque figure threatening the various national icons he stood beside—such as the Statue of the Liberty or the Empire State Building—here Tseng’s body is dwarfed in the presence of Borglum’s homage to the nation’s forefathers. The pose Tseng adopts in this photograph brings to mind the Byronic hero, the lone romantic figure cast in relief against the natural landscape. A well-known example of these “magisterial aesthetics” is captured in a nineteenth-century piece called The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818) by the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Contained in Friedrich’s painting (figure 2.7 ) are the frequently recycled tropes of romanticism. For instance, the clouds and mountaintops intermingle in the painting to emphasize the inseparability of nature from the heavens above. At the center is the solitary traveler, who has climbed to a dangerous vantage point, his back turned to us so that the viewer can share his point of view and spiritual identification with the purity of nature. The mountains in this painting similarly evoke permanence and steadfastness. Joining earth and heaven, the intermingling craggy rocks and clouds convey both endurance and immortality. The anticapitalist subtext of this romantic vision is underscored by the wanderer’s traditional folk attire, which valorizes the cultural purity of folk life over the abstract degradations of capitalist modernity.

Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Tseng stands with his back to the viewer. However, he is standing so close that the monument loses its illusions of grandeur. Boime suggests that Mount Rushmore, “like the statue of liberty, . . . succeeds [only] through the impact of scale rather than aesthetic quality.” 88 From where Tseng stands, unable to appreciate the impact of scale, the monument cannot succeed. Using his body to emphasize distinctions of scale, Tseng also evokes Chinese landscape paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties. 89 The small scale of the human figures depicted in the paintings of these periods emphasizes the sanctuary offered by nature and the relative insignificance of human beings against an overpowering natural environment. Maxwell Hearn explains that the disintegration of the Tang dynasty was the main catalyst for the Romantic antidynastic retreat into nature: “Faced with the failure of the human order, learned men sought permanence within the natural world, retreating into the mountains to find a sanctuary from the chaos of dynastic collapse.” 90 Whether deliberate or not, the allusion to Chinese landscape painting in Tseng’s photograph is amusingly out of place at Mount Rushmore because it subverts, as Mitchell explains, “any claims for the uniquely modern or Western lineage of landscape.” 91 In particular, in the context of Mount Rushmore’s celebration of Manifest Destiny, the photograph’s connection to Chinese landscape painting further underscores the circuits of dynastic power and capital that give rise to imperial dimensions of landscape art. Through the parodic gaps between repetition and difference, Tseng’s photography brings to view the imperial dimensions of landscape art that are conditioned by the violent elimination of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of land resources. Toying with these elements of scale, Tseng dramatizes his insignificance in the face of these forefathers in a parody of heroic frontier masculinity. This parody underscores the cultural importance of frontier masculinity as a constitutive element of US national identity while emphasizing how Asian men literally fall short of its larger-than-life romanticization. As a queer Asian man, moreover, Tseng and his near invisibility underscore the multiple registers of his alienation: from constructions of white masculinity, from the whiteness of US gay male identity, and from patriarchal Asian American cultural nationalisms that reinforce a staunchly heterosexist “heroic” masculinity to combat anti-Asian racism. For instance, according to Frank Chin, Jeffery Paul Chan, Lawson Fusao Inada, and Shawn Hsu Wong of the Aiiieeeee! Collective, Asian American cultural politics must challenge the social and cultural emasculation of Asian American men by subverting stereotypes of the “good Chinese man . . . [as] the fulfillment of white male homosexual fantasy, literally kissing white ass.” 92 While Tseng assumes the guise of the explorer, however parodic, his contemplation of the four presidents might very well be read as “kissing white ass.” Thus, in Tseng’s disruption of cultural nationalist prescriptions, his physical inconsequentiality may suggest that a masculinist and heterosexist Asian American cultural nationalism falls short precisely because it further entrenches a cultural standard of white masculinity. At the same time, Tseng’s diminutiveness can also be read as a tacit acknowledgment of what Malini Johar Schueller calls “the gendered imperatives of Western imperialism and orientalism that have produced the stereotype of the effeminate Asian male.” 93 Refusing to adopt the “magisterial gaze” of the four presidents, Tseng turns his attention to the gaze itself and its presumed authority. He faces east rather than west, reversing the westward direction of the frontier that the presidents seem to be surveying. His eastward gaze counters the normative conventions of landscape that, as Patricia Nelson Limerick observes, “ran on an east-to-west track, following the physical and mental migrations of white English-speaking men.” 94 Most importantly, his eastward gaze demonstrates the fact that the westward movement of white settlers was only one small part of the process of “discovery.” A disoriented explorer, Tseng evokes the historical fact that for nonwhite immigrants, as they moved along the west–east axis of labor, internment, and other displacements, the landscape was not the simple, pure, virgin wilderness of the settler colonial imagination. Indeed, Chinese labor in North America offers a salient illustration of Raymond Williams’s remark that “a working country is hardly ever a landscape.” 95 The subtle lighting in the black-and-white photograph also has the effect of nearly disappearing Tseng. On the one hand, his invisibility underscores the illegibility of his queer Asian difference within the regenerative myths and expansionist ideologies that Mount Rushmore stands for. On the other hand, his disappearance allegorizes the repressed histories that are not etched in stone, most notably the history of the Sioux Nation: the Sioux campaigned vigorously against the monument, which was built on stolen land and commemorated the murder and dispossession of Indigenous peoples. As Boime points out, “Consistent with the pattern of destruction characteristic of national exploration and empire building, the creation and the dedication of the Mount Rushmore monument was one more symbol of the white man’s racist and intolerant Indian policy.” 96 The site of Mount Rushmore is between what is now Harney National Forest and Custer State Park, what Boime refers to as the “two most hated names in the Sioux lexicon” because of William S. Harney’s and George Armstrong Custer’s massacres of Sioux populations that led to illegal gold mining in the Black Hills. 97 The Black Hills, where Mount Rushmore is situated, houses the sacred site of Paha Sapa and is designated by the Sioux as a ceremonial place of prayer and meditation. The memorial was built despite the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which gave Dakota Indians exclusive rights to the Black Hills. Predictably, as soon as gold was discovered, white miners swiftly breached the treaty agreement to begin the illegal expropriation of natural resources and, in the case of Borglum, to blast 450,000 tons of granite from the face of the sacred Black Hills. This history underscores the contradictory logics of settler colonialism, which engages in the violent elimination and dispossession of Indigenous peoples and simultaneously expresses a desire to become Indigenous to the landscape, to naturalize settler colonialism through symbolic projection. Another history not etched into stone includes the many Chinese who worked in the Black Hills in what Liping Zhu calls the “largest Chinatown east of San Francisco from 1876 to 1910.” 98 Only since 2001, when extensive archaeological excavations of Deadwood’s Chinatown began, have widespread signs of Chinese life been revealed for examination. As Zhu notes, the gold rush brought thousands of Chinese miners to the western states, including South Dakota—although the population did not surpass 250 residents. Zhu explains that “as soon as the news spread of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer’s expedition finding gold in the mountains of western Dakota Territory, Chinese immigrants joined the last major gold rush in the nineteenth century, arriving in the Black Hills by the winter of 1875–1876.” 99 They were subject to labor exploitation and racial violence. Only recently have the Chinese, who played such an important role in this South Dakota borderland, emerged from historical repression into partial visibility, giving new meaning to the hazy outline of Tseng’s body at Mount Rushmore. But as Tseng’s suit nearly blends into the rock—suggesting that he is part of the rock—the Chinese of the Black Hills are also embedded in this borderland of invasion, dispossession, and ongoing political struggle. Like the Group of Seven, Borglum’s nationalist project was shaped by his own reactionary beliefs. Despite the rhetoric of democracy he invoked to characterize Mount Rushmore’s commemorative spirit, he was unambiguous about the perils of miscegenation. In particular, in addition to expansions in anti-immigration law, the period saw the rise in white supremacist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK ), an organization that had earlier commissioned Borglum to create a Confederate monument at Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia. His ties to the KKK were not insignificant. Borglum was an impassioned reader of Madison Grant’s Passing of the Great Race , a scaremongering, pseudoscientific treatise that “became a sacred text for eugenicists, the Klan, and proto-Nazis everywhere.” 100 Influenced by Grant’s treatise, Borglum also took to the page. In a 1923 letter to prominent Indianapolis Klansman David C. Stephenson, Borglum boasted, “I wrote 2500 to 3000 words on the evils of the alien races.” 101 In other letters to Stephenson in the early 1920s he also expressed a profound anti-Semitism in his fears of hypodescent through miscegenation, writing as follows: If you cross a thorough-bred with a jackass you get a mule. . . . The lowest race in civilization is the strongest physically and breeding (crossed) is always down. A Negro and a Jew will produce Negro, but Hindu and Jew—Jew; Chinese and Jew, offspring Jew; Italian and Jew, offspring Jew; and European race and Jew, offspring Jew. 102 As John Taliaferro notes, “He labeled immigrants ‘slippered assassins,’ . . . [and] warned that America was becoming an alien ‘scrap heap.’” 103 Even though Borglum opposed slavery, he blamed African slaves for the degeneration of the white race, writing that “it has been the character of the cargo that has eaten into the very moral fiber of our race character, rather than the moral depravity of Anglo-Saxon traders.” 104 His eugenic vision was also explicitly gendered. Boime explains that Borglum’s admiration of Benito Mussolini’s virile masculinity was in direct contrast to the effeminacy and weakness he associated with Jews. For these reasons he attempted to disassociate himself from stereotypes of the effete artist by engaging in rigorous physical activities such as rock climbing, boxing, and wrestling and crafting an aesthetic vision based on colossal forms. In this light, Tseng’s presence on the face of Mount Rushmore stages a confrontation with the manifest masculinity embedded in the shrine of democracy, a confrontation captured in his eastward gaze and richly evocative of the earlier title of the series, East Meets West . In sum, the degenerative excess signaled by Tseng’s abstract alien body powerfully underscores the romantic anticapitalism embedded in the settler colonial personification of the landscape as a concrete, racially pure, and masculine expression of a noncapitalist universe.

Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. Our Home and Native Landscape To conclude this chapter I turn to Jin-me Yoon’s 1996 photographic work Group of Sixty-Seven , which usefully complements Tseng’s parodic exposure of romantic anticapitalist ideology projected onto the nationalist landscape. Group of Sixty-Seven extends the focus on racial constructions of national landscape that first appeared in her 1991 Souvenirs of the Self postcard series, in which Yoon poses, much like Tseng, in front of familiar tourist sites in Banff National Park. Continuing her exploration of the interplay of race and landscape, Group of Sixty-Seven connects romantic anticapitalism with the fetishization of Indigenous identity and racializes Asians as a negative abstraction. Here Yoon incorporates the paintings of two iconic Canadian painters, Lawren Harris of the Group of Seven and Emily Carr, an artist deeply inspired by the Group of Seven’s nationalist vision who became renowned for her artistic interaction with Native populations in British Columbia. From the view of settler colonialism’s triangulation of settler, Native, and alien identities, Yoon’s work exemplifies how the Native and the Asian personify opposite sides of an antinomical view of capitalist relations, in which the concrete, noncapitalist dimension is Indigenous and the abstract representation of capitalist modernity is Asian. Group of Sixty-Seven (figure 2.8 ) consists of two gridlike panels, each panel containing sixty-seven photographs of Korean Canadians from Vancouver, British Columbia. On the left panel, they face away from us (figure 2.9 ), and on the right, they face us (figure 2.10 ). We can first observe the various layers of national citation in this piece. The title, Group of Sixty-Seven , makes an overt reference to the Group of Seven. The number “sixty-seven” in the title also cites Canadian confederation in 1867 and the elimination of national origins immigration quotas a hundred years later, in 1967—the crucial legal prerequisite for the appearance of many of the sixty-seven Korean Canadian faces featured in the piece. Adding another layer of citation to the Group of Seven artists, we note that behind the heads on the right panel is Lawren Harris’s Rocky Mountain painting Maligne Lake, Jasper Park . Building on Tseng’s references to the Group of Seven painters and their association of white male nationhood with landscape, Yoon’s work highlights the commodification of landscape in her use of repetition, recalling the seriality of Andy Warhol’s pop art.

Like Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroe portraits, Yoon’s piece similarly inverts high and low aestheticism and the values associated with originality and duplication. Her postmodern play of surface and depth presents a dramatic recontextualization of Harris’s Maligne Lake , which was considered the most influential painting in Toronto from the time it was painted in 1924 to 1930. 105 As one of the most celebrated nationalist works of art in Canada, art historian Dennis Reid describes Harris’s painting as a “tribute to the spiritualizing force of the country, an incentive to the spiritual capacity in us all.” 106 In keeping with his romantic views of a nation united under a spiritual conception of the North, Maligne Lake expresses a sense of control and order that defended against the turbulent social realities of the 1920s. This was a period of increasing industrialization, urbanization, and class struggle that fomented increasing antipathy toward racialized aliens, particularly Chinese labor migrants, who were subject to the Chinese Head Tax and would face exclusion through passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act. Thus the “rise of landscape” 107 and escape into a primordial, frozen wilderness in this context can be attributed to an increasing sense of chaos spurred by modernity. By invoking Harris and the Group of Seven so explicitly in this piece, Yoon invites the viewer to explore the intersection of race and romantic anticapitalism in the Group of Seven’s artwork, particularly in the racial and spatial depiction of Canada’s national identity constructed around the idea of the “Great White North.” More confrontationally, Yoon prompts the viewer to consider the relationship between these Korean faces and the essence of Nordic purity celebrated in the Group’s depiction of the landscape. By photographing sixty-seven Korean faces in front of Harris’s painted landscape, Yoon imposes what Hutcheon calls “an external order upon a work that is presumed to be original.” 108 However, Yoon manipulates the line between the authenticity of the original by repeating Harris’s landscape sixty-seven times. In terms of the dissonant media presented in the work, Yoon emphasizes the modernity of the Korean faces through her use of photography—a medium whose infinite capacity for reproduction represents an antithesis to notions of artistic originality contained in Harris’s piece. In doing so, Yoon allegorizes the way Korean Canadian bodies become racial signifiers of the abstract dimension of capitalist modernity and, alternatively, how the painted landscape becomes a signifier of the concrete dimension of nature, purity, and originality. But Yoon ultimately frustrates a view of the abstract homogeneity associated with Asians by emphasizing the gender and generational diversity of her Korean Canadian subjects against a Maligne Lake that is here reduced to “background,” its unoriginality reinforced again by Yoon’s repetition of the image. In a twist on the visual codes of the tourist snapshot, what is “real” about the photograph are the Korean faces, emphasizing both the commodification of landscape as tourist scene and its artificiality. The jarring superimposition of Asian faces onto the constructed landscape also serves as an invitation to consider why Asians have or have not been incorporated into the dominant social and cultural landscape in Canada. While Maligne Lake is celebrated as a timeless and noncontradictory representation of Canadian nationalism, it is interesting to note that it was completed one year after the passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act, in a period that saw the rise in organized anti-Asian labor agitation and the continual revision of anti-Asian legislation. What Yoon’s piece suggests, then, is that romantic expressions of Canadian nationalism that are conveyed as pastoral retreat must be read as inseparable from a history of yellow peril and anti-immigrant sentiment. If we shift to a more contemporary context, Yoon’s faces comment on the xenophobic responses to ways recent Asian immigration has redrawn the racial landscape in large urban cities such as Vancouver. Indeed, the public outcry against Hong Kong immigrant “monster houses” in Vancouver’s historically white Shaughnessy and Kerrisdale neighborhoods is one example of how the influx of Asian residential settlement outside the spatial and class confines of segregated Chinatowns reflects, as geographer Katharyne Mitchell observes, “anxiety about the loss of both economic and symbolic control over the defining and marking of place.” 109 Thus the images of these unsmiling faces blocking our view of the aestheticized landscape suggest that these faces are always in excess of nationalist constructions of landscape. By superimposing these faces onto Harris’s painting in a gridlike parody of Canada’s so-called multicultural “mosaic,” Yoon suggests that we can draw no unifying, ideological comfort from the retreat into landscape. FIGURE 2.11 Emily Carr, Old Time, Coast Village , 1929–1930. Oil on canvas, 91.3 × 128.7 cm. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Emily Carr Trust. Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. The left panel of Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven offers a related parody of the national landscape by emphasizing the romanticization of Indigenous themes. This panel draws on a painting titled Old Time, Coast Village (figure 2.11 ) by British Columbia painter Emily Carr—an iconic figure in her own right. Emily Carr’s association with the Group of Seven was established in 1927 when she was invited by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa to participate in an exhibition of West Coast painting. There she met Lawren Harris, whose praise for the Native themes in her art and subsequent years of encouragement became a key motivator for the artistic and literary projects she undertook, including her Governor General award-winning autobiography, Klee Wyck , recounting her experiences with Pacific Coast First Nations communities. The book’s title is based on the nickname given to her by the Tlingit Nation—an Indigenous people she strongly identified with—which translates to “the laughing one.” 110 In a revealing journal entry about the 1927 exhibition, Carr notes proudly, “I felt my work looked dead and dull, but they [Group of Seven] all say I have more of the spirit of the Indian than the others.” 111 Not only for Carr, who identified with the First Nations to the point that she imagined herself an Indian, the merit of her own work was judged on its capacity to reflect Native spirituality and cultural vision. Because she was a female artist and assumed to be lesbian, the First Nations themes Carr drew out in her work, which included reproducing their art forms in her own art practice, are often lauded as exemplary of her anticonformism, which challenged patriarchal and heteronormative gender scripts. Carr traveled alone to Native communities in British Columbia, such as the coastal Haida, Tsmishian, and Tlingit Nations, and began to feature their totem poles in her paintings. In her pursuit of a Native vision, Carr exemplified the role of the romantic hero—but as a woman. Her attraction to First Nations cultures was clearly based on romanticized notions of the “noble savage,” who she believed existed in a vanishing state of purity in nature. Art historian Dorothy Shadbolt attests to this belief, explaining that Carr “intuitively grasped the sense in which Indian art was an expression of the native’s relation to the natural and supernatural world as he understood it.” 112 In figure 2.9 we can observe the proximity Carr observed in the relation between First Nations and “real” nature. In particular, the light-colored totem poles at the center of the piece echo the brown trees in the background, suggesting the indistinguishable features of First Nations culture and nature. From an antinomical view of capitalist social relations, First Nations culture comes to express concrete nature, purity, and originality against the abstract, antinatural oppressions of capitalist modernity. But what complicates Carr’s romanticization of First Nations culture here is the overwhelming foliage that drapes the village in a heavy, molten green and serves as protective cover. The trees in the foreground appear human in form, leaning toward the village in cautious observance. Recalling Alexandra Minna Stern’s examination of the racial undertones of early twentieth-century conservationism and wilderness protection, Carr’s painting betrays not only an ideology of romantic anticapitalism at the core of the settler colonial retreat into nature, but also a suffocating management and control of First Nations cultures. Thus her desire to “go Native” was ultimately more revealing of a defensive investment in whiteness than a respect for Indigenous sovereignty and land claims. More extreme than the Group of Seven’s northern retreat from social and political upheavals of the 1920s that marked life in urban centers, Carr’s psychological withdrawal from urbanization manifested itself in illnesses, to the extent that it appeared she was allergic to the city—an ailment Reid refers to as the “‘city disease’ that was to attack [Carr] whenever she settled in a metropolis.” 113 Her loathing of the city, coupled with her idealization of and identification with First Nations culture and appropriation of their art, exemplifies Shari Huhndorf’s description of “going Native” as an appropriation of the identity, images, culture, or practices of Indigenous peoples. A settler colonial logic that finds equal expression in Canada as in the United States, she explains that going Native “reinforces the racial hierarchies it claims to destabilize”: 114 Over the last century, going native has become a cherished American tradition, an important—even necessary—means of defining European American identities and histories. In its various forms, going native articulates and attempts to resolve widespread ambivalence about modernity as well as anxieties about the terrible violence marking the nation’s origins. 115 From this perspective we can reread Carr’s gender transgressions as symptomatic of her own white colonial identity crisis, one she attempted to resolve by appropriating and identifying herself with a First Nations identity. While Carr may have viewed going Native as simultaneously anticapitalist in shunning modernity’s spoils and ruins alike, antiracial in her idealization of the coastal First Nations communities onto which she imposed herself, and gender-bending in her adoption of the persona of the lonely romantic genius, she actually reinforced rather than dismantled these structures. In particular, rather than challenging capitalism, Carr’s journey to remove herself from the toxic industrial and immigrant-filled environment of the city to find personal and artistic inspiration in Native cultures reinforces capitalism’s main values. As Huhndorf explains, “The fixation on self-discovery and self-healing articulate the very Western ideologies of bourgeois individualism.” 116 Because her oeuvre relied on the appropriation of First Nations art practice, her relationship with First Nations cultures was largely economic insofar as she profited immensely from appropriating their cultural practices. Finally, Carr’s idealization of the naturalness of the “noble savages” of the Pacific coast was contradicted by her antipathy toward the large urban population of Songhees who lived in her hometown of Victoria. As Janice Stewart explains, Carr’s view of the Songhees was in keeping with prevailing ideas at the time: they were seen as “‘lazy, gambling, drunks’ who were ‘a nuisance and trouble to the authorities’ as ‘individuals warranting charity.’” 117 The practice of either idealizing Native peoples as noble savages or denigrating them as inferior and requiring colonial management ultimately performs the same ideological work. On one hand, the romanticization of Native cultures functions to distance North Americans from their European settler roots, thereby displacing responsibility for the conquest and dispossession of the First Nations. 118 It also reinforces racial hierarchies when settlers identify and imagine themselves as “super-Indian” and therefore the rightful inheritors of the land and its resources. On the other, the denigration of Native communities naturalizes European dominance and its ideologies of western progress. It rationalizes the colonization of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of their resources through suggestions that Natives cannot “accept” modernity and civilization. Last but not least, while Carr’s adoption of the Tlingit name Klee Wyck can be read as a rejection of Victorian notions of womanhood and the rigid organization of her father’s house; as Stewart observes, “For most of her life, Carr turned to masculine authorities . . . for final judgment of her work rather than to her circle of reading ladies or other women artists.” 119 As an artist who rose to iconic fame in the 1930s, after the Group of Seven disbanded, by extending their project of defining a distinctively Canadian art, Carr’s persona reveals a problematic desire to escape from a social world marked by social upheavals, anti-immigrant sentiment, and industrialization, and a colonial desire to possess First Nations culture to promote the authenticity of her “Canadian” art. If spiritual replenishment for the nation did not spring from the “true North strong and free,” as the Group believed, then according to Carr, “our home and Native land” 120 became a national symbol of cultural purity and wholeness. Yoon’s engagement with Carr in the left panel must therefore be read as an engagement with Carr’s autochthonophilia and appropriation of First Nations cultural identity. The way Yoon’s work performs a disidentification of Carr’s painting is registered on multiple levels. If we focus on the way the Korean Canadian heads are turned away from the viewer, we can interpret this “faceless” gesture as a disidentification with the ethnographic gaze embedded in Carr’s painting, a gaze that appropriates the Native other for artistic legitimacy and produces art that becomes a romantic index to a defensive settler colonial identity. But at another level, they stage a disidentificatory encounter for the settler looking in. Given that these Korean heads block the view of the village, they foreclose a settler desire to identify with the Native landscape, whose commodification is reinforced through the repetition of Carr’s painting. A further irony embedded in this panel is that not only do Yoon’s Korean Canadian subjects block an identification with the landscape, but the blackness of the back-turned heads also allegorize the inability of settler culture to “identify” Asians as anything but abstractly homogeneous—as unidentifiable as the black hair in each frame. Adding, then, to the degenerative excess that Tseng’s body performs in the romanticized landscape, here Yoon suggests that Asian bodies are an alien antithesis of settler colonialism’s indigenizing desire. In short, by viewing capitalism as an antinomy of abstract and concrete dimensions, Asians are as unnatural to the landscape as Indigenous peoples are natural. This is the double edge of settler colonialism. Conclusion In Tseng’s and Yoon’s disidentification with iconic landscapes of North America, their photographs present, to quote Hutcheon again, “inscription[s] of the past in the present [that] embody and bring to life actual historical tensions” and prompt us to delve into the genealogy of landscape art of the early twentieth century. 121 Disidentifying with a shifting set of clichés and stereotypes associated with Asian North Americans and the landscape while preserving the aesthetic beauty of the latter tradition, their photographs use landscape “as raw material for representing a disempowered politics or positionality that has been rendered unthinkable by the dominant culture.” 122 Indeed, the alien presence of Asian bodies set against these landscapes foregrounds messy intersections of race science, white nativism, and settler nationalism projected onto the landscape. For Tseng, his parodic repetition of early twentieth-century landscape conventions associated with the Group of Seven’s, Adams’s, and Borglum’s landscapes brings forth the eugenic ideology that conveyed a white, masculine, and paternalistic identification with mountains and trees. Despite conservationists’ progressive environmental agenda, their efforts were often intertwined with a eugenic agenda that opposed the degeneration of the white race by alien races. Juxtaposed with Tseng’s alien excess, their projection of virility and obstinate resistance to change onto a mountainous and tree-filled landscape expresses the contradictory way that racist ideology formed a key subtext of so-called progressive, anticapitalist visions of national unity, conservation, and democracy. In a complementary manner, Yoon draws out the indigenizing dimension of romantic anticapitalism that collapse Native cultures into an unchanging natural purity and authenticity. She also builds on Tseng’s evocation of the degenerative excess signified by Asian bodies to exemplify the abstractness and unnaturalness of the Asian body against the landscape. From the period of railroad labor discussed in the last chapter to Asian immigrant exclusion in this chapter, the perverse abstraction associated with Chinese labor had by the 1920s and 1930s been supplanted by the settler retreat into the aestheticized landscape, whose unnatural antithesis is the Asian alien. Despite the romantic tribute to national culture embedded in landscape art of the early twentieth century, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographic countermemories suggest that such a “progressive” vision of national culture was “born in the apprehension of imminent loss,” as Lake and Reynolds indicate, and part of the anxious growth of “whiteness as a transnational mode of racial identification in settler societies.” 123 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, territorial symbols of regenerative whiteness expressed the proprietorial dimension of British settler colonialism and became, over time, synonymous with whiteness. As W. E. B. Du Bois observed succinctly on the whiteness of territorial expansion, “Whiteness is the ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen.” 124 Finally, in the spirit of Kingston’s and Fung’s reimagining of abstract labor as History 2, the potential of Tseng’s and Yoon’s parody is not in articulating a more ideal landscape of normative inclusion to symbolize the self-identity of the settler nation. Rather, by queering the aestheticized landscape, Tseng’s alien difference animates the contradictions, exclusions, and violent eliminations of settler colonialism that the landscape, as aesthetic object, fetishizes and naturalizes. Similarly, Yoon’s iteration of the interrupted landscape lays bare the fetishized commodity function of the landscape. It is from the ambivalence of the parodic gaps between Tseng’s and Yoon’s difference to the landscape that their photographs allegorize a state of nonequivalence. Nonequivalence, as Chandan Reddy explains, represents subjects “who are not ‘unified’ by a prior identity.” 125 Disidentifying with the white regenerative ideal projected onto the romantic landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs interrupt and denaturalize the mundane iteration of its symbolic violence. Following from the first chapter’s examination of the perverse temporality of abstract labor and this chapter’s focus on antinatural landscapes during a converging period of anti-Asian immigration restriction in North America, the next chapter moves forward to the internment of Japanese North Americans. If Asian North American cultural producers have thus far exposed and recircuited the abstract and unnatural signifiers attached to Asian bodies, what might a transnational approach to Japanese internment narratives expose as internment’s governing logics? Continuing my exploration of Asian racialization as a fetishistic alignment with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, I track the evolution of romantic anticapitalism and its antinomical view of concrete and abstract dimensions of capitalism. Probing Asian North American representations of labor and landscape in chapter 3 , I demonstrate how Joy Kogawa’s Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory reflect how the perverse abstraction of Asian labor takes on mechanical, nonhuman representation that must be eradicated from West Coast agriculture and fishing industries. However, through the process of labor resignification established through symbolic proximity with Indigeneity, Japanese North Americans emerge renaturalized and recorporealized as surplus labor.",

      "content": "CHAPTER 3 JAPANESE INTERNMENT AND THE MUTATION OF LABOR The only tree here is dead. —Joy Kogawa, Obasan Underworlds Paradox defined the late Ruth Asawa in life and art. Born into a poor Japanese farming family in Norwalk, California, in 1926, relocated in February 1942 to Santa Anita Racetrack and later interned at Rohwer Relocation Center, she was by 1946 an unlikely art student at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. When she emerged on the art scene in the mid-1950s, Asawa and her art were, perhaps inevitably, viewed through the prism of race and gender stereotypes. Critics were intent on either casting her sculptures as typically “Oriental” or dismissing them as decorative, feminine craft rather than modernist sculpture. 1 Because of their lack of grandiosity (in stark contrast to Gutzon Borglum’s colossal sculpture examined in the last chapter), Asawa’s sculptures were interpreted as insubstantial and thus feminine. Unlike the scale and orientation of Mount Rushmore, most of her sculptures are hanging or lie on the floor. In a telling review of her work in 1956, art critic Eleanor Munro contrasts her sculptures to the monumental and masculine qualities we could easily associate with Borglum: FIGURE 3.1 Ruth Asawa, Untitled , ca. 1960–1965. Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. © Ruth Asawa. These are “domestic” sculptures in a feminine, handiwork mode—small and light and unobtrusive for home decoration, not meant, as is much contemporary sculpture, to be hoisted by cranes, carted by vans and installed on mountainsides. 2 At a time when modernist aesthetics were defined through heroic, masculine traits, such as welding and cutting iron, 3 her innovative technique of weaving and tying industrial wire into shapes required viewers to engage with contradictory modalities of hardness and softness, heaviness and weightlessness, and movement and suspension. Asawa would eventually gain recognition for expanding the boundaries of sculpture by bringing visibility to the power of what she referred to as “negative space,” 4 the tension produced by the space inside and surrounding the materiality of the sculpture. In Asawa’s work, this negative space functions as an invisible force field that defines and directs the flow of energy. For the purposes of this chapter, Asawa’s work offers a visual metaphor for the negative space within and surrounding Japanese internment in North America. In particular, her tied-wire sculptures (figure 3.1 ) present a contextual frame for this chapter’s continuing focus on romantic anticapitalism. In her art practice Asawa was intent on exploring the limits of duality, making a “shape that was inside and outside at the same time . . . [something] that continually reverses itself.” 5 Her tied-wire sculptures’ continual inversions and reversals offer a visual motif of dialectical process—in stark contrast to romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical view of capitalist social relations as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions, between universalism and particularism. As I will develop in this chapter, this antinomical view led to an association of Japanese labor with the creation of unnatural value. Fusing the natural and the unnatural, Asawa’s sculptures hang from the ceiling as clusters of branches, bringing to mind a tree growing downward. As John Yau observes, “There is the forceful suggestion of an inverted world , reinforced by the downward pointing branching shadows cast on the wall.” 6 Reversing the properties of the trees depicted in the last chapter—the sturdy hang tree of Gonzales-Day’s photograph or anchoring trees of the Group of Seven’s paintings—this tree’s branches grow ever thinner and more delicate into fine needles. The fragility of the needles is paradoxically suggestive of both regeneration and evanescence. Yau points out the haunting effect of the shadows cast by the sculpture against the gallery wall: “The shadows branch down the nearby walls, conveying a ghostly domain in which everything is in reverse.” 7 Gravity, too, whose invisible, abstract force compels her forest of tied-wire trees upsidedown, captures the downward pull of mortality. The sculpture ultimately suspends the duality of the material and immaterial worlds, showcasing the interplay of wire, space, and shadow—whose impact is achieved by what is concretely visible and invisible, abstract. Encapsulating the human activity of tying wire with the abstract representation of natural forms, Asawa transcends personal biography while evoking those “things that your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” As such, her work offers an allegory of the dialectics of Japanese internment expressed in forms that are both figurative and nonfigurative. If Asawa’s inverted forest suggests an underworld where the immaterial but objective laws of gravity collapse into the concrete materiality of form, the works by Joy Kogawa and Rea Tajiri that I examine in this chapter extend this vision into both the concrete and affective dimensions of Japanese internment. Unlike the romantic landscapes of the last chapter, onto which a eugenic “natural” white settler identity could be projected, this chapter focuses on its unnatural, negatively abstract counterpart. In this sense, Asawa’s art’s abstract qualities also serve to capture aspects of Japanese internment in North America that defy concrete representational form, elements that contribute to the way Japanese internment can never be fully compartmentalized in the past. If Asawa’s upside-down tree serves as an unnatural marker of those “things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind,” its gravitational pull also suggests the weight of psychic excess. For Kogawa and Tajiri, the nightmares, visions, and complex identifications similarly constitute the haunting excess of Japanese internment, of a world mysteriously turned over. Attending to the competing theories that attribute Japanese internment to economic and/or racial causes, I probe the affective registers of Japanese internment—its negative space—whose insights exceed the empiricism of national historiography. In my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s shifting modes of cross-racial identification, first with Jewish and then Native intersections, I suggest that the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians to internment sites was motivated by a perception of the excessive industry of Japanese labor. This excessive efficiency was associated with having control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. Both texts offer a complementary view of this racialization expressed through modes of identification with Jewish peoples under Nazi persecution, animating a corresponding condition of destructive economic abstraction. After West Coast expulsion and relocation, however, Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value is neutralized as both texts turn to Japanese-Native intersections. Unlike the destructive economism associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents the romantic anticapitalist ideal of organic purity and concrete nature external to economic modernity. Thus Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts’ evoke how the brutality of relocation, internment, and labor exploitation function paradoxically to indigenize Japanese North Americans as surplus labor through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism. My reading focuses on how Kogawa and Tajiri evoke this transformation in the way they denaturalize the settler landscape in relation to labor. Japanese Internment as Irrationality and Postmemory In both Canada and the United States, the motivation and objective of expulsion have never been completely clear. Historians agree that Japanese expulsion from the West Coast was not, contrary to the rationale given in 1942, due to military necessity—or, by extension, Pearl Harbor. In Canada, Army and Navy leaders, in addition to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, opposed mass expulsion. 8 Although US Navy chiefs were hostile to Japanese Americans, the army’s General Staff opposed wholesale removal and argued that the chances of Japanese invasion were negligible. Moreover, the army’s intelligence unit and the FBI concurred that there had been no Japanese American sabotage during or after the Pearl Harbor attack. 9 The fact that most Japanese civilians in Hawaii were not interned speaks to the lack of credible threat posed by Japanese Americans. Ultimately, as Greg Robinson observes, “the ‘security’ sought by the West Coast could not be resolved by ordinary means because it did not depend on meeting and neutralizing actual threats.” 10 If not a military threat, whatever security these governments pursued meant that the label of “enemy alien” would be applied to small children, including those removed from orphanages, and, in the United States, individuals with one-sixteenth Japanese blood. What, then, was the threatening content of Japaneseness that would necessitate such an expansive and meticulous removal project? Beyond the Pearl Harbor thesis, Japanese internment has also been viewed as a continuation of exclusionary anti-Asian racism that began in the nineteenth century, first targeting Chinese migrants through immigration laws and then extended to other Asian ethnic groups. However, this explanation does not identify what elements of immigrant restriction functioned as antecedents to the qualitative specificity of dispossession, relocation, and confinement that are particular to the Japanese experience on the West Coast of North America. As a result, Colleen Lye points out, “the reliance on racism to explain a historical causation often leads to a dehistorization of racism.” 11 In other words, while we are aware of racial dynamics that are clearly in play, it is unclear how anti-Japaneseness extends or exceeds the logics of prior anti-Asian racism. Lye describes this as a failure to grasp “both the racial logic of internment and its historical specificity.” 12 It remains ambiguous what kind of racial animus was mobilized leading up to such catastrophic policy decisions of 1942, which have retrospectively been viewed as an aberration of western democratic principles. Economic theories of Japanese internment, in contrast, stress its rationality from the standpoint of white capitalists who stood to benefit from Japanese dispossession. Here Japanese internment is thought to have been engineered by influential economic stakeholders who stood to gain from the elimination of competition from Japanese labor and businesses. According to Gary Okihiro and David Drummond’s materialist theory of anti–Japanese American exploitation, immigration restriction was a precursor to Japanese internment. They argue that the anti-Asian racism from 1900 to the Immigration Act of 1924—which introduced a national origins quota system and effectively halted all Asian immigration—was based on the extraction of surplus-value from migrant labor exploitation. This was followed by a second period from 1924 to 1942, characterized by a model of internal colonialism in which value was extracted from racial rent premiums. 13 These premiums were tied to the passage of the Alien Land Law in California in 1913, which restricted property ownership and transfer to “citizens,” thus barring the Issei, who were “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” Okihiro and Drummond argue that “the alien land laws served to maintain Japanese tenancy and thus their economic dependence.” 14 They suggest that the crisis presented by Pearl Harbor enabled a “return to exclusionism and offered an opportunity for immediate profit and the expulsion of the Japanese from the level of farm operators.” 15 What remains unclear from Okihiro and Drummond’s periodization of anti-Asian racism is why one mode of economic exploitation was supplanted by the other. As Lye asks, “If mass removal and internal colonialism both share the principal aim of economic gain, what explains the priority of ‘quick profits’ over the long-term attractions of systemic dependency at one moment compared to another?” 16 Because the long-term profitability of rent premiums would greatly exceed the returns on mass removal, the economic motivation for Japanese internment becomes less clear. Further distorting the economic rationale of the Alien Land Laws, these laws led not to the contraction but to the expansion of Japanese farm acreage, which doubled between 1910 and 1920. 17 This blurs the precise objective of the Alien Land Laws, though the looming intersection of racialized dispossession and white property is undeniable. Revising Okihiro and Drummond’s theory, I argue that it is racism’s economic irrationality rather than rationality that forms the central medium of anti-Japanese feeling. This economic irrationality is crucially tied to the fundamental misreading of capitalism that I’ve been tracking in this book, one that nevertheless projects the economic benefit of racist policy without being actualized. From an expanded North American perspective, the economic irrationality of anti-Japanese sentiment was also visible in the 1920s in Canada, particularly in the fishing industry. 18 As Ken Adachi explains, in the 1920s the Department of Marine Fisheries attempted to take measures to eliminate Japanese Canadian competition in the British Columbia fishing industry, “gradually eliminat[ing] Orientals from the fishery” by reducing the number of licenses issued to them. 19 The denial of fishing licenses to Japanese Canadians was, analogous to US Alien Land Laws, not necessarily effective, and the negative effects stemming from the loss of Japanese canners and fishermen from the industry once again complicate a clear profit motivation. 20 As Masako Fukawa notes, “When rigidly enforced, the license reductions had a negative impact on the existing fishing industry” because there were not enough white fishermen to take the place of Japanese fishermen. 21 The reductions also created hardships for white fishermen who profited from Japanese launching and tugging services. Moreover, the Japanese who were pushed out of fishing were able to successfully adapt to other industries, such as small-scale berry farming and forestry. Thus, as an editor of the Vancouver Province noted of the Japanese in 1930, “We have hunted the Orientals out of the fishing industry and they have gone to the woods and they have gone to the farms. . . . We haven’t diminished their numbers; we have simply pushed them about.” 22 While the economic benefits for whites of Japanese exclusion from agriculture and fishing before Pearl Harbor were not always straightforward, the economic opportunities Japanese internment produced for whites in both farming and fishing industries was more transparent. When used to view the forced sale of Japanese Canadians private property, David Harvey’s translation of Marx’s concept of primitive accumulation as “accumulation by dispossession” seems particularly apt. Indeed, for sympathetic whites who protested the forced sales, such property dispossession recalled the Nazi’s confiscation of Jewish property under the Nuremberg Laws. 23 What this economic history shows, however, is how anti-Japanese agitation both subverted and supported white labor interests. Building on arguments in previous chapters, the mixed economic legacy of Japanese expulsion from the West Coast is shaped by the interplay of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism and the destructive abstraction embodied by Japanese labor. From the fundamental misperception at the heart of romantic anticapitalism, ridding the West of Japanese labor was necessary to prevent economic destruction rather than to profit from their disappearance. Within this book’s larger argument that the abstract forces within capitalism are biologized as Asian , this chapter probes how the destructively abstract content of Japaneseness mutates after the mass expulsion of Japanese civilians from the West Coast. Following the previous chapters’ focus on Asian labor as perverse and antinatural signifiers of abstract labor, I focus on the way Japanese labor transforms in this period from a dehumanizing symbol of modernization into an ideal surplus labor force. This mutation in the meaning of Japanese labor was shaped by the upheavals caused by technological modernization. From the Great Depression through the post–World War II era, modernization had profound effects on labor, urbanization, and domesticity. Since the 1920s, agriculture and fishing industries where Japanese labor was concentrated were transformed by new technologies, such as gas-powered plows and early sonar, 24 innovations that were accompanied by these industries’ steady consolidation into corporate monopolies. 25 Population booms in California and Vancouver led to rapid urbanization and suburbanization, giving the West Coast a distinctly “modern” identity. “Midcentury modernism” was the retrospective name given to the aesthetic, architectural, and cultural revolution that accompanied these rapid changes, reflecting a movement away from ornate traditional styles and toward the heightened rationalism of clean lines, functionality, and simplicity. As Andrew Shanken observes, technology was seen a “civilizing force” whereby “better living” became synonymous with modern homes equipped with lighting, electric appliances, and other efficiencies. 26 But the dark side of the fetishization of technological convenience, speed, and mobility was the reconstitution of labor power, environmental change, and a recalibration of the social order. And embedded in this culture of rapid modernization were deeply felt anxieties about social and economic displacement, a breeding ground for romantic anticapitalism. 27 In this state of anxiety and unpredictability comes renewed attention on the evils of abstraction and the glory of nature, purity, and the concrete. Counterintuitively, the machine—the key agent of modernization—was often anthropomorphized and fetishized as “anticapitalist.” As Postone explains, the “positive emphasis on ‘nature,’ on blood, the soil, concrete labor, and Gemeinschaft , can easily go hand in hand with a glorification of technology and industrial capital.” 28 Therefore, it was not simply the identification of Japanese labor with mechanization that becomes the target of romantic anticapitalism but, as I will develop later, an association of Japanese labor efficiency with the creation of unnatural value that is symptomatic of the destructive consequences of modernization. Evolving from a prior racialization as perverse and unnatural signs of abstract labor in the period leading up to mass removal, Japaneseness became the specter of dehumanization against a world of “better living.” However, in the war’s aftermath, Japanese labor was increasingly praised, helping to give rise to the model minority myth. This suggests a profound resignification of Asian labor during Japanese relocation and internment, from being associated with a dangerous efficiency before the war to a commendable productivity after it. As my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts demonstrates, this resignification turns on the symbolic alignment of Japaneseness with the destructive economism of Jewishness before the war, transforming into an association with a romanticized noneconomism of Indigeneity after relocation and internment. Unlike the negative economic abstraction associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents a sphere external to capitalism, symbolizing romantic anticapitalism’s ideal of concrete nature and purity. Within this complex imaginary of Japanese internment, through which Japaneseness undergoes a shift from a symbolic alignment with the Jew to the figure of the Native, I situate Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts in the frame of postmemory. 29 Marianne Hirsch describes postmemory as an affective connection to traumatic experiences that precedes a generation’s birth. For Hirsch it is a way of contextualizing the memories of the children of Holocaust survivors, whose experiences were nevertheless shaped by “cultural or collective traumatic events . . . distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection.” 30 She explains further that “postmemory is a powerful and very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 31 Rea Tajiri’s experimental film memoir, History and Memory , offers a powerful evocation of Hirsch’s description of postmemory in the personal narration she weaves through the film. In the melancholic tone of her voice-over she explains the quandary of having memories disconnected from experience. As a Sansei born over a decade after the release of Japanese American internees from camps, she is haunted by recurring memories—memories of events she never experienced directly—that confuse her sense of identity. Her film becomes an archive of her efforts to probe the emotional residue of Japanese internment that has been implanted into her own subjective experience: I began searching for a history, my own history. Because I had known all along the stories I’d heard were not true and parts had been left out. I remember having this feeling when I was growing up that I was haunted by something, that I was living within a family of ghosts. There was this place they knew about. I had never been there, yet I had a memory for it. Adding to the surreal nature of her connection to a foreign history is her mother’s inability to remember her own experience of wartime relocation to a camp in Poston, Arizona. In the film, her mother’s soft, barely audible voice is heard explaining, “There are so many things I’ve forgotten.” Accompanying her voice is scrolling text that reads: She tells the story of what she doesn’t remember But remembers one thing: Why she forgot to remember. Thus Tajiri’s film explores the paradoxical interplay of history and memory, capturing an irony that David Eng describes where “the mother has history but no memory, while the daughter has memory but no history. 32 This forms the central irony of postmemory, in which traumatic memories and feelings of loss are unconsciously passed from one generation to the next. Its haunting effects manifest in unrelieved sadness, akin to the experience that Grace Cho describes as transgenerational haunting, “a repetition of trauma that resists all attempts to erase it from personal and public memory.” 33 Eng situates Tajiri’s postmemory in the domain of melancholia, identifying how “the most difficult losses suffered in melancholia are unconscious ones, psychic forfeitures that cannot be properly grieved.” 34 Working through the melancholic layers of postmemory, the film gives visual representation to the negative space of Japanese internment. I expand on the “post-” of postmemory in my reading of Joy Kogawa’s Obasan , referring not only to the memory that exists “after,” as in the case of Tajiri’s film, but also “beyond.” Here I am referring to the unconscious, psychic world of attachments that both draw on and exceed memory. Because she is a reserved person, much of the protagonist Naomi Nakane’s emotional complexity is conveyed through her graphic, often violent nightmares and daydreams—the negative space of her conscious, rational mind. Her dreams often take place in a wilderness landscape, peopled by relatives, bayonet-wielding soldiers, prosthetic-limbed women, and deceptively “real”-looking robots. Like Asawa’s inverted tree, these gothic landscapes convey the unconscious attachments and fears tied to the crisis of relocation, which, in the case of Naomi, is coupled with the disappearance of her mother. In addition, another sense of how the post of postmemory goes “beyond” memory in the novel is in the expression of dialectical consciousness. Although Kogawa experienced Japanese internment in Canada as a child, her novel’s blend of autobiographical elements, government documents, and archival sources accentuates the contested nature of personal memory and official history. If the “truth” exists, it exists somewhere between and beyond the text’s multiple authorial voices. 35 Similar to Tajiri’s mother, as an adult Naomi has repressed her internment experience: of relocation to a ghost town in the interior of British Columbia and postwar dispersal to a beet farm in Granton, Alberta. The terrain of memory that Naomi uncovers is neither linear, individual, nor finite. Mona Oikawa describes Naomi’s complex reckoning with the past this way: “As [she] struggles to remember and to know, she confronts the complex ways in which memory is revelatory, both through remembering and forgetting.” 36 Thus the post of post-memory also refers to the memory of willful forgetting. The Jewish Question In Obasan and History and Memory , the economic modality of anti-Japanese sentiment is rendered through moments of cross-racial identification and, as I argue in the following section, through the postmemory of landscape. First, in indirect and overt examples, the persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime and the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples serve as analogical frames for each text’s reckoning with the meaning of Japanese internment. In Obasan , general observations of economic jealousy subtly refract the financial modality of anti-Semitism. As Naomi sorts through old letters in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, she comes across one of the many unopened letters her Aunt Emily wrote to her sister, Naomi’s mother, who was unable to return home from a visit to Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In the letter, written before the family’s expulsion from Vancouver, Aunt Emily reveals an awareness of economic resentment of Japanese Canadian prosperity, noting that “when gas rationing starts [Dad] won’t be able to use the car much. It’s so sleek it’s an affront to everyone he passes. I wish he’d bought something more modest, but you know Dad.” 37 Presumably the car is also an affront to less affluent Japanese Canadians, but its acquisition also symbolizes Japanese mobility and access to liberal individualism, a status historically aligned with and guarded by whites. Later in the letter, after enumerating the way Japanese Canadians have become the enemy, Aunt Emily makes a more pointed connection between the effects of war on Jews and Japanese Canadians: The things that go on in wartime! Think of Hitler shiploading people into Poland or Germany proper to work for nothing in fields and factories far from home and children—stealing food from conquered people—captive labor. . . . War breeds utter insanity. Here at home there’s mass hatred of us simply because we’re of Japanese origin. 38 In this passage, Aunt Emily’s observations of Nazi tactics serve as an eerie premonition of what will ensue for Japanese Canadians, as Naomi’s father will be sent to labor on a road camp, while the remaining family will be twice relocated before settling as exploited labor on a beet farm in Alberta. Decades after the war, Aunt Emily becomes more direct in her allusions to Nazism as a cultural force. In answer to her rhetorical question “Why in a time of war with Germany and Japan would our government seize the property and homes of Canadian-born Canadians but not the homes of German-born Germans?” she replies to herself, “Racism. . . . The Nazis are everywhere.” 39 Thus from prewar to postwar reflections on Japanese internment, anti-Japanese sentiment is expressed through the economic and racial prism of anti-Semitism. Rea Tajiri’s film-memoir also makes reference to the specter of anti-Semitism, but as a threatening identification that is actively suppressed. Without sound, she incorporates scrolling text to highlight the way Japanese internment continues to be sanitized of any connotations of Nazi Germany: NEW YORK TIMES AUGUST 28, 1990 ASSEMBLYMAN GIL FERGUSON, REPUBLICAN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIF., SEEKS TO HAVE CHILDREN TAUGHT THAT JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE NOT INTERNED IN “CONCENTRATION CAMPS,” BUT RATHER WERE HELD IN “RELOCATION CENTERS” JUSTIFIED BY MILITARY NECESSITY. Tajiri’s inclusion of this text indicates that in 1990, forty-five years after the end of World War II, two years after the successful redress campaign, and following exhaustive debunking of theories of “military necessity,” the primary meaning of Japanese internment remains subject to ongoing deferral. 40 In light of wartime atrocities committed by the Nazis, Roosevelt’s initial references to Japanese “concentration camps” were actively redacted. As a result, Japanese internment could only be described through euphemism and negation, as not a concentration camp. Obasan ’s Aunt Emily shares a similar reaction to the discursive construction of internment camps as “Interior Housing Projects.” She observes, “With language like that you can disguise any crime.” 41 Tajiri’s silent, scrolling text thus captures the discursive predicament that Japanese internment poses, while emphasizing the ongoing threat of identifying Japanese internment with the symbolism of the Nazi regime. If we pursue the vexed intersection of Japanese internment and anti-Semitism raised in these texts, we find similar deferrals of meaning that attend the Holocaust. Moishe Postone’s reflection on West Germany’s emotional response to the late 1970s American television miniseries Holocaust illuminates some of the interpretive impasse that, in analogous fashion, surrounds Japanese internment in North America. In pursuing this intersection, my intention is not to conflate the stark disparity of outcomes of “concentration camps” in Europe and North America; rather, it is to further uncover an intersecting economism of anti-Semitic and anti-Japanese racialization. Observing the tendency in postwar Germany of Germans to deny having knowledge of the wartime existence of extermination camps, Postone reflects on the underlying sentiment masked by appeals to ignorance: “‘We didn’t know’ should be understood as ‘we still don’t want to know.’” 42 What Holocaust ultimately exposed about the public horrors against Jews, Russians, and Poles that occurred outside the camps “undermined the fiction that Nazi genocide was the affair of a small handful of people operating within a context hermetically sealed off from most of the soldiers as well as the rest of the German population.” 43 Similar to the ostensibly arbitrary but coordinated will of multiple governments to expel, confine, and/or deport Japanese civilians in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the precise motivation within National Socialism for exterminating Jews continues to evolve in the postwar era. Postone troubles theories of fascism and racial prejudice because neither can sufficiently account for what he calls the “qualitative specificity” 44 of the extermination of European Jews. This specificity, he observes, will “remain inexplicable so long as anti-Semitism is treated as a specific example of prejudice, xenophobia and racism in general, as an example of a scapegoat strategy whose victims could very well have been members of any other group.” 45 Within this qualitative specificity, neither fascism nor racism in general can explain why, during the German army’s defeat by the Red Army, they allocated a significant number of vehicles to transport Jews to gas chambers rather than for military reinforcements. 46 This reveals a biopolitics in which the extermination of Jews served a greater purpose than the preservation of German soldiers’ lives. Rather than profiting from the elimination of Jews, their extermination was itself a mode of German self-preservation against the evils of capitalism that Jews represented. What Japanese internment and the Holocaust share is a romantic anticapitalist logic. The transnational frame magnifies how Japanese North Americans were not interned to protect the coast, to rob them of their property (although white citizens certainly profited from their dispossession), to protect them, or to test their loyalty. Neither was the Holocaust motivated by profit or wartime security interests: “They were not exterminated for military reasons, or in order to violently acquire land (as was the case with American Indians and the Tasmanians), or in order to wipe out those segments of the population around whom resistance could most easily crystallize.” 47 Rather, in the case of Jews, the qualitative specificity was due to the kind of secular power attributed to them. This power was defined not as the resistance of an oppressed underclass but, rather, as the potentially greater force of a super-race—an overclass—whose power was “mysteriously intangible, abstract and universal.” 48 Given that romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes and glorifies the concrete dimensions of capitalist social relations, the abstract dimension “must find a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression.” 49 This biological carrier came in the form of the Jew: Because this power is not bound concretely, is not “rooted,” it is of staggering immensity and is extremely difficult to check. It stands behind phenomena, but is not identical with them. Its source is therefore hidden—conspiratorial. The Jews represent an immensely powerful, intangible, international conspiracy. 50 Within this romantic anticapitalist system of representation, Jews represented an immensely powerful conspiratorial force that contributed to the decline of traditional social formations, values, and institutions. Thus the eradication of Jews under National Socialism was a mode of preservation from the abstract evils of capitalism. If mass removal and internment of Japanese civilians in Canada and the United States was a protective measure, it was for the similarly mysterious and immense power attributed to them. This power, like that represented by European Jews, was defined not by the resistant power of the racialized poor, like that of African American or First Nations communities, but as a destructive economic conspiracy. The dangerous content of the power attributed to Japanese communities along the West Coast was alien, intangible, conspiratorial, and international. In contrast to European Jews’ segregation in financial sectors of the labor market—an alignment that was strongly associated with the abstract dimension of capitalism within the binarized social universe of romantic anticapitalism—Japanese communities were associated with farming, fishing, and retail labor. How did their labor come to represent such a negative power? In order to appreciate how the Japanese became “a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression” for the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, we can track the continuity in the evolution of racialized characterizations of “cheap” Chinese labor to the “excessive efficiency” of Japanese labor. As we saw in chapter 1 , Chinese associations with the temporal domination of abstract time rendered them a perverse, abstract counterpart to white “concrete” labor. In the rapidly industrializing context of nineteenth-century railroad building and mining, the laboring Chinese body came to signify the consolidation of abstract, homogeneous time that threatened normative social reproduction. Within this regime of intensified labor time, therefore, the Chinese body stood for the devaluation of white labor. In chapter 2 I explored how, when Asian immigration came largely to a halt in the 1920s in the United States and Canada, a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism was expressed in the masculinist personification of nature. As an embodiment of the temporal domination of abstract labor, which is fundamental to the determination of the value of labor-power, Asian aliens represented an antinatural force of value formation—the abstract antithesis of a concrete, pure, and Indigenous natural world. During the global Great Depression and in its aftermath, liberal protections in Canada and the United States intervened in determining the value of labor power to stabilize capitalism, with strategies that included minimum wage standards in British Columbia and Roosevelt’s New Deal labor safeguards in the 1930s. These worker protections may have subdued the perception that Asian bodies represented an abstract, alien force that devalued concrete white labor power. 51 However, as Japanese labor and ownership of boats, land, and equipment expanded alongside developments in industrial modernization, the abstract power embodied by Asian labor no longer represented the devaluation of white labor; rather, it represented the creation of unnatural value . The excessive industry associated with Japanese labor was threatening precisely because it fed a perception that they had control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. The form of relative surplus-value associated with the excessive industry of Japanese labor is transient. In “The Concept of Relative Surplus Value” in Capital , Marx asks why individual capitalists are driven to innovate, especially because their innovations are beneficial to the entire capitalist class. Specifically, efficiency measures reduce the value of labor power, increase the rate of exploitation, and generate more surplus-value. 52 Are innovators selfless individuals motivated to bolster the capitalist class? Marx says no: individual capitalists are driven to innovate not out of class interests but out of individual interests. When a capitalist innovates to produce a commodity more efficiently, the value of his or her product temporarily falls below its social value, which means “they have cost less labour-time than the great bulk of the same article produced under the average social conditions.” 53 As discussed in previous chapters, the immaterial but objective source of value is socially necessary labor time: “The real value of a commodity is not its individual, but its social value; that is to say, its value is not measured by the labour-time that the article costs the producer in each individual case, but the labour-time socially required for its production.” 54 The crucial gap between the actual time it takes to produce a product after innovations have been introduced and the socially necessary labor time is what yields a surplus on surplus-value. This extra profit—the relative surplus-value —is precisely what motivates the individual capitalist to innovate. However, this extra profit is only temporary. Once other capitalists adopt the same labor-saving innovation, the socially necessary labor time will adjust accordingly. As Marx explains, “This extra surplus-value vanishes as soon as the new method of production is generalized, for then the difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value vanishes.” 55 Because of the coercive nature of competition, the capitalist interest to profit from the temporal gap between a product’s individual and social value—the gap that constitutes relative surplus-value—is implicit within capitalism. What this means is that technical innovation or technological modernization does not occur solely as a result of someone’s creative genius; rather, as Marx emphasizes, “capital . . . has an immanent drive, and a constant tendency, towards increasing the productivity of labour, in order to cheapen commodities and, by cheapening commodities, to cheapen the worker himself.” 56 Innovation is part of capitalism’s “immanent drive” to devalue labor. Within this book’s larger claim that the abstract forces within capitalism are personified as Asian, the harmful content of Japanese labor thus appears as a negative symptom of modernizing innovation, whose destructive power catalyzes the unnatural creation of relative surplus-value. Evolving from an unnatural sign of abstraction, the Asian becomes a specter of destructive innovation in a landscape of ceaseless modernization. Born-Again Native Paradoxically, the obverse of the destructive economism traditionally associated with Jews occurs in a second mode of cross-racial identification depicted in Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts: symbolic attachments to and reflections on Indigenous peoples. In this case, I suggest that Japanese identification with Native peoples both replicates and exceeds the settler colonial romantic attachment to the Native in ways that reveal a transformation in the way Asians constitute abstract labor. As I discuss below, their identification with Native peoples is further shaped by the settler colonial conflation of Japanese enemy aliens with Native peoples. Japanese relocation, dispossession, and confinement thus emerge within a dual identificatory framework of anti-Semitic and settler colonial regimes. In Obasan , Naomi repeatedly aligns herself and members of her Japanese Canadian family with First Nations’ identities. At the onset of the novel, she accompanies her uncle to the ravine and imagines him as an American Indian warrior hero: Uncle could be Chief Sitting Bull squatting here. He has the same prairie-baked skin, the deep brown furrows like dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks. All he needs is a feather headdress, and he would be perfect for a picture postcard—“Indian Chief from Canadian Prairie”—souvenir of Alberta, made in Japan. 57 Here the optics of Japanese Canadian racial form are staged in correspondence to Native identity. The narrator’s depiction functions as an attempt to indigenize Uncle on two levels: first, his Indigeneity stems from a phenotypical convergence with Chief Sitting Bull that results in their same “prairie-baked skin,” and second, Uncle’s Indigeneity is established through his figurative embodiment of landscape, with “dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks.” Although this portrayal clearly intends to naturalize Japanese Canadians to the landscape, it also acknowledges the iterative circuits of dispossession and commodification that make it possible for a Japanese import to offer a “picture postcard” vision of Indigeneity. Naomi projects a similar analogy between Obasan, her aunt, and an Indigenous fighter. Gauging her aunt’s inability to integrate into a community of elderly white Canadians, she concludes that Obasan would be as “welcome as a Zulu warrior.” 58 Later, describing her moribund life as a schoolteacher, Naomi once again pauses to reflect on a shared Japanese and Native disposition. 59 She observes that “some of the Native children I’ve had in my classes over the years could almost pass for Japanese, and vice versa. There’s something in the animal-like shyness I recognize in the dark eyes. A quickness to look away.” 60 The implications of these figurative projections of cross-racial identification are justifiably vexed. On one hand, as Marie Lo explains, these identifications “blur the boundaries of what is Native and what is Japanese,” placing Japanese Canadians on a broader colonial continuum that begins with dispossession of Indigenous people. 61 On the other, as Lo also points out, these modes of Native identification participate in a long-standing Canadian settler nationalism that has sought to “elaborate a national and autochthonous claim to the land” 62 through white identifications with the figure of the Native. That the novel similarly attempts to naturalize Japanese Canadians is reflected no less problematically in Aunt Emily’s continual refrain “This is my own, my native land.” 63 However, as I suggest below, the precondition for this problematic identification with the Native is the dehumanizing effects of their transformation into surplus labor. Relocated to work a beet farm under postwar dispersal orders, the combined sterility of the landscape and tropes of human degeneracy expose the eliminatory logic of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. Tajiri’s film contains more subtle reflections on Japanese and Native American crossings, less through the mode of identification than spatial intersection. After her family was removed to the Salinas Rodeo Grounds barracks, Tajiri explains how they were relocated again by train to Poston, Arizona, “to live in part of an Indian reservation converted into a concentration camp.” The camp was built on a section of the Colorado River Tribal Indian Reservation. Tajiri’s film delicately probes the intersection of Japanese internees and Native residents by foregrounding the ironies of colonial dispossession. When she travels to Poston, a resident explains how “the government came in and overnight took over a section of the reservation and started to build the camps.” Tajiri emphasizes the poor quality of the barracks, which were made “of this really cheap unseasoned pine and finished [off] with this tar paper.” Later, she explains, “they tried to offer the barracks back to the Native Americans as compensation for the use of the land.” From this vantage point, Poston becomes a space where the dispossessed and the recipients of government “welfare” confront each other as exchangeable figures of colonial management. A single group photograph of Native mothers and children, titled 1942, Native American Residents, Poston , further accentuates how the internment camp was a space that, as Jodi Byrd points out, spatializes a “recursive colonialism that, during World War II, served to enjamb Japanese American detainees within the histories of containment and expropriation that strip lands and nations from American Indians.” 64 The intersection of Indigenous colonization and Japanese internment in the historical record further exemplifies the conflating tendency of this “recursive colonialism.” In particular, the bureaucratic structure governing the incarceration of 113,000 Japanese Americans in ten remote concentration camps was modeled on existing colonial operations. From 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA ) was largely staffed by personnel from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA ). Exemplifying the BIA-WRA connection was Dillon Myers, a ten-year veteran of the Indian Service, who was made director of the WRA for four years at Gila, Arizona, before assuming leadership of the BIA in 1950. 65 The similarities between the way the US government handled American Indians and Japanese internees often stemmed from Myers’s conflation of Japanese and Indigenous bodies. A colleague once assessed Myers’s tendency to collapse the two racial groups, remarking, “Like all of those guys [in the Indian Service] he feels that there are only two kinds of Indians—gooduns and baduns—and feels that Japs are Indians.” 66 Behind the barbed wire, Japanese internees at Poston, Arizona, drew similar comparisons in their inquiries about whether “they would be ‘kept’ the rest of their lives on reservations like Indians.” 67 Indeed, one of Eleanor Roosevelt’s chief objections to Japanese internment camps was that it risked producing a culture of dependency: “If we don’t look out we will create another Indian problem.” 68 Once Japanese Americans were interned, the economic threat associated with them was resignified as the economic burden of social welfare. In Canada, the government’s instinct was similarly to conflate Japanese internees and First Nations peoples. When the federal government was devising plans for the expulsion of twenty-two thousand Japanese Canadians from the hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, officials explored the possibility of using First Nations residential schools as sites for their internment. Although this plan was never executed, bureaucratic discourse functioned to fuse Japanese Canadians and First Nations as similarly alien to a white Canada and to promote Indigenous colonization as a useful template for Japanese internment. Mona Oikawa explains that one officer reporting to the British Columbia Security Commission stated, “We are hoping that mutually satisfactory arrangements can be made with your Commission so that the present staff could look after the Japanese on the basis somewhat similar to that applying in the case of the Indians.” 69 Thus, in stark contrast to conspiratorial and destructive associations of economic power, Japanese internees are here aligned with colonial subjects, who, as the last chapter demonstrated, have been romanticized as existing outside of time and money. One reading suggested by these seemingly incompatible identifications, from the abstract economism of the Jewish analogy to the concrete noneconomism of the Native analogy, is that Japanese internment and dispersal renovated the connotation of Japanese labor from that of unnatural, excessive industry to some other, more benevolent expression of labor symbolically aligned with Native peoples. Jodi Kim refers to this transformation as a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation,” in which Japanese American and Japanese Canadian subjects are transformed into a “model minority.” 70 Building on this approach, I turn now to the way Kogawa and Tajiri unpack the question of labor resignification and consider its implications for our understanding of the relationship between settler colonialism and romantic anticapitalism. Going Native as Surplus Labor Drawing on the way settler nationalism informs the use of Native figures in contemporary Anglophone Canadian literature, Marie Lo argues that Obasan ’s representation of Native figures “can be seen as a variant on mainstream nationalism, whereby authors who are marginalized and prevented from identifying with dominant Anglo-Canadian culture can find in Native culture ‘a prior superior culture with which to identify.’” 71 My own analysis examines the material preconditions for the novel’s alignment with Native identities. This effort is intended to serve a broader objective: to mine the transnationality of Japanese internment in North America through the figurative and spatial alignment with Indigenous peoples that is present in both Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts. If the figure of the Native functions as a settler colonial trope intended to naturalize Japanese Canadians, my analysis excavates the conditions of possibility that make such a trope accessible and legible within the imaginary of Japanese internment. In the case of Obasan , it is largely in the aftermath of the family’s double removal that an identification with Native peoples is most explicit. Specifically, Naomi’s descriptions of Uncle as Sitting Bull and Obasan as a Zulu warrior occur after decades living in Granton, Alberta. I argue that two elements condition this identification: first, that the figurative identification with Native identities relies on the symbolic transformation of labor from excessive efficiency to commendable productivity; and second, that this transformation is expressed as a process of devitalization, of both the land and the laborers themselves. What the novel exposes, therefore, is that the dehumanization of surplus labor reflects the eliminatory core of settler colonialism’s romantic fantasy of the Native and reveals the necropolitical interplay of settler colonialism’s relation to land and labor. Although the subject of labor has not been a central literary concern in Obasan criticism, it is essential to the historical context that Kogawa’s novel excavates. 72 As part of the West Coast removal process, the government created road labor camps for all able-bodied Japanese Canadian men to make badly needed improvements on neglected roadways in the hinterlands of British Columbia. 73 Sugar beet farmers who were desperate for wartime labor also capitalized on the removal orders by petitioning the government for Japanese Canadian laborers. 74 At the war’s end, when Japanese Canadians were forced to choose between deportation or “Eastern Placement”—relocation east of the Rockies—the Labour Department was responsible for expanding its network of placement offices. Having enjoyed the economic boom that Japanese labor brought to the beet-farming industry in Alberta, industry leaders benefited further from the continued West Coast exclusion orders. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. 75 This labor history figures in the material and speculative worlds of the Obasan . These policies had a direct impact on the reconfiguration of Naomi’s family, given that her uncle and father are among the men dispatched to remote road labor camps. Like many married men, Uncle is eventually permitted to rejoin the family in Slocan, the ghost town where they are interned. For reasons never made clear, Naomi’s father Tadashi is not reunited with the family until the war’s end. The family’s existence becomes increasingly abject after the war, when they are relocated again as part of the dispersal policy. Perhaps due to his frailty, the Department of Labor deems Tadashi “unsuitable for Eastern Placement,” 76 which results in his continued separation from the family and eventual death. The family is relocated to Granton, Alberta, where they endure the misery of being labor hands on the Barker beet farm, their home a converted chicken coop. For Naomi, it is the beet farm that becomes a central source of her trauma, the living nightmare of double relocation: “I cannot bear the memory. There are some nightmares from which there is no waking, only deeper and deeper sleep.” 77 Transforming reality into the language of dreams, these years on the Barker farm are what she refers to as the “sleepwalk years.” 78 The novel’s retrospective view of Japanese Canadian relocation emphasizes the mechanical degeneration of organic purity, of life reduced to deathly abjection. In Naomi’s dream-memories, the Japanese are progressively deanimated in a lifeless landscape. After Uncle dies, Naomi is pulled back to her postwar home in Granton, Alberta, to come to the side of her aging Obasan, her aunt and primary caregiver through and after the war years. She returns to find the house and her aunt in a parallel state of somnambulance, the house a living appendage of Obasan’s frail body, “where memories and dreams seep and mingle through cracks, settling on furniture and into upholstery.” 79 In Naomi’s first dream in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, its nightmarish quality turns on mechanical deception in nature. In the dream Naomi descends into what seems a prelapsarian Eden, but a heavy mist coats the landscape and at turns, transforms its human subjects. As the dream progresses, what comes into foggy relief is how nature meets the mechanical in a field of labor. In Naomi’s dream, the degeneration of human labor is figured as a process of prostheticization that highlights the dissonant intersection of Indigenous nature and mechanized efficiency. Accompanied by a nameless man, Naomi’s dream avatar descends on a mountainside forest to encounter another man and woman. For a fleeting moment, she catches a glimpse of the woman’s beauty, appearing “as she once was, naked, youthful, voluptuous.” 80 In this instant, the woman is Eve—pure, fertile, and without shame. But the vision quickly changes to reveal the woman in her current, fallen state. The dream’s imagery underscores the mechanistic degeneration of the human body. Her seductive curves have been transformed into sharp angles: “Her face is now harsh again and angular as quartz. . . . Her body, a matching squareness, is dense as earth.” 81 The vitality of the woman Naomi first encounters morphs into harsh quartz angularity. Her squareness suggests a uniformity and steel symmetry; she has more in common with metal than with flesh. The reference to her square body, as “dense as earth,” lends an organicism to her embodiment, yet the heaviness of the simile evokes death and entombment. The glimmer of Indigenous, Eve-like purity—“naked, youthful, voluptuous”—is transformed into the organic burden of earth that pulls the body downward so she is capable only of movements that are “slow and heavy as sleep.” 82 Labor enters the dream as an allegory of Naomi’s work on the Barker farm. In her dream nature and animate bodies undergo discipline and are transformed into disembodied, devitalized androids. The square woman is engaged in repetitive labor, her back bent over as her “arms sway and swing, front to back, back to front” 83 wielding a sickle, “harvesting the forest’s debris, gathering the branches into piles.” 84 Alongside her is a man, “taller thinner and precise—a British martinet.” 85 Naomi observes that he is in command; equipped with “pruner’s shears, he is cutting the trees.” 86 With her companion, Naomi is silently entreated into joining the woman and man in labor, threatened by the martinet, whose glance is “a raised baton”: 87 We move without question or references in an interminable unknowing without rules, without direction. No incident alerts us to an awareness of time. But at some subtle hour, the white mist is known to be gray, and the endlessness of labor has entered our limbs. Weariness. 88 The man, a vision of patriarchal militaristic authority, enforces the monotonous repetition of their labor, while his pruner’s shears cut into and discipline the natural landscape. He is accompanied by a “huge gentle beast—a lion or a dog” whose “obedience is phenomenal.” 89 But the beast too, to Naomi’s shock, is plastic: “The animal is a robot!” 90 What alerts her is its frozen yawn “when the mechanism that hinges the jaws has proven faulty.” 91 By this point, she observes that the laboring woman’s arms are now connected by “four hooks locked to make a hinge . . . [which] dangles as she approaches.” 92 Therefore, in the process of disciplining the landscape, animate bodies undergo prosthetic degeneration, while deceptively real-looking robots take the place of animals. There is no place here even for language, which devolves in this landscape of mechanized beings. Naomi hears the woman speaking, “but the words are so old they cannot be understood. . . . The language has been forgotten.” 93 The destructive rationalism and robotification in the dream allegorize both the progressive dehumanization of labor and the settler colonial disciplining of nature. Moreover, the dream accentuates the dehumanizing condition of surplus labor and the eliminatory spirit of settler colonialism. The dream’s apocalyptic vision of mechanized dehumanization captures the profound abjection of her years working on the devitalized landscape of the Barkers’ beet farm. 94 Like the machine people in her dream, the farm landscape is barren and unnatural. As though the land had been subjected to the pruning shears of the British martinet of Naomi’s nightmare, “here and there are straight unnatural rows of fierce almost leafless trees pruned like the brooms of a chimney sweep.” 95 Even the air is unwelcoming and brutal: “Here, the air is a fist.” 96 In this landscape where “plant growth is deliberate and fierce,” 97 both nature and machines are associated with death and confinement. “Round skull-shaped weeds” grow along the miles of “barbed wire fences,” 98 while “skeletons of farm machinery” lie between the shed and the farmhouse “like the remains of dinosaurs in a prehistoric battleground.” 99 Naomi’s dream refracts the prehistory of this lifeless landscape of coerced, unnatural growth. Succumbing to its deadening effects, Naomi feels like a “scarecrow or a skeleton in the wind.” 100 Her brother Stephen, too, is later haunted by monstrous scenes of mechanized nature, once dreaming that “a metallic insect the size of a tractor [was] webbing a grid of iron bars over him.” 101 Technological rationalism has turned the natural world upside-down, evoking the nightmarish scenes of her dream’s landscape of human degeneration and artifice. The condition of possibility for the way the novel attempts to indigenize Japanese Canadians through analogies to Native peoples centers on the dehumanization of labor. In this unnatural world, Naomi herself embodies the degeneration of the prosthetic-limbed woman who appears in her dream. Reproducing the metamorphosis of the woman from “youthful” and “voluptuous” into a harsh, square body with a face “angular as quartz,” 102 Naomi, too, “mind[s] growing ugly” in this prisonlike atmosphere where hardships are “so pervasive, so inescapable, so thorough it’s a noose around my chest and I cannot move anymore.” 103 Like the “endlessness of labor” 104 in the dream, Naomi’s work on the beet farm is a nightmare of repetition where she “will never be done thinning and weeding and weeding and weeding,” to the point that her body begins to degenerate into an empty shell while her “tear glands burn out.” 105 Collectively the family is turned into automatons that switch on or off, “obedient as machines,” 106 through their days filled with the emptiness of labor, seemingly outside of time, space, and sound: “There are no other people in the entire world. We work together all day. At night we eat and sleep. We hardly talk anymore.” 107 There is nothing of the symbolic purification in working the land associated with a romantic settler colonial vision of landscape. In this inverted world, both landscape and labor are disciplined and denaturalized into mechanical abstraction, which, as I will discuss further below, exemplifies the racialized condition of surplus labor. Through this gothic transformation of landscape and labor—and continued exclusion from the West Coast—the dangerous economism of Japanese labor in the prewar period mutates to commendable productivity; the enemy alien morphs into the ideal surplus labor population. As Naomi sifts through Aunt Emily’s package of wartime letters and documents, she finds a newspaper clipping filed under “Facts about evacuees in Alberta.” 108 A caption that reads “‘Grinning and Happy’: Find Jap Evacuees Best Beet Workers” accompanies a photograph of a smiling Japanese Canadian family posing by a pile of beets. 109 The article praises the all-time record crop produced by Japanese “evacuee” labor, who worked 65 percent of Alberta’s sugar beet acreage: “Generally speaking, Japanese evacuees have developed into most efficient beet workers, many of them being better than the transient workers who cared for beets in southern Alberta before Pearl Harbor.” 110 This account of the bountiful yields attributed to Japanese labor is striking in its contrast to the dangerous efficiency of prewar Japanese Canadian fishing crews, which previously warranted restrictions on licenses and even the use of gas-powered boats. Thus the symbolic transformation in the postwar era, to be celebrated as commendable productivity, turns on the relocation and resignification of labor. What is especially telling about the article is how Japanese labor is no longer set in relation to white labor. Rather than competing with white labor on the West Coast, the newspaper clipping positions Japanese labor in relation to “transient workers.” In short, Japanese Canadian laborers are reconstituted as superior figures of transient labor, which is possible only after their relocation and confinement. Under these coercive and immobilizing conditions of labor, what enables the mutation of Japanese Canadian labor is their alignment with surplus laboring populations referred to as the “transient workers” in the article. Shedding racialized associations to abstract labor, which is perceived as having a destructive hold on the creation of unnatural, relative surplus-value, Japanese labor is reconstituted into what Marx terms an “industrial reserve army.” As a surplus labor population, they regulate—for the benefit of capitalists—the interplay of technological innovation and human labor productivity in the process of capital accumulation. Marx describes the indispensable role played by the surplus population as follows: But if a surplus population of workers is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, this surplus population also becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalist accumulation, indeed it becomes a condition of the existence of the capitalist mode of production. It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, which belongs to capital just as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates a mass of human material always ready for exploitation by capital in the interests of capital’s own changing valorization requirements. 111 Clarifying the expendability at the root of this mode of labor exploitation, Roderick Ferguson explains, “Both superfluous and indispensable, surplus populations fulfill and exceed the demands of capital.” 112 It is precisely the condition of being disposable that I suggest produces the structural alignment with Native peoples who, as primary subjects of colonial elimination, are also exploited and similarly transformed into latent and then stagnant members of the industrial reserve army. 113 They are wage laborers who are subject to capitalism’s need for labor power in uneven quantities and qualities over space and time. Describing the effect of capitalism’s ability to “pivot” labor power, Ruth Gilmore explains that as “systemic expansions and contractions produce and throw off workers, those idled must wait, migrate, or languish until—if ever—new opportunities to sell their labor power emerge.” 114 This also demonstrates how settler colonial logics of elimination (from land) and exclusion (as exploited alien labor) are not mutually exclusive but dialectically connected. Given that the Native reservation system and urban relocation programs in Canada and the United States functioned to entrench the disposability of Indigenous labor, 115 Native people were especially susceptible to irregular employment. As such, as Marx notes, this surplus labor group “offers capital an inexhaustible reservoir of disposable labour power.” 116 Therefore, despite Naomi’s anger at the characterization of Japanese beet farm laborers as “Grinning and Happy,” it is this, their resignification as surplus labor, that connects Japanese bodies not to racialized value production but to the racialization of surplus labor populations, chief among them First Nations labor. 117 The availability of cross-racial identification in the novel turns on the transformation of Japanese abstract labor into surplus labor, a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation” that renews a white settler colonial hierarchy. 118 In sum, Obasan ’s presentation of a landscape of devitalization, a place where “something dead is happening, like the weeds that are left to bleach,” 119 offers several remaining insights. First, in this inverted world, the rehumanization of Japanese Canadians as surplus laborers who are “Grinning and Happy” relies on their dehumanization and dispossession. In other words, this indigenization reveals the dehumanized content at the core of romantic idealization of Native peoples. Second, in Kogawa’s identification of Uncle with Chief Sitting Bull and Obasan with a Zulu warrior—non-Canadian Indigenous peoples from the United States and South Africa, respectively—they exemplify a dual condition of alien-ness and Indigeneity that highlights the dialectical interplay of land and labor under settler colonialism that expropriates Indigenous land and exploits racialized labor. That the postwar period saw the coerced recruitment of Native laborers to fill more labor shortages in the southern Alberta sugar beet industry until the 1980s further exemplifies the instrumentality of disposable labor populations, which embodied the condition of hyperexploitability: it was more profitable to consign these laborers to seasonal hand labor than to rely on costlier machines and chemicals. As the central pivot in facilitating the evolution to modern, better living in western Canada, racialized surplus labor bridges the necropolitical dimension of Native elimination to alien exclusion. In Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory , the mutation of Japanese labor is similarly expressed in the devitalization associated with the landscape on a Native reservation. Unlike the purely symbolic identification with Native identities in Obasan , in Tajiri’s film indigenization turns on the relocation and confinement of Japanese internees to the shared colonial site of the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Poston, Arizona. Her film offers an illuminating complement to Kogawa’s focus on the degenerative, mechanistic landscape of surplus labor on the beet farm by further probing the dark registers of Japanese internment that are refracted onto the reservation. Contrasting the way the colonial disciplining and rehabilitation of racialized labor are mirrored in the disciplined, unnatural landscape in Obasan , the landscape in History and Memory also serves as a witness to the modes of erasure enacted upon Japanese labor. Through a combination of reenacted memories, Hollywood movie reels, text, and voice-overs, Japanese internment is presented as a source of knowledge that can be accessed only indirectly, through these tangled strands of representation. These are the multimedia artifacts of postmemory—memories and visions that are transmitted into Tajiri’s consciousness from elsewhere. As David Eng observes of the documentary’s experimental aesthetic, “Tajiri presents us with a complex argument concerning the supplemental relationship between political and affective histories of Japanese American internment that cannot be easily reconciled with dominant US or Japanese American accounts of the event.” 120 In particular, recurring scenes of water—connected to land irrigation and a water tower—overturn water’s associations with vitality and purification. Instead, water imagery serves as a collective trace of devitalization and degeneration. The theme of water is first established through repeated dramatizations of a memory that haunts Tajiri because it is not her own. In the vision her mother crouches at an outdoor tap, filling a canteen. We can identify the vision as postmemory from Tajiri’s description: I don’t know where this came from but I just had this fragment, this picture that’s always been in my mind. My mother, she’s standing at a faucet and it’s really hot outside, and she’s filling this canteen. And the water’s really cold, and it feels really good. And outside the sun is just so hot, it’s just beating down. And there’s this dust that gets in everywhere. And they’re always sweeping the floors. The scene is played several times from alternating vantage points, focusing in on the rush of water from the tap, the overflowing canteen, the back of her mother’s crouching body, and her mother’s face as she splashes water onto it. This visual refrain operates as an abstract contrast to the realism of films that rationalize Japanese internment through numerous Hollywood reenactments of Pearl Harbor and government-sponsored announcements justifying its wartime actions toward Japanese civilians. In the documentary’s continual return to the dislocated postmemory of water, Tajiri suggests that the meaning of Japanese internment has been overdetermined by Hollywood’s heroic action films and melodrama. Challenging this representational realism, Tajiri deconstructs the meaning of Japanese internment by presenting indirect channels of meaning that form a nonlinear collage of knowledge that focuses on what water reveals through what it conceals. Alongside the continual return to the scene of her mother at the fountain, a single Hollywood film recurs through the documentary, standing as an exception to normative representations of Japanese internment: Bad Day at Black Rock , a 1955 film that, like Tajiri’s documentary, deals with Japanese internment indirectly through absence rather than presence. 121 The strength of Bad Day at Black Rock for Tajiri is that despite the fact that no Japanese American character ever appears in the film, this absence constitutes a meaningful form of erasure and emptiness, analogous to the visual tension produced by the negative space of Asawa’s sculptures. Specifically, it is the disappearance of a man named Komoko in the film that Tajiri uses as a conceptual frame for understanding the Japanese internment experience at Poston. She explains, “Komoko never appears, not even a picture or a photograph.” She relates his disappearance to her family’s: “Komoko’s disappearance from Black Rock was like ours from history. His absence is his presence.” Again, the weight of Komoko’s absence reinforces Asawa’s concept of negative space, as a force that reveals and energizes what exceeds the visual representation and historiography of Japanese internment. Although Tajiri incorporates only selected clips of Bad Day at Black Rock , the entire arc of the film reveals a racialized projection of Japanese labor’s excessive efficiency, which generated unnatural value. Part revisionist western, part film noir, the film is saturated with mystery. Spencer Tracy stars as John Macreedy, a one-armed stranger who arrives in Black Rock, a forgotten town where, prior to his arrival, the train had not stopped in four years. Macreedy reveals almost nothing of himself, except that he is a World War II veteran whose purpose is to find a man named Komoko. The lawless townspeople react to his inquiries with intimidation and violence. Although the town’s unofficial leader, a man named Smith, claims that Komoko was sent to a Japanese internment camp after Pearl Harbor, Macreedy remains skeptical after finding wildflowers growing outside Komoko’s home, a sign that “something’s buried up there.” He eventually discovers that Komoko has been murdered. A rare ally in the town explains the rationale for the mob killing of Komoko one day after Pearl Harbor, which is the result neither of redirected anger for Pearl Harbor nor of any conflation of Japanese Americans with Japanese wartime enemies. Instead, it is Komoko’s excessive efficiency that has fueled economic resentment and conspiracy. The townsperson tells Macreedy that when the land that Komoko leased—land previously perceived to be too dry and sterile to be productive—yielded growth, they all “figured he must be cheating him . . . [because] you can’t grow anything without water.” But Komoko does find water by digging a deep well, “climb[ing] down sixty feet,” Macreedly learns. This reinforces a larger point in this chapter: that leading up to Japanese internment, Japanese labor was associated with the production of unnatural value—an unnatural hold on relative surplus-value. From the perspective of the townspeople in Black Rock, Komoko frustrated natural laws by growing things where there “never was any water.” Therefore, through the film’s symbolic logic, the discovery of water signifies unnatural growth. Like the recurrence of water imagery, the symbolism of wildflowers marks decomposition rather than growth and connects Bad Day at Black Rock to Japanese internment. Under a scene captioned “Flowers for Komoko’s Grave” appears Tajiri’s mother’s flower garden. Rather than serving as sentimental natural imagery, the textual emphasis on Komoko’s grave draws out the significance of Macreedy’s observation that the wildflowers he identifies in the film are signifiers of death. Having been in Italy during the war, Macreedy has learned that bodies buried in the ground decompose into nutrients that produce wildflowers. Tajiri capitalizes on the dual edge of this natural imagery, as sign of both degeneration and regeneration. In place of her mother’s memory, moreover, the wildflowers give materiality to the absence that is also a presence. Here the wildflowers symbolize a landscape that has become witness to events that have been erased or willfully forgotten. The connection between water, landscape, and labor helps to contextualize the repeated scenes of Tajiri’s mother at the water faucet in the larger context of the Poston camp. Tying these scenes into Komoko’s ability to bring water to an arid landscape, she notes, “That was the thing about the Japanese. They took barren lands and brought water to it. . . . The irony is that they did it again in Poston: brought water to the land and made things grow.” The new context for their labor at Poston enables a transformative regeneration symbolized by Tajiri’s mother’s flowers, which are simultaneously signifiers of death. The still photographs of a single water tower, one taken in 1942 and another in 1988, seem to stand as the only evidence of Japanese irrigation labor at Poston, the largest internment camp built in the United States. 122 That Poston was the site of a Native reservation and Japanese internment camp sets in motion what Ruth Okimoto calls “an ironic twist of history,” in which “the Japanese detainees at Poston experienced what American Indians did in the nineteenth and early 20th centuries.” 123 And it is my argument that this “ironic twist” turns on the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor. It is this spatial context of Japanese confinement on a Native reservation that renovates the prior association of water with unnatural growth in Bad Day at Black Rock to sustainability and productivity. As an uncanny precursor to Japanese confinement, Native Americans were similarly relocated to this desolate landscape. As Okimoto explains in her report Sharing a Desert Home , “Citing national security and the need to protect white settlers, the US government had similarly herded American Indians onto this desolate, arid, and unproductive stretch of land.” 124 Linking the postmemory of water and agriculture woven into Tajiri’s film, what Poston exemplifies, therefore, is the spatial paradox of surplus labor. The water tower evokes the way water imagery remains a material trace of an unnatural landscape through the dehumanization of surplus labor. 125 For both the War Relocation Authority, responsible for housing Japanese detainees, and the Office of Indian Affairs, which would manage the subjugation and irrigation projects, the use of Japanese labor represented the high point of settler colonial logics in the managed interplay of land and labor, elimination and exclusion. Not surprisingly, the Colorado River Indian Tribal supported neither the internment camps nor the colonization program. 126 The outcome was clearly advantageous mostly to whites, who benefited from the access to irrigation systems in the desert, in addition to the dispossessed Japanese property on the West Coast. Thus, from the deep well on Komoko’s land to the water tower at Poston, water is the conduit for and witness to both unnatural growth and exploited, invisible labor. To reiterate an earlier point, the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor turned on their conflation with Native populations. Opposing the enthusiasm for efficient Japanese labor, WRA Director Dillon Myers (who became head of the BIA in 1950) became openly concerned that if kept too long in confinement, Japanese internees would become “dependent like Native Americans.” 127 In stark contrast to the labor efficiency attributed to Japaneseness, Poston was (like other camps) a space of idled labor, where boredom and inactivity coexisted with coerced labor. This dual condition of coerced and idled labor is the primary condition of a surplus population of reserve labor. Given what Michael McIntyre identifies as “race’s long-standing use as a mark of labor,” 128 the prior association of Japaneseness with unnatural “abstract labor” undergoes colonial rehabilitation to the historically racialized category of surplus labor, whose exploitation reinforces whiteness as the basis for property acquisition and expansion. This is the movement from an alien mode of threatening racialized labor to a domesticated form of surplus, racialized labor. A statement by one white farmer plainly reveals the true beneficiaries of using Japanese labor to subjugate Native land: “It will develop a lot of land, bring in irrigation, so white farmers can use it. . . . Couldn’t let good land like that go to waste.” 129 Tajiri’s visual emphasis on the water tower at Poston stands as a remaining artifact of this history, which, like Komoko’s body, has been disappeared from the landscape of labor. For Tajiri it is only a stagnant, unpromising landscape that remains as evidence of the Japanese American internees confined at Poston, whose rehabilitation as surplus labor functioned ironically to indigenize their previously abstract alien labor. The signs that designate Indigenous peoples as surplus populations are continually reinforced through the film’s stark panoramas of the overgrown and decrepit state of the Poston barracks. They were turned over to Native American “colonists” after Japanese Americans were released in 1945 and used as classrooms until 1980. With the exception of an alcohol recovery center, the buildings that remain have deteriorated out of neglect. This is the colonial wasteland of surplus, disposed-of populations. The water tower remains, symbolizing the irrigation of Poston land in the Parker Irrigation Project—rearticulated through recurring dramatizations of Tajiri’s mother at the desert water faucet—and there are two film stills of palm trees, which text identifies as “Date Palm Grove, Poston, 1988: Planted by internees, 1942.” In this landscape of neglect and ruin, the palm trees, like wildflowers, figure as an ambivalent symbol of transformation, of both death and regeneration. Tajiri concludes the film with similar ambivalence. Ultimately she finds affective reconciliation with her mother, realizing that the recurring image of her mother at the water faucet is rooted in a memory of a rare story her mother once told of her years in camp, and states: “Now I found I could connect the picture to the story. I could forgive my mother her loss of memory.” This sentiment is complicated by the final frame of the film, which pans out to a desolate road near the Poston desert, a refusal to find aesthetic resolution in natural vitality. The viewer is left only with a sweep of the empty highway, electrical wires in the distance, and the shrill cry of a hawk. David Eng calls it a “scene of unfolding, a scene of discursive emptiness.” 130 It is quite literally a scene of negative space that refuses to animate a central subject. This final vision of landscape is not a romantic symbol of belonging to landscape but, rather, of how the landscape itself is a witness to the necropolitical dimension of the drive to annihilate abstraction within an ideology of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. As symbols of death’s remainder, Komoko’s and Tajiri’s mother’s wildflowers represent the inverted growth of the underworld of Japanese internment, one for which Ruth Asawa’s upside-down tree similarly evokes “those things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” Conclusion This chapter explores how Japanese internment was less a final episode in a record of anti-Asian exclusion that began in the nineteenth century than a turning point that created conditions for the resignification of Japanese labor as efficient and tractable—the core tenets of the model minority myth—only after being reconstituted as a dependent, surplus labor population. As a result, our understanding of the outcome of Japanese internment in North America shifts the foundational distinction of land and labor that Patrick Wolfe identifies for delineating the interplay of elimination and exclusion that Indigenous peoples and African Americans have been subject to, respectively. In the case of Native North Americans, elimination was achieved through a spectrum of tactics that included genocidal campaigns and the move toward the “statistical elimination” of Indigenous peoples through the strategic dilution of blood-quantum. Exclusion, on the other hand, represents the undissolvable blackness as a transferable category of a racial underclass. Thus the example of Japanese land dispossession and coerced labor within the project of Japanese internment adds a new dimension to this theorization of settler colonialism. In particular, the relocation, dispossession, and dispersal of Japanese North Americans follow a trajectory of colonial elimination through assimilation. In the process, Japanese North Americans underwent resignification: they started out embodying the threat of yellow peril and emerged as a dependent surplus labor force who exemplified liberal individualism rather than a collective, unnatural menace. In Canada, the elimination of Japanese Canadians from the West Coast was achieved through the postwar dispersal program, which scattered Japanese Canadians across the prairies. In the United States, similarly, officials such as Dillon Myers at Poston worked to implement policies that would enable the disappearance of Japanese Americans. As Okimoto recounts, Myers’s belief was that Japanese Americans should “melt or boil away.” 131 In 1943, Myers’s relocation program—an assimilation program—was designed to relocate and disperse Japanese Americans east of the western states. On their release, only half of former West Coast residents returned; the rest relocated to Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Denver, and New York. 132 Turning the revolving door of colonial history, when Myers became commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (formerly the OIA ) in 1950, he reimplemented the relocation policy for Native nations. Okimoto explains that “under this policy, Indians were convinced to move out of reservations and into cities, where they were told jobs and a better life awaited them.” 133 Such relocation policies were instituted as pathways to “termination,” a policy exemplified in Canada’s failed 1969 White Paper, which sought to terminate First Nations special status, turning them into “equal” citizens with alienable property. Thus Japanese and Native bodies stood in as surplus populations against which conceptions of liberal individualism and property ownership were reconfigured and entrenched. Dispossession, relocation, and labor thus become the eliminatory conduits to “better, modern living.” The next chapter examines the brave new world of racial equivalents, where liberal individualism, corporate personhood, and market freedom reigns. In it I explore how the economic modality of Asian racialization becomes bifurcated and further entrenches the association of Asians with destructive abstraction. Specifically, I look at the significance of the post-1960s neoliberalization of immigration borders to reinforce the abstract racialization of Asians as both poor migrant labor and wealthy, flexible citizens.

      "content": "CHAPTER 4 THE NEW NINETEENTH CENTURY Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism Art Imitates Art Between 6 and 8 A.M . on four consecutive mornings in July 1978, multimedia artist Ken Lum stood on the east bank of the 152nd Street overpass leading rush-hour commuters into Vancouver from Surrey. Entertainment for Surrey , the grainy black-and-white video-recording of this performance, depicts Lum in jeans and a sweatshirt facing oncoming traffic, standing on a strip of grass on the side of the highway (figure 4.1 ). Recounting his experience, Lum observed, “The first day there was some reaction, the second day there was much more, but on the third day people ignored me.” 1 On the fourth day, many commuters had grown accustomed to him, honking and waving as their cars disappeared under the overpass. On the fifth and final morning of the performance, Lum replaced his body with a large white cardboard cutout of himself, a representation of the “living statue” he had become. 2 Lum explained that “people quickly came to expect me on the same spot. I became a sign.” 3 The humor in Lum’s comment is its double edge: he literally turned his body into a cardboard sign while, at the level of postmodern signification, his body became a referential sign. Turning the highway overpass into a performance art space and the Asian male body into a sign of repetition, Entertainment for Surrey collapses the boundary between literal and figurative representation. Even more dramatically, his performance probes the spatial absurdity of the individual—of individualism itself—in an urban environment designed to facilitate the movement of labor, goods, and capital. As Jeff Derksen observes, “The tension between mobility and fixity is often heightened by [Lum’s] grinding of the scales between the urban and the global and between capitalism and the subject.” 4 Only by recognizing his apparent lack of function or purpose could otherwise baffled commuters have been alerted to the artistic registers of his performance. For the purposes of this chapter, the way Lum stages a visual interruption in the flow of capitalist circulation offers new avenues for mining the abstractions signaled by the Asian body after the neoliberal turn. In the parallel urban literary world of Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange , another artist ascends the freeway overpass to deliver daily performances. Enter Manzanar Murasaki, the homeless Sansei who stands atop the Los Angeles Harbor Freeway at the downtown interchange to conduct an orchestra that he alone hears. For this grizzled, white-haired artist, it is “the complexity of human adventure over lines of transit” that fascinate him, and he is grateful for the opportunity to use his silver baton to direct the sounds of traffic, which amount to “nothing less than the greatest orchestra on Earth.” 5 Is he crazy? We learn that Manzanar was not always a conductor. He was once a skilled surgeon who abruptly left his profession, family, and friends to become a “missing person.” 6 He decided one day to exit the world he knew, “followed an ancient tortoise out into a deep place in his brain and stayed there year after year.” 7 Using the alias “Manzanar,” he references his birthplace at Manzanar Concentration Camp in the Owens Valley, where he was the first Sansei born into captivity during World War II. We learn that he could easily have applied his artistic talents to becoming “a sculptor in clay, wood, or even marble—any sort of inanimate substance”; however, “strangely, it was the abstraction of music that engulfed his being.” 8 Los Angeles commuters rarely take notice of him, though, thinking themselves “disconnected from a sooty homeless man on an overpass.” 9 Nevertheless, he had become a “fixture on the freeway overpass much like a mural or a traffic information sign or a tagger’s mark.” 10 Like Ken Lum in Entertainment for Surrey , Manzanar became a sign. Both Lum and Manzanar bear an uncanny resemblance to David Caspar Friedrich’s Wanderer above the Sea of Fog discussed in chapter 2 , the iconic embodiment of the Byronic hero surveying the vast, mountainous landscape before him. Even Buzzworm, the African American street philanthropist of Tropic of Orange , calls Manzanar the “ultimate romantic.” 11 However, while Lum and Manzanar evoke the individualism of the romantic figure, they do not adopt Albert Boime’s notion of a “magisterial gaze,” 12 given the total absence of control they exert over the oncoming traffic. Observing the way Manzanar responds to the dizzying urban flows of capitalist production with a “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting,” Mark Chiang highlights the irony that Manzanar “does not control anything. . . . His conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 13 Thus it is a kind of purposeful purposelessness that binds Lum and Manzanar, two Asian North Americans who abandoned their real and fictional lives as model minorities—Lum’s as a scientist and Manzanar’s as a surgeon—to yield to an artistic vision that would compel them to their respective freeway overpasses. Against the rational landscape of the freeway and the temporal organization of the workweek, both artists suspend and denaturalize the relation between the body and sign, embodying a postromantic subjectivity whose exaggerated nonproductivity constitutes a strange other of capitalism. Evoking forms of undisciplined labor power, Lum and Manzanar index a sphere of disability , a nonrehabilitative population that remains distinct from the exploitable population of racialized and gendered surplus labor. David T. Mitchell and Sharon Snyder designate nonproductive bodies as those “inhabitants of the planet who, largely by virtue of biological (in)capacity, aesthetic non-conformity, and/or non-normative labor patterns . . . [are] not merely excluded from—but also resistant to standardized labor demands of human value.” 14 They point to Antonio Negri’s term “living labor” to “suggest forms of creativity that cannot be reduced to an economic value.” 15 In this sense, both Lum and Manzanar stage a confrontation of capitalism’s naturalized modes of consumption, circulation, and social organization—using and misusing the freeway as motif of urban modernity. Most important for this chapter is how their bodies-as-sign animate new relations between labor and the Asian body against the flows of global capital. A utopian ideal of functional disruption captured by Lum’s and Manzanar’s performances guides this chapter’s focus on the ongoing racial abstractions assigned to the Asian body in an apocalyptic phase of contemporary capitalism. Describing the “catastrophic character of the current phase shift that global capital is undergoing,” Chris Nealon labels it a “late late capitalism.” 16 The previous chapters in this book have examined capitalism as a representational regime whose fetishism mystifies the social relations embedded in commodity production. Within its social distortion, I explored how alien Asian labor has since the nineteenth century functioned as biological signifier of the destructively abstract dimension of an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Moishe Postone ties the origins of this antinomy to the commodity form itself, wherein each commodity’s expression of use-value and exchange value is misperceived as an antinomical (rather than dialectical) relation of concrete and abstract dimensions. From this view, which I’ve described as a form of romantic anticapitalism, use-value appears concrete, “as objective in the sense of being objectlike, ‘material’ or ‘thingly,’” while exchange-value appears abstract,” as “general, homogenous, and abstracted from all particularity.” 17 In other words, even though a commodity such as a chair contains both use-value as something to sit on and exchange-value as a quantitative dimension that enables the chair to be bought and sold, romantic anticapitalism perceives these two characteristics as so completely disconnected they are oppositional—antinomical—rather than dialectically related. As a key ideological anchor of white settler colonialism, romantic anticapitalism always favors the qualitative over the quantitative. It prefers the concrete dimension for being natural, material, tactile, and thus closer to earthly origins in an increasingly artificial world. For the romantic anticapitalist, capitalism is identified solely with the abstract exchange dimension of the antinomy, while the concrete dimension is perceived as essentially noncapitalist. This book interprets anti-Asian racism as a fetishized, one-sided form of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism, an ideology that anthropomorphizes capitalism’s abstract dimension as alien Asian labor. As such, my first two chapters explored how Asian North American literature and visual culture exposes and disidentifies with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century association of Asian labor with an abstractly perverse, unnatural, and destructive economism that threatened the normative social reproduction of white concrete labor. In the third chapter, on postmemory narratives of Japanese internment in North America, I probed the extent of the destructiveness associated with Japanese labor, whose excessive efficiency and perceived control over the creation of relative surplus-value were key elements in the decision to relocate and confine Japanese civilians. Then, by connecting the relocation of Japanese North American labor to the settler colonial precedent of Native North American relocation evoked by these narratives, I argued that the exploitation of relocated Japanese labor contributed to the resignification of Japanese bodies as an ideal “surplus” labor force, dispossessed of any control over the creation of relative surplus-value. This facilitated a symbolic process that Jodi Kim calls “gendered racial rehabilitation,” 18 which enabled Japanese civilians to be aligned with the ameliorated status of model minority in the midst of civil rights activism in the United States during the Cold War. However, as this chapter will explore further, the neoliberal reconstitution of immigration laws in Canada and the United States in the latter twentieth century has reinforced the destructive abstraction associated with Asian alien surplus labor, an abstraction that comes into heightened relief in Vancouver and Los Angeles, two cities that refract urbanism, immigration, and trans-Pacific economic flows of labor, goods, and capital. Examining Karen Tei Yamashita’s Los Angeles as imagined in her 1997 novel Tropic of Orange alongside Ken Lum’s Vancouver through his multimedia works—concluding with a reading of his sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (1999)—my central argument in this chapter is that these artists bring into focus the border as a key apparatus of neoliberal multiculturalism that facilitates the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. I demonstrate how the neoliberalization of the border substitutes economic class for race, resulting in a bifurcated economism of Asian racialization. As John Park outlines, the unprecedented rise of skilled and affluent migrants from Asia has been coupled with the similar explosion in undocumented aliens; Park observes that in the United States “up to one million undocumented aliens are now from Asian countries. . . . Their numbers multiplied four or five times over the past 25 years.” 19 Immigration policy increasingly privileges flexible Asian citizens with foreign capital, expanding and entrenching the alignment of Asians with an abstract dimension of destructively alien capital. Vancouver’s identity as an Asian metropolis and “Pacific gateway” has coincided with widespread resentment of wealthy Chinese investor-migrants, who are blamed for the city’s skyrocketing property prices. 20 At the same time, poor Asian migrants situated at the margins of legality represent a perennial threat to the social order and remain indebted to the precarious structure of settler colonial hospitality. In this neoliberal scenario, settler colonial romantic anticapitalism targets both the population of highly skilled, capitalized migrants that L. Ling-chi Wang calls “high-tech coolies” 21 and the population of poor migrants—we might call them “retro” coolies—who have always been the subject of labor exploitation guaranteed by class-based structures of immigrant exclusion that have been in place in North America since the nineteenth century. We should recall that the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States specifically barred laborers and exempted merchant classes, while Canada’s 1885 Chinese Head Tax (and later 1923 Chinese Immigration Act) similarly aimed to deter poor Chinese migrants through financial hardship. In a contemporary climate that looks like a neoliberal nineteenth century, therefore, the economic logic of the border reinforces the alignment of Asians with the abstract threat of foreign investment, whose incursion into North America represent an oppressive “takeover” of traditional values and social order. At the same time, the population of undesirables (and provisional desirables, in the case of certain refugees) remains an alien labor threat to the security of citizen wages and normative social reproduction. While Ken Lum’s multimedia works evoke the superficiality of neoliberal multiculturalist aesthetics, Yamashita’s novel provides a complementary view of alien labor subjectivity conditioned by globalization. I conclude with a reading of the inverted ecology of the border represented in Yamashita’s novel and Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , which sits on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery. At stake in Yamashita’s and Lum’s aesthetic reconfigurations of the border is the value of human labor in late late capitalism. Lum’s Multicultural Discontents In order to contextualize my reading of Lum’s Four Boats Stranded , one of his most direct responses to the issue of immigration in Canada, this section establishes his conceptual ties to pop art and minimalism and the way his art probes themes of social exclusion, multiculturalism, and labor. His work powerfully reconsiders the interplay of multicultural citizenship, labor alienation, and stranger hospitality that shapes the landscape of urban racialization. Since the late 1970s, Lum’s work has achieved international renown and acclaim. Through the decades his work has consistently examined the tense boundary between mobility and stasis (as in Entertainment for Surrey ), public and private space, access and exclusion, image and text, reflection and projection. The spatial boundaries Lum erects are often uncomfortably fraught with race, gender, and class implications. Beginning in the 1980s, he gained visibility for his furniture sculptures, such as Sculpture for Dream Home (1980), Red Circle (1986), and Corner Bed (1990). Each of these sculptures engages the spatial politics of domesticity and hospitality, whose symbolism encompasses the personal as much as the national. For example, in Sculpture for Dream Home (figure 4.2 ), four identical contemporary sofas with side tables and lamps are wedged together into a perfect square. At first glance, the uniformity of the arrangement recalls the impersonal but functional aesthetic of a hotel lobby. But the viewer quickly realizes that the sofas are so tightly interlocked there’s no way to actually sit down on any of them. The functionality of the sofas is entirely displaced, and the viewer is literally marginalized by the sculpture, blocked from accessing its interior, core space. They evoke Derrida’s notion that the “law of hospitality . . . appears as a paradoxical law, pervertible or perverting”: 22 FIGURE 4.2 Ken Lum, Sculpture for Dream Home , 1980. This right to hospitality offered to a foreigner “as a family,” represented and protected by his name or her family name, is at once what makes hospitality possible, or the hospitable relationship to the foreigner possible, but by the same token what limits and prohibits it. Because hospitality, in this situation, is not offered to an anonymous new arrival and someone who has neither name, nor patronym, nor family, nor social status, and who is therefore treated not as a foreigner but as another barbarian. 23 FIGURE 4.3 Ken Lum, Red Circle , 1986. Fabric, wood, 300 cm diameter. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Acquisition Fund. Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. In other words, Sculpture for Dream Home captures the contradictions of hospitality that must distinguish between the foreigner and absolute other, whose provisional guarantee of welcome simultaneously expresses its opposite: rejection. The sculpture thus resignifies the stage of mundane domesticity into one of inhospitality, a hostile expression of isolation that calls into question the spatial boundaries that configure social belonging and exclusion. Continuing these themes more dramatically is Red Circle (1986), which consists of a plump fire-engine-red sofa in the shape of a circle (figure 4.3 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home , the sofa violates its own function. Despite its inviting, cushiony enclosure, there is no way to actually sit on this sofa. Its sexually inviting minimalist aesthetic, conveyed through its seductive color and symmetrical vertical lines, adds to the sense of calculated exclusion and thwarted intimacy. A modernist ethos of form over function seems responsible for accentuating the viewer’s dislocation and nonbelonging. Observing the manner through which these sculptures harness the viewer’s sense of exclusion, Okwui Enwezor identifies Lum’s furniture works as “social sculptures” in the sense that they invite a social reading of minimalism: “Where minimalism abjured the presence of the subject in order to prioritize the presence of the object, social and relational sculpture reasserted the primacy of the subject.” 24 In this view, these sculptures register a critique of minimalism’s abstractions and evacuation of historical and social context. Connecting minimalism’s focus on pure form and capitalism, Scott Watson calls attention to the way minimalist works such as Donald Judd’s boxes or Carl Andre’s bricks seem to replicate disturbing transformations in the built urban landscape: “Regularity, logic and order in the art work were suddenly implicated in the conformist tendencies of society; the abstractions of pure form became ciphers from the abstractions of capital itself.” 25 That is, the desire for disinterested, abstract, pure form was a reflection of the conformist, homogenizing spirit of capitalism. Moreover, Lum’s reconfiguration of the use-value of the sofas as art seems to satirize the modernist ideal of “better living” achieved through the fusion of art and design. Here that view is collapsed into a scene of insecure, empty living. Among the last of these furniture works, Corner Bed (1990) adds a further layer of dysfunction to the social space of the domestic “living” room. The sculpture consists of two unfolded sofa beds that face a corner (figure 4.4 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home and Red Circle , the sofa beds cannot be accessed; the viewer can neither sit nor lie on either sofa bed. What’s distinct about Corner Bed is how it registers the theme of inhospitality more intensely by evoking an excluded visitor. As sofa beds are mostly used for temporary guests rather than permanent residents, Corner Bed suggests an aggressive exclusion of visitors and strangers. Putting the sculpture into the sustained geographical emphasis on the city of Vancouver in Lum’s work, the piece also alludes to the city’s historical hostility toward Asian migrants who have sought and continue to seek entry to Canada via Vancouver. As Enwezor reflects, the work “propos[es] an analysis of spatial politics that is all too familiar within regimes of border control.” 26 Here we see the suggestive refraction of private living space into the social domain of national exclusion. But what complicates a straightforward reading of racial exclusion is the pathetic, half-hearted display of hospitality (the sofa beds are unfolded, for instance) that Lum cuts into these furniture sculptures. The ambivalent message of the furniture’s arrangement reinforces the paradox of Derrida’s elaboration of hospitality while evoking both an invitation and an expectation of strangers. FIGURE 4.4 Ken Lum, Corner Bed , 1990. Two sofa beds, dimensions variable. Courtesy of the artist. The dark humor of Lum’s sculptures also marks his photographic works, which probe the unvarnished materiality of urban life in Vancouver. In his portrait-text works, Lum opts for scenes that do not recycle mythologized panoramas of the Lion’s Gate Bridge or the sunset over English Bay that project the city’s beauty and cosmopolitanism. Rather, Lum’s Vancouver often reflects his own background in the working-class and often invisible east side of Vancouver. His grandfather arrived as an immigrant before the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1923 and found work on the Canada Pacific Railway. When Lum was growing up, his mother worked in sweatshops and his father held menial jobs. As a result, the Vancouver Lum projects highlights the decidedly unglamorous side of urban existence: the minimalls, parking lots, and sidewalks populated by immigrants, workers, and people who often seem down and out. These are the characters and locales Lum connects to his own childhood in East Vancouver: There were all those families whose fathers worked as dishwashers with the mothers sewing in sweatshops; that’s basically my family roots. Then there are the very desperate, itinerant families at the bottom. East Vancouver is also an area with many immigrants, so there is always a kind of confusion in reference to how people relate to one another. 27 But as his furniture works suggest, Lum is far from sentimental in his approach to East Vancouver and its inhabitants. Rather, Lum’s firsthand experience compels him to weave a dark humor into his portrayal of Vancouver, with an eye to how the global economy shapes urban existence as well as our perception of it. The neoliberal turn in economic commonsense has resulted in increasing production and movement of goods and people, widening the gap between rich and poor, expanding the gendered and racialized global wage-labor force, and swelling the proportions of that global population who live in the city. As Derksen observes, these are dynamics of the global-urban nexus, in which “the city—under its many designations of ‘megacity,’ ‘world city,’ ‘cosmopolis,’ or ‘metapolis’—has become a condenser of global forces and an amplifier of global effects.” 28 Engaging with capitalism and its racialized tropes, Lum’s photographic works explore the dissonance of race, class, and gender between image and text. It is here that the Asian subject of work—of labor—comes to the fore, presenting with barbed humor the relationship between Asians and work, capital, and value production. Among his large-scale photographic series titled Portrait Attributes , Lum pairs a subject’s portrait alongside text that we would normally associate with billboard advertising. The portraits are unusual for the way they capture ordinary people in what Kitty Scott describes as the “micro-moments of life.” 29 In these works Lum makes central the complex, affective dimension of those often racialized and gendered subjects who are rarely the focus of pictorial representation. In Melly Shum Hates Her Job (1989) (figure 4.5 ), 30 Lum intensifies the boundary between racial theater and social documentary. In this portrait-text work, the subject Melly Shum is sitting at her desk in the midst of accounting work. Her surroundings are lackluster, suggestive of a governmental branch office. The fact that she is crunching numbers on a clunky industrial adding machine suggests her low-level position; she is not a CEO overseeing million-dollar transactions on a computer screen. It appears she is pausing briefly to smile at the camera before returning to her accounting task. Accompanying her portrait is a panel of large, capitalized text that reads, from top to bottom: “MELLY SHUM HATES HER JOB .” The vertical orientation of the text accentuates the work’s use of billboard conventions and heightens the emotional impact of the words. The word “HATES ” is enlarged and in vivid color, distinguishing it from the more neutral blue font of the other words. The rippled contours of red, yellow, and black typeface make the word “HATES ” look sizzling or electrified. This loud advertising typography is totally contradicted by Melly Shum’s smiling face. Although there is humorous relief in Melly’s sentiments about work in general, that humor has a dark side. In particular, what is disturbing about the relationship between text and image is the way it violates the privacy of the photographic subject. Like many of Lum’s subjects, Melly Shum is not a glamorous or heroic worker; rather, she appears as a beleaguered civil servant who, in spite of her gloom, is compelled to smile for the camera. More intrusively, her private thoughts have been broadcast in corporatist type by an omniscient narrator—the artist—onto a public billboard. In a form of ethnographic violence, an exclusive form of dialogue is enabled between the artist and the viewer that excludes Melly Shum altogether. As Kitty Scott remarks, this “doubling of voice and intimate knowledge about a stranger induces a sense of dis-ease in the viewer.” 31 What Lum achieves in this photograph is a refusal of what Roland Barthes calls the “good” picture, one in which the “object speaks [and] induces us, vaguely, to think.” 32 Instead, Melly Shum “‘sp[eaks] too much’ . . . suggest[ing] a meaning—a different meaning from the literal one” 33 and thus dislocating the photograph’s intention. FIGURE 4.5 Ken Lum, Melly Shum Hates Her Job , 1989. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. In the sense that misery becomes an object of artistic consumption—a kind of working-class spectacle—Lum’s photographic works approach the threshold of cynicism. Scott Watson observes a long tradition of artistic depictions of the working poor that Lum taps into, particularly eighteenth-century genre paintings of the poor, which were consumed by the aristocratic classes: At that time, and throughout the following century, paintings of the poor, especially those who worked the land, identified the poor with all those stable values—family, faith and soil—that capital was eroding. The bourgeoisie took comfort in this illusion because it so blithely ignored class antagonisms. 34 Later, in the 1930s, we could turn to Dorothea Lange’s photographs for the Farm Security Administration, which increased the pathos surrounding the working, rural poor. Absent of illusions of family stability in poverty, Lange’s photographs are intended to draw sympathy from the viewer over the plight of displaced laborers. For example, in Dust Bowl Texas, American Exodus, A.C. Woman (1938) (figure 4.6 ), we see the figure of a woman whose world-weariness is captured in the way her hands are clasped onto her forehead and neck. While her ragged shift dress and sun-scorched face testify to her hardship, Lange’s effort to dignify her portrait verges on heroism. The fact that the woman stands against an expansive sky, whose low horizon dips below the woman’s waist, has the effect of making her appear monumental. The aestheticism of the photograph ultimately carries a romantic undercurrent that attributes a morality to her endurance. By contrast, in Lum’s image-text works, the viewer cannot take comfort in such a sentimental illusion about the poor or working class. Melly Shum evokes neither stable, “natural” values of “family, faith, and soil” nor the pathos of heroic endurance suggested by Lange’s work. Rather, there is a sense of irreconcilability evoked by the public nature of her image and sentiments. The unsentimental and unnatural elements of the scene ultimately seem conditioned by social relations that exist outside the work, highlighting a banality of social responses to visions of alienated labor.

Tying this photo-work to the larger questions about Asian racialization as biological signifier of capitalism, Melly Shum Hates Her Job presents a stunning antithesis to the model minority scientist who was erased from the redesigned Canadian hundred-dollar bill, a subject I began this book with. In the case of the Asian woman scientist, her erasure signaled the status of Asians as a biological signifier of bad capital. She became a metaphor for a destructive logic of equivalence that reduces individual attributes into commensurable, exchangeable forms that Helen Jun calls “human capital.” From the view of romantic anticapitalism, the Asian signals the overthrow of traditional, pure, concrete conceptions of labor for an era that reduces human individuality to an abstract form of repetition and equivalence. Melly Shum, however, does not offer us a vision of such racialized abstraction or a picture of sentimentalized, concrete labor. It is unclear how or whether we viewers are to identify with her. It is this sense of nonequivalence that creates what Watson calls a “discomfort zone.” Melly Shum refuses to accommodate either an idealized vision of labor or an aestheticized image of multicultural diversity that resolves the material and geographical contradictions of the global economy. FIGURE 4.7 Ken Lum, Phew, I’m Tired , 1994. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Acquisition Fund. Further reinforcing this sense of discomfort around race and labor is Lum’s Phew, I’m Tired (1994) (figure 4.7 ). The portrait features a South Asian man at work in a metal-galvanizing factory. Unlike Melly Shum, the unnamed subject of the photograph is not smiling; rather, he appears to be in distress. On the right half of the work, against a bright orange background, appears light-blue text that reads: “. . . phew . . . / . . . I’m tired . . . /. .Oh, man . . . / . . . man . . . / . . . phew . . . / . . . tired.” The words and phrases surrounded by ellipses cascade down the panel in a zigzag formation, an arrangement suggesting a downward spiral that accentuates the weariness of the worker in the photograph. At the same time, the words themselves seem unable to capture the man’s pained expression. There is an unsettling tension between the jaunty quality of the corporate typeface and the anguish evoked by the man’s face. At the level of linguistic representation, the repetition of the words accentuates the limits language reaches in narrating the conditions of labor. Not only do the repeated words, such as “phew” and “man,” seem to comically undermine his situation, but the sounds associated with them also have a comic book quality. Further displacing the social documentary signifiers of the work, these comic strip elements reference pop art such as Roy Lichtenstein’s large reproductions of advertising and comic strip images in a piece such as Drowning Girl (figure 4.8 ). Just as pop artists’ use of popular culture and commercial iconography intensified the artwork’s artifice to challenge the spiritual ambitions and moral seriousness of art conventions (particularly of abstract expressionism), Phew, I’m Tired seems to reject the moralism inspired by Dorothea Lange’s photographic subjects. Ultimately, as Derksen points out, “the didacticism of the image-text format is made unstable by the oscillation between the representational photos and the ambivalent relationship of text to image.” 35 Unlike Lange’s documentary camera, Lum’s choreographed images intensify their own artifice and theatricality, projecting a sense of indifference that distances the viewer. In its refusal to supply the viewer with a moral standpoint from which to engage with the work, to reconcile image and text, or to join form and content, Lum’s work evokes the purposeful purposelessness of nonequivalence. By displacing the photographic subject’s racial heroism or pathos through manufactured indifference, the work interrupts a neoliberal logic of racial equivalence that folds race into culture and antiracism into multiculturalism. Instead, the viewer is left only with the irreducibility of form to affect, a state of nonequivalence that interrupts the belief in the equality of persons that is presupposed by free-market exchange and the drive to make unequal forms of human activity commensurable and exchangeable into values. 36 In his representation of racial nonequivalence, Lum therefore interrupts the logic of value production premised on the commensurating function of abstract labor.

Lum extends this state of nonequivalence to challenge what Jodi Melamed calls neoliberal multiculturalism, capitalism’s new logic of inclusion. Replacing the ideological primacy of white supremacy and colonial capitalism, she explains that multiculturalism “portrays neoliberal policy as the key to a postracist world of freedom and opportunity.” 37 In other words, multiculturalism operates as an economic and racial logic that responds to economic imperatives by celebrating cultural diversity and border-crossing to facilitate foreign investment and trade. This signals not the end of race but, rather, its rebranding. Melamed observes, “As historical articulations of race and capitalism have shifted—with white supremacy and colonial capitalism giving way to racial liberalism and transnational capitalism and, eventually, to neoliberal multiculturalism and globalization—race remains a procedure that justifies the nongeneralizability of capitalist wealth.” 38 This absorption of antiracism into an ideology of multiculturalism has been especially pervasive in Canada, which in 1988 became the first nation to enact multiculturalism as law. 39 As global capitalism’s “silent partner,” 40 former prime minister Brian Mulroney could not have made their connection more plain in a speech he delivered at a conference titled “Multiculturalism Means Business,” 41 where he invoked the marketing advantages of multiculturalism: “To cement our prosperity with trade and investment links the world over and with a renewed entrepreneurial spirit at home. . . . Our multicultural nature gives us an edge in selling to that [competitive] world.” 42 Adding to the “mixed legacy” that Cheryl Harris attributes to the overturning of legalized segregation in the United States, which defined racial oppression solely through the terms of racial separation rather than the domination associated with institutionalized white wealth and power, 43 Canadian multiculturalism sidetracks race and class for a celebration of cultural difference. The result in Canada, as Smaro Kamboureli observes, is a “sedative politics” that manages racial and ethnic difference by making it a universal condition of Canadian culture, repackaging systemic racism as merely a flawed attitude that can be corrected through cultural appreciation. 44 Lum’s engagement with images of cultural diversity seems to mock the simplification of such racial and ethnic codes. In Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate (1990) (figure 4.9 ), Lum offers an alternative view of Asian racialization against a more familiar scene of Vancouver’s cosmopolitanism. The high-rise apartments that populate the photograph’s backdrop are a signifier of the city’s alias as “Hongcouver.” This name—used in both pejorative and celebratory contexts—stems from the significant Chinese population in Vancouver, as well as the city’s purported architectural, cultural, and economic resemblance to Hong Kong. Redirecting a pop emphasis on exaggerated artifice, in Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , Lum’s advertising motif actually verges on verisimilitude. The top half of the image-text presents a portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau. They are standing on the balcony of a high-rise apartment, similar to those that appear in the background. Below their portrait in the bottom half of the piece appear their names; their last names, Nishi and Chau, are enlarged and capitalized. Removed from an art gallery context, the only element of the piece that alerts us to its status as art is the cartoonish 3-D font of the words “REAL ESTATE ,” which imitates stone carving. In what Derksen identifies as their “Flintstones quality,” 45 the unrealistic veneer of the lettering humorously undermines the realness of “real” estate. In addition, in the contrasting relation between image and text—between the concrete buildings in the background in the photograph and the abstract, textual representation of buildings as real estate commodities—we can make out a subtle reference to the antinomy of concrete and abstract dimensions that Moishe Postone associates with capitalism’s social universe. As Derksen observes of the transformation of the concrete into the abstract, “urban materiality is turned into immaterial commodity speculation.” 46 Here the abstract representation of “concrete” real estate is reduced to a comically inadequate imitation of actual concrete buildings. FIGURE 4.9 Ken Lum, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , 1990. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. Yet at another level, the portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau adds to the more racially ominous registers of the friction between image and text. Their relation to the Flintstones “real estate” logo adds an air of illegitimacy and artifice to the earnest expressions they bring to their professional endeavor. On one hand, this sense of illegitimacy broadcasts their artificial relation to property; their belonging is rendered a mere abstract signifier against a more concrete sense of citizenship. On the other hand, the artificial concreteness of their profession as realtors also allegorizes an anti-Asian animosity stemming from the perception that Vancouver has been overrun by Hong Kong real estate investors. For example, Katharyne Mitchell notes that in Vancouver, Hong Kong Chinese “are perceived as responsible for house price escalation as a result of using homes for profit through the practice of speculation, rather than as places to live.” 47 Much of this anti–Hong Kong Chinese sentiment came to the surface in 1988, when 216 luxury condominiums in the False Creek area were sold exclusively to Hong Kong buyers. 48 The sales took all of three hours and circumvented the Canadian market, leading to charges that Hong Kong investors were taking over the city. Although the roots of the city’s demographic shifts and spatial reconfigurations are the result of state-led efforts to expedite Vancouver’s integration into the global economy, the racial outcome of these processes has effectively reinforced the perception that Asians represent pure market rationality—their desires represent the psychology of capitalist expansion. Asian investors and business immigrants have only economic rather than “human” motivations. By contrast, for white Vancouver residents, as Mitchell points out, purchasing homes “secures profit yet does not have to be pursued as profit .” 49 Only white residents have the concrete, “natural” humanity that allows them to “profess ignorance and innocence of any cynical or mercenary motives such as profit, yet establishes their fundamental connection to the underlying systems that generate it.” 50 The biologization of capitalism thus renders Asians less human, removed from the concrete associations that align whiteness with property and belonging. As such, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate evoke the form of racial anxiety associated with Asians that we saw in the hundred-dollar-bill controversy: they register a kind of bad capital associated with the abstract sphere of foreign investment and real estate speculation. Despite the postinternment rehabilitation of Japanese as indigenized surplus labor and the effects of transnational capital, free trade, and the neoliberalization of the immigrant border, Asian North America’s association with a destructive capitalism has become even further entrenched. In his discussion of Mimic (1982), a photograph by Lum’s mentor Jeff Wall, Walter Benn Michaels too probes the signifiers of globalization that attend Wall’s presentation of anti-Asian racism in Vancouver in the 1980s: Following in the footsteps of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the new Canadian policy substituted economic desirability for racial desirability . And this neoliberalization of immigration policy has the same effect in Canada that it did in the United States: a rapid increase in Asian immigration. 51 In this light, the celebratory discourse of legislated multiculturalism functions as a screen hiding the fact that the infusion of Asian foreign investment and rise of Asian migration into North America project a heightened expression of abstract economic rationality that is mapped onto the Asian body. In what Michaels describes as the substitution of “economic desirability for racial desirability” in immigration reform, we can see how the Asian embodiment of economic abstraction once again threatens the concrete human values invested in traditional rather than flexible citizenship. In response, Lum’s work exposes the contradictions of multicultural belonging by disidentifying with the visual tropes of multicultural inclusion and, through his image-text works, the sense of nonequivalence evoked by depictions of Asian working-class and professional labor. Postmodern Coolies and the Political Unconscious in Tropic of Orange Bringing together the aesthetic structure of stranger inhospitality, the tragicomedy of working-class Asian labor, and bad Asian capital explored in Lum’s work as conceptual anchors for my focus on Yamashita’s novel, my overarching argument is that neoliberal multiculturalism reinforces the abstraction of both wealthy and poor Asian North Americans. In the aftermath of immigration reforms that increasingly privilege wealthy Asian migrants and exclude poor Asian migrants, 52 romantic anticapitalism rejects the former for being agents of an economic takeover and the latter for draining economic resources and “stealing jobs,” once again bearing out the contradictory promise of settler colonial hospitality. Thoroughly denaturalizing the role of the border as barrier and conduit for flows of labor and capital, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works highlight the devaluation of human labor as the racial and economic fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism. What Tropic of Orange brings to this argument is a view into the dehumanization and subjective experience of both retro and high-tech coolies. Complementing each other’s vision of the intersection of race and urban labor, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works together refract the effects of the neoliberalization of immigration policy and its perversion of race discourse through multicultural rhetoric. Representing an expansion rather than a break from a prior abstract racialization, in the contemporary context of global capitalism, migration, and neoliberal ideology, Asians are both the primary racial subject of neoliberal multiculturalism and the ongoing racial target of romantic anticapitalism. As the brief glimpse of freeway conductor Manzanar Murakami that opened this chapter intimates, Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange is a novel that, like Lum’s sculptures and photographs, reworks the Real into a narrative whose fantastical elements are not pure fantasy; neither is its blunt realism an earnest display of social documentary. The novel, whose many moving parts make it difficult to summarize, might best be described as a postmodern bible of neoliberal capitalism: it is temporally organized over seven days that build toward apocalyptic catastrophe. As such it is both a quintessentially LA disaster novel 53 and an allegory of capitalist ruin, combining all the elements of what Žižek describes as “an apocalyptic end point: ecological breakdown, the biogenic reduction of humans to manipulable machines, and total digital control over our lives.” 54 The narrative consists of three seemingly disparate plotlines that eventually converge to connect the novel’s seven principal characters. The intersection of these characters from varying racial, economic, and citizenship classes—in addition to the merging of social, spatial, and technological geographies—reveals capitalism as a dynamic ecology. Each strand of connection between these human, technological, and spatial dimensions of the text amplifies the social, mental, and environmental relations that capitalism produces. Marx too refers to capitalism as a quasi-Darwinian organism, not reducible to or fully determined by any one relation (against the claim of economic determinism). Marx asks: “Does not the history of the productive organs of man in society, of organs that are the material basis of every particular organization of society, deserve equal attention [as Darwin pays to the formation of organs of plants and animals]?” 55 His own response might serve as the materialist provocation for the literal and metaphoric strands that Yamashita weaves through her novel: Technology reveals the active relation of man to nature, the direct process of the production of his life, and thereby it also lays bare the process of the production of the social relations of his life, and of the mental conceptions that flow from those relations. 56 Connecting technology, social relations, and mental conceptions, this network of relations is literally and symbolically mobilized in Tropic of Orange by a hemispheric thread being dragged from Mexico to Los Angeles by a mysterious, rogue orange. The Southern Hemisphere is pulled into the North, bringing with it histories of colonialism, labor exploitation, trade imbalances, monetary devaluation, and the cross-border “movement of free capital—45 billion—carried by hidden and cheap labor.” 57 Accompanying this thread is Arcangel, a poet and performance artist whose mission exhumes Benjamin’s “Angel of History,” 58 to give voice to five hundred years of history and resistance in the Americas and to perform the role of El Gran Mojado (The Great Wetback) in an epic wrestling match against the formidable opponent SUPERNAFTA . The second overlapping plotline concerns a massive traffic accident on LA’S Harbor Freeway, which causes explosions and forces drivers to flee while the homeless set up camp in the deserted vehicles. The unyielding traffic jam that ensues over multiple days is, as Jinqi Ling observes, “tantamount to a collapse of capitalist operation in the city of Los Angeles.” 59 Finally, in a third interwoven plotline, we meet Bobby Ngu, who is “Chinese from Singapore with a Vietnam name speaking like a Mexican living in Koreatown.” 60 A hardworking self-employed night janitor, he works during the day in the mailroom of the Los Angeles Times . Abandoned by his Mexican immigrant wife and labor activist, Rafaela, with their young son Sol, he is called by smugglers to pay for safe passage and release of a Chinese cousin in Tijuana. Thrown into these plotlines are lethal oranges, transnational infant organ trafficking, and a lot of television. Building on the significant body of insightful scholarship on the novel’s critique of free trade, its figurative representation of globalization, its hemispheric and transnational geographic scope, and its parody of multicultural universalism, 61 my reading of Tropic of Orange focuses primarily on its three main Asian characters: Bobby, Emi, and Manzanar. This focus aims to illuminate the interplay of labor, immigration status, and capitalism in the neoliberal racialization of Asians that I’ve tracked throughout this book. In particular, I explore the bifurcation of Asian racialization into the “retro” and the “high-tech” classes of what I’m calling postmodern coolie labor. As a hardworking immigrant janitor, Bobby fulfills the “retro coolie” end of the spectrum, while Emi, an Internet addict and the Japanese American television producer for NewsNow , indexes the latter, “high-tech coolie.” In my reading of Manzanar, the homeless Japanese American freeway conductor who exemplifies Marx’s idea of human freedom, I argue that he stands as a figurative embodiment of the text’s political unconscious. Drawing on Fredric Jameson’s hermeneutic approach to excavating literature’s political unconscious, we can see that within the struggle to “wrest a realm of Freedom from a realm of Necessity,” 62 Manzanar restores “to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history [of class struggle].” In many ways he is the essential hermeneutic reader of capitalism, whose primary task, as Chiang notes, “is sheer comprehension, and his conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 63 Throughout the novel, Bobby’s and Emi’s struggle to come to terms and act with political agency is symbolically fulfilled by Manzanar. Although the two characters never come into contact in the novel, Manzanar’s and Bobby’s connection rests in their unusual relation to what Mimi Nguyen calls “the refugee condition.” 64 As a refugee of Japanese American internment, Manzanar is a bodily sign of its unresolved historical excess. Gayle K. Sato observes that Manzanar “embodies and acts out the psychic reality of the inadequacy of the 1988 Civil Liberties Act in itself to enable a Japanese American to be at home in the United States.” 65 On the other hand, Bobby, whose US citizenship is the result of his entry as a refugee, is not strictly speaking a refugee at all. From a family rendered destitute after a multinational American bicycle company drove his father’s bicycle store out of business in Singapore, Bobby and his younger brother infiltrate a Vietnamese refugee camp and are eventually “Saved by the Americans” 66 and transported to the United States. Passing as so-called legitimate refugees, their claims to refugee status could also be based on how transnational American capital destroyed their chances of economic survival. In spite of Bobby’s success, an overwhelming sense of literal and symbolic homelessness haunts him and disconnects him from others. His wife Rafaela sees Bobby’s homelessness through his pervasive insecurity: “This fear of losing what you love, of not feeling trust, this fear of being someplace unsafe but pretending for the sake of others that everything was okay.” 67 Manzanar has managed, however, to convert his postinternment homelessness into an entirely different plane of consciousness about labor. And while Bobby justifies his nonstop work through profligate, empty spending, Manzanar has interrupted the cycle of labor and consumption by relinquishing material comforts to become homeless, with few possessions. Therefore, as two characters who are subject to US hospitality through redress and refugee protections, they magnify the interplay of alien labor productivity, the ethics of consumption, and the contradictions of legal citizenship. Manzanar also animates the active repression of his granddaughter Emi’s historical and political unconscious. On the surface, his homeless asceticism and “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting” 68 dramatically contrasts with his granddaughter’s postmodern exuberance for digital media and technological gadgetry. As a TV producer for NewsNow and avid consumer of the Internet, Emi’s personal disposition reflects the speed-up and commodification of time, where seconds are packaged and sold to commercial sponsors. Despite these differences, Emi’s political unconscious is made visible through this very vexed affiliation to Manzanar. While Manzanar’s homelessness expresses a selective repression of his former identity and history, Emi’s recognition of him exposes her own cultural amnesia and historical dislocation. Notwithstanding the confidence exhibited by her “padded shoulders” 69 and uninhibited personality, “it was questionable if she even had an identity.” 70 Responding to her mother’s accusation that her attitude and behavior are un-Japanese, she retorts: “Maybe I’m not Japanese American. Maybe I got switched in the hospital.” 71 Furthermore, her sense of racial and corporeal displacement is revealed when she confesses to her boyfriend Gabriel, the Chicano reporter, that she had sex with someone else “over the net” 72 but is not sure whether it “counts” as sex. In sum, as the other Japanese American in the novel, Manzanar throws into relief the multicultural aphasia and apathy that thwart Emi’s semi-conscious political will. Bringing the context of migration more explicitly into conversation with the theme of settler colonial inhospitality evoked by Lum’s furniture sculptures, Bobby Ngu’s character exemplifies the sense of homelessness that results from his indebtedness to the promise of the American Dream. He is described as “always working. Hustling. Moving.” 73 Although he owns his home and business, it isn’t enough: “Can’t explain. Happier he is, harder he works. Can’t stop. Gotta make money. Provide for his family. Gotta buy his wife nice clothes. Gotta buy his kid the best. Bobby’s kid’s gonna know the good life. That’s how Bobby sees it.” His blind faith in the American Dream is the reason he doesn’t understand his wife Rafaela’s labor activism. He cannot understand why she joined Justice for Janitors or why she’s complaining. His attitude illustrates the paradox of Mimi Nguyen’s description of the “refugee condition,” as a figure who is both “a target and also an instrument for the gift of freedom” 74 and embodies an “existential condition of suspension or surrender.” 75 He suspends thinking and surrenders to work: Always working. Washing dishes. Chopping vegetables. Cleaning floors. Cooking hamburgers. Painting walls. Laying brick. Cutting hedges. Mowing lawn. Digging ditches. Sweeping trash. Fixing pipes. Pumping toilets. Scrubbing urinals. Washing clothes. Pressing clothes. Sewing clothes. Planting trees. Changing tires. Changing oil and filters. Stocking shelves. Lifting sacks. Loading trucks. Smashing trash. Recycling plastic. Recycling aluminum. Recycling cans and glass. Drilling asphalt. Pouring cement. Building up. Tearing down. Fixing up. Cleaning up. Keeping up. 76 But as Nguyen powerfully exposes, the “gift of freedom” is itself bound up in power through the ways “liberal empire marshals its forces for and against others and elsewhere.” 77 In Bobby’s case, it is a looming sense of unrepayable debt that defines American citizenship and freedom: “Gotta be happy he’s alive in America. Saved by the Americans. New country. New life. Working hard to make it. American through and through. . . . Doing America a favor. Doing his duty.” 78 Demonstrating the inseparability of debt from the gift of freedom that Bobby expresses through his endless workdays, Nguyen writes, “The gift of freedom emerges as a site at which modern governmentality and its politics of life (and death) unfolds as a universal history of the human, and the figuration of debt surfaces as those imperial remains that preclude the subject of freedom from being able to escape a colonial order of things.” 79 It is out of racial debt that he cannot stop consuming, stop working, stop moving. His debt-bound life takes its toll on his closest relationships. His wife, Rafaela, whom he helped smuggle across the border from Mexico, shares no such sense of indebtedness that Bobby does. Getting her degree at Los Angeles Community College, she becomes a labor activist to unionize janitorial workers. As a sign of her rejection of his consumer lifestyle, when she leaves him she takes none of the material goods from their house, which is secured by double locks and a security door: She left the cherry-red Camaro Z28 with the car seat and The Club. She left the house and the 32” Sony KV32V25 stereo TV with picture-inpicture and the Panasonic PUS4670 Super-VHS VCR , the Sony Super-ESP CD player, the AT&T 9011 cordless phone, the furniture, the clothing, the two-door Frigidaire with the icemaker, the Maytag super-capacity washer and gas dryer, the Sharp Carousel R1471 microwave, everything. . . . Didn’t even lock the security door. 80 The nonsensical series of numbers and letters that accompany each commodity satirizes the meaningless abstractions of commodity culture and the value Bobby sees reflected in them. But the many locks, the security door, and the Club Bobby installs to defend his home and car emphasize the intrinsic insecurity and fear that are the basis of his homelessness. His relationship to his younger brother also suffers. Although he sends money, pays college tuition, and pays for books, “when they get together, there’s nothing to say. Bobby’s too busy working.” 81 He realizes after Rafaela leaves him that she and his younger brother “wanted something more.” 82 After he is called by a snakehead to pay for the release of a Chinese cousin being held in Mexico, Bobby begins to see new relations between debt, consumption, and retro coolie labor that he and his wife perform. His first step is to extricate himself from the spiral of work and consumption: like his smoking habit, it’s an addiction that is difficult to quit but will eventually kill him if he doesn’t. Rafaela left because “[she] didn’t want to watch him die.” 83 He begins to reflect on what he had previously refused to hear from Rafaela about their existence as cheap labor, that “we’re not wanted here. Nobody respects our work. Say we cost money. Live on welfare.” 84 He begins to see that by immersing himself in work he has failed to recognize how devalued his life and work are in the United States. His second step is to take a crash course in global capitalism by reading Rafaela’s papers about NAFTA : Titles like Maquiladoras & Migrants. Undocumented, Illegal & Alien: Immigrants vs. Immigration . Talks about globalization of capital. Capitalization of poverty. Internationalization of the labor force. Exploitation and political expediency. Devaluation of currency and foreign economic policy. Economic intervention . 85 Reading them he realizes, “Maybe he’s been too busy. Maybe. But it’s not like he don’t understand.” 86 He begins to see how the circuit of migrant debt and provisional freedom is orchestrated by settler colonial capitalism. The way Rafaela’s papers conceptualize the exploitation of free trade resonates powerfully with the novel’s poet-prophet, Arcangel, who also understands the flows of migrant labor back and forth across the “New World Border”: the deportation of 400,000 Mexican citizens in 1923 coaxing back of 2.2 million braceros in 1942 only to exile the same 2.2 million wetbacks in 1953 . 87 Here the border extends an invitation or expedites removal, exemplifying the contradictions of hospitality evoked earlier in Lum’s furniture sculptures. Alien laborers like him, Bobby realizes, are among the many “gifts from NAFTA ,” the “oranges, bananas, corn, lettuce, guarachis, women’s apparel, tennis shoes, radios, electrodomestics, live-in domestics, living domestics, gardeners, dishwashers, waiters, masons, ditch diggers, migrants, pickers, packers, braceros, refugees, centroamericanos, wetbacks, wops, undocumenteds, illegals, aliens.” 88 Here gifts and debt are one and the same: the gift of migrant labor is multiplied in their ongoing debt to settler colonial capitalism. Bobby’s growing awareness of the exigencies of migration born out of the “capitalization of poverty ” and “globalization of capital ” is enhanced by the situation of his teenage cousin Xiayue, who is being held by smugglers in Tijuana. Although he is skeptical of their relation, he is compelled to help her when he hears she is from Fujian, the same village his mother came from. 89 Fujian, in particular, has a long history of out-migration, more recently due to economic pressures resulting from the Chinese government’s market reforms catering to North American consumer markets. These areas are often classified as Special Economic Zones, which have few labor laws, prohibit trade unions, and slash import and export taxes in order to increase trade. In China, as Peter Kwong remarks, market reforms “have practically eliminated all labor laws, labor benefits and protections. In the ‘free enterprise zones’ workers live virtually on the factory floor, laboring fourteen hours a day for a mere two dollars—that is, about 20 cents an hour.” 90 In the novel, because both of her parents are dead, Xiayue and her older brother knew that they “would have to come [to the United States] sooner or later.” 91 His own mother dead too, Bobby identifies with the girl, thinking, “It’s like it’s maybe twenty years ago. Like it’s him and his kid brother,” 92 except her situation is far more dire. Her arrival has none of the protections of being a refugee. Bobby contemplates the fate of her brother, who, if he’s alive, will enter an America that hasn’t changed since the nineteenth century: “The brother’s gonna work. Work like all the celestials before him. Put down rail ties. Pick oranges. Wash shirts. Sew garments. Stir-fry chop suey.” 93 The sister’s fate is less clear. Passing her off as his daughter, just as he himself passed as a refugee, Bobby gets Xiayue across the border as effortlessly as swiping his credit card: “Drag themselves through the slit jus’ like any Americanos. Just like Visa cards.” 94 The “collapsing of visas and Visa cards,” as Molly Wallace observes, depicts the United States as a “landscape thoroughly mortgaged to global capital. . . . Consumerism, in Tropic of Orange , replaces nationalism.” 95 But within the Visa’s symbolism of debt accumulation, in this case it is poor Third World migrants who must assume that debt. By accompanying Xiayue across the US-Mexico border, Bobby witnesses the transparent economic logic of immigration policy. Just as business immigrants can pay their way into North American citizenship, the poor can purchase entrance, yet the poor must pay off this lifelong debt with insecure citizenship. 96 Through her depiction of US-Mexico border crossing, Yamashita eviscerates the moral standing of the refugee (as the target for the “gift of freedom”) and the immoral standing of the undocumented Asian migrant (as unworthy subject of hospitality) to emphasize the shared conditions of economic exploitation that align poor migrants across free trade zones. Their insecurity is captured when Bobby has no response for Xiayue’s repeated question “What is social security?” 97 In the way that Lum’s photo-text works Melly Shum Hates Her Job and Phew, I’m Tired present a visual challenge to the aesthetics of neoliberal multiculturalism by depicting racial and gendered labor ironically, as a kind of sentimental pop art, Emi’s character in Tropic of Orange also frustrates its homogenizing logics. Unlike Melly Shum’s, however, her private thoughts are not betrayed by the artist but, rather, willingly expressed by her character. Despite Emi’s clear disconnect from her Japanese American cultural heritage and racial politics—her idea of real “struggle” is when her parents force her to make “payments on [her] Civic” 98 —her insights about the contradictory interplay of Asian racialization and neoliberal multiculturalism reveal a surfacing political consciousness. With blithe unsentimentality, Emi recognizes the dehumanized mechanical abstraction that the Asian body signifies. Ridiculing the romantic anticapitalist sentiments of her boyfriend Gabriel’s desire to reject “all this [materialism]” and commune with nature by “mak[ing] something I can actually touch and eat,” she tells him, “I read somewhere that these days, if you are making a product you can actually touch and . . . [are] making a comfortable living at it, you are either an Asian or a machine.” 99 Her point is that Gabriel’s valorization of productive over financial labor, signaled by “planting a tree,” is a false one—that there is no nature external to capitalism. Moreover, with deindustrialization and US outsourcing of manufacturing labor, the level of exploitation experienced by Third World Asian laborers reduces them to dehumanized machines. Such a vexed conflation of Asians and machines—as high-tech coolies—is also one of the reasons she admits that “there are producers who would kill me if they knew who I was.” 100 However, Emi’s own obsession with technological gadgetry and immersion into the ephemeral world of cyber-sex suggest her own resigned participation in the increasing digital abstraction of social lives, as she remarks, “Who needs a reality check?” 101 Despite Emi’s cynical disdain for politics, she is able to see past the multiculturalist veneer of capitalist determinism. At a sushi restaurant she informs Gabriel that money drives everything, that social change has nothing to do with justice or humanity: It’s just about money. It’s not about good honest people like you or about whether us Chicanos or Asians get a bum rap or whether third world countries deserve dictators or whether we should make the world safe for democracy. It’s about selling things: Reebok, Pepsi, Chevrolet, All-State, Pampers, Pollo Loco, Levis, Fritos, Larry Parker Esq., Tide, Raid, the Pillsbury Doughboy, and Famous Amos. Them that’s smart took away the pretense and do the home shopping thing, twenty-four hours. Hey, we’re all on board to buy. 102 In Emi’s economic determinist rendition, social justice is just a “pretense”—a fetish of capitalist ideology. But in her view one may as well embrace this reality because there is no ethical outside: “We’re all on board to buy.” Her pragmatism leads her to take on a particular disdain for the pretext of multicultural ethics, to the extent that she enjoys being as “antimulticultural” 103 as possible. As a favorite pastime, she and Gabriel devise fictional stories about the “multicultural mosaic” 104 of characters while they are eating lunch in the sushi restaurant, including the “Caucasian Japanophiles who talk real Japanese with the sushi man.” 105 Predictably, an eavesdropping white woman takes offense to Emi’s pronouncements that “cultural diversity is bullshit. . . . It’s a white guy wearing a Nirvana T-shirt and dreds. That’s cultural diversity.” 106 In defense of multiculturalism and cultural diversity, the woman—wearing two “ornately-lacquered chopsticks” in her hair—retorts, “I love living in L.A. because I can find anything in the world to eat, right here. . . . A true celebration of the international world. It just makes me sick to hear people speak so cynically about something so positive and to make assumptions about people based on their color.” 107 The woman’s morally superior rationale highlights the evacuated antiracist politics that Žižek ascribes to “multiculturalism, or the cultural logic of multinational capitalism,” in which “liberal ‘tolerance’ condones the folklorist Other deprived of its substance—like the multitude of ‘ethnic cuisines’ in a contemporary megalopolis.” 108 In short, the woman’s expression of neoliberal moralism converts racial politics into a celebratory form of white cultural consumption, flattening racial difference into a commodified feature of the global city. For this reason we hear an echo of Melly Shum Hates Her Job in Emi’s retort: “I hate being multicultural.” 109 Both Melly Shum and Emi recognize that for the racialized worker operating within a capitalist logic of multicultural equivalence, “you’re invisible, I’m invisible. We’re all invisible. It’s just tea, ginger, raw fish, and a credit card.” 110 At another level, Emi’s exchange with the white woman recalls the post-modern racism evoked by Lum’s photograph Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate : Nancy and Joe can be viewed as the inviolable poster children of multiculturalism, a shield of cultural diversity to deflect criticism of the dramatic escalation of real estate values in Vancouver that is often blamed on wealthy Asian investors. In Tropic of Orange , the woman’s implication that Emi is being racist by “mak[ing] assumptions about people based on their color” parallels the way that, in the similar urban context of Vancouver, where neoliberalism has reformed immigration policy and expanded the flow of capital across international borders, it has become racist to call into question the logic of capitalism. In a perversion of racial politics, open challenges such as Emi’s to the multicultural logic of capitalism have been conflated with racist and anti-immigrant voices. As Jodi Melamed points out, neoliberal multiculturalism “disconnects antiracism and economic justice, denying race as a structure of capitalist organization” that would reveal “continuities between prewar colonial capitalism and postwar US global ascendancy and expanding transnational capitalism.” 111 Moreover, when the white woman accuses Emi of racial intolerance, we see how her neoliberal expression of cultural appreciation obfuscates the profound continuity between racial divisions produced historically—through structures of colonialism and slavery—and the contemporary expropriation of surplus-value from racialized and gendered Third World labor working in free-trade zones. Such an ideology simultaneously naturalizes economic disparity by deflecting criticism through moralizing slogans of cultural diversity and racial equivalence. Ultimately, Emi prevails in revealing the superficiality of the woman’s moral high ground when she ridicules her self-serving multiculturalist aestheticism, asking her whether she would “consider using these [two forks] in your hair? Or would you consider that . . . unsanitary?” 112 The woman’s expression is appropriately “blanched” in response. After Los Angeles authorities wage a full-scale military assault on the homeless occupants of abandoned cars on the jammed freeway while Emi is tanning on top of the NewsNow van, her death by the first bullet evokes the doubleness signaled by the Asian body’s economism, an inherently racial ambiguity that positions her both as retro coolie underclass and high-tech coolie/robot overclass. Her last words, “Abort. Retry. Ignore. Fail,” 113 seem to recall the death of a replicant in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner and is similarly mired in racial signifiers of mechanical and technological domination. Following David Palumbo-Liu’s reading of the film’s representation of the human/nonhuman divide as a racialized phenomenon that “serves to maintain the essential inhuman character of the replicant against that of the human,” 114 the replicants too evoke a doubleness in the sense that they are simultaneously the slaves and potential oppressors of white humans. Blurring the line between human victim and cyborg oppressor, Emi offers a renewed representation of Lye’s observation of the conspiratorial economism invested in the Asian figure: “When we are looking at Japanese, we can never be sure whether we are seeing businessmen or coolies.” 115 As a conflation of both, she epitomizes a Homo sacer , she who “may be killed and yet not sacrificed ” 116 in the free-fire zone of the homeless-occupied freeway. Within the logic of Yamashita’s narrative, Emi’s doubleness is also linked to her political and cultural alienation in the face of her estranged grandfather, Manzanar. The paralysis she experiences is symbolic of her inability to engage with her family history and Japanese American history more broadly. After initially recognizing her grandfather on the overpass and “star[ing] at him in disbelief,” 117 she can only watch him from afar cursing to herself—“Damn that old deadbeat on the overpass” 118 —and never finds “the courage to march up there to meet the man.” 119 After Buzzworm repeatedly urges her to meet him, she shrugs him off, asking, “What’s the point?” 120 Her death soon after this exchange suggests that it is this sense of apathy that is partially responsible for her untimely death. Even though she begins to absorb Manzanar’s consciousness through the music he conducts—“a melody she could not place but knew. Electronic tones representing numerical information, i.e., music” 121 —she shuns her genetic connection to the old man: “Wasn’t everything from Alzheimer’s to schizophrenia genetic? Damn.” 122 After she is shot, Emi dreams that she will be buried in the La Brea Tar Pits and later become “La Brea Woman . . . bones and a holographic image of me.” 123 Her identification with the ancient Indigenous woman buried in the tar pits suggests, perhaps, her own regret that she too will become some mysterious, decomposed hieroglyph of history. Even though her death might stem from political paralysis, her slaying catapults her to the status of Christ-like martyrdom whose endlessly repeated televised death signals the onset of urban war, particularly for Manzanar. The moment she is shot, he can no longer go on conducting the swelling sounds of revolution below him as he awakens to his own anger and pain: “The sound of the shot penetrated Manzanar’s very being with a vengeance he did not understand. The moment repeated itself again and again; he clothed it in desperation each time with pain and more pain.” 124 Coming back to the surface, his memories return in a flood, triggered by the sight of an infant’s heart that has been harvested and trafficked from south of US-Mexico border. In this moment, instead of joining sounds of the freeway into “an entire civilization of sound,” 125 he connects his own history: his wartime confinement in a Japanese American internment camp, his surgical practice of “careful incisions . . . inserting implants, facilitating transplants,” 126 and his life on the societal margins as a homeless freeway conductor. Although he is no longer a surgeon, which, as Ling observes, registers “his refusal to participate in the perpetuation of human tragedy in the name of human need” by “using organs obtained from questionable sources,” 127 the visions of premature death reanimate his connection to the world he left behind. In the profound sensory universe from which Manzanar hails, his “surfacing” is enacted through visual rather than aural stimuli: the sight of the infant heart and of his fatally wounded granddaughter. But his reconnection to the surface world of sight and sound ultimately overloads him: “He had seen enough. And he had heard everything.” 128 Our last glimpse of Manzanar is on a gurney hanging from a helicopter holding his granddaughter’s hand, witnessing from above a vision of atomic annihilation stopped short: Peering cautiously from his higher perch, saw bird’s-eye the inflation of thousands upon thousands of automotive airbags, bursting simultaneously everywhere from their pouches in steering wheels and glove compartments like white poppies in sudden bloom. All the airbags in L.A. ruptured forth, unfurled their white powdered wings against the barrage of bullets, and stunned the war to a dead stop. But Manzanar heard nothing . 129 Here the simultaneous bursting of thousands of airbags, like “white poppies in sudden bloom,” eerily evoke the mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But in this case it is the supernatural force of the airbags’ automatic deployment that stops the war. Regardless, Manzanar hears nothing. Manzanar’s deafness at this apocalyptic scene exceeds what Ling identifies as the “cognitive plenitude” 130 he performs as a freeway conductor, where his brain is comfortably submerged under an ocean of “foam and floating kelp.” 131 Without the orchestral language of his political consciousness, in his confrontation with the sensory overload of capitalist urbanity he “dissolves,” as Ling contends, “into the novel’s imagined urban tide of carnival revolts.” 132 Manzanar’s sensory collapse suggests the difficult unity of political consciousness and the materiality of racialized vulnerability to death. Although the novel ends without a clear sense of Manzanar’s fate, his ascent from the overpass onto a gurney flying across LA while “the entire city [had] sprouted grassroots conductors of every sort” 133 presents a tilted ecology of capitalist relations where Manzanar’s urban literacy has been disseminated to a next generation of conductors. Like Manzanar, whose romantic detachment as freeway conductor dissolves the moment Emi is shot, Emi and Bobby also undergo metamorphosis. Emi’s cultural alienation and immersion into digital technology ultimately leads to high-tech failure as she dies. Bobby, whose working life has turned him into a labor automaton, stops working. Reversing the inhuman tropes of Asians as “killer robots” or “Asian ‘dragon’ gangs” depicted in narratives that participate in what Mike Davis calls the “literary destruction of LA ,” 134 Yamashita’s Asian characters collectively register sensory disability (Manzanar), nonproductivity (Bobby), and technological failure (Emi). This generalized sphere of nonproductivity gestures toward what Mitchell and Snyder recognize as “forms of incapacity as the new galvanizing agent of post-modern resistance.” 135 But we are left with a far-from-sanguine vision of LA : homeless junkies feasting on trafficked infant organs “toasted like marshmallows” 136 and the mutual destruction of SUPERNAFTA and Arcangel in the wrestling match “sponsored by a generous grant from the Ministry of Multicultures [and hosted by] the CIA , the PRI , the DEA , and the INS ”; 137 “profits from the ticket sales were being divided” 138 after the match. It is a world in suspension, “unplugged and timeless,” 139 on the verge of collapse. To amplify the political stakes of narrative suspension that concludes Yamashita’s novel, I want to bring this chapter to a close by returning to Ken Lum’s artwork to tie the themes of labor and neoliberal immigration together with the strands of Asian racialization and romantic anticapitalism I have explored through this book. In particular, like the tilted capitalist ecology presented in Yamashita’s novel, Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (figure 4.10 ) offers a similarly “unnatural” presentation of global movement shaped by settler colonial capitalism. The sculpture is the result of a commission Lum won in 1999 that was part of Vancouver’s Millennial Public Art Project, “On Location.” The work, located on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery, cannot be viewed in its entirety from any one side of the building. It consists of four boats, each placed on a corner of the gallery roof that faces east, west, north, or south. FIGURE 4.10 Ken Lum, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , 2000.

The different primary colors chosen for each boat suggest racial typologies: yellow for Chinese, red for First Nations, white for Europeans, and black for Indians. The design of each boat also evokes more concrete historical periods and episodes. For instance, the red boat is a representation of a First Nations longboat used by Coast Salish communities located along the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. The white boat depicts the HMS Discovery , the Royal Navy ship that led George Vancouver’s exploration of the West Coast of North America between 1791 and 1795. The black boat in Lum’s sculpture is a replica of the Komagata Maru , a Japanese boat chartered by an Indian businessman in the early twentieth century. In 1914, 376 British Indian residents of Hong Kong, China, and Japan who were onboard the Komagata Maru were detained for two months in Vancouver Harbor before being turned away. Even though the boat had fulfilled the requirements of a “continuous journey” law, specifically designed to bar entry of Indian immigrants unless they arrived “by a continuous journey on through tickets purchased before leaving the country,” 140 their legal exclusion was ultimately based on their presumed unassimilability in a white Canada. The fourth, yellow boat in Lum’s sculpture is a representation of one of the four Fujianese migrant ships that, reprising the Komagata Maru incident eighty-five years later, were detained off the coast of Vancouver in 1999 for nearly two months. On board were 599 undocumented migrants from the Fujian province of China, who—unlike Bobby’s niece Xiayue—were detained and eventually deported. The title of Lum’s sculpture, Four Boats Stranded , is a specific reference to the media’s characterization of the four Fujianese boats. For the most part, the media coverage exploited their criminality through images of barbed wire, shackles, guard dogs, orange prison uniforms, and guards. As Anna Pratt remarks, this event demonstrated the “slippage between categories of refugees, frauds, and criminals . . . [and] spectacle in the application of sovereign power.” 141 Lum’s sculpture’s subtitle, Red and Yellow, Black and White , evokes an American abolitionist context. According to Carla Benzan, the phrase refers to a Civil War–era Sunday school song whose verse goes: “Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world; red and yellow, black and white.” 142 By drawing on dissonant tropes of settler colonialism, Asian exclusion, and racial equivalence, the sculpture’s response to the migrant crisis is largely an invocation of immigration history: a history of boat people. If we consider this sculpture against the aesthetic disorientations of Lum’s furniture sculptures and image-text works discussed earlier, Four Boats Stranded ’s invocation of immigration history is similarly irreverent. For one, despite being a public art commission, the sculpture is located on the roof of the downtown gallery and thus is largely inaccessible to the public audience. Here the work ironically inverts the duality of disinterested high art and low “popular” art in its placement above the gallery, so that it is literally “high” art. In keeping with pop art’s challenge of the exclusivity and cultural orthodoxy of the art gallery space, Lum’s bright, toylike depiction of the boats similarly evokes the staged pathos of narratives that erase Native peoples to remind us that we are “a nation of immigrants.” Given the themes of commodified repetition in pop art such as Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroes, this pop-art rendering of the boats also suggests a banality and reproducibility as subjects of mass consumption. As such, they subvert the association of art as the original product of artistic invention and leave the viewer without a straightforward idea of the sculpture’s relation toward the historical and political content it clearly alludes to. By taking boats out of water and putting them into the air, I suggest, Lum aims here, as in his other works, to offer a decontextualized aesthetics of the border and thereby denaturalize its racial logics. From this view, the placement of the sculpture on the gallery roof connects to Yamashita’s novel in terms of the inverted, suspended ecology it similarly evokes. While the landscape of Tropic of Orange is transformed by a thread pulling the Southern Hemisphere into the North, Lum’s sculpture reconfigures the spatial properties of land, water, and air with boats that apparently fly. The very inaccessibility of these boats also highlights the work of a metaphoric and invisible border that has “stranded” these four boats high in the air. Decontextualizing the North–South border as a thread and the East–West border as air, Yamashita’s and Lum’s works suggest connection and absence, respectively. For Yamashita, that connection is first rendered ambiguous as Bobby, in the novel’s final scene, grasps the thread, asking himself, “What are these goddamn lines anyway? What do they connect? What do they divide?” 143 His decision to let go and rejoin his family suggests that the thread is no longer a border to cross; it is now a line to release. In Lum’s sculpture, the apparatus of the border is reconfigured as an art domain, a space of figuration that deconstructs a pop veneer of multicultural equivalence contained in the rhetoric of a “nation of immigrants.” Reframing the nation as a field of racial incommensurability, Lum’s boats stage a narrative of white settler colonial invasion: the conversion of Indigenous land into sovereign property with the power to exclude based on race, in the case of the Komagata Maru , followed by the neoliberal power to include on the basis of economic class, in the case of the exclusion of poor Fujianese migrants. Adopting a pop aesthetic, Lum’s sculpture undermines the rhetoric of the border as a moralizing tool of neoliberal multiculturalism whose hospitality is reserved for flexible citizens and high-tech coolies while exploiting the vulnerability of Fujianese retro coolies and other undocumented arrivals. From a more dystopic perspective, moreover, the suspended boats parody the dream of totally boundless free trade and mobility, what Postone describes as “a fantasy of freedom as the complete liberation from matter, from nature . . . a ‘dream of capital’ [that] is becoming the nightmare of that from which it strives to free itself—the planet and its inhabitants.” 144 Denaturalizing nature itself, Lum and Yamashita redirect the target of romantic anticapitalism toward the field of representation that obfuscates the dehumanizing dialectic of capitalist value. By animating the border against its North–South and East–West hemispheric histories, Yamashita and Lum accentuate its prominence in the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. According to Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler, “the settler mode of production” relies on a developed capitalist world market and exploitation of the migrant labor system, a system that has advantages over slave holding because it helps to paralyze the resistance potential of domestic labor. They explain that “from purely economic considerations, migrant labour seems more efficient in terms of absolute surplus-value formation and the minimization of the social costs of reproduction.” 145 Contrary to the notion that migrant labor is an economic burden, migrant labor often assumes the total costs of its social reproduction. Moreover, the United States’ long-standing interventionist mode has transformed economies and governments south of the border and across the Pacific and has contributed to the internationalization and expansion of the surplus labor force from which North America can draw. Settler colonial capitalism continually reinvents the levels of unfreedom through the creation of the debt-bound migrant. As Bierrman and Kössler explain, “Settler capitalism differs from slave-holding in the important respect that here the class of migrant workers as a whole is, in true capitalist fashion, dependent on the class of settler capitalists as a whole. Although the migrant workers are not personally free, their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 146 In Yamashita’s and Lum’s respective evocations of the suspended function that interrupts the productive flow of migrant labor and capital, they emphasize the destructive interplay of human labor and value production that is objectified at the border.

      "content": "EPILOGUE THE REVENGE OF THE IRON CHINK Capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons which is mediated through things. —Karl Marx, Capital Figure E.1 is a fish-butchering machine that is on permanent display at the Royal British Columbia Museum, located in my hometown of Victoria, British Columbia. On the other side of the machine, not visible here, its name appears in large, capital letters: “IRON CHINK .” The machine was built by the Victoria Machinery Depot in 1909 and replaced a crew of thirty butchers. As indicated on the information placard at the exhibit, “it processed about 60 fish per minute, removing tail and fins, slicing open the belly and scraping out the guts.” 1 It was named the Iron Chink for the Chinese butchery crews it replaced in salmon canneries along the Pacific coast, a machine capable of gutting salmon at a rate of sixty to seventy-five fish per minute with a crew of only three laborers. As Geoff Meggs explains, “Before 1900, twenty-five men could handle only 1,500 to 2,000 fish in a ten-hour day. Now a single iron butcher could keep two canning lines amply supplied with a fraction of the labour.” 2 Today the Iron Chink resides in the museum as a relic of early industrial innovation and accompanying racial attitudes. I offer this concluding example of the Iron Chink because it serves as an unusual corollary to the example of the 2012 controversy over the erased Asian scientist from the Canadian hundred-dollar-bill that began this book. In that example, I argued that the controversy animated the negative association of Asians with money, an association that adapts a form of modern anti-Semitism which sees Jews as the architects of a destructive capitalism. The origins of such a racialized alignment of Jews with capitalism stemmed from their historical segregation in financial sectors of the economy. Such interest-generating sectors—that is, financial institutions that make money out of money—have historically been taboo and aligned with moral and sexual impurity and corruption. For example, condemnations of usury are present across Christian, Islamic, Judaic, and Buddhist religious texts. Today Islamic law outlaws charging interest, and until the mid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church similarly barred the charging of interest. 3 As David Harvey elaborates, “Conservative Catholics often compared investment houses to bordellos and viewed financial operations as a form of prostitution.” 4 Images from the period satirized this connection, and Harvey points to one cartoon that depicts a young woman trying to entice a horrified man into an investment house, telling him, “My rate of return is good for whatever amount you wish to invest. I’ll treat you very gently.” 5 Although investing in interest-generating financial products is the norm today and is no longer compared to hiring a prostitute, the connotations of race, gender, and sexual immorality are not entirely absent. One can point to Forbes magazine’s review of the 2013 feature film The Wolf of Wall Street : according to Forbes , the film “proves that Hollywood sees finance as drugs, sex and rock and roll.” 6 This is certainly not the first time Wall Street has been portrayed as a perverse universe of greed and sexual vice that corrupts individuals. 7 This book has explored Asians’ negative alignment with a destructive capitalism that is derived from value’s origins in labor, specifically abstract labor. The controversy over the one-hundred-dollar bill sheds light on how, as a negative personification of capital, Asians, unlike Jews, symbolize a destructive dimension of value based on what Marx calls “socially necessary labor time.” In a settler colonial context that relies on alien labor, Asian labor has had a precarious relation to the racial, gendered, and sexual constitution of “social necessity.” If the one-hundred-dollar bill illustrates the abstraction of Asians as money, the Iron Chink highlights the abstraction of Asians as machines. Because value is based on socially necessary human labor time, machines are not a source of value—only a source of temporary relative surplus value. What the case of the Iron Chink evokes is the way Asian labor is symbolically transposed onto a machine designed to cut human labor time, the true source of value, in exchange for the more temporary and volatile production of relative surplus-value. 8 Here the dehumanized labor efficiency evoked by the “Chink” suggests both a perverse excess and unnatural form of labor. The link between the one-hundred-dollar bill (as money commodity) and the Iron Chink (as machine commodity) is how racial signifiers animate the work of the fetish to misrepresent the relations between people as the relations between things. As money or machine, the Asian is aligned with the destructive value dimension of capitalism. Staying at the level of metaphor, it is also interesting that in personifying capital, the erased Asian scientist and the Iron Chink bear a metaphorical trace of the duplicitous role of capitalist value that emanates from the commodity form, whose “mysterious character . . . reflects the social characteristics of men’s own labour as objective characteristics of the products of labour themselves, as the socio-natural properties of these things.” 9 By projecting racial personifications of quantifiable and qualitative dimensions of labor onto money and machine commodities, both examples offer a similar metaphorical trace of “the social relation of the producers to the sum total of labour as a social relation between objects,” insofar as the social relations of race are abstracted onto the commodities themselves “apart from and outside the producers.” 10 In this light, the fetishism of commodities is essentially a figurative operation , “a substitution [whereby] the products of labour become commodities, sensuous things which are at the same time suprasensible or social.” 11 This reinforces one of this book’s main points: that capitalism is a representational (and misrepresentational) regime where the metaphoric activity of the fetish “conceals the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual workers.” 12 The fetish conceals as it substitutes, rendering unequal elements the same by turning them into values. Richard Godden describes this as the “metaphoric moment of the fetish”: even though “A is not B any more than a person is a thing or money a person,” the metaphoric work of the fetish forces them into a nonidentical unity. 13 We can go a step further and identify the value dimension of commodities as the central engine for this metaphoric work because the only way that commodities can assert their value is through the relative exchange of equivalent units of abstract labor, or socially necessary labor time. Value is thus a “metaphor in hiding” that conceals its own metaphoricity—one that is “structurally essential to capitalist reality, yet one whose advocates disavow its internal contradictions.” 14 So whether we’re talking about the Iron Chink, the Canadian one-hundreddollar polymer bill, financial derivatives, debt, and so on, at their core as commodities they retain a dual character that I’ve tracked through this book: that of concrete labor (qualitatively diverse labor) and abstract labor (commensurate units of labor time). Even though financial products appear to be in a world of their own and seem, as some have suggested, to “have nothing to do with national production or the labor of any nation’s citizen subjects,” 15 we should understand this false assessment as a consequence of the fetish. As I’ve tried to emphasize in this book, neoliberal regimes that deregulate flows of capital are concomitant with the global expansion of exploited surplus labor forces. As Godden puts it, “Given the ‘two-fold nature’ of financial value, labor, however peripheral to thought and geography, however seemingly disposable, retains its place at value’s core.” 16 It is precisely this mystified connection between labor and value that must be exposed to even contemplate a world where people control the products of their labor rather than being controlled by them. Let me clarify this point. I do not mean to suggest that in a postcapitalist world people would control the products of their labor through the ideal of collective ownership of the means of production, an underlying principle that has structured communist and socialist states past and present. By extension, so-called socialist state practices that redistribute wealth and resources, solve problems of overproduction and effective demand (Keynesianism), eliminate private property, support trade unions, or reduce the hours in the workweek will never eliminate capitalism. They accommodate capitalism by making it more bearable, which is certainly not a bad thing. Rather, what I am suggesting is that what underlies the massive racialized and gendered disparities in wealth on a global scale is embedded in the labor process itself, in labor whose sole purpose is to create more and more value. The relation between labor and value is the motor of capitalism’s immanent drive to accumulate, and it is this relationship that plays a socially mediating role in humanity’s relation to technology, nature, the modes of production, social relations, the reproduction of daily life, and mental conceptions of the world. 17 As I have argued throughout this book, social relations produced out of commodity production are antinomical, externalizing its concrete and abstract dimensions. Here again we discern the metaphoric role of the fetish, which extends its substitutions into the social world. Not only does the dual character of labor as concrete and abstract constitute the very basis of capitalism; this duality also frames the contradictions of social life. Marx’s nineteenth-century assessment seems particularly apt for our current situation: Everything seems pregnant with its contrary. Machinery gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labour, we behold starving and overworking it. The new-fangled sources of wealth, by some weird spell, are turned into sources of want. . . . This antagonism between modern industry and science on the one hand, modern misery and dissolution on the other hand . . . is a fact, palpable, overwhelming, and not to be controverted. 18 If we anchor these contradictions in the very duality that structures social relations, we may reconsider cultural and ideological contradictions of race, gender, and sexuality as extensions of the contradictions between abstract universality (of humanity) and concrete particularity of race, gender, and sexual identities. As Postone proposes, “Such an approach can address the constitution of values and worldviews in terms of specific, contradictory social forms, rather than in terms of the cognitive and moral progress of the human species [by grasping] the two-sided character of capitalist development in cultural and ideological terms as well.” 19 This proposes that the founding, metaphorical duplicity at the heart of capitalist value, the metaphoric movement of concrete labor into abstract labor, creates tensions that become manifest in social life. But let us return to the Iron Chink. As a personification of the simultaneous efficiency and disposability of the Chinese laborer, the Iron Chink articulates the contradictions of settler colonial capitalism that expose the inhumanity of commodity-determined labor. Connecting its symbolism to our contemporary moment, artist Tommy Ting’s 2012 sculpture Machine (Iron Chink, invented in 1903, found at the Gulf of Georgia Cannery in Steveston, British Columbia, refabricated in Beijing, China) resurrects the Iron Chink, giving it a new look and perhaps a new voice. Extending the symbolic presence of Black Frankenstein in American literature and visual culture, the resurrection of the Iron Chink similarly employs a gothic humor, “laughing back as well as haunting back.” 20 In this frame we can consider how the monstrously reanimated Asian Frankenstein returns to British Columbia to rebel against its original creators. The first thing we notice about Ting’s Machine (figure E.2 ) is its sly engagement with the original. Eliminating the iron, Ting instead uses PVC , painted “China Red” and manufactured in a modeling factory in China. By adapting pop art strategies, Ting has thus recontextualized the salmon-gutting machine as sculpture, transforming low to high. The bright, gleaming red of the sculpture evokes a sexiness we are more likely to associate with a race car than an early twentieth-century industrial machine. At the level of satire, this projection of sensuality seems to poke fun at the romantic glorification of machine technology. In particular, the presence of the shipping crate undercuts a monumental reading of technological glory. The shipping crate, which itself has undergone transformation into sculptural object, emphasizes the sculpture’s status as an import, a migrant machine. This emphasis speaks to our contemporary reality, in which China is the manufacturing source of many of the products we consume in the west—and apparently China is a place where we can even outsource our racial stereotypes. Moreover, as a vessel that carries the personification of a racial metaphor, the shipping crate presents a sardonic comment on the imprisoning, dehumanized conditions of global labor migration. Part of the dark comedy in Ting’s piece lies in how it perfectly embodies the dehumanized abstraction that I’ve tied to Asian racialization throughout this book. In its shiny new modern form, Machine not only evokes the continuing metaphorization of Asian labor but also dramatizes its ongoing allure through its vibrant China Red color. In its seductive appeal, Machine hyperbolizes the sexualization of the Chinese female migrant, who was subject to the 1875 Page Law, the United States’ first federal immigration law designed to bar entry to Chinese women based on their presumed sexual immorality. In this light, as a feminized Asian Frankenstein, Machine stands as an ironic invocation of the sexualized and racialized migrant system so central to the settler colonial mode of capitalist reproduction. But equally, Machine ’s China Red paint clearly evokes the color of communism, giving rise to both positive and negative connotations. On one hand, the China Red color cheerfully promotes the communist ideal of collective ownership of the means of production. On the other, the color alludes to communism’s association with the mechanization of human labor. But the reality is that Machine remains, at the end of the day, a commodity whose value is commensurable and thus exchangeable with all other commodities. As the monstrous personification of dehumanized equivalence, Asian Franken stein expresses the contradiction between the value of human beings and their exchangeability as equivalents.

Marx refers to value as a “veil” that transforms labor power into a form of equivalence, one that will not be “removed from the countenance of the social life-process . . . until it becomes production by freely associated men, and stands under their conscious and planned control.” 21 To remove value’s veil of equivalence suggests a world of radical transparency and symbolic control. If we are to imagine a world beyond capitalism, it will require reconstituting commodity-determined labor and its mediation of social and cultural temporality. Only then will it be possible to abolish capitalist value, a form of metaphoric power that obfuscates its own metaphoricity. Only then will labor time cease to play a socially mediating role that is external to the human beings performing the labor. A world beyond capitalist value means a new set of social relations between people and nature, technology, and mental conceptions but also, and perhaps most importantly, the recognition of the radical incommensurability of humanity as the basis of emancipation.",

In her discussion of sexology, Somerville explores the influential role that women of color’s bodies had on establishing and adjudicating racial, gender, and sexual normativity. She explains that “comparative anatomy located the boundaries of race through the sexual and reproductive anatomy of the African female body, ignoring altogether the problematic absence of male bodies from these studies” (Queering the Color Line , 25). In Entry Denied , Luibhéid demonstrates how nonwhite women served to rationalize restrictions based on psychological and moral “deviance.” 7 . “‘Asian-Looking’ Woman Removed from Canada’s $100 Bill,” Angry Asian Man (blog), August 17, 2012, http://blog.angryasianman.com/2012/08/asian-looking-woman-removed-from.html . 8 .

Becker’s theory of human capital has antecedents in the work of Adam Smith and others whom Marx referred to as “apologetic economists.” Like Becker, they attempt to claim that the worker’s labor power exists as a form of capital, proving that the worker is also a capitalist “because he always has a ‘commodity’ (himself) for sale.” If this were the case, Marx rejoins, “Even a slave would be a capitalist, even though he is sold once and for all as a commodity by a third person.” He clarifies that the worker’s labor power is her capacity rather than capital : “It is the only commodity that he can constantly sell, and he has to sell it in order to live, but it operates as capital . . . only in the hands of the buyer, the capitalist.” It is only the capitalist who profits from the laborer’s skills.

Proudhon, in other words, mistook a form of appearance—money as the objectification of the abstract—for the essence of capitalism.” See Postone, “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism,” 109, footnote 14. 60 .

Termination was implemented by the Hoover administration in 1954 and represented a series of policies designed to dismantle the reservation system, disband tribal nations, and distribute their assets among tribal members—with or without the consent of tribal nations. Although no termination policies took effect in Canada, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s failed 1969 white paper was designed to divest all such nations of special status. Franks writes that “the white paper proposed a drastic shift to liberal individualism and a denial of group rights in some ways even more extreme than the failed termination policy in the United States.” See Franks, “Indian Policy,” 243. 73 .

Grant Farred has introduced the concept of the postcolonial “unsettler” in the Sudan, where the Arab paramilitary majority functions as a more brutal colonialist extension of the settler, “exceed[ing] the worst excesses of colonial violence” in “evacuat[ing] the land entirely of the native.” See Farred, “The Unsettler,” 807, 794. 100 .

While earlier fur-trading posts in North America allowed for settlers and Indigenous people to coexist, the shift from mercantile (trade-centered) to industrial (land-centered) forms of capitalism marks the shift to settler colonialism. 112 .

Accessed July 28, 2015. 117 . For instance, despite the absence of a similar Dawes Act allotment policy in Canada, the government took steps to alienate Indigenous peoples from their lands. However, because reserves in Canada were relatively smaller than those in the US West, only 10 percent of those lands were alienated—compared to the loss of two-thirds in the United States. See Franks, “Indian Policy,” 235. Historically, assimilation policies were much more aggressive in Canada, and strategies to divest Indigenous peoples of “Indian status” have been much more extensive. 118 .

Lawrence, “Gender, Race, and the Regulation of Native Identity in Canada and the US.” “Status” and “non-Status” denote the federal status of an Indigenous person in Canada. In order to have status, one must be recognized as a “Registered Indian” as defined by the Indian Act. 128 .

Roediger notes that slaves themselves were among the most profitable US-produced commodities, while cotton accounted for 57 percent of the total value of US exports before the Civil War. It is also a mistake to suggest that Northern industrial capitalists were responsible for pressuring Southern plantation owners to abolish slavery, given that “multiple economic, cultural, and political ties bound Northern capital to Southern slavery.” The point is that industrial capitalism was not responsible for ending slavery; rather, it shifted the terms of race, labor, and inequality. Indeed, the expansion of capitalism in the United States was rooted in slavery. 130 . Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 894. 131 . Biermann and Kössler, “The Settler Mode of Production,” 112. 132 . Jung, Coolies and Cane . 133 . Not all slave societies reproduced their slave populations in corresponding ways. While the United States reproduced its enslaved population through reproduction, Brazil reproduced it by replenishing the supply of slaves through continual shipments of African slaves. Thus unlike in the United States, the hereditary fact of slavery and its fusion with blackness, which became wholly racialized after emancipation, did not produce a similar racial conception of blackness. Rather, they produced those of caste and color. See Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 904. 134 . Canadian antimiscegenation policy was even less consistent than in the United States, but various policies such as “Girls and Women’s Protection Act” prevented Chinese men from being employed in establishments that also employed white women or girls. 135 .

In declining my request to reproduce Van Horne’s sketch, which also appears in Margot Francis’s Creative Subversions , the CPR ’s manager of corporate communications indicated that the history of Chinese railroad labor would compromise Van Horne’s reputation: “My concern is not your work, but is based on the history of the construction period of the CPR . The image is speaks [sic ] to a larger issue of sensitivities around how the CPR was built, the conditions and the realities of the 1880s. The other consideration is that is a drawing done by the President of the CPR ; not some anonymous business figure. My decision on this is final.” 3 . Francis, Creative Subversions , 77. 4 .

See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , and Victor Bascara, “Cultural Politics of Redress.” Of all the nations that participated in the removal of ethnic Japanese, only those in the United States and Canada received an apology and compensation for financial losses incurred during wartime confinement. In August 1988, President Reagan signed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, H.R. 442, which enabled each Japanese American affected by Executive Order 9066 to receive a tax-free payment of $20,000. Because Latin American internees in Texas were not covered by Executive Order 9066, they were not eligible for a redress payment. In September 1988, six weeks after redress was granted in the United States, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed the redress settlement for Japanese Canadians, which provided $21,000 to the Issei and Nisei who were incarcerated during the war. Although redress was a hard-won and overdue victory for Japanese North American activists, it had the effect of recasting the legacy of Japanese internment as a triumph of democracy over an aberrant, isolated event that occurred in the distant past. But even before redress was won, perhaps the largest irony of Japanese internment in North America was that Japanese civilians were confined as the yellow peril, only to emerge in its aftermath as the model minority. 41 .

Passages from the novel were read aloud in the House of Commons during the government’s announcement of the Japanese Canadian Redress settlement in 1988, adding to its national significance in Canada. While early criticism was largely concerned with formalist issues or universal themes of overcoming suffering, later criticism engaged in debates over its mainstream reception and probed the implications of the novel’s treatment of history, racism, and racial and gendered subjectivity. Among this scholarship, Donald Goellnicht examined the novel’s combining of documentary history, archival sources, and fiction as a postmodern deconstruction of absolute truths. Others, such as Roy Miki and Scott Toguri McFarlane, challenged critical approaches that celebrated the novel’s “resolutionary” (rather than revolutionary) ending, which functioned to appease white guilt for historical injuries. Given Naomi’s complex psychology, scholars such as Smaro Kamboureli and Tomo Hattori examined the novel through the lens of psychoanalysis, while King-Kok Cheung focused on how the novel balances Western and Asian conceptions of speech and silence. 73 . Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , 134. 74 . During the war, nearly four thousand West Coast Japanese left to work on sugar beet farms in Alberta, Manitoba, and southwestern Ontario. The Issei and Nisei would remain in the three provinces as an exploited source of labor, subject to long hours of hard labor and substandard living conditions. The transparency of the government’s economic rather than security priorities came into full relief when the British Columbia Security Commission was dissolved in 1943 and transferred to the control of the Department of Labour. The Labour Department was then given full authority over the movement and resettlement of Japanese Canadians. Under its leadership, coercive measures were instituted to conscript able-bodied Nisei men to labor camps in rural parts of Ontario that were in need of workers. See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . 75 . See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . Compared to the Japanese American experience, Japanese Canadians suffered larger financial losses and were barred from the West Coast for longer. Although 75 percent of Japanese Americans lost all their property as a result of their wartime expulsion and confinement, they did not suffer the total liquidation of their property to pay for their incarceration as their Japanese Canadian counterparts did. By 1946, half of the former population of Japanese Americans returned to the coast, while Japanese Canadians remained barred until 1949, by which time few would return. Canada, already at war with Germany, was brought into the Pacific theater with Japan’s simultaneous attacks on Pearl Harbor and Hong Kong. The government’s immediate actions involved detaining suspected Japanese terrorists, closing Japanese language schools and presses, and impounding twelve hundred fishing boats. On February 24, 1942, on the heels of the US initiative, Prime Minister Mackenzie King’s government issued Order in Council P.C. 1486, mandating that the Japanese race be expelled from a one-hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, where more than 95 percent of the Japanese Canadian population resided. After being held in an assembly center in Vancouver—which, similar to those in the United States, consisted of hastily converted horse stables—twenty-two thousand Japanese civilians, of whom 75 percent were citizens, were confined in deserted mining camps in the British Columbia interior and to labor camps and “self-support” sites in eastern British Columbia. The government subsequently formed the Japanese Fishing Vessel Disposal Committee charged with supervising the forced sale of Japanese boats. In the fall of 1942 the government passed the Veterans Land Act, which gave the Director of Soldier Settlement the right to sell 939 deliberately undervalued Japanese farms without consulting the owners. On January 23, 1943, the Custodian of Alien Property was authorized to liquidate all remaining Japanese property at rock-bottom prices. All proceeds from liquidation sales as well as the wages of Japanese men forced to work on road projects were used to subsidize the internment—only after their own board expenses and, for a time, unemployment insurance were deducted. After the war, internees were forced to choose either repatriation to Japan or resettlement outside of the West, which led to the deportation of nearly four thousand inmates. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the one-hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. In large part, Japanese American families remained intact during their confinement, while able-bodied Japanese Canadian men were taken to road camps and separated from their families. Unlike the US government, which paid for the transportation, food, and the lodging of Japanese Americans, the Canadian government supplied only fuel, bunk beds, mail, and medical services. No food was provided, nor were cultivators paid for their labor. It is estimated that the Canadian government spent a third of the US government’s total expenditures. The War Relocation Authority’s budget was $162 million for housing and the US Army’s $75 million for rounding up and transporting Japanese Americans. 76 . Kogawa, Obasan , 206. 77 . Ibid., 232. 78 .

Japanese American families were directed to irrigate the land in order to develop the local economy. Promoting this plan was John Collier, famed for ending the pattern of dispossession enabled by the 1887 Dawes Act and clearing a pathway for the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. He wanted to seize the opportunity to exploit detained Japanese labor to subjugate the land by digging irrigation ditches, building canals, leveling land, and preparing the land for water. As the reservation had previously been mired in a water rights battle, Collier saw Japanese internment at Poston as a golden opportunity to turn the reservations’ undeveloped land into a source of economic sustenance. Linked to this project was a “colonization” program, in which neighboring Native nations living on other reservations that were deprived of water would move to Poston.

      "content": "INTRODUCTION THE NEW JEWS Settler Colonialism and the Personification of Capitalism No Jew can smell out with keener instinct an opportunity where money can be made to grow than can a Chinaman. —Atlantic Monthly , 1900 Racial Capital In August 2012, Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney issued a public apology for purging an image of a female Asian scientist from the newly designed one-hundred-dollar polymer banknote. She was replaced by a “Caucasian-looking woman” 1 who is seen peering through a microscope (figure I.1 ). In the foreground appears a bottle of insulin that symbolizes nationalist ingenuity through medical innovation. Based on internal reports obtained by the Canadian Press, the decision to remove the Asian scientist came in response to focus groups who previewed the design in Montreal and Charlottetown and felt that her Asian appearance “did not represent Canada” 2 and was “exclusionary . . . since the banknote didn’t represent other ethnicities.” 3 Although the bank declined requests to release the initial design to the public, a bank spokesperson indicated that the image of a “Caucasian-looking woman” was substituted to “restore neutral ethnicity.” 4 News of the bank’s decision met sharp criticism from Asian advocacy groups, particularly the Chinese Canadian National Council, who criticized the bank and urged it to stop “‘erasing’ visible minorities from Canada’s money.” 5 FIGURE I.1 One-hundred-dollar Canadian bill, Bank of Canada. This controversy highlights this book’s central focus on the interplay of Asian racialization, capitalism, and settler colonialism that, as I will develop below, reveals an economic modality that links constructions of the Asian and the Jew. At first glance, the controversy sheds light on the ever-simmering tension between race and national culture in Canada. In particular, the bank’s equation of a “Caucasian-looking woman” with race “neutrality” exposes the normativity of whiteness in an officially multicultural nation. That an erased woman of color’s body serves as the battleground for adjudicating cultural legitimacy participates in a long-standing objectification of nonwhite female bodies as litmus tests of racial, gender, sexual, and here national normativity and deviance. 6 The Chinese Canadian National Council’s admonishment attempts to bare these contradictions but ultimately endorses the superimposing of multicultural iconography onto capital. Even US-based blogger Phil “Angry Asian Man” Yu weighed in on the politics of representation, calling the controversy “racebending on a banknote.” 7 In response to focus group members who objected to the Asian scientist for being too stereotypical, Yu remarks, “Sure there is a stereotype of Asians excelling in math or science. But let’s be real. The reason why people didn’t want an Asian-looking woman on the $100 bill is because an Asian-looking woman couldn’t possibly represent a face of Canada. Thus, the rush to redesign her with more Caucasian features.” 8 For the Chinese Canadian National Council, “Angry Asian Man,” and countless other bloggers and YouTube vloggers, the controversy’s significance turns on the variable race of the scientist against the assumed stability of the money form of capital as a representation of nation. To restore the “Asian-looking” characteristics to the scientist would, by extension, restore equilibrium between race and nation. But what seems to be missing from this discussion is the peculiar intersection of race and money—of race as a form of money, or vice versa. How do we understand the variability of money as capitalist (rather than solely nationalist) fetish and its own racialized personas? For the purposes of this book, the controversy dramatizes ways that Asian North Americans are uncomfortably associated with capital. More benign expressions of this association arise out of recognition of the upward economic mobility of Asians in North America over the twentieth century, which, at least temporarily, secured Asian Canadian representation on the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill and have earned Asian Americans the title of the “new Jews.” 9 Both expressions refer to the increasing affluence and assimilation of a historically excluded minority. In the case of the Asian-Jewish analogy, Matthew Frye Jacobson’s discussion of the evolution of Jewish American immigrant identity from a non-Anglo-Saxon to a Caucasian social position in the nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries emphasizes the progressive and linear orientation of the analogy. 10 This progressive emphasis is amplified in the 2012 Pew Research Center study “The Rise of Asian America,” which reported that Asians were the highest-income (earning 33 percent more than median-income households), best-educated, and fastest-growing racial group in the United States. 11 Despite numerous scholarly objections to the Pew Research Center’s failure to identify the extended configuration of most Asian households, the high-cost urban residential concentration of those families, and the pronounced income disparities between Asian ethnicities, 12 these facts have had little countervailing influence on the mainstream perception that Asians are more hurt than helped by affirmative action policies. Moreover, from Thomas Friedman’s recommendation that US children adopt the competitive traits of their Chinese and Indian counterparts 13 to Québec politician François Legault’s declaration that “kids in Québec should work harder, like Asians,” 14 the attributes of Asians in Asia and North America are to be ignored at one’s economic peril. Coupled with the benign recognition of Asian North American educational and economic achievement are more unsettling aspects of the Asian-Jewish analogy. For instance, Los Angeles Times reporter Gregory Rodriguez emphasizes how “the Jewish comparison has a dark side.” 15 According to Rodriguez, the victorious narrative of the civil rights movement has contributed to the misguided belief that “economic status rises as prejudice decreases, and vice versa . . . [and] that bias is always targeted downward at the weakest and the most vulnerable in society.” 16 In other words, the Asian-Jewish analogy should not be read as an indication of what Susan Koshy refers to as a “morphing of race into ethnicity,” 17 a theory stating that Asians in North America have evolved from discriminated racial minority to assimilated ethnic group over the twentieth century. Rather, according to Rodriguez, the Asian-Jewish analogy compels recognition of the economic contexts of modern anti-Semitism, which he characterizes as “distrust or disdain of Jews [which] can sometimes be motivated by envy or resentment of an identifiably separate group that’s significantly wealthier than the population at large.” 18 The economic conflation of Asians and Jews has a long history, explains Jonathan Freedman, who notes that “like Jews, Chinese merchants were traditionally active throughout East and South Asia and faced—again like Jews—resentment, discrimination, and even the occasional pogrom as a result.” 19 Intersecting expressions of industriousness, greed, and evil have been infused in popular culture representations of both groups in Europe and North America, from novelist George Du Maurier’s 1895 creation of the Jewish-descended Svengali to novelist Sax Rohmer’s 1921 invention of Fu Manchu. 20 Both characters are perverse, evil geniuses who aspire to world domination. Turning back to the controversy over the one-hundred-dollar bill, the bank’s initial effort to present an image that promotes Canadian medical innovation through the figure of the Asian Canadian scientist aligns Asian subjects with capital in more abstract, nonhuman ways. In particular, the characteristics of the model minority stereotype—educated, disciplined, obedient—embodied by the Asian Canadian scientist increasingly emphasize economic over human attributes. As Helen Jun explains, the model minority represents the ideal neoliberal subject who manifests the qualities she refers to as “human capital,” a term coined by economist Gary Becker in the 1960s to emphasize the role that education plays in adding value to labor. 21 As human capital, the individual is regarded as an “enterprise” driven by market values who embodies an “infinite capacity for ‘self-development.’” 22 Jun draws the connection between neoliberal capital and the racialization of Asian Americans in ways that can be extended to the Canadian context: We can see that the neoliberal theory of human capital and its notion of individual enterprise and self-regulation are not merely evident in Asian American model minority discourse but are also key tenets by which Asian American racial difference came to be defined in the post-1965 period. The centrality of educational achievement and the importance of family in contemporary discourses of Asian American racial difference are no mere coincidence, as neoliberal theories of human capital championed education and parenting as the most critical investments promising the highest rates of return. 23 What this passage highlights is how key aspects of model minority discourse are reflected in Asian American racialization as a form of market-driven instrumentality. Further bridging market instrumentality and racial form, the Bank of Canada’s “Asian-looking” banknote takes Jun’s notion of Asian American human capital to another level by symbolically removing the “human.” Projected onto the one-hundred-dollar bill, the Asian Canadian scientist is not merely a form of human capital but a representation of capital itself. Moreover, the eventual jettisoning of her image suggests that she signified an offensive form of capital that had to be “neutralized” by whiteness. As the personification of bad capital, the rejected “Asian-looking” one-hundred-dollar bill evokes prior economic modalities that have shaped Asian racialization. For instance, Colleen Lye’s discussion of pre-1942 expressions of anti-Japanese sentiment in California agriculture demonstrates how economic resentment toward Japanese farmers is represented through the sphere of monopoly capitalism. In the naturalist fiction she examines, Lye notes how the “homogenizing evils of monopoly are entirely displaced onto sinister Japanese characters.” 24 It is the “inorganic quality of the Asiatic body” 25 that manifests the “intangibly abstract” threat of finance capital. 26 Reflecting on the role of economic tropes embedded in racist representations of Japanese American success in agriculture in the early twentieth century, a success mirrored by Japanese Canadians in the British Columbia fishing industry, Lye points to what she calls the “economism of Asiatic racial form—a form in which economic interests are not masked but are the primary medium of race’s historical expression.” 27 The Canadian hundred-dollar-bill controversy is a heightened expression of this economism of racial form insofar as the dehumanized economism of the Asian simultaneously represents the personification of capital. What precedes the economism of Asian racial form is the similarly destructive economism historically attributed to Jews, highlighting more disturbing implications of the “New Jews” appellation. In his essay “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism,” Moishe Postone focuses on the secular elements of anti-Semitism that flourished under National Socialism in Germany, illustrating a historical process by which Jews became associated with the abstract evils of capitalism. Because Jews had long been segregated in finance and interest-generating sectors of European society, traditional anti-Semitism identified them as owners of money. Perhaps the most notorious literary example of traditional anti-Semitism is Shakespeare’s Shylock, the sinister usurer in The Merchant of Venice , whose penalty for late payment is nothing short of a pound of flesh. However, by the nineteenth century, modern anti-Semitism not only identified Jews as the owners of money but “held [them] responsible for economic crises and identified [them] with the range of social restructuring and dislocation resulting from rapid industrialization: explosive urbanization, the decline of traditional social classes and strata, the emergence of a large, increasingly organized industrial proletariat.” 28 In short, as Postone explains, “They [Jews] became the personification of the intangible, destructive, immensely powerful, and international domination of capital as a social form.” 29 Here the attributes of “abstractness, intangibility, universality, mobility” 30 that are associated with Jews are striking in their resonance with characteristic forms of Asian racialization in North America. The racial signifiers of inscrutability, perpetual foreignness, transnational mobility, and flexibility similarly register the abstract features of Asian racialization that this book aligns with the evolution of settler colonial capitalism in North America. The controversy over the Bank of Canada’s initial design of the one-hundred-dollar bill and the “new Jews” analogy may suggest that Asian racialization has entered a new historical phase. Indeed, the model minority stereotype seems far afield from the historical repertoire of yellow perilism denoting disease, vice, and destruction. But rather than expressions associated with two distinct phases, “yellow peril” and the “model minority” stereotype function as complementary aspects of the same form of racialization, in which economic efficiency is the basis for exclusion or assimilation. This book therefore engages in the task of demonstrating how the contemporary economism of Asian racial form does not represent a break from the past but rather is part of a continuum of settler colonial capitalism and its racial formations. Building on scholarship that examines the economic modalities of “Asiatic racial form” depicted in the interplay of art and policy by white producers, 31 I focus on contemporary Asian American and Asian Canadian literature and visual culture as a transnational genealogy of settler colonialism’s capitalist logics. What Asian North American cultural producers reveal in their rearticulation of settler colonial mythologies is how capitalism operates as a system of representation that is objective but immaterial, immanent but subject to resignification. My methodology is influenced by Marx’s dialectical method, which emphasizes dynamic relations rather than causation to illuminate the dualities and contradictions that emerge from capitalism. I am similarly guided by Fredric Jameson’s argument that the most important task of cultural interpretation is to reveal a work’s “political unconscious.” 32 In this spirit, I look to ways that Asian North American cultural production similarly magnifies settler colonial mythologies to reveal a system of representation that reproduces the logic of capitalism. The expansive, transnational scope of the archive also offers a framework for highlighting patterns and convergences across settler colonial borders. This book’s primary thesis is that Asian North American literature and visual culture present a genealogy of settler colonialism that magnifies a key logic of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic anticapitalism is the misperception of the appearance of capitalist relations for their essence, a misperception that stems from Marx’s notion of the fetish. As Neil Levi points out, what romantic anticapitalism “solves is a problem of representation . . . possess[ing] an intrinsically aesthetic dimension.” 33 As an aesthetic dimension, therefore, Asians give human shape to the abstract circuits of capitalism that have “no concrete manifestation, that are quite literally unrepresentable .” 34 In the manner that Jews came to personify processes internal to finance capital under National Socialism, I argue that the Asian subject in North America personifies abstract processes of value formation anchored by labor. From the economic efficiency associated with Asian racialization, denigrated as “cheap” labor in the nineteenth century and valued as “efficient” in the twenty-first, Asian North American cultural production magnifies the manner through which Asians are aligned with “abstract labor,” a concept that anchors Marx’s labor theory of value. It is from the vantage of abstract labor, as Dipesh Chakrabarty also notes, that capitalism is both reconstituted and potentially subverted. Let me elaborate on this connection between race and abstract labor, which I would argue is a key logic of what Cedric Robinson calls “racial capitalism.” 35 In particular, by giving material and symbolic weight to the category of abstract labor, my project diverges from the important work of scholars such as Lisa Lowe, David Roediger, and others who have argued that capitalism has profited from labor not by rendering it abstract but by producing racialized difference. For instance, in Lowe’s critique of the labor theory of value, she hones in on Marx’s homogenizing definition of “abstract labor ‘as the use value which confronts money posited as capital, labour is not this or another labour, but labour pure and simple , abstract labour; absolutely indifferent to its particular specificity.’” 36 Her point is to demonstrate that capital has profited from the specifically gendered and racialized character of labor, qualities that are far from indistinguishable or abstract. She presents the notion of abstract labor as the erroneous basis of an equally flawed conception of abstract citizenship in the political sphere: Abstract labor, subject to capitalist rationalization and the logic of equivalence through wages, is the adjunct of the formal political equality granted through rights and representation by the state. Yet in the history of the United States, capital has maximized its profits not through rendering labor “abstract” but precisely through the social productions of “difference,” of restrictive particularity and illegitimacy marked by race, nation, geographical origins, and gender. The law of value has operated, instead, by creating, preserving, and reproducing the specifically racialized and gendered character of labor power. 37 In short, she writes, “Asian immigrants and Asian Americans have been neither ‘abstract labor’ nor ‘abstract citizens.’” 38 David Roediger extends this line of argument, asserting that “far from flattening difference by buying undifferentiated units of labor power, US management studiously bought into inequality, preserving and continually recreating race.” 39 While my project is in harmony with the claim that capitalism produces racialized difference, I propose that these differentiating effects are not in contradiction with Marx’s formulation of abstract labor. What is missing from Lowe’s and Roediger’s critiques of abstract labor is a recognition of its dialectical relation to concrete labor. Concrete labor represents the racial, gendered, and qualitatively distinct form of actual labor that is rendered abstract as a value expression. Where I locate the principal violence of capitalism is in the very way it abstracts (or renders homogeneous as commensurable units of labor) highly differentiated gendered and racialized labor in order to create value . It is therefore the law of value that obscures the racial and gendered character of labor power. For value itself is what necessitates what we could characterize as the metaphoric process of turning particular labor into quantifiable units of abstract labor. So in response to the suggestion that racialized labor is irreducible to the conception of abstract labor because of its gendered and racial particularity, no value would be produced if this were the case. Rather, all commodity-determined labor plays a socially mediating role that is structured by time. Capital maximizes profit by controlling time: socially necessary labor time. Nothing prevents the exploitation of racial and gendered labor from being a “social necessity” that determines average labor time. Indeed, one core logic of the settler colonial mode of production I explore in this book centers on the systematic exploitation of a racialized, gendered, and sexualized alien labor force. The structuring role of time is precisely the reason that capitalism is an abstract form of domination, what Petrus Liu characterizes as “impersonal domination.” 40 This doesn’t mean that we don’t daily bear witness to brutal working conditions or the near enslavement of racialized and gendered labor; rather, the very violence of labor abstraction, what Richard Godden calls “the founding moment of abstraction,” 41 is what subsumes the horrors of highly differentiated labor into an abstracted quantity that is commensurable with all other things. It is the duplicity of value as a social relation that Marx denounces, such that “the various proportions in which different kinds of labour are reduced to simple labour as their unit of measurement are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers.” 42 To put it another way, we don’t control the products of our labor; we are controlled by the products of our labor. Therefore, while I agree that capitalism produces racialized difference, this book defines social differentiation as a form of destructive abstraction anchored by a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic Anticapitalism The historical processes that encode a romanticized distinction between concrete and abstract social relations grow out of Marx’s identification of an internalized duality within the commodity. Romantic anticapitalism’s confusion over the appearance and essence of the commodity is what Marx refers to as its “fetishism.” While a focus on the fetishism of the commodity appears initially removed from the realm of race and social relations, the commodity is foundational to Marx’s labor theory of value, which structures social—and hence race, gender, and sexual—relations within a capitalist mode of production. The chief effect of this fetishism is the appearance of capitalist social relations as antinomical: that an antinomy or opposition exists between concrete and abstract realms of society. Under a romantic anticapitalist view, what is real, sensory, or “thingly” is the tree in your backyard, the dusty work boots by the door, the reliable pickup truck in the driveway. These make up the concrete realm. What is unnatural, nonthingly, or intangible is capital accumulation, surplus-value, and money. These form the abstract realm. Therefore, as Levi clarifies, “romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of the antinomy.” 43 The antinomical view that characterizes romantic anticapitalism glorifies the concrete dimension while casting as evil the abstract domination of capitalism. In particular, the specific power attributed to Jews under National Socialism anthropomorphizes the internal workings of the commodity itself. What is remarkable is how the traits of mobility, abstractness, immateriality, and universality that modern anti-Semitism identifies with Jews are the very same characteristics that Marx uses to describe the commodity’s value dimension. However, as Postone clarifies, “this [value] dimension—like the supposed power of the Jews—does not appear as such, rather always in the form of a material carrier, such as the commodity. The carrier thus has a ‘double character’—value and use-value.” 44 In other words, what romantic anticapitalism misunderstands is that value, while seemingly abstract, is nonetheless objectified within the concrete, sensory form of the commodity during the exchange process. Pulling away the veil of the fetish will reveal that commodities are above all the representations (carriers) of social processes that are objectified in things, and as Marx puts it, “its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing.” 45 The main secret hidden within the commodity is that it comprises a duality of abstract and concrete dimensions. In a section of volume 1 of Capital titled “The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities,” Marx explains that the commodity internalizes two aspects: (a) use-value (a thing of use) and (b) exchange value (the exchangeability of that thing). Here we can observe a distinction between these two characteristics of the commodity; a use-value is concrete in a material sense—a table, for instance—but exchange value is abstract and immaterial in the sense that we can’t see or touch it. Dissecting the labor that produces the commodity, Marx continues by saying that “labour, too, has a dual character insofar as [when] it finds its expression in value, it no longer possesses the same characteristics as when it is the creator of use-values.” 46 Unpacking this distinction, concrete labor refers to a specific activity—whether hammering or cooking—that produces a use-value. On the other, it is “abstract labor” that objectifies a commodity’s value. Before we move on, we can pause to observe a fundamental point about value, which is that it is immaterial but objective : 47 “We may twist and turn a single commodity as we wish; it remains impossible to grasp it as a thing possessing value. . . . Commodities possess an objective character as values only in so far as they are all expressions of an identical social substance, human labor.” 48 Like gravity, value is invisible but real. What gives objectivity to the value of commodities, Marx asserts, is that they are products of human labor. A commodity’s value, therefore, is what Marx defines as “socially necessary labor time.” But what determines “social necessity”? This, it turns out, is part of the distinction between abstract and concrete labor. The main difference between concrete and abstract labor is temporal. The actual time it takes to produce a commodity in the case of concrete labor has no immediate bearing on a particular commodity’s value. If it did, a commodity would become more valuable the slower a worker labored to produce it, or as Marx puts it, a given product “would be more valuable the more unskillful and lazy the worker who produced it, because he would need more time to complete the article.” 49 Concrete labor will only tell us how well made a commodity is; it is the qualitative dimension of use-value. 50 On the other hand, abstract labor is a quantitative expression of value—it is an unfixed social average of human labor time. As Marx explains, “In the former case [of concrete labor] it was a matter of the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ of labour, in the latter [abstract labor] of the ‘how much,’ of the temporal duration of labor.” 51 Time is the ultimate measure of abstract labor and the magnitude of a commodity’s value. The quantity of time in abstract labor is not individual or provisional but socially necessary . Marx writes, “Socially necessary labour-time is the labour-time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society.” 52 From this view of the dual character of labor embodied in the commodity, we see how concrete labor is more directly aligned with the qualitative production of use-value, while abstract labor is more directly aligned with the quantitative dimension of value. While use-value and value are inseparable, internal features of each and every commodity, they nevertheless appear on the surface as discrete. Money generalizes the exchange of commodities and reinforces the fetishistic appearance that use-value and value are oppositional rather than part of the internal duality of the commodity. Marx historicizes money’s emergence through his discussion of commodity value. He explains that the only way we can determine the value of a commodity is when it is in motion: through its exchange with a different commodity. In a simple barter situation, I might exchange two forks for your bowl. The magnitude of value—the amount of socially necessary labor time—embedded in my forks and your bowl becomes visible (or objective) only in the exchange process. What we find is that your one bowl holds the equivalent value of my two forks; my two forks express the relative value of your one bowl. Over time certain commodities come to stand as the universal equivalent because they offer a stable measure of equivalent value. Historically, gold and other metals have played this role. So, rather than exchanging my two forks for your one bowl, I would give you two forks in exchange for an equivalent value in gold. While gold is useful for expressing equivalent value, carrying it around and circulating it can be cumbersome, which brings us to paper money. Paper money was once the representation of real gold held in a bank, but now it is a representation of floating value contained in a bundled commodity index. As a universal equivalent, the money commodity can be exchanged with any other commodity and express any another commodity’s value. Here’s the takeaway: after money generalizes the exchange of commodities, money seems solely an expression of value rather than of use-value (as a useful piece of colored paper with numbers on it, for example). Marx makes a further observation of the way the commodity’s internal duality is expressed externally: The internal opposition between use-value and value, hidden within the commodity, is therefore represented on the surface by an external opposition, i.e. by a relation between two commodities such that the one commodity, whose own value is supposed to be expressed, counts directly only as a use-value, whereas the other commodity, in which that value is to be expressed, counts directly only as exchange-value. Hence, the simple form of value of a commodity is the simple form of the appearance of the opposition between use-value and value which is contained within the commodity. 53 What this means is that the duality of use-value and value, which are internal characteristics of the commodity, are expressed externally as an opposition between commodities and money. The social consequences of how a binary rather than dialectical view of use-value and value is such that the use-value dimension appears empirically-grounded while the latter, value dimension appears ephemeral or abstract. Specifically, the dialectical tension between value and use-value in the commodity requires that its dual character be materially externalized in the value form, where it appears “doubled” as money (the manifest form of value) and the commodity (the manifest form of use-value). The effect of this externalization, as Postone elaborates, is that “the commodity, although it is a social form expressing both value and use-value, appears to contain only the latter, i.e., appears as purely material and ‘thingly’ ; money, on the other hand, then appears to be the sole repository of value , i.e., as the manifestation of the purely abstract, rather than as the externalized manifest form of the value dimension of the commodity itself.” 54 The point here is that even though a fork and money are both commodities that internalize use-value and value, the fork appears only as a concrete “thingly” use-value and the money as an abstract source of value. This illusory opposition is at the core of the commodity fetish, which disguises the actual basis of value, which is “socially necessary labor time.” A key aspect of the fetish, then, is the mystification of capitalist social relations that present themselves antinomically, as the opposition of the abstract and concrete . Within this antinomy, the social relations specific to capitalism appear as an opposition between the concreteness of labor, commodities, and nature, on one hand, and the abstractness of money and finance, on the other. Moreover, within this fetishistic antinomy, the very origins of value—socially necessary labor time—are completely repressed. In the nineteenth century, we can see how the social consequences of this antinomical view of capitalist social relations emerge and take on racial significance. As capitalism underwent rapid expansion, the externalization of abstract and concrete forms intrinsic to the commodity fetish became increasingly biologized and racialized in concert with prevailing socioscientific conceptions of the world. The proliferation of scientific racism with the rise of social Darwinism in the late nineteenth century is an example of how society and historical development were increasingly understood in biological terms, moving from a more mechanical or typological worldview in which events were a reflection of divine power and design to a more secularized, biologized worldview that naturalized an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Enduring features of romanticism, the aesthetic movement that emerged in the nineteenth century, exhibit such a biologized worldview in its human (and often racial and national) identification with the purity of the natural world, portrayed as the valorized antithesis to the negative influences of urbanization and industrialization. From the antimaterialism expressed in Henry David Thoreau’s excursion to Walden Pond in the nineteenth century to Christopher McCandless’s 1992 divestment of all symbols of material wealth—even setting fire to his remaining cash—for a life in the wilderness, 55 we can discern a romantic attachment to a revitalizing and pure construction of an unchanging nature, in contrast to the alienation attributed to capitalist modernity. Expressing the antinomy of concrete and abstract, nature therefore personifies concrete, perfected human relations against the social degeneration caused by the abstract circuits of capitalism. This antinomical view of capitalism finds acute biologized expression in the context of anti-Semitism. During Germany’s rapid industrialization in the nineteenth century, Jews were perceived as an all-powerful international conspiracy that orchestrated capitalism. Jews not only were identified with money but became a personification of the destructive nature and abstract domination of capital. In other words, the concrete side of this antinomy was naturalized and biologized as real, hardworking Germans. German labor and machines were glorified as concrete “counter principles to the abstract.” 56 Alternatively, the manifest abstract dimension of money and finance became biologized as the Jews. As Postone explains, “Jews were not merely identified with money, with the sphere of circulation, but with capitalism itself.” 57 Jews came to personify the “intangible, destructive, immensely powerful and international domination of capital as a social form.” 58 His insight here is to identify an anticapitalist element of National Socialism that, in misrecognizing the role of the antinomy in capitalism, strove to evacuate the world of the abstract dimensions of capitalism, which was seen as the source of all evil and oppression in the world. Jews were identified as controllers of money and thus misidentified as responsible for capitalism’s oppression, a misperception based on the erroneous notion that capitalist oppression was caused by money—despite the reality that money and commodity forms are relative expressions of value determined by socially necessary labor time. 59 Thus even though Jews were citizens, citizenship was once again deemed politically abstract compared to the more concrete notion of the nation defined by “common language, history, tradition, and religions.” 60 As Postone observes, “The only group in Europe which fulfilled the determination of citizenship as a purely political abstraction, were Jews following political emancipation in the nineteenth century. They were German or French citizens, but they were not really Germans or Frenchmen.” 61 Instead, they were of the nation only “abstractly, not concretely,” which was ultimately a fatal relation to the scourge of “capitalism” and the bourgeois state. Thus anti-Semitism solves a problem of representation by incorporating an aesthetic dimension that gives human form to the abstract circuits of capitalism. 62 As the controversy over the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill suggests, Asians too are associated with an abstract dimension of capitalism, but in a different sense. In the case of Jews, their conflation with the abstract domination of capitalism derived from their segregation in financial sectors of the economy. Alternatively, Asians have personified the abstract dimensions of capitalism through labor time . In the nineteenth-century context of Chinese railroad building in North America, the subject of chapter 1 , the connection between the Chinese and the abstract domination of capitalism evolved through their identification with a mode of efficiency that was aligned with a perverse temporality of domestic and social reproduction. In other words, the Chinese personified the quantitative sphere of abstract labor, which threatened the concrete, qualitative sphere of white labor’s social reproduction. It is from this view of labor’s socially mediating role that each chapter explores a different aspect of dominant settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism that triangulates Indigenous, alien, and settler positions. Settler colonialism reinforces this triangulation through a fundamental misperception of capitalism as an opposition between a concrete natural world and a destructively abstract, value-driven one that is personified as Asian. In the sections that follow I clarify the racial interplay of settler colonial exclusion and elimination that frames my analysis of Asian North America and the personification of capitalism. Settler Colonialism, or Postcolonial Colonialism In this book I make the claim that the racialization of capitalism emerges from the particular contours of settler colonialism in North America whose conditions are distinct from the geopolitical context out of which modern anti-Semitism arose in Europe. At its core, settler colonialism reflects the common social, cultural, and political racial destiny of a transnational configuration that Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds refer to simply as “white men’s countries.” 63 Beginning in the nineteenth century, the spread of whiteness in nations bordering the Pacific was “a transnational form of racial identification [that was] at once global in its power and personal in its meaning, the basis of geo-political alliance and a subjective sense of self.” 64 It was against the backdrop of Indigenous dispossession and the “problem” of Asian migration that settler colonial expansion could be justified through ideologies of liberal democracy. As Adam McKeown notes of the benevolence with which border controls were implemented, “The controls were created by white settler nations around the Pacific that saw themselves as the forefront of the liberal freedoms of the nineteenth century. . . . Modern border controls are not a remnant of an ‘illiberal’ political tradition, but a product of self-conscious pioneers of political freedoms and self-rule.” 65 Thus the patterns of Indigenous decimation and dispossession, racialized labor recruitment and exploitation, immigrant restriction, and internment are evolving elements that tie Canada and the United States to a racial destiny shared by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Indeed, as Lothrop Stoddard, a xenophobic proponent of transnational solidarity among white settler colonies, put it in the 1920s: “Nothing is more striking than the instinctive and instantaneous solidarity which binds together Australians and Afrikanders, Californians and Canadians, into a ‘sacred union’ at the mere whisper of Asiatic migration.” 66 The corresponding features of Asian racialization in settler colonies capture the moving spirit of settler colonialism: a formation that is transnational but distinctively national, similar but definitely not the same, repetitive but without a predictable rhythm, structural but highly susceptible to change, everywhere but hard to isolate. This is what we might call the music of settler colonialism. It is from the past, but never stops playing. Until recently, white settler colonialism has received far less attention than its “postcolonial” counterpart among the multiplicity of colonial configurations, past and present. 67 On one hand, postcolonialism is the term that has often been applied to franchise colonies—British India or the Dutch East Indies, for instance—regions where economic exploitation occurred without large-scale white settlement. While the postcolonial condition remains a nuanced subject of theoretical debate in terms of its history and enduring social, economic, and cultural impact, the formal end of British and Dutch imperial rule and colonial administration in the late 1940s initiated a complex process of decolonization that was encoded into the “post-” of postcolonialism. Settler colonialism, on the other hand, is effectively immune to the process of decolonization. As Ian Tyrell explains, “Settler societies represented a particularly complex and resilient form of European colonial expansion often not recognized as imperial conquest by its own agents precisely because they claimed to do more than extract wealth and then return to the metropolitan space.” 68 They are “breakaway” colonies insofar as they transfer the power of the metropolitan center to the periphery, subverting a normative logic of colonialism. 69 In the establishing of settler colonies, the primary objective was land acquisition, as Patrick Wolfe points out, rather than the surplus value gained by mixing Native labor with it. 70 Because white settlement was an intentional aspect of colonization in British North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, neither the revolutionary nor the nonrevolutionary processes of detaching from British imperial rule—becoming “postcolonial,” as it were—significantly altered or ended the colonial relationship between settlers and the Indigenous population. In many ways, as Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler reflect on the irony of revolutionary settler independence movements like the United States’, “settler counter-imperialism cannot, in any sense, be considered of an emancipatory nature, but rather as a defense for atavistic forms of exploitation which by this token take on a politically anachronistic stature as well.” 71 Therefore, in settler colonies, the diminishing role of an imperial metropole facilitated successive stages of Indigenous conquest that involved invasion, removal, relocation, reservation, assimilation, termination, 72 co-optation, and self-determination. This renders a paradoxical situation where, as Robert Young describes it, “the postcolonial operates simultaneously as the colonial.” 73 In other words, what Taiaiake Alfred calls a “paradigm of post-colonial colonialism” 74 is thus a defining feature of contemporary settler colonialism in North America. Triangulating Settler Colonialism While Asians have not held any prominence in popular media projections of settler national culture, which often erases or figuratively disguises Asians as infiltrating replicants or alien invaders, 75 the opposite has been true for Indigenous identities. As Scott Lauria Morgensen explains, the settler colonial imaginary is continually underwritten by Indigenous tropes that convey settler “conquest and incorporation of primitivity.” 76 Much like the way the 2011 feature film Cowboys and Aliens aligns cowboys and Indians with each other against an invading, technologically superior alien population—read Asian—settler identity is heavily invested in appropriating Indigeneity. This is a mode of white settler identification that Shari Huhndorf calls “going Native,” 77 which functions to cover over colonial invasion and reimagine a natural affiliation to the land. The erasure of the alien and the romantic identification with the Native are two sides of the settler colonial coin. By mapping out the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions, this book moves beyond a binary theory of settler colonialism, which is predominantly structured around an opposition between Indigenous peoples and settlers. While scholarship on the settler-Indigenous dialectic has been tremendously valuable, it often falls short of clarifying the role that nonwhite migration plays within such a framework or how it intersects with other aspects of white supremacy. Reflecting on what she calls the “indigenous-settler binary,” Andrea Smith similarly cautions that this “binary certainly exists, [but] our analysis of it is insufficient if not intersected with other logics of white supremacy.” 78 In particular, key questions over the status or role that racialized migrants play within white settler colonialism often remain unasked or avoided. In a binary framework of settler colonialism—where one is either a settler or an Indigenous person—are slaves, indentured laborers, or refugees “settlers,” despite the involuntary context of their migration to North America? If we observe Jared Sexton’s claim that “no amount of tortured logic could permit the analogy to be drawn between a former slave population and an immigrant population, no matter how low-flung the latter group,” 79 do descendants of slaves exceed the conceptualization of migrants more generally? These questions highlight some of the uncertainty that surrounds the nonwhite “alien” and the role of race within settler colonialism. As the cases below signal, slavery and the abject condition of blackness complicate a straightforward approach to settler colonialism organized around a central opposition between settlers and Indigenous peoples. More directly, the “settler” classification collapses important racial distinctions between various contexts of voluntary and forced migration into one homogeneous group of “occupiers.” Recent studies of settler colonialism that have given attention to Asian or other nonwhite, non-Indigenous cultures have often distinguished settler identity by the degree to which migration is intentional. Writing about Canadian settler imperialism, for example, Adam Barker notes the changing provenance of settlers: “[They are] often people of European descent, but in the contemporary sense Settler increasingly includes peoples from around the globe who intentionally come to live in occupied Indigenous territories to seek enhanced privileges.” 80 In essence, settler identity—regardless of race—is predicated on the intentionality of migration. For those who may not have intended to migrate, however, Barker is more circumspect: “Attempts to integrate discussions of hybrid identities (such as the descendants of African peoples brought to the Americas against their will, many refugees, or Settler Muslims who are increasingly targeted by the state and other racist Settlers) with Settler and Indigenous identities are complicated and beyond the scope of this inquiry.” 81 Complicating Barker’s view of voluntarism, Jodi Byrd’s theorization of settler colonialism accounts for the involuntary conditions of migration. She offers the term arrivant “to signify those people forced into the Americas through the violence of European and Anglo-American colonialism and imperialism around the globe.” 82 For Byrd, structures of coerced migration distinguish the arrivant from the settler. Alternatively, Patrick Wolfe forcefully opposes voluntaristic approaches that attempt to differentiate the settler from coerced migrant populations such as slaves. He maintains that “the opposition between Native and settler is a structural relationship rather than an effect of the will. . . . Neither I nor other settlers can will our way out of it, whether we want to or not.” 83 In particular, he draws on the Australian context in which unfree white convict labor was imported from Britain in order to pose the rhetorical question, “Does this mean that their descendants are not settlers?” 84 Given that Wolfe concedes that white convicts in Australia did not pass on the condition of their criminality to their offspring, this example fails as a comparative equivalent to a US history of African slavery. The very content of black racialization has been based on the exclusive and transferable condition of racial slavery. Moreover, in claiming that settler identity applies even to “enslaved people [who] immigrated against their will,” Wolfe implicitly preserves the voluntarism that he otherwise rejects in his construction of the slave as an “immigrant.” Such references to immigration project a set of voluntaristic assumptions onto widely divergent conditions of voluntary and forced migration that are central features of the United States’ specific configuration as a settler colony. In the contemporary context, the racialized vulnerability to deportation of undocumented, guest-worker, or other provisional migrant populations similarly exceed the conceptual boundaries that attend “the immigrant.” Our awareness of these distinctions does not absolve any of these groups from being willing or unwitting participants in a settler colonial structure that is driven to eliminate Indigenous people. However, folding them into a generalized settler position through voluntaristic assumptions constrains our ability to understand how their racialized vulnerability and disposability supports a settler colonial project. The most unequivocal work to define Asian migrants as “settlers of color” is the edited volume Asian Settler Colonialism: From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawai‘i . Referring specifically to Asian Americans in Hawai‘i, editor Candace Fujikane states clearly that “all Asians, including those who don’t have political power, are identified in this book as settlers who participate in US settler colonialism.” 85 Acknowledging the historical exploitation of Asian plantation labor in Hawai‘i, she argues that it is equally important to acknowledge the “ways that they [Asian migrants and their descendants] are beneficiaries of US settler colonialism” and how “early Asian settlers were both active agents in the making of their own histories and unwitting recruits swept into the service of empire.” 86 In this formulation it is not necessary for migrants of color to migrate “intentionally” to become settlers; rather, settler status is a mixture of both self-determination and structural contingency . As Fujikane puts it succinctly, “Colonial intent [does not] define the status of Asians as settlers but rather the historical context of US colonialism for which they unknowingly became a part.” 87 Furthermore, she also dispels the notion that Asians represent a “third space” outside the Indigenous-settler dialectic. She admits her previous subscription to this idea, but explains her change of thinking as follows: I was attempting to create a “third space” for Asians as another category of the oppressed in Hawai‘i. The attempt to ally [Asian] “locals” with “Natives,” however, created the illusion of a “shared” struggle without acknowledging that Asians have come to constitute the very political system that has taken away from Natives their rights as indigenous peoples. 88 In this view, given the political power that Asian Americans currently enjoy in Hawai‘i, they cannot be said to represent a stable third space that is exempted from the settler-Indigenous dialectic or positioned “with” Indigenous peoples and “against” settlers. While attributing a settler identity to Asians may be germane in a demographic context such as Hawai‘i, it nevertheless remains unclear whether such a settler identity is generalizable to the situation of Asian immigrant formations that exist elsewhere. Even though Fujikane stresses that political and economical subordination does not exempt Asian ethnic groups from participating as settlers in a colonial system—particularly Filipinos 89 —her emphasis on Asian demographic majority, dominant political representation, and economic power in Hawai‘i emphasizes how political and economic authority are nonetheless dominant features of settler colonial identity. 90 The importance of economic and political leverage embedded in this characterization of settler identity may explain the absence, for example, of comparable discussions of “black settler colonialism.” A case in point is the postemancipation recruitment of black “Buffalo Soldiers” in anti-Indian wars in the western United States and during the Philippine-American War. 91 The Buffalo Soldiers are a clear example of an oppressed group’s unwitting (and sometimes unwilling) participation in settler colonialism and imperial invasion, yet the continued economic and political subjugation of African Americans seems to exempt them from most theorizing on settler colonialism, as a “third space” or otherwise. Thus the settler status of racialized migrants to Indigenous lands outside Hawai‘i remains undetermined. In some ways, the conundrum of positioning Asian North Americans within settler states highlights broader inconsistencies that mediate theories of Asian racialization in North America and the role of race in a settler colonial context. Speaking to the racial ambiguity evoked by Asians in the United States, Colleen Lye encapsulates the racial condition of Asian Americans as “racial, racialized, but lacking the certainty of a racial formation.” 92 Remarking upon the surfeit of articles and monographs that focus either on Afro-Asian interracial contexts or on how Asian Americans disrupt conceptualizations of race anchored by a foundational opposition between black and white, Lye continues to observe the uncertainty of Asian racialization: Asian America’s attenuated relation to racial conceptualization can be seen in the extent to which critical focus on the Asian American is so often couched in terms of “needing to move beyond race as a matter of black and white.” The Asian American is more easily evoked as a third term to trouble binary habits of racial classification and analysis than to illustrate the genuine multiplicity of racial logics and racisms. 93 From sophisticated approaches to Asian American racialization such as Claire Jean Kim’s theory of Asian America’s triangulated relation to black and white, to Susan Koshy’s conception of a single hierarchical axis in which Asian Americans have moved progressively away from a racialization associated with blackness toward an ethnicization associated with whiteness, most theories of Asian racialization rely, according to Lye, on the “historical agency of a racism that is foundationally antiblack.” 94 However, the problem with this approach is that it constrains our ability to elaborate the specificity of Asian racialization that isn’t merely a by-product of a foundational antiblackness. As it stands, what Lye calls an “Asian American analogical dependency” fails to clarify the way contemporary expressions of political liberalism and white supremacy seem to diverge so starkly from those of the late nineteenth century and, importantly, leaves unanswered whether contemporary “Asian American mobility confirms the persistent power of white privilege or whether it represents the detachment of whiteness’s symbolic power from material power.” 95 The Canadian context only adds to this racial uncertainty, since the absence of a similarly foundational system of racial slavery has not, as “analogical” arguments might suggest, led to divergent forms of anti-Asian racism in Canada. Indeed, the racialization of Asian Americans and Asian Canadians has unfolded as a parallel evolution of yellow peril to model minority—from immigrant restriction and segregation, wartime internment of Japanese civilians, to the 1960s-era liberalization of immigration policy. This mirrored arc of Asian racialization, therefore, cannot be entirely attributable to an inherited legacy or second-order version of antiblack racism given the absence of a similar regime of plantation-based slavery in Canada. This is not to say that structural antiblackness did not play a role in conditioning Canada’s entrance into capitalist modernity; rather, the similar pattern of policies directed at Asians in Canada and the United States indicates forces that exceed those that shape the social construction of blackness. 96 To put it another way, a transnational framework contradicts an understanding of anti-Asian racism as solely derivative of a prototypical racialization of blackness. As I will argue, the vicissitudes of racialization are grounded in settler colonial logics. This book presents a theory of settler colonialism in North America that operates as a triangulation of symbolic positions that include the Native, the alien, and the settler. The distinctions between alien and settler are by no means stable or fixed but are meant to emphasize the role of territorial entitlement that distinguish them. What initially distinguishes the settler from the alien migrant, as Lorenzo Veracini offers, is that “not all migrations are settler migrations.” 97 This is both poignantly true and, for African slaves, a profound understatement. As Frank Wilderson describes transatlantic slavery, “From the very beginning, we were meant to be accumulated and die.” 98 Alternatively, on the other end of the spectrum, the alien may not only be complicit with the settler colonial regime but may eventually inherit its sense of sovereign territorial right, such as Asian settlers in Hawai‘i. 99 Acknowledging these inconsistencies, what I demonstrate in this book is that for slaves and racialized migrants, the degree of forced or voluntary migration or level of complicity with the settler state is ultimately secondary to their subordination under a setter colonial mode of production driven by the proprietorial logics of whiteness. In this light, highly differentiated populations of African slaves and Asian migrants historically represented alien rather than settler migrations. This shared status in no way implies an equivalence in the heterogeneous racial experience of African slaves and Asian migrants. Instead, it clarifies their historical relationship to North American land, which was as exclusive and excludable alien labor forces. Their unsovereign alien status was a precondition of their exploitation and intersects with the multiple economic logics that require and reproduce alien-ness in settler colonies. While African slaves represented a system of forced migration, unfree alien labor, and property—a form of biopolitical life that was “market alienable” 100 —the later recruitment of indentured and “free” Chinese labor incorporated provisionality, excludability, and deportability into the notion of alien-ness. The heterogeneously racialized alien is a unique innovation of settler colonialism. Race is thus an organizing principle of settler colonialism in North America, a principle that we neglect at the risk of relegating African slaves “to the position of the unthought” 101 and obscuring the persistence and evolution of Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation, where “conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part.” 102 The governing logic of white supremacy embedded in a settler colonial mode of production relies on and reproduces the exploitability, disposability, and symbolic extraterritoriality of a surplus alien labor force. Therefore, complicating an Indigenous-settler binary, this book’s focus on the settler colonial alien follows Byrd’s method of “disrupt[ing] the dialectics of settler/native, master/slave, colonizer/colonized.” 103 As I attempt to clarify below, what remains fundamental to this triangulated articulation of settler colonialism is how land and labor are constitutive features of heterogeneous processes of settler colonial racialization. Indigenous Land, Alien Labor The triangulation of Native, alien, and settler populations comes into view when we examine two subjects who are the most racially antithetical to one another: the African American alien and the Native North American. While some have argued that a race-based framework potentially subsumes the critical importance of Indigenous sovereignty, 104 this exploration highlights the role that land—and land sovereignty—plays in Indigenous racial formation and what Alfred refers to as the “racism that is the foundation and core of all colonial countries.” 105 As Patrick Wolfe highlights, the logics of exclusion and elimination have profoundly shaped the distinct racial destinies of colonized groups. In this formulation, the logic of exclusion operates as a barrier within national culture to protect and reinforce settlers’ social and political control. De jure and de facto practices of segregation, disenfranchisement, exclusion, exploitation, police brutality, detention, and imprisonment are some of the ways that the settler state asserts and maintains control over an internalized alien population. On the other hand, the logic of elimination is driven to eradicate an Indigenous population rather than controlling it through various exclusionary measures. Genocide and biological absorption are two contradictory—but complementary—means of extinguishing an Indigenous population: the first attempts to kill the population off, the second assimilates them out of existence. 106 It is worth pausing here to emphasize the dire consequences of assimilation for Indigenous populations, a process that may seem benign or even beneficial to other racialized groups. As Katherine Ellinghaus clarifies, “One of the outcomes of acknowledging the links between miscegenation, assimilation policies, and genocide is . . . an acknowledgment of the underlying biological, physical, bloody aspects of assimilation policies that demonstrate the terrifying resolve of settler governments to rid themselves of the Aboriginal or Indian problem one way or another.” 107 Exclusion and elimination are not discrete logics but operate on a moving spectrum of biopolitical violence. For instance, a logic of exclusion applied to Indigenous peoples, who were conferred US citizenship in 1924 but were still denied the right to vote in many states. 108 In Canada, a logic of exclusion denied the franchise to Indigenous nations until 1958, while a logic of elimination rendered this right of citizenship conditional on the abandonment of “Indian Status” and accompanying right to live on a reservation. In both Canada and the United States, logics of exclusion and elimination inform how Indigenous peoples are incarcerated at higher rates than other groups. 109 While these examples demonstrate how these logics often work in tandem, for Indigenous peoples a logic of exclusion is underscored by an overarching logic of elimination. For aliens, similarly, the eliminatory logics expressed through police-initiated murder or death-penalty sentencing of black men are tactics that simultaneously reinforce the exclusion and exclusivity of blackness. 110 In the following section I clarify how these logics operate when land and labor are at stake in the settler colony. My focus on the comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans draws more heavily on the United States than on Canada because the former has a longer national history, and that history presents a foundation that illuminates subsequent racial developments in both countries. Historically, a distinctive feature of settler colonialism was that the primary objective of settlers was to appropriate land alone rather than appropriate Indigenous labor to expropriate that land’s resources. This distinguishes settler colonialism from franchise colonialism—in British India, for example—where Indigenous labor was exploited to produce commodities and extract the land’s wealth. Wolfe explains, “Settler colonialism seeks to replace the natives on their land rather than extract surplus value by mixing their labor with a colony’s natural resources.” 111 Therefore the primary logic of settler colonialism is one of elimination, and land establishes the relationship Indigenous peoples have with the colonizer. This is not to say that Indigenous people either never constituted a labor force or have ceased to be one. Rather, while there are numerous historical examples of Indigenous labor in settler colonies, from factory work in canneries in British Columbia to Alaska, Indigenous recruitment into surplus labor (the subject of chapter 3 ) occurs “in spite of rather than as a result of the primary tendency of settler-colonial policy.” 112 This logic of elimination helps to contextualize the sequence of actions directed at Indigenous peoples whose primary objective was extermination. A snapshot of these directives in the United States include eastern removal; genocidal actions taken by the US Cavalry; the 1877 Dawes Severalty Act, which turned tribes into individual property owners and resulted in the loss of two-thirds of Indigenous land; assimilationist policies of urban relocation and boarding schools (“residential schools” in Canada); and policy on Indigenous “self-determination.” Despite the rhetorical shift in settler discourse that now celebrates Indigenous self-determination as fully incorporated citizens of the settler state through a discourse of reconciliation, this has largely involved implementing federal rather than Indigenous Nation–specific policies. As Glen Coulthard explains, “Although the semantics of the comprehensive claims policy have changed, the legal and political outcomes remain the same.” 113 Further, Federal Indian Identification Policy functions as a form of what Annette Jaimes terms “statistical elimination”: 114 the effective meaning of the state’s definition of “Indian” as a minimum of one-quarter blood quantum is that through intermarriage, Indians will eventually “be defined out of existence.” 115 In the Canadian context, Karrmen Crey refers to this form of racial engineering as the “two-generation cutoff.” 116 Thus if elimination meant physical relocation and/or death in the period preceding the implementation of the Dawes Act, elimination came to mean absorption in the period following it. While policy history in Canada differs, the spirit of elimination does not. 117 And though the treaty process remains subject to negotiation in Canada while Indigenous nations in the United States have sovereignty, the predictable and ongoing process of treaty revision and violation indicates that treaties function as strategic forms of state accommodation designed to appease rather than to concede blame or to compensate. 118 Despite formal differences, the practice of settler colonial elimination is more consistent in the two nations than not. If the primary relationship between settler colonizers and Indigenous populations is land, in the case of African slaves transported to the United States it is labor . Rather than exhibiting a governing logic of elimination, a logic of racial exclusion clarifies the form of colonial exploitation experienced by African Americans in antebellum and postemancipation contexts. Because the relationship between colonizers and slaves was primarily based on labor, the objective was not to eliminate that population but to increase it and, by extension, increase the property value of that exclusive labor force. Consequently, a logic of exclusion applies insofar as slavery was an inherited condition, which made blackness equivalent to slavery and racial admixture assignable to it. Distinguishing the logic of elimination and exclusion, Wolfe explains that whereas Indigenous women “became conduits to whiteness . . . black women came to augment white men’s property by incubating the additional slaves whom they fathered.” 119 While this logic of exclusion functioned to reproduce and grow a discrete population of slaves who became synonymous with the condition of blackness, blackness was not the only condition for enslaveability. For instance, Indigenous peoples were also enslaveable, a lesson that Spanish colonialism in Mexico teaches us. In the most successful regimes of slavery, however, among the most important features that rendered Africans most vulnerable to enslavement was their alienation , “not just the natal alienation that Orlando Patterson has made famous, since indigenous societies . . . have also had their children taken away, but the spatial alienation that slave transportation effected.” 120 The spatial alienation experienced by African slaves made them a more manageable population to control, to thwart insurrection and overthrow, and to prevent from escaping. This form of alienation therefore helps to distinguish, in the case of African Americans, the “alien” position from the Native and settler in a triangular framework. In the United States, African Americans are the original aliens. In the post–Civil War context, race came into full emergence; it was rooted in slavery but came to life during the shift to black emancipation. Not only did Reconstruction put whiteness into crisis—whiteness was also threatened by non-Anglo-Saxon immigration of Jews and southern and eastern Europeans. Shifting the terms of the logic of exclusion, race reinforced the barrier between whites and blacks that the institution of slavery formerly performed. In other words, race became amplified with the downfall of slavery because racial domination was an implicit feature of slavery. However, in the wake of emancipation and without the barrier of slavery to designate free from unfree labor, race became unambiguously natural, reinforcing an exclusively racial division between black and white populations. By extension, without the barrier that slavery performed, whiteness became the basis of racialized privilege after emancipation. What is significant is that emancipation reproduced for African Americans an anomalous condition that similarly characterized the experience of postfrontier “incorporated” Indigenous Nations. Although freed slaves did not become anomalous as labor—in the South they continued to represent a cheap and hyperexploitable labor force—they became, as Wolfe puts it, “juridically anomalous as equals.” 121 Since the settler colonial solution was to eliminate anomalous postfrontier Indigenous peoples through racial absorption, a key question arises: Why didn’t newly freed and anomalous African Americans follow the assimilative racialization of Indigenous peoples and become similarly “eliminated”? Historical attempts to colonize African Americans abroad or assimilate them into the white population point to endeavors to apply a logic of elimination to African Americans. However, given the socially engineered disproportion in the size of the black population vis-à-vis the Indigenous population, neither attempt was practical or, in the case of assimilation, imaginable. Elaborating on the difference between the population of post-emancipated slaves and Indigenous nations, Wolfe highlights the biopolitics of settler colonialism and its “calculated management of life”: 122 In this case, it represents the difference between one group of people who had survived a centuries-long genocidal catastrophe with correspondingly depleted numbers and another group who, as commodities had been preserved, their reproduction constituting a singularly primitive form of accumulation for their owners. 123 The hereditary nature of slavery, which fused slavery to blackness, was thus carried over into the postemancipation context to fuse blackness to an “unlimited power to contaminate.” Given that emancipated African Americans were neither “immigrants” who could be deported nor a population that could be eliminated through biological absorption, African Americans became an undisposable alien labor population, which accounts for the intensity through which subsequent generations of African Americans have been subject to a logic of exclusion where the only means of disposal is death. Furthermore, the force through which blackness was excluded during the Jim Crow era highlights a broader consolidation of whiteness—of Anglo-Saxons and Protestants at first, and eventually extending to other European ethnics 124 —and intensified nation-building in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In both Canada and the United States, “white nationalism” was the ideological and policy response to nonwhite immigration and black incorporation. The comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans highlights the heterogeneity of race that is anchored by a foundational distinction between land and labor. For Indigenous peoples of North America, race was always subject to dilution and disappearance. In both Canada and the United States, the biological constitution of Indigenous peoples was determined assimilable to whiteness. Describing this evolution in the logic of elimination, Wolfe explains that “mixed-bloodedness became the post-frontier version of the vanishing Indian.” 125 For African Americans, on the other hand, the “one-drop rule” relegated to blackness a biological permanence that would survive any amount of interracial mixing. Whereas mixed or light-skinned African Americans who passed as white frustrated the settler colonial racial regime, Indigenous people who assimilated to whiteness upheld it. Similarly, while Jim Crow and antimiscegenation laws kept the line between blacks and whites from blurring, interracial mixing was not only tolerated among Indigenous people but was often actively encouraged through policy. In the United States, the practice of “checkerboarding” during the administration of the Dawes Act (1887–1934) interpenetrated Indigenous reservations with white allotments to promote intermarriage and decrease eligible heirs to Native Title. 126 In Canada, prior to changes to the Indian Act in 1985, Indigenous women were “rewarded” with the loss of their status as “Registered Indians” for the prize of a white identity, not only if they married non-Native but non-Status men. 127 As distinct as these black and Native racial formations appear, they were still bound together by an overarching economic rationale of settler colonialism. First, for each group, race became more salient during the rise and development of industrial capitalism. For Indigenous nations, the logic of elimination became aggressively implemented as trading posts were eclipsed by industrial forms of economic production. In Canada, for instance, James Tulley explains that “the end of the British and French wars rendered the military alliances with the First Nations irrelevant. The shift from trade to settled agriculture and manufacture caused the trading treaties to decline . . . undermining Aboriginal economies and forcing Aboriginal peoples into relations of dependency.” 128 Being rendered anomalous by industrial modes of production thus signals the full onset of settler colonialism and, with it, a racial logic of elimination. In the case of African American slaves, their emancipation was contextualized by the growing challenges to plantation-based economies and the increasing demand for flexible, free labor for the emerging industrial economy. While plantation capitalism was still highly profitable before the Civil War, Southern plantations were increasingly challenged by their need to expand production into non-slave-holding states. 129 Nevertheless, in the absence of slavery, new demands of the industrial economy rendered postemancipation African Americans anomalous as people and gave rise to an intensified notion of race as a regime of social control. From the view of capitalist expansion that lies at the heart of settler colonialism, the divergent forms of racialization that Indigenous peoples of North America and African Americans have been subject to are entirely reconcilable. As Wolfe puts it unequivocally: “The simple undifferentiated product of the encounter between African labor and Indian law was European property.” 130 Mixing alien labor with Indigenous land to expand white property was the basis and objective of settler colonialism. Disposable/Undisposable Alien Labor and the Heterogeneity of Race As migrants to North America, Asians’ primary relationship to settler colonizers was historically based on labor. Similar to African Americans, Asians represented an alien labor force that mixed with Indigenous land to transform it into white property and capital. What comes to light from this framework is, yet again, the heterogeneity of race under settler colonialism. Rather than presenting a derivative model of Asian racialization that is based on a prototypical antiblackness, the vicissitudes of Asian racialization are primarily shaped by the evolving economic landscape of settler colonialism within a global economy. While African Americans and Asian North Americans share an alien status in a triangular framework, the divergent historical and economic contexts of Asian and African labor highlight the heterogeneity contained within an alien position. Asian labor migration to North America, as well as elsewhere in the Americas, occurred during the demise of plantation-based slave economies, a decline that began in the 1830s. Given shifting requirements of industrializing economies, which demanded a flexible rather than enslaved labor force, the economic context of Asian labor migration in the nineteenth century inoculated Asians from assuming the status of unfree labor. This distinction renders Asian aliens highly dependent, nevertheless, on the class of settler capitalists. This means, as Biermann and Kössler clarify, that “the migrant workers are not personally free, [although] their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 131 In addition, as Moon-Ho Jung explains, the historical importation of indentured Chinese labors to replace or supplement slave labor in the US South represented a period of dramatically destabilized labor relations that introduced new and reinvigorated conceptualizations of race and nation. 132 In this tumultuous economic context, Chinese labor migrants would assume none of the hereditary stain of slavery that defined blackness before emancipation or hereditary racialization that determined African American exclusion afterward. While the presence of African American slave labor was an important context for subsequent Asian-settler labor relations in the United States, the Canadian context demonstrates that parallel expressions of Asian racialization were not wholly contingent on the prior enslavement of black people; rather, they were overwhelmingly conditioned by industrial capitalism. Therefore, in the absence of plantation-based African slavery in Canada, the common denominator of Chinese laborers’ analogous experiences of exploitation and exclusion was their alien status rather than their proximity to a racialized notion of blackness. Because the industrial economy that Asian labor served did not require a permanent, reproducible, exclusive, and violently contained population of alien labor, as was the case under US slavery, the exclusionary tactics that Asians were subjected to never approximated those experienced by black slaves. 133 The projection of Asianness as a racial signifier of indelible, exclusively transferable attributes was less necessary as a strategy of containment. Unlike emancipated slaves, Asians could be excluded and eliminated from the nation-state. If the rise of industrial capitalism solidified biological notions of race that subjected Indigenous populations to eliminatory assimilation on the basis of the mutability of their blood, and black populations to Jim Crow exclusion based on the contaminating reach of their blood, the logic of exclusion ascribed alien-ness and spatial vulnerability not simply to Asian blood but to the entire Asian body. Because Asian bodies could be entirely excluded from the nation-state, Asian labor was susceptible to more volatile forms of domestic exclusion than those experienced by African Americans. As a result, the history of domestic segregation and antimiscegenation laws targeting Asians in North America—evoked by racial fears of biological contamination and contagion 134 —was more uneven than its African American counterpart. 135 A much more effective means of exclusion was through immigration control. A form of Jim Crow in a transnational context, immigration policy not only determined entry into the nation but could legally bar an immigrant from naturalizing, voting, owning and transferring property, and working. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds observe, “In drawing the global colour line, immigration restriction became a version of racial segregation on an international scale.” 136 To the extent that Asians were restricted or excluded from coming to North America until the mid-1960s, and because their deportability constituted a form of what David Hernández calls “lesser citizenship,” 137 the logic of exclusion employed the national border to segregate populations and maintain social control. In a settler colonial context, these variable, exclusionary logics have resulted in the heterogeneous racialization of the alien: the African American, whose indisposability in the settler state requires a heightened form of racialized exclusion as a form of domestic social control, and the Asian North American, whose disposability from the settler state produces a less fixed and more volatile racialization by virtue of the exclusionary power of immigration restriction. In this framework of abstract labor, Asian North Americans may appear “less racial”—to adapt Lye’s language—than African Americans or Indigenous populations, whose racial essences were expressed in the relative power of blood to contaminate or to erase a population, respectively. However, if Asian racialization produced a less blood-defined racial body, it is by virtue of the exclusionary, segregationist logics that were carried out in the extraterritorial arena of immigration control that inhibited Asian exposure to more sustained domestic logics of racial exclusion and elimination. In this context, race is not only a heterogeneous formation; it is also an expression of settler power whose capacity to racialize is not, as Jodi Melamed suggests, “reducible to biology, identity, or ontology.” 138 These factors laid the settler colonial groundwork for an understanding of the abstract racialization of the Asian alien that form this book’s central concern. While a logic of elimination functions to increase white property through the decimation of Indigenous populations who stand in the way of territorial expansion, a logic of exclusion serves industrial capitalism by furnishing a vulnerable labor force whose existence could be managed at the border. Bearing some similarity to the spatial segregation of prison inmates from inner cities, the border represents a geographical solution to manage surplus populations. 139 This focus does not discount the many other exercises of racialized domestic social control, which prevented, denied, or rescinded access to naturalization, labor, the franchise, property ownership, and, in the case of Japanese North American citizens interned during World War II, due process or freedom of mobility. My point is that each of these modes of domestic racial control served a broader logic of exclusion that is inherent in immigration restriction: to underscore and preserve Asians’ alien status by creating policy that exploited the volatility of an Asian presence. From the perspective of settler colonialism, we can build on this framework by clarifying the importance of spatial alienation (rather than Indigeneity) as a factor in the exploitation of a racialized labor force. In this light, a logic of exclusion is the prerequisite for the recruitment of alien labor, functioning either to reproduce an exclusive labor force in the case of African slaves or to render an Asian labor presence highly conditional to the demands of capital. Both are subject to forms of segregation, either on a national or international scale. As each of my chapters argues, this volatility is what makes it possible to view the Asian alien as the embodiment of the abstract evils of capitalism. By clarifying the evolving triangulation of Native, alien, and settler subject positions, my purpose has been to distinguish both the heterogeneity of race and the heterogeneity of alien racialization. This formation is uniquely tied to settler colonialism, which requires a disposable reserve army labor force. In the chapters that follow, I will situate this heterogeneous racial formation within a settler colonial logic of romantic anticapitalism that hypostatizes whiteness and sublates Asianness into abstract labor and the intangible, destructive dimension of capitalist relations. Chapter Overview In order to magnify the capitalist logics of settler colonialism that account for the striking parallels in US and Canadian policy directed at Asian ethnic groups, this book’s transnational focus draws on corresponding racial policy making at key turning points since the nineteenth century: Chinese railroad labor in the 1880s and subsequent immigrant restriction laws; the expansion of anti-Asian immigration restrictions in the 1920s; the relocation and internment of Japanese civilians during and after World War II; and the late 1960s neoliberalization of immigration policy. Because one of my goals is to reframe these historical touchstones where Chinese and Japanese populations figured predominantly, the majority of my examples are limited to this East Asian scope. However, because my project is aimed at presenting a theorization of the abstract economism of the Asian alien in a settler colonial framework rather than emphasize the ethnic particularity of any one group, I have strived to construct a flexible rather than ethnically determined model that can be expanded and adapted to accommodate the specific historical circumstances of Asian populations not covered in the book. In each chapter I explore Asian North American cultural production as a genealogical archive. As such I draw from Michel Foucault’s distinction between history and genealogy, one shaped by his principle that “knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting.” 140 Rather than the traditional approach to history as a linear and unified development—“an acquisition, a possession that grows and solidifies”—a genealogy is an “unstable assemblage of faults, fissures, and heterogeneous layers that threaten the fragile inheritor from within or from underneath.” 141 As such, genealogy opens up what Foucault calls a countermemory: “a transformation of history into a totally different time.” 142 To the three modalities of counter-memory that he identifies as parodic, dissociative, and sacrificial reworkings of history, I would like to add a fourth, a “postmemory,” in order to call attention to the affective register of racial genealogies. As Marianne Hirsch defines it, postmemory is a “very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 143 She further distinguishes postmemory and memory as follows: Postmemory characterizes the experiences of those who grow up dominated by narratives that preceded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated. 144 Such a conceptualization of postmemory applies to the contemporary Asian North American cultural production I examine in the sense that these works present less of a direct or experiential connection to historical events than a collective consciousness of Asian American and Asian Canadians who have grown up with settler narratives of national identity and belonging that have relegated the Asian as other. I further adapt the notion of postmemory to indicate a form of future memory, a memory yet to come, to capture the simultaneously utopian and apocalyptic capitalist futurity explored in Asian North American reconfigurations of history. Given that my primary focus is on the economic modalities of Asian racialization that are tied to capitalism, my goal is to demonstrate how an Asian North American cultural genealogy of settler colonialism does not simply oppose this economism but, rather, opens it up for further exposure. Laid bare, the symbolic infrastructure of this economism provides a window into what Dipesh Chakrabarty terms History 2, the relations “whose reproduction does not contribute to the reproduction of the logic of capital . . . [even though they] can actually be intimately intertwined with the relations that do.” 145 History 2 expresses the potential of countermemory to subvert the social relations embedded in History 1 that reproduce the logic of capital. Most of the chapters in the book feature a dialogue between literary and visual texts. The multimedia nature of the archive that grounds my analysis of each historical episode aims to meet two objectives. First, a starting point for this book is an understanding that the ideological expression of white settler colonialism and anti-Asian sentiment in North America is a multimedia projection that has glorified whiteness in artistic constructions of landscape and delimited racial belonging in textual definitions of citizenship. Therefore the multimedia archive of Asian North American cultural production in this book is a response to both the literary and visual form of these constructions. Related to this, the visual works I incorporate attempt to address the predominance of mainstream film and television constructions of Asians that evoke untrustworthiness, mystery, or deceitfulness and collectively reinforce the destructive, unrepresentable abstraction attributed to Asian bodies. The mystery and treachery often reinforced through the visuality of Asians in popular media are distinctive because they always point to something invisible and unseen, suggesting that the negative content of Asian racialization is something that we can’t see. The visual culture presented in this book thus offers imaginative responses to the challenge of visualizing the unrepresentable. Each chapter explores how settler colonialism negatively aligns Asians with an abstract dimension of capitalism through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism—that is, through romantic anticapitalism’s misperception that social relations are defined either as concrete, natural, visible, and hence noncapitalist or abstract, unnatural, invisible, and hence capitalist. Such a misperception of capitalism presents an ideal ideology for rationalizing and forgetting the settler colonial elimination of Native peoples and exploitation of alien labor. Thus what romantic anticapitalism offers is an ideological framework for settler colonialism to respond to economic and technological crises by imagining whiteness through indigenizing tropes of purity and organic connection to land that function to distort and deflect responsibility for capitalist modernity. As such, each chapter examines the expression of white settler romantic anticapitalism both to indigenize whiteness and to align Asians with the threateningly abstract economism of capitalism. The first chapter, “Sex, Time, and the Transcontinental Railway: Abstract Labor and the Queer Temporalities of History 2,” establishes the book’s foundational claim that the economism of Asian racialization arises from a temporal alignment of Chinese bodies with abstract labor, which has implications for what constitutes socially necessary labor time. This “abstract” racialization is reinforced by romantic anticapitalism, which projects an antinomical character of capitalist social relations expressed as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions. I examine how romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, pure, and organic dimensions of white labor and leisure time, while identifying capitalism solely with the abstract dimensions of the antinomy, which is personified by Chinese labor. The chapter begins with a reflection on a nineteenth-century sketch of a Chinese laborer’s profile surrounded by financial figures drawn by William Van Horne, president of the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR ). My interpretation of the sketch, whose provocative nature the CPR itself underscored by not granting me permission to reproduce in this book, sets the stage for clarifying the sexualized intersection of race and capitalism. In taking this direction I adapt Postone’s theorization of the secular, anticapitalist dimensions of modern anti-Semitism for understanding anti-Asian sentiment. Analyzing Richard Fung’s Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes alongside Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men , two works about Chinese labor on the transcontinental railroad, I explore the identity—or sameness—relation between Chinese labor, time, and money. Focusing on the range of gender and sexual substitutions represented in these texts, I argue that these works demonstrate how the abstract racialization of Asian alien labor is established through their alignment with a perverse temporality. While Fung’s and Kingston’s works expose the fungibility of alien labor conditioned by biologized notions of time, they also point to the queer potential of History 2 that resides within abstract labor but does not reproduce the logic of capitalism. Moreover, their contemporary approach to this history highlights the ongoing construction of racialized abstraction in the era of globalization—the new nineteenth century—which is the subject of chapter 4 . The second chapter, “Unnatural Landscapes: Romantic Anticapitalism and Alien Degeneracy,” builds on the first chapter’s focus on the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations—personified by Chinese labor—by turning its attention to the concrete dimension of capitalist social relations personified in artistic depictions of the settler landscape. Turning to the photographs of Tseng Kwong Chi and Jin-me Yoon, I argue that their photographic citations of 1920s- and 1930s-era landscape art parody its romanticization of whiteness-as-nature during a heightened period of Asian immigrant restriction. In particular, Tseng and Yoon respond to themes of regenerative whiteness and autochthonophilia—a term that refers to a settler colonial desire for and identification with Indigeneity—personified in the majestic landscapes by American artists Ansel Adams and Gutzon Borglum and Canadian artists Emily Carr and the Group of Seven. Disidentifying with the romanticization of the concrete, purifying landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs expose the politics of whiteness invested in the identification with nature and Indigeneity. Further developing the theme of perversity associated with abstract labor in chapter 1 , Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs highlight how Asian bodies evolve to denote a degenerative, antinatural force associated with the abstract dimension of romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical social universe. Chapter 3 , “Japanese Internment and the Mutation of Labor,” focuses on the consequences of an increasingly unnatural, mechanical abstraction of Asian racialization developed in the previous chapters. To help contextualize the expulsion, internment, and, in the case of Japanese Canadians, postwar relocation east of the Rocky Mountains, I suggest that the modes of abstraction attributed to Japanese agriculture and fishing labor in the United States and Canada contributed to the false impression that Japanese labor held a destructive control over the creation of relative surplus-value. I suggest that Japanese internment is neither reducible to prior modalities of Asian immigrant exclusion nor a rational expression of white accumulation by racial dispossession. Instead, I argue that Japanese internment turns on the association of Japanese labor with the modernizing displacements of technological innovation, which fed a perception that Japanese labor monopolized the creation of relative surplus-value. The chapter probes how the destructive power of Japanese labor was resignified after West Coast expulsion and relocation. Focusing on Joy Kogawa’s novel Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s video-memoir History and Memory , I examine how symbolic identification with Jewish persecution before the war shifted toward an identification with Native identities after relocation. This cross-racial identification with Native contexts evokes the neutralization of Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value and reconstitution as an ideal surplus labor force. The fourth chapter, “The New Nineteenth Century: Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism,” examines the persistent and evolving economism of Asian racialization in the postexclusion era, after the United States and Canada removed race-based immigration criteria in 1965 and 1967, respectively. Turning to Ken Lum’s multimedia works, including his sculpture on the roof of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , along with Karen Tei Yamashita’s novel Tropic of Orange , I track their works’ reconceptualizations of labor, migration, and political consciousness. Their works point to the capacity of the neoliberal border to recruit and restrict surplus labor populations from around the world while preserving the racialized abstractions that surround both high-tech, flexible Asian labor and working-class labor. As such, free trade becomes a further conduit for the fungibility of bodies as capital across borders and the continuing perils of abstract labor associated with the “new Jew.” Far from symbolizing multicultural inclusion, I suggest that the border is a central motor for the expanded fulfillment of a settler colonial mode of production that relies on a disposable migrant labor system. The epilogue, “The Revenge of the Iron Chink,” offers a meditation on an exhibition featuring an early twentieth-century fish-gutting machine called the “Iron Chink” located in my hometown of Victoria, British Columbia, personifying a racist slur. To explore its contemporary significance I turn to artist Tommy Ting’s reanimation of the Iron Chink in his 2012 sculpture Machine (Iron Chink, invented in 1903, found at the Gulf of Georgia Cannery in Steveston, British Columbia, refabricated in Beijing, China) . Examining how Ting’s sculpture recontextualizes the original machine, I reflect on aesthetic and biological dimensions of capitalism that I’ve tracked through the book. Probing the question of value in capitalism as the central motor of the metaphoric work of the fetish, I consider what it might mean to imagine human incommensurability in a world beyond commodity-determined labor.

She was replaced by a “Caucasian-looking woman” 1 who is seen peering through a microscope (figure I.1 ). In the foreground appears a bottle of insulin that symbolizes nationalist ingenuity through medical innovation. Based on internal reports obtained by the Canadian Press, the decision to remove the Asian scientist came in response to focus groups who previewed the design in Montreal and Charlottetown and felt that her Asian appearance “did not represent Canada” 2 and was “exclusionary . . . since the banknote didn’t represent other ethnicities.” 3 Although the bank declined requests to release the initial design to the public, a bank spokesperson indicated that the image of a “Caucasian-looking woman” was substituted to “restore neutral ethnicity.” 4 News of the bank’s decision met sharp criticism from Asian advocacy groups, particularly the Chinese Canadian National Council, who criticized the bank and urged it to stop “‘erasing’ visible minorities from Canada’s money.” 5 FIGURE I.1 One-hundred-dollar Canadian bill, Bank of Canada. This controversy highlights this book’s central focus on the interplay of Asian racialization, capitalism, and settler colonialism that, as I will develop below, reveals an economic modality that links constructions of the Asian and the Jew. At first glance, the controversy sheds light on the ever-simmering tension between race and national culture in Canada. In particular, the bank’s equation of a “Caucasian-looking woman” with race “neutrality” exposes the normativity of whiteness in an officially multicultural nation. That an erased woman of color’s body serves as the battleground for adjudicating cultural legitimacy participates in a long-standing objectification of nonwhite female bodies as litmus tests of racial, gender, sexual, and here national normativity and deviance. 6 The Chinese Canadian National Council’s admonishment attempts to bare these contradictions but ultimately endorses the superimposing of multicultural iconography onto capital. Even US-based blogger Phil “Angry Asian Man” Yu weighed in on the politics of representation, calling the controversy “racebending on a banknote.” 7 In response to focus group members who objected to the Asian scientist for being too stereotypical, Yu remarks, “Sure there is a stereotype of Asians excelling in math or science. But let’s be real. The reason why people didn’t want an Asian-looking woman on the $100 bill is because an Asian-looking woman couldn’t possibly represent a face of Canada. Thus, the rush to redesign her with more Caucasian features.” 8 For the Chinese Canadian National Council, “Angry Asian Man,” and countless other bloggers and YouTube vloggers, the controversy’s significance turns on the variable race of the scientist against the assumed stability of the money form of capital as a representation of nation. To restore the “Asian-looking” characteristics to the scientist would, by extension, restore equilibrium between race and nation. But what seems to be missing from this discussion is the peculiar intersection of race and money—of race as a form of money, or vice versa. How do we understand the variability of money as capitalist (rather than solely nationalist) fetish and its own racialized personas? For the purposes of this book, the controversy dramatizes ways that Asian North Americans are uncomfortably associated with capital. More benign expressions of this association arise out of recognition of the upward economic mobility of Asians in North America over the twentieth century, which, at least temporarily, secured Asian Canadian representation on the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill and have earned Asian Americans the title of the “new Jews.” 9 Both expressions refer to the increasing affluence and assimilation of a historically excluded minority. In the case of the Asian-Jewish analogy, Matthew Frye Jacobson’s discussion of the evolution of Jewish American immigrant identity from a non-Anglo-Saxon to a Caucasian social position in the nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries emphasizes the progressive and linear orientation of the analogy. 10 This progressive emphasis is amplified in the 2012 Pew Research Center study “The Rise of Asian America,” which reported that Asians were the highest-income (earning 33 percent more than median-income households), best-educated, and fastest-growing racial group in the United States. 11 Despite numerous scholarly objections to the Pew Research Center’s failure to identify the extended configuration of most Asian households, the high-cost urban residential concentration of those families, and the pronounced income disparities between Asian ethnicities, 12 these facts have had little countervailing influence on the mainstream perception that Asians are more hurt than helped by affirmative action policies. Moreover, from Thomas Friedman’s recommendation that US children adopt the competitive traits of their Chinese and Indian counterparts 13 to Québec politician François Legault’s declaration that “kids in Québec should work harder, like Asians,” 14 the attributes of Asians in Asia and North America are to be ignored at one’s economic peril. Coupled with the benign recognition of Asian North American educational and economic achievement are more unsettling aspects of the Asian-Jewish analogy. For instance, Los Angeles Times reporter Gregory Rodriguez emphasizes how “the Jewish comparison has a dark side.” 15 According to Rodriguez, the victorious narrative of the civil rights movement has contributed to the misguided belief that “economic status rises as prejudice decreases, and vice versa . . . [and] that bias is always targeted downward at the weakest and the most vulnerable in society.” 16 In other words, the Asian-Jewish analogy should not be read as an indication of what Susan Koshy refers to as a “morphing of race into ethnicity,” 17 a theory stating that Asians in North America have evolved from discriminated racial minority to assimilated ethnic group over the twentieth century. Rather, according to Rodriguez, the Asian-Jewish analogy compels recognition of the economic contexts of modern anti-Semitism, which he characterizes as “distrust or disdain of Jews [which] can sometimes be motivated by envy or resentment of an identifiably separate group that’s significantly wealthier than the population at large.” 18 The economic conflation of Asians and Jews has a long history, explains Jonathan Freedman, who notes that “like Jews, Chinese merchants were traditionally active throughout East and South Asia and faced—again like Jews—resentment, discrimination, and even the occasional pogrom as a result.” 19 Intersecting expressions of industriousness, greed, and evil have been infused in popular culture representations of both groups in Europe and North America, from novelist George Du Maurier’s 1895 creation of the Jewish-descended Svengali to novelist Sax Rohmer’s 1921 invention of Fu Manchu. 20 Both characters are perverse, evil geniuses who aspire to world domination. Turning back to the controversy over the one-hundred-dollar bill, the bank’s initial effort to present an image that promotes Canadian medical innovation through the figure of the Asian Canadian scientist aligns Asian subjects with capital in more abstract, nonhuman ways. In particular, the characteristics of the model minority stereotype—educated, disciplined, obedient—embodied by the Asian Canadian scientist increasingly emphasize economic over human attributes. As Helen Jun explains, the model minority represents the ideal neoliberal subject who manifests the qualities she refers to as “human capital,” a term coined by economist Gary Becker in the 1960s to emphasize the role that education plays in adding value to labor. 21 As human capital, the individual is regarded as an “enterprise” driven by market values who embodies an “infinite capacity for ‘self-development.’” 22 Jun draws the connection between neoliberal capital and the racialization of Asian Americans in ways that can be extended to the Canadian context: We can see that the neoliberal theory of human capital and its notion of individual enterprise and self-regulation are not merely evident in Asian American model minority discourse but are also key tenets by which Asian American racial difference came to be defined in the post-1965 period. The centrality of educational achievement and the importance of family in contemporary discourses of Asian American racial difference are no mere coincidence, as neoliberal theories of human capital championed education and parenting as the most critical investments promising the highest rates of return. 23 What this passage highlights is how key aspects of model minority discourse are reflected in Asian American racialization as a form of market-driven instrumentality. Further bridging market instrumentality and racial form, the Bank of Canada’s “Asian-looking” banknote takes Jun’s notion of Asian American human capital to another level by symbolically removing the “human.” Projected onto the one-hundred-dollar bill, the Asian Canadian scientist is not merely a form of human capital but a representation of capital itself. Moreover, the eventual jettisoning of her image suggests that she signified an offensive form of capital that had to be “neutralized” by whiteness. As the personification of bad capital, the rejected “Asian-looking” one-hundred-dollar bill evokes prior economic modalities that have shaped Asian racialization. For instance, Colleen Lye’s discussion of pre-1942 expressions of anti-Japanese sentiment in California agriculture demonstrates how economic resentment toward Japanese farmers is represented through the sphere of monopoly capitalism. In the naturalist fiction she examines, Lye notes how the “homogenizing evils of monopoly are entirely displaced onto sinister Japanese characters.” 24 It is the “inorganic quality of the Asiatic body” 25 that manifests the “intangibly abstract” threat of finance capital. 26 Reflecting on the role of economic tropes embedded in racist representations of Japanese American success in agriculture in the early twentieth century, a success mirrored by Japanese Canadians in the British Columbia fishing industry, Lye points to what she calls the “economism of Asiatic racial form—a form in which economic interests are not masked but are the primary medium of race’s historical expression.” 27 The Canadian hundred-dollar-bill controversy is a heightened expression of this economism of racial form insofar as the dehumanized economism of the Asian simultaneously represents the personification of capital. What precedes the economism of Asian racial form is the similarly destructive economism historically attributed to Jews, highlighting more disturbing implications of the “New Jews” appellation. In his essay “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism,” Moishe Postone focuses on the secular elements of anti-Semitism that flourished under National Socialism in Germany, illustrating a historical process by which Jews became associated with the abstract evils of capitalism. Because Jews had long been segregated in finance and interest-generating sectors of European society, traditional anti-Semitism identified them as owners of money. Perhaps the most notorious literary example of traditional anti-Semitism is Shakespeare’s Shylock, the sinister usurer in The Merchant of Venice , whose penalty for late payment is nothing short of a pound of flesh. However, by the nineteenth century, modern anti-Semitism not only identified Jews as the owners of money but “held [them] responsible for economic crises and identified [them] with the range of social restructuring and dislocation resulting from rapid industrialization: explosive urbanization, the decline of traditional social classes and strata, the emergence of a large, increasingly organized industrial proletariat.” 28 In short, as Postone explains, “They [Jews] became the personification of the intangible, destructive, immensely powerful, and international domination of capital as a social form.” 29 Here the attributes of “abstractness, intangibility, universality, mobility” 30 that are associated with Jews are striking in their resonance with characteristic forms of Asian racialization in North America. The racial signifiers of inscrutability, perpetual foreignness, transnational mobility, and flexibility similarly register the abstract features of Asian racialization that this book aligns with the evolution of settler colonial capitalism in North America. The controversy over the Bank of Canada’s initial design of the one-hundred-dollar bill and the “new Jews” analogy may suggest that Asian racialization has entered a new historical phase. Indeed, the model minority stereotype seems far afield from the historical repertoire of yellow perilism denoting disease, vice, and destruction. But rather than expressions associated with two distinct phases, “yellow peril” and the “model minority” stereotype function as complementary aspects of the same form of racialization, in which economic efficiency is the basis for exclusion or assimilation. This book therefore engages in the task of demonstrating how the contemporary economism of Asian racial form does not represent a break from the past but rather is part of a continuum of settler colonial capitalism and its racial formations. Building on scholarship that examines the economic modalities of “Asiatic racial form” depicted in the interplay of art and policy by white producers, 31 I focus on contemporary Asian American and Asian Canadian literature and visual culture as a transnational genealogy of settler colonialism’s capitalist logics. What Asian North American cultural producers reveal in their rearticulation of settler colonial mythologies is how capitalism operates as a system of representation that is objective but immaterial, immanent but subject to resignification. My methodology is influenced by Marx’s dialectical method, which emphasizes dynamic relations rather than causation to illuminate the dualities and contradictions that emerge from capitalism. I am similarly guided by Fredric Jameson’s argument that the most important task of cultural interpretation is to reveal a work’s “political unconscious.” 32 In this spirit, I look to ways that Asian North American cultural production similarly magnifies settler colonial mythologies to reveal a system of representation that reproduces the logic of capitalism. The expansive, transnational scope of the archive also offers a framework for highlighting patterns and convergences across settler colonial borders. This book’s primary thesis is that Asian North American literature and visual culture present a genealogy of settler colonialism that magnifies a key logic of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic anticapitalism is the misperception of the appearance of capitalist relations for their essence, a misperception that stems from Marx’s notion of the fetish. As Neil Levi points out, what romantic anticapitalism “solves is a problem of representation . . . possess[ing] an intrinsically aesthetic dimension.” 33 As an aesthetic dimension, therefore, Asians give human shape to the abstract circuits of capitalism that have “no concrete manifestation, that are quite literally unrepresentable .” 34 In the manner that Jews came to personify processes internal to finance capital under National Socialism, I argue that the Asian subject in North America personifies abstract processes of value formation anchored by labor. From the economic efficiency associated with Asian racialization, denigrated as “cheap” labor in the nineteenth century and valued as “efficient” in the twenty-first, Asian North American cultural production magnifies the manner through which Asians are aligned with “abstract labor,” a concept that anchors Marx’s labor theory of value. It is from the vantage of abstract labor, as Dipesh Chakrabarty also notes, that capitalism is both reconstituted and potentially subverted. Let me elaborate on this connection between race and abstract labor, which I would argue is a key logic of what Cedric Robinson calls “racial capitalism.” 35 In particular, by giving material and symbolic weight to the category of abstract labor, my project diverges from the important work of scholars such as Lisa Lowe, David Roediger, and others who have argued that capitalism has profited from labor not by rendering it abstract but by producing racialized difference. For instance, in Lowe’s critique of the labor theory of value, she hones in on Marx’s homogenizing definition of “abstract labor ‘as the use value which confronts money posited as capital, labour is not this or another labour, but labour pure and simple , abstract labour; absolutely indifferent to its particular specificity.’” 36 Her point is to demonstrate that capital has profited from the specifically gendered and racialized character of labor, qualities that are far from indistinguishable or abstract. She presents the notion of abstract labor as the erroneous basis of an equally flawed conception of abstract citizenship in the political sphere: Abstract labor, subject to capitalist rationalization and the logic of equivalence through wages, is the adjunct of the formal political equality granted through rights and representation by the state. Yet in the history of the United States, capital has maximized its profits not through rendering labor “abstract” but precisely through the social productions of “difference,” of restrictive particularity and illegitimacy marked by race, nation, geographical origins, and gender. The law of value has operated, instead, by creating, preserving, and reproducing the specifically racialized and gendered character of labor power. 37 In short, she writes, “Asian immigrants and Asian Americans have been neither ‘abstract labor’ nor ‘abstract citizens.’” 38 David Roediger extends this line of argument, asserting that “far from flattening difference by buying undifferentiated units of labor power, US management studiously bought into inequality, preserving and continually recreating race.” 39 While my project is in harmony with the claim that capitalism produces racialized difference, I propose that these differentiating effects are not in contradiction with Marx’s formulation of abstract labor. What is missing from Lowe’s and Roediger’s critiques of abstract labor is a recognition of its dialectical relation to concrete labor. Concrete labor represents the racial, gendered, and qualitatively distinct form of actual labor that is rendered abstract as a value expression. Where I locate the principal violence of capitalism is in the very way it abstracts (or renders homogeneous as commensurable units of labor) highly differentiated gendered and racialized labor in order to create value . It is therefore the law of value that obscures the racial and gendered character of labor power. For value itself is what necessitates what we could characterize as the metaphoric process of turning particular labor into quantifiable units of abstract labor. So in response to the suggestion that racialized labor is irreducible to the conception of abstract labor because of its gendered and racial particularity, no value would be produced if this were the case. Rather, all commodity-determined labor plays a socially mediating role that is structured by time. Capital maximizes profit by controlling time: socially necessary labor time. Nothing prevents the exploitation of racial and gendered labor from being a “social necessity” that determines average labor time. Indeed, one core logic of the settler colonial mode of production I explore in this book centers on the systematic exploitation of a racialized, gendered, and sexualized alien labor force. The structuring role of time is precisely the reason that capitalism is an abstract form of domination, what Petrus Liu characterizes as “impersonal domination.” 40 This doesn’t mean that we don’t daily bear witness to brutal working conditions or the near enslavement of racialized and gendered labor; rather, the very violence of labor abstraction, what Richard Godden calls “the founding moment of abstraction,” 41 is what subsumes the horrors of highly differentiated labor into an abstracted quantity that is commensurable with all other things. It is the duplicity of value as a social relation that Marx denounces, such that “the various proportions in which different kinds of labour are reduced to simple labour as their unit of measurement are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers.” 42 To put it another way, we don’t control the products of our labor; we are controlled by the products of our labor. Therefore, while I agree that capitalism produces racialized difference, this book defines social differentiation as a form of destructive abstraction anchored by a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic Anticapitalism The historical processes that encode a romanticized distinction between concrete and abstract social relations grow out of Marx’s identification of an internalized duality within the commodity. Romantic anticapitalism’s confusion over the appearance and essence of the commodity is what Marx refers to as its “fetishism.” While a focus on the fetishism of the commodity appears initially removed from the realm of race and social relations, the commodity is foundational to Marx’s labor theory of value, which structures social—and hence race, gender, and sexual—relations within a capitalist mode of production. The chief effect of this fetishism is the appearance of capitalist social relations as antinomical: that an antinomy or opposition exists between concrete and abstract realms of society. Under a romantic anticapitalist view, what is real, sensory, or “thingly” is the tree in your backyard, the dusty work boots by the door, the reliable pickup truck in the driveway. These make up the concrete realm. What is unnatural, nonthingly, or intangible is capital accumulation, surplus-value, and money. These form the abstract realm. Therefore, as Levi clarifies, “romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of the antinomy.” 43 The antinomical view that characterizes romantic anticapitalism glorifies the concrete dimension while casting as evil the abstract domination of capitalism. In particular, the specific power attributed to Jews under National Socialism anthropomorphizes the internal workings of the commodity itself. What is remarkable is how the traits of mobility, abstractness, immateriality, and universality that modern anti-Semitism identifies with Jews are the very same characteristics that Marx uses to describe the commodity’s value dimension. However, as Postone clarifies, “this [value] dimension—like the supposed power of the Jews—does not appear as such, rather always in the form of a material carrier, such as the commodity. The carrier thus has a ‘double character’—value and use-value.” 44 In other words, what romantic anticapitalism misunderstands is that value, while seemingly abstract, is nonetheless objectified within the concrete, sensory form of the commodity during the exchange process. Pulling away the veil of the fetish will reveal that commodities are above all the representations (carriers) of social processes that are objectified in things, and as Marx puts it, “its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing.” 45 The main secret hidden within the commodity is that it comprises a duality of abstract and concrete dimensions. In a section of volume 1 of Capital titled “The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities,” Marx explains that the commodity internalizes two aspects: (a) use-value (a thing of use) and (b) exchange value (the exchangeability of that thing). Here we can observe a distinction between these two characteristics of the commodity; a use-value is concrete in a material sense—a table, for instance—but exchange value is abstract and immaterial in the sense that we can’t see or touch it. Dissecting the labor that produces the commodity, Marx continues by saying that “labour, too, has a dual character insofar as [when] it finds its expression in value, it no longer possesses the same characteristics as when it is the creator of use-values.” 46 Unpacking this distinction, concrete labor refers to a specific activity—whether hammering or cooking—that produces a use-value. On the other, it is “abstract labor” that objectifies a commodity’s value. Before we move on, we can pause to observe a fundamental point about value, which is that it is immaterial but objective : 47 “We may twist and turn a single commodity as we wish; it remains impossible to grasp it as a thing possessing value. . . . Commodities possess an objective character as values only in so far as they are all expressions of an identical social substance, human labor.” 48 Like gravity, value is invisible but real. What gives objectivity to the value of commodities, Marx asserts, is that they are products of human labor. A commodity’s value, therefore, is what Marx defines as “socially necessary labor time.” But what determines “social necessity”? This, it turns out, is part of the distinction between abstract and concrete labor. The main difference between concrete and abstract labor is temporal. The actual time it takes to produce a commodity in the case of concrete labor has no immediate bearing on a particular commodity’s value. If it did, a commodity would become more valuable the slower a worker labored to produce it, or as Marx puts it, a given product “would be more valuable the more unskillful and lazy the worker who produced it, because he would need more time to complete the article.” 49 Concrete labor will only tell us how well made a commodity is; it is the qualitative dimension of use-value. 50 On the other hand, abstract labor is a quantitative expression of value—it is an unfixed social average of human labor time. As Marx explains, “In the former case [of concrete labor] it was a matter of the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ of labour, in the latter [abstract labor] of the ‘how much,’ of the temporal duration of labor.” 51 Time is the ultimate measure of abstract labor and the magnitude of a commodity’s value. The quantity of time in abstract labor is not individual or provisional but socially necessary . Marx writes, “Socially necessary labour-time is the labour-time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society.” 52 From this view of the dual character of labor embodied in the commodity, we see how concrete labor is more directly aligned with the qualitative production of use-value, while abstract labor is more directly aligned with the quantitative dimension of value. While use-value and value are inseparable, internal features of each and every commodity, they nevertheless appear on the surface as discrete. Money generalizes the exchange of commodities and reinforces the fetishistic appearance that use-value and value are oppositional rather than part of the internal duality of the commodity. Marx historicizes money’s emergence through his discussion of commodity value. He explains that the only way we can determine the value of a commodity is when it is in motion: through its exchange with a different commodity. In a simple barter situation, I might exchange two forks for your bowl. The magnitude of value—the amount of socially necessary labor time—embedded in my forks and your bowl becomes visible (or objective) only in the exchange process. What we find is that your one bowl holds the equivalent value of my two forks; my two forks express the relative value of your one bowl. Over time certain commodities come to stand as the universal equivalent because they offer a stable measure of equivalent value. Historically, gold and other metals have played this role. So, rather than exchanging my two forks for your one bowl, I would give you two forks in exchange for an equivalent value in gold. While gold is useful for expressing equivalent value, carrying it around and circulating it can be cumbersome, which brings us to paper money. Paper money was once the representation of real gold held in a bank, but now it is a representation of floating value contained in a bundled commodity index. As a universal equivalent, the money commodity can be exchanged with any other commodity and express any another commodity’s value. Here’s the takeaway: after money generalizes the exchange of commodities, money seems solely an expression of value rather than of use-value (as a useful piece of colored paper with numbers on it, for example). Marx makes a further observation of the way the commodity’s internal duality is expressed externally: The internal opposition between use-value and value, hidden within the commodity, is therefore represented on the surface by an external opposition, i.e. by a relation between two commodities such that the one commodity, whose own value is supposed to be expressed, counts directly only as a use-value, whereas the other commodity, in which that value is to be expressed, counts directly only as exchange-value. Hence, the simple form of value of a commodity is the simple form of the appearance of the opposition between use-value and value which is contained within the commodity. 53 What this means is that the duality of use-value and value, which are internal characteristics of the commodity, are expressed externally as an opposition between commodities and money. The social consequences of how a binary rather than dialectical view of use-value and value is such that the use-value dimension appears empirically-grounded while the latter, value dimension appears ephemeral or abstract. Specifically, the dialectical tension between value and use-value in the commodity requires that its dual character be materially externalized in the value form, where it appears “doubled” as money (the manifest form of value) and the commodity (the manifest form of use-value). The effect of this externalization, as Postone elaborates, is that “the commodity, although it is a social form expressing both value and use-value, appears to contain only the latter, i.e., appears as purely material and ‘thingly’ ; money, on the other hand, then appears to be the sole repository of value , i.e., as the manifestation of the purely abstract, rather than as the externalized manifest form of the value dimension of the commodity itself.” 54 The point here is that even though a fork and money are both commodities that internalize use-value and value, the fork appears only as a concrete “thingly” use-value and the money as an abstract source of value. This illusory opposition is at the core of the commodity fetish, which disguises the actual basis of value, which is “socially necessary labor time.” A key aspect of the fetish, then, is the mystification of capitalist social relations that present themselves antinomically, as the opposition of the abstract and concrete . Within this antinomy, the social relations specific to capitalism appear as an opposition between the concreteness of labor, commodities, and nature, on one hand, and the abstractness of money and finance, on the other. Moreover, within this fetishistic antinomy, the very origins of value—socially necessary labor time—are completely repressed. In the nineteenth century, we can see how the social consequences of this antinomical view of capitalist social relations emerge and take on racial significance. As capitalism underwent rapid expansion, the externalization of abstract and concrete forms intrinsic to the commodity fetish became increasingly biologized and racialized in concert with prevailing socioscientific conceptions of the world. The proliferation of scientific racism with the rise of social Darwinism in the late nineteenth century is an example of how society and historical development were increasingly understood in biological terms, moving from a more mechanical or typological worldview in which events were a reflection of divine power and design to a more secularized, biologized worldview that naturalized an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Enduring features of romanticism, the aesthetic movement that emerged in the nineteenth century, exhibit such a biologized worldview in its human (and often racial and national) identification with the purity of the natural world, portrayed as the valorized antithesis to the negative influences of urbanization and industrialization. From the antimaterialism expressed in Henry David Thoreau’s excursion to Walden Pond in the nineteenth century to Christopher McCandless’s 1992 divestment of all symbols of material wealth—even setting fire to his remaining cash—for a life in the wilderness, 55 we can discern a romantic attachment to a revitalizing and pure construction of an unchanging nature, in contrast to the alienation attributed to capitalist modernity. Expressing the antinomy of concrete and abstract, nature therefore personifies concrete, perfected human relations against the social degeneration caused by the abstract circuits of capitalism. This antinomical view of capitalism finds acute biologized expression in the context of anti-Semitism. During Germany’s rapid industrialization in the nineteenth century, Jews were perceived as an all-powerful international conspiracy that orchestrated capitalism. Jews not only were identified with money but became a personification of the destructive nature and abstract domination of capital. In other words, the concrete side of this antinomy was naturalized and biologized as real, hardworking Germans. German labor and machines were glorified as concrete “counter principles to the abstract.” 56 Alternatively, the manifest abstract dimension of money and finance became biologized as the Jews. As Postone explains, “Jews were not merely identified with money, with the sphere of circulation, but with capitalism itself.” 57 Jews came to personify the “intangible, destructive, immensely powerful and international domination of capital as a social form.” 58 His insight here is to identify an anticapitalist element of National Socialism that, in misrecognizing the role of the antinomy in capitalism, strove to evacuate the world of the abstract dimensions of capitalism, which was seen as the source of all evil and oppression in the world. Jews were identified as controllers of money and thus misidentified as responsible for capitalism’s oppression, a misperception based on the erroneous notion that capitalist oppression was caused by money—despite the reality that money and commodity forms are relative expressions of value determined by socially necessary labor time. 59 Thus even though Jews were citizens, citizenship was once again deemed politically abstract compared to the more concrete notion of the nation defined by “common language, history, tradition, and religions.” 60 As Postone observes, “The only group in Europe which fulfilled the determination of citizenship as a purely political abstraction, were Jews following political emancipation in the nineteenth century. They were German or French citizens, but they were not really Germans or Frenchmen.” 61 Instead, they were of the nation only “abstractly, not concretely,” which was ultimately a fatal relation to the scourge of “capitalism” and the bourgeois state. Thus anti-Semitism solves a problem of representation by incorporating an aesthetic dimension that gives human form to the abstract circuits of capitalism. 62 As the controversy over the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill suggests, Asians too are associated with an abstract dimension of capitalism, but in a different sense. In the case of Jews, their conflation with the abstract domination of capitalism derived from their segregation in financial sectors of the economy. Alternatively, Asians have personified the abstract dimensions of capitalism through labor time . In the nineteenth-century context of Chinese railroad building in North America, the subject of chapter 1 , the connection between the Chinese and the abstract domination of capitalism evolved through their identification with a mode of efficiency that was aligned with a perverse temporality of domestic and social reproduction. In other words, the Chinese personified the quantitative sphere of abstract labor, which threatened the concrete, qualitative sphere of white labor’s social reproduction. It is from this view of labor’s socially mediating role that each chapter explores a different aspect of dominant settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism that triangulates Indigenous, alien, and settler positions. Settler colonialism reinforces this triangulation through a fundamental misperception of capitalism as an opposition between a concrete natural world and a destructively abstract, value-driven one that is personified as Asian. In the sections that follow I clarify the racial interplay of settler colonial exclusion and elimination that frames my analysis of Asian North America and the personification of capitalism. Settler Colonialism, or Postcolonial Colonialism In this book I make the claim that the racialization of capitalism emerges from the particular contours of settler colonialism in North America whose conditions are distinct from the geopolitical context out of which modern anti-Semitism arose in Europe. At its core, settler colonialism reflects the common social, cultural, and political racial destiny of a transnational configuration that Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds refer to simply as “white men’s countries.” 63 Beginning in the nineteenth century, the spread of whiteness in nations bordering the Pacific was “a transnational form of racial identification [that was] at once global in its power and personal in its meaning, the basis of geo-political alliance and a subjective sense of self.” 64 It was against the backdrop of Indigenous dispossession and the “problem” of Asian migration that settler colonial expansion could be justified through ideologies of liberal democracy. As Adam McKeown notes of the benevolence with which border controls were implemented, “The controls were created by white settler nations around the Pacific that saw themselves as the forefront of the liberal freedoms of the nineteenth century. . . . Modern border controls are not a remnant of an ‘illiberal’ political tradition, but a product of self-conscious pioneers of political freedoms and self-rule.” 65 Thus the patterns of Indigenous decimation and dispossession, racialized labor recruitment and exploitation, immigrant restriction, and internment are evolving elements that tie Canada and the United States to a racial destiny shared by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Indeed, as Lothrop Stoddard, a xenophobic proponent of transnational solidarity among white settler colonies, put it in the 1920s: “Nothing is more striking than the instinctive and instantaneous solidarity which binds together Australians and Afrikanders, Californians and Canadians, into a ‘sacred union’ at the mere whisper of Asiatic migration.” 66 The corresponding features of Asian racialization in settler colonies capture the moving spirit of settler colonialism: a formation that is transnational but distinctively national, similar but definitely not the same, repetitive but without a predictable rhythm, structural but highly susceptible to change, everywhere but hard to isolate. This is what we might call the music of settler colonialism. It is from the past, but never stops playing. Until recently, white settler colonialism has received far less attention than its “postcolonial” counterpart among the multiplicity of colonial configurations, past and present. 67 On one hand, postcolonialism is the term that has often been applied to franchise colonies—British India or the Dutch East Indies, for instance—regions where economic exploitation occurred without large-scale white settlement. While the postcolonial condition remains a nuanced subject of theoretical debate in terms of its history and enduring social, economic, and cultural impact, the formal end of British and Dutch imperial rule and colonial administration in the late 1940s initiated a complex process of decolonization that was encoded into the “post-” of postcolonialism. Settler colonialism, on the other hand, is effectively immune to the process of decolonization. As Ian Tyrell explains, “Settler societies represented a particularly complex and resilient form of European colonial expansion often not recognized as imperial conquest by its own agents precisely because they claimed to do more than extract wealth and then return to the metropolitan space.” 68 They are “breakaway” colonies insofar as they transfer the power of the metropolitan center to the periphery, subverting a normative logic of colonialism. 69 In the establishing of settler colonies, the primary objective was land acquisition, as Patrick Wolfe points out, rather than the surplus value gained by mixing Native labor with it. 70 Because white settlement was an intentional aspect of colonization in British North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, neither the revolutionary nor the nonrevolutionary processes of detaching from British imperial rule—becoming “postcolonial,” as it were—significantly altered or ended the colonial relationship between settlers and the Indigenous population. In many ways, as Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler reflect on the irony of revolutionary settler independence movements like the United States’, “settler counter-imperialism cannot, in any sense, be considered of an emancipatory nature, but rather as a defense for atavistic forms of exploitation which by this token take on a politically anachronistic stature as well.” 71 Therefore, in settler colonies, the diminishing role of an imperial metropole facilitated successive stages of Indigenous conquest that involved invasion, removal, relocation, reservation, assimilation, termination, 72 co-optation, and self-determination. This renders a paradoxical situation where, as Robert Young describes it, “the postcolonial operates simultaneously as the colonial.” 73 In other words, what Taiaiake Alfred calls a “paradigm of post-colonial colonialism” 74 is thus a defining feature of contemporary settler colonialism in North America. Triangulating Settler Colonialism While Asians have not held any prominence in popular media projections of settler national culture, which often erases or figuratively disguises Asians as infiltrating replicants or alien invaders, 75 the opposite has been true for Indigenous identities. As Scott Lauria Morgensen explains, the settler colonial imaginary is continually underwritten by Indigenous tropes that convey settler “conquest and incorporation of primitivity.” 76 Much like the way the 2011 feature film Cowboys and Aliens aligns cowboys and Indians with each other against an invading, technologically superior alien population—read Asian—settler identity is heavily invested in appropriating Indigeneity. This is a mode of white settler identification that Shari Huhndorf calls “going Native,” 77 which functions to cover over colonial invasion and reimagine a natural affiliation to the land. The erasure of the alien and the romantic identification with the Native are two sides of the settler colonial coin. By mapping out the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions, this book moves beyond a binary theory of settler colonialism, which is predominantly structured around an opposition between Indigenous peoples and settlers. While scholarship on the settler-Indigenous dialectic has been tremendously valuable, it often falls short of clarifying the role that nonwhite migration plays within such a framework or how it intersects with other aspects of white supremacy. Reflecting on what she calls the “indigenous-settler binary,” Andrea Smith similarly cautions that this “binary certainly exists, [but] our analysis of it is insufficient if not intersected with other logics of white supremacy.” 78 In particular, key questions over the status or role that racialized migrants play within white settler colonialism often remain unasked or avoided. In a binary framework of settler colonialism—where one is either a settler or an Indigenous person—are slaves, indentured laborers, or refugees “settlers,” despite the involuntary context of their migration to North America? If we observe Jared Sexton’s claim that “no amount of tortured logic could permit the analogy to be drawn between a former slave population and an immigrant population, no matter how low-flung the latter group,” 79 do descendants of slaves exceed the conceptualization of migrants more generally? These questions highlight some of the uncertainty that surrounds the nonwhite “alien” and the role of race within settler colonialism. As the cases below signal, slavery and the abject condition of blackness complicate a straightforward approach to settler colonialism organized around a central opposition between settlers and Indigenous peoples. More directly, the “settler” classification collapses important racial distinctions between various contexts of voluntary and forced migration into one homogeneous group of “occupiers.” Recent studies of settler colonialism that have given attention to Asian or other nonwhite, non-Indigenous cultures have often distinguished settler identity by the degree to which migration is intentional. Writing about Canadian settler imperialism, for example, Adam Barker notes the changing provenance of settlers: “[They are] often people of European descent, but in the contemporary sense Settler increasingly includes peoples from around the globe who intentionally come to live in occupied Indigenous territories to seek enhanced privileges.” 80 In essence, settler identity—regardless of race—is predicated on the intentionality of migration. For those who may not have intended to migrate, however, Barker is more circumspect: “Attempts to integrate discussions of hybrid identities (such as the descendants of African peoples brought to the Americas against their will, many refugees, or Settler Muslims who are increasingly targeted by the state and other racist Settlers) with Settler and Indigenous identities are complicated and beyond the scope of this inquiry.” 81 Complicating Barker’s view of voluntarism, Jodi Byrd’s theorization of settler colonialism accounts for the involuntary conditions of migration. She offers the term arrivant “to signify those people forced into the Americas through the violence of European and Anglo-American colonialism and imperialism around the globe.” 82 For Byrd, structures of coerced migration distinguish the arrivant from the settler. Alternatively, Patrick Wolfe forcefully opposes voluntaristic approaches that attempt to differentiate the settler from coerced migrant populations such as slaves. He maintains that “the opposition between Native and settler is a structural relationship rather than an effect of the will. . . . Neither I nor other settlers can will our way out of it, whether we want to or not.” 83 In particular, he draws on the Australian context in which unfree white convict labor was imported from Britain in order to pose the rhetorical question, “Does this mean that their descendants are not settlers?” 84 Given that Wolfe concedes that white convicts in Australia did not pass on the condition of their criminality to their offspring, this example fails as a comparative equivalent to a US history of African slavery. The very content of black racialization has been based on the exclusive and transferable condition of racial slavery. Moreover, in claiming that settler identity applies even to “enslaved people [who] immigrated against their will,” Wolfe implicitly preserves the voluntarism that he otherwise rejects in his construction of the slave as an “immigrant.” Such references to immigration project a set of voluntaristic assumptions onto widely divergent conditions of voluntary and forced migration that are central features of the United States’ specific configuration as a settler colony. In the contemporary context, the racialized vulnerability to deportation of undocumented, guest-worker, or other provisional migrant populations similarly exceed the conceptual boundaries that attend “the immigrant.” Our awareness of these distinctions does not absolve any of these groups from being willing or unwitting participants in a settler colonial structure that is driven to eliminate Indigenous people. However, folding them into a generalized settler position through voluntaristic assumptions constrains our ability to understand how their racialized vulnerability and disposability supports a settler colonial project. The most unequivocal work to define Asian migrants as “settlers of color” is the edited volume Asian Settler Colonialism: From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawai‘i . Referring specifically to Asian Americans in Hawai‘i, editor Candace Fujikane states clearly that “all Asians, including those who don’t have political power, are identified in this book as settlers who participate in US settler colonialism.” 85 Acknowledging the historical exploitation of Asian plantation labor in Hawai‘i, she argues that it is equally important to acknowledge the “ways that they [Asian migrants and their descendants] are beneficiaries of US settler colonialism” and how “early Asian settlers were both active agents in the making of their own histories and unwitting recruits swept into the service of empire.” 86 In this formulation it is not necessary for migrants of color to migrate “intentionally” to become settlers; rather, settler status is a mixture of both self-determination and structural contingency . As Fujikane puts it succinctly, “Colonial intent [does not] define the status of Asians as settlers but rather the historical context of US colonialism for which they unknowingly became a part.” 87 Furthermore, she also dispels the notion that Asians represent a “third space” outside the Indigenous-settler dialectic. She admits her previous subscription to this idea, but explains her change of thinking as follows: I was attempting to create a “third space” for Asians as another category of the oppressed in Hawai‘i. The attempt to ally [Asian] “locals” with “Natives,” however, created the illusion of a “shared” struggle without acknowledging that Asians have come to constitute the very political system that has taken away from Natives their rights as indigenous peoples. 88 In this view, given the political power that Asian Americans currently enjoy in Hawai‘i, they cannot be said to represent a stable third space that is exempted from the settler-Indigenous dialectic or positioned “with” Indigenous peoples and “against” settlers. While attributing a settler identity to Asians may be germane in a demographic context such as Hawai‘i, it nevertheless remains unclear whether such a settler identity is generalizable to the situation of Asian immigrant formations that exist elsewhere. Even though Fujikane stresses that political and economical subordination does not exempt Asian ethnic groups from participating as settlers in a colonial system—particularly Filipinos 89 —her emphasis on Asian demographic majority, dominant political representation, and economic power in Hawai‘i emphasizes how political and economic authority are nonetheless dominant features of settler colonial identity. 90 The importance of economic and political leverage embedded in this characterization of settler identity may explain the absence, for example, of comparable discussions of “black settler colonialism.” A case in point is the postemancipation recruitment of black “Buffalo Soldiers” in anti-Indian wars in the western United States and during the Philippine-American War. 91 The Buffalo Soldiers are a clear example of an oppressed group’s unwitting (and sometimes unwilling) participation in settler colonialism and imperial invasion, yet the continued economic and political subjugation of African Americans seems to exempt them from most theorizing on settler colonialism, as a “third space” or otherwise. Thus the settler status of racialized migrants to Indigenous lands outside Hawai‘i remains undetermined. In some ways, the conundrum of positioning Asian North Americans within settler states highlights broader inconsistencies that mediate theories of Asian racialization in North America and the role of race in a settler colonial context. Speaking to the racial ambiguity evoked by Asians in the United States, Colleen Lye encapsulates the racial condition of Asian Americans as “racial, racialized, but lacking the certainty of a racial formation.” 92 Remarking upon the surfeit of articles and monographs that focus either on Afro-Asian interracial contexts or on how Asian Americans disrupt conceptualizations of race anchored by a foundational opposition between black and white, Lye continues to observe the uncertainty of Asian racialization: Asian America’s attenuated relation to racial conceptualization can be seen in the extent to which critical focus on the Asian American is so often couched in terms of “needing to move beyond race as a matter of black and white.” The Asian American is more easily evoked as a third term to trouble binary habits of racial classification and analysis than to illustrate the genuine multiplicity of racial logics and racisms. 93 From sophisticated approaches to Asian American racialization such as Claire Jean Kim’s theory of Asian America’s triangulated relation to black and white, to Susan Koshy’s conception of a single hierarchical axis in which Asian Americans have moved progressively away from a racialization associated with blackness toward an ethnicization associated with whiteness, most theories of Asian racialization rely, according to Lye, on the “historical agency of a racism that is foundationally antiblack.” 94 However, the problem with this approach is that it constrains our ability to elaborate the specificity of Asian racialization that isn’t merely a by-product of a foundational antiblackness. As it stands, what Lye calls an “Asian American analogical dependency” fails to clarify the way contemporary expressions of political liberalism and white supremacy seem to diverge so starkly from those of the late nineteenth century and, importantly, leaves unanswered whether contemporary “Asian American mobility confirms the persistent power of white privilege or whether it represents the detachment of whiteness’s symbolic power from material power.” 95 The Canadian context only adds to this racial uncertainty, since the absence of a similarly foundational system of racial slavery has not, as “analogical” arguments might suggest, led to divergent forms of anti-Asian racism in Canada. Indeed, the racialization of Asian Americans and Asian Canadians has unfolded as a parallel evolution of yellow peril to model minority—from immigrant restriction and segregation, wartime internment of Japanese civilians, to the 1960s-era liberalization of immigration policy. This mirrored arc of Asian racialization, therefore, cannot be entirely attributable to an inherited legacy or second-order version of antiblack racism given the absence of a similar regime of plantation-based slavery in Canada. This is not to say that structural antiblackness did not play a role in conditioning Canada’s entrance into capitalist modernity; rather, the similar pattern of policies directed at Asians in Canada and the United States indicates forces that exceed those that shape the social construction of blackness. 96 To put it another way, a transnational framework contradicts an understanding of anti-Asian racism as solely derivative of a prototypical racialization of blackness. As I will argue, the vicissitudes of racialization are grounded in settler colonial logics. This book presents a theory of settler colonialism in North America that operates as a triangulation of symbolic positions that include the Native, the alien, and the settler. The distinctions between alien and settler are by no means stable or fixed but are meant to emphasize the role of territorial entitlement that distinguish them. What initially distinguishes the settler from the alien migrant, as Lorenzo Veracini offers, is that “not all migrations are settler migrations.” 97 This is both poignantly true and, for African slaves, a profound understatement. As Frank Wilderson describes transatlantic slavery, “From the very beginning, we were meant to be accumulated and die.” 98 Alternatively, on the other end of the spectrum, the alien may not only be complicit with the settler colonial regime but may eventually inherit its sense of sovereign territorial right, such as Asian settlers in Hawai‘i. 99 Acknowledging these inconsistencies, what I demonstrate in this book is that for slaves and racialized migrants, the degree of forced or voluntary migration or level of complicity with the settler state is ultimately secondary to their subordination under a setter colonial mode of production driven by the proprietorial logics of whiteness. In this light, highly differentiated populations of African slaves and Asian migrants historically represented alien rather than settler migrations. This shared status in no way implies an equivalence in the heterogeneous racial experience of African slaves and Asian migrants. Instead, it clarifies their historical relationship to North American land, which was as exclusive and excludable alien labor forces. Their unsovereign alien status was a precondition of their exploitation and intersects with the multiple economic logics that require and reproduce alien-ness in settler colonies. While African slaves represented a system of forced migration, unfree alien labor, and property—a form of biopolitical life that was “market alienable” 100 —the later recruitment of indentured and “free” Chinese labor incorporated provisionality, excludability, and deportability into the notion of alien-ness. The heterogeneously racialized alien is a unique innovation of settler colonialism. Race is thus an organizing principle of settler colonialism in North America, a principle that we neglect at the risk of relegating African slaves “to the position of the unthought” 101 and obscuring the persistence and evolution of Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation, where “conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part.” 102 The governing logic of white supremacy embedded in a settler colonial mode of production relies on and reproduces the exploitability, disposability, and symbolic extraterritoriality of a surplus alien labor force. Therefore, complicating an Indigenous-settler binary, this book’s focus on the settler colonial alien follows Byrd’s method of “disrupt[ing] the dialectics of settler/native, master/slave, colonizer/colonized.” 103 As I attempt to clarify below, what remains fundamental to this triangulated articulation of settler colonialism is how land and labor are constitutive features of heterogeneous processes of settler colonial racialization. Indigenous Land, Alien Labor The triangulation of Native, alien, and settler populations comes into view when we examine two subjects who are the most racially antithetical to one another: the African American alien and the Native North American. While some have argued that a race-based framework potentially subsumes the critical importance of Indigenous sovereignty, 104 this exploration highlights the role that land—and land sovereignty—plays in Indigenous racial formation and what Alfred refers to as the “racism that is the foundation and core of all colonial countries.” 105 As Patrick Wolfe highlights, the logics of exclusion and elimination have profoundly shaped the distinct racial destinies of colonized groups. In this formulation, the logic of exclusion operates as a barrier within national culture to protect and reinforce settlers’ social and political control. De jure and de facto practices of segregation, disenfranchisement, exclusion, exploitation, police brutality, detention, and imprisonment are some of the ways that the settler state asserts and maintains control over an internalized alien population. On the other hand, the logic of elimination is driven to eradicate an Indigenous population rather than controlling it through various exclusionary measures. Genocide and biological absorption are two contradictory—but complementary—means of extinguishing an Indigenous population: the first attempts to kill the population off, the second assimilates them out of existence. 106 It is worth pausing here to emphasize the dire consequences of assimilation for Indigenous populations, a process that may seem benign or even beneficial to other racialized groups. As Katherine Ellinghaus clarifies, “One of the outcomes of acknowledging the links between miscegenation, assimilation policies, and genocide is . . . an acknowledgment of the underlying biological, physical, bloody aspects of assimilation policies that demonstrate the terrifying resolve of settler governments to rid themselves of the Aboriginal or Indian problem one way or another.” 107 Exclusion and elimination are not discrete logics but operate on a moving spectrum of biopolitical violence. For instance, a logic of exclusion applied to Indigenous peoples, who were conferred US citizenship in 1924 but were still denied the right to vote in many states. 108 In Canada, a logic of exclusion denied the franchise to Indigenous nations until 1958, while a logic of elimination rendered this right of citizenship conditional on the abandonment of “Indian Status” and accompanying right to live on a reservation. In both Canada and the United States, logics of exclusion and elimination inform how Indigenous peoples are incarcerated at higher rates than other groups. 109 While these examples demonstrate how these logics often work in tandem, for Indigenous peoples a logic of exclusion is underscored by an overarching logic of elimination. For aliens, similarly, the eliminatory logics expressed through police-initiated murder or death-penalty sentencing of black men are tactics that simultaneously reinforce the exclusion and exclusivity of blackness. 110 In the following section I clarify how these logics operate when land and labor are at stake in the settler colony. My focus on the comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans draws more heavily on the United States than on Canada because the former has a longer national history, and that history presents a foundation that illuminates subsequent racial developments in both countries. Historically, a distinctive feature of settler colonialism was that the primary objective of settlers was to appropriate land alone rather than appropriate Indigenous labor to expropriate that land’s resources. This distinguishes settler colonialism from franchise colonialism—in British India, for example—where Indigenous labor was exploited to produce commodities and extract the land’s wealth. Wolfe explains, “Settler colonialism seeks to replace the natives on their land rather than extract surplus value by mixing their labor with a colony’s natural resources.” 111 Therefore the primary logic of settler colonialism is one of elimination, and land establishes the relationship Indigenous peoples have with the colonizer. This is not to say that Indigenous people either never constituted a labor force or have ceased to be one. Rather, while there are numerous historical examples of Indigenous labor in settler colonies, from factory work in canneries in British Columbia to Alaska, Indigenous recruitment into surplus labor (the subject of chapter 3 ) occurs “in spite of rather than as a result of the primary tendency of settler-colonial policy.” 112 This logic of elimination helps to contextualize the sequence of actions directed at Indigenous peoples whose primary objective was extermination. A snapshot of these directives in the United States include eastern removal; genocidal actions taken by the US Cavalry; the 1877 Dawes Severalty Act, which turned tribes into individual property owners and resulted in the loss of two-thirds of Indigenous land; assimilationist policies of urban relocation and boarding schools (“residential schools” in Canada); and policy on Indigenous “self-determination.” Despite the rhetorical shift in settler discourse that now celebrates Indigenous self-determination as fully incorporated citizens of the settler state through a discourse of reconciliation, this has largely involved implementing federal rather than Indigenous Nation–specific policies. As Glen Coulthard explains, “Although the semantics of the comprehensive claims policy have changed, the legal and political outcomes remain the same.” 113 Further, Federal Indian Identification Policy functions as a form of what Annette Jaimes terms “statistical elimination”: 114 the effective meaning of the state’s definition of “Indian” as a minimum of one-quarter blood quantum is that through intermarriage, Indians will eventually “be defined out of existence.” 115 In the Canadian context, Karrmen Crey refers to this form of racial engineering as the “two-generation cutoff.” 116 Thus if elimination meant physical relocation and/or death in the period preceding the implementation of the Dawes Act, elimination came to mean absorption in the period following it. While policy history in Canada differs, the spirit of elimination does not. 117 And though the treaty process remains subject to negotiation in Canada while Indigenous nations in the United States have sovereignty, the predictable and ongoing process of treaty revision and violation indicates that treaties function as strategic forms of state accommodation designed to appease rather than to concede blame or to compensate. 118 Despite formal differences, the practice of settler colonial elimination is more consistent in the two nations than not. If the primary relationship between settler colonizers and Indigenous populations is land, in the case of African slaves transported to the United States it is labor . Rather than exhibiting a governing logic of elimination, a logic of racial exclusion clarifies the form of colonial exploitation experienced by African Americans in antebellum and postemancipation contexts. Because the relationship between colonizers and slaves was primarily based on labor, the objective was not to eliminate that population but to increase it and, by extension, increase the property value of that exclusive labor force. Consequently, a logic of exclusion applies insofar as slavery was an inherited condition, which made blackness equivalent to slavery and racial admixture assignable to it. Distinguishing the logic of elimination and exclusion, Wolfe explains that whereas Indigenous women “became conduits to whiteness . . . black women came to augment white men’s property by incubating the additional slaves whom they fathered.” 119 While this logic of exclusion functioned to reproduce and grow a discrete population of slaves who became synonymous with the condition of blackness, blackness was not the only condition for enslaveability. For instance, Indigenous peoples were also enslaveable, a lesson that Spanish colonialism in Mexico teaches us. In the most successful regimes of slavery, however, among the most important features that rendered Africans most vulnerable to enslavement was their alienation , “not just the natal alienation that Orlando Patterson has made famous, since indigenous societies . . . have also had their children taken away, but the spatial alienation that slave transportation effected.” 120 The spatial alienation experienced by African slaves made them a more manageable population to control, to thwart insurrection and overthrow, and to prevent from escaping. This form of alienation therefore helps to distinguish, in the case of African Americans, the “alien” position from the Native and settler in a triangular framework. In the United States, African Americans are the original aliens. In the post–Civil War context, race came into full emergence; it was rooted in slavery but came to life during the shift to black emancipation. Not only did Reconstruction put whiteness into crisis—whiteness was also threatened by non-Anglo-Saxon immigration of Jews and southern and eastern Europeans. Shifting the terms of the logic of exclusion, race reinforced the barrier between whites and blacks that the institution of slavery formerly performed. In other words, race became amplified with the downfall of slavery because racial domination was an implicit feature of slavery. However, in the wake of emancipation and without the barrier of slavery to designate free from unfree labor, race became unambiguously natural, reinforcing an exclusively racial division between black and white populations. By extension, without the barrier that slavery performed, whiteness became the basis of racialized privilege after emancipation. What is significant is that emancipation reproduced for African Americans an anomalous condition that similarly characterized the experience of postfrontier “incorporated” Indigenous Nations. Although freed slaves did not become anomalous as labor—in the South they continued to represent a cheap and hyperexploitable labor force—they became, as Wolfe puts it, “juridically anomalous as equals.” 121 Since the settler colonial solution was to eliminate anomalous postfrontier Indigenous peoples through racial absorption, a key question arises: Why didn’t newly freed and anomalous African Americans follow the assimilative racialization of Indigenous peoples and become similarly “eliminated”? Historical attempts to colonize African Americans abroad or assimilate them into the white population point to endeavors to apply a logic of elimination to African Americans. However, given the socially engineered disproportion in the size of the black population vis-à-vis the Indigenous population, neither attempt was practical or, in the case of assimilation, imaginable. Elaborating on the difference between the population of post-emancipated slaves and Indigenous nations, Wolfe highlights the biopolitics of settler colonialism and its “calculated management of life”: 122 In this case, it represents the difference between one group of people who had survived a centuries-long genocidal catastrophe with correspondingly depleted numbers and another group who, as commodities had been preserved, their reproduction constituting a singularly primitive form of accumulation for their owners. 123 The hereditary nature of slavery, which fused slavery to blackness, was thus carried over into the postemancipation context to fuse blackness to an “unlimited power to contaminate.” Given that emancipated African Americans were neither “immigrants” who could be deported nor a population that could be eliminated through biological absorption, African Americans became an undisposable alien labor population, which accounts for the intensity through which subsequent generations of African Americans have been subject to a logic of exclusion where the only means of disposal is death. Furthermore, the force through which blackness was excluded during the Jim Crow era highlights a broader consolidation of whiteness—of Anglo-Saxons and Protestants at first, and eventually extending to other European ethnics 124 —and intensified nation-building in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In both Canada and the United States, “white nationalism” was the ideological and policy response to nonwhite immigration and black incorporation. The comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans highlights the heterogeneity of race that is anchored by a foundational distinction between land and labor. For Indigenous peoples of North America, race was always subject to dilution and disappearance. In both Canada and the United States, the biological constitution of Indigenous peoples was determined assimilable to whiteness. Describing this evolution in the logic of elimination, Wolfe explains that “mixed-bloodedness became the post-frontier version of the vanishing Indian.” 125 For African Americans, on the other hand, the “one-drop rule” relegated to blackness a biological permanence that would survive any amount of interracial mixing. Whereas mixed or light-skinned African Americans who passed as white frustrated the settler colonial racial regime, Indigenous people who assimilated to whiteness upheld it. Similarly, while Jim Crow and antimiscegenation laws kept the line between blacks and whites from blurring, interracial mixing was not only tolerated among Indigenous people but was often actively encouraged through policy. In the United States, the practice of “checkerboarding” during the administration of the Dawes Act (1887–1934) interpenetrated Indigenous reservations with white allotments to promote intermarriage and decrease eligible heirs to Native Title. 126 In Canada, prior to changes to the Indian Act in 1985, Indigenous women were “rewarded” with the loss of their status as “Registered Indians” for the prize of a white identity, not only if they married non-Native but non-Status men. 127 As distinct as these black and Native racial formations appear, they were still bound together by an overarching economic rationale of settler colonialism. First, for each group, race became more salient during the rise and development of industrial capitalism. For Indigenous nations, the logic of elimination became aggressively implemented as trading posts were eclipsed by industrial forms of economic production. In Canada, for instance, James Tulley explains that “the end of the British and French wars rendered the military alliances with the First Nations irrelevant. The shift from trade to settled agriculture and manufacture caused the trading treaties to decline . . . undermining Aboriginal economies and forcing Aboriginal peoples into relations of dependency.” 128 Being rendered anomalous by industrial modes of production thus signals the full onset of settler colonialism and, with it, a racial logic of elimination. In the case of African American slaves, their emancipation was contextualized by the growing challenges to plantation-based economies and the increasing demand for flexible, free labor for the emerging industrial economy. While plantation capitalism was still highly profitable before the Civil War, Southern plantations were increasingly challenged by their need to expand production into non-slave-holding states. 129 Nevertheless, in the absence of slavery, new demands of the industrial economy rendered postemancipation African Americans anomalous as people and gave rise to an intensified notion of race as a regime of social control. From the view of capitalist expansion that lies at the heart of settler colonialism, the divergent forms of racialization that Indigenous peoples of North America and African Americans have been subject to are entirely reconcilable. As Wolfe puts it unequivocally: “The simple undifferentiated product of the encounter between African labor and Indian law was European property.” 130 Mixing alien labor with Indigenous land to expand white property was the basis and objective of settler colonialism. Disposable/Undisposable Alien Labor and the Heterogeneity of Race As migrants to North America, Asians’ primary relationship to settler colonizers was historically based on labor. Similar to African Americans, Asians represented an alien labor force that mixed with Indigenous land to transform it into white property and capital. What comes to light from this framework is, yet again, the heterogeneity of race under settler colonialism. Rather than presenting a derivative model of Asian racialization that is based on a prototypical antiblackness, the vicissitudes of Asian racialization are primarily shaped by the evolving economic landscape of settler colonialism within a global economy. While African Americans and Asian North Americans share an alien status in a triangular framework, the divergent historical and economic contexts of Asian and African labor highlight the heterogeneity contained within an alien position. Asian labor migration to North America, as well as elsewhere in the Americas, occurred during the demise of plantation-based slave economies, a decline that began in the 1830s. Given shifting requirements of industrializing economies, which demanded a flexible rather than enslaved labor force, the economic context of Asian labor migration in the nineteenth century inoculated Asians from assuming the status of unfree labor. This distinction renders Asian aliens highly dependent, nevertheless, on the class of settler capitalists. This means, as Biermann and Kössler clarify, that “the migrant workers are not personally free, [although] their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 131 In addition, as Moon-Ho Jung explains, the historical importation of indentured Chinese labors to replace or supplement slave labor in the US South represented a period of dramatically destabilized labor relations that introduced new and reinvigorated conceptualizations of race and nation. 132 In this tumultuous economic context, Chinese labor migrants would assume none of the hereditary stain of slavery that defined blackness before emancipation or hereditary racialization that determined African American exclusion afterward. While the presence of African American slave labor was an important context for subsequent Asian-settler labor relations in the United States, the Canadian context demonstrates that parallel expressions of Asian racialization were not wholly contingent on the prior enslavement of black people; rather, they were overwhelmingly conditioned by industrial capitalism. Therefore, in the absence of plantation-based African slavery in Canada, the common denominator of Chinese laborers’ analogous experiences of exploitation and exclusion was their alien status rather than their proximity to a racialized notion of blackness. Because the industrial economy that Asian labor served did not require a permanent, reproducible, exclusive, and violently contained population of alien labor, as was the case under US slavery, the exclusionary tactics that Asians were subjected to never approximated those experienced by black slaves. 133 The projection of Asianness as a racial signifier of indelible, exclusively transferable attributes was less necessary as a strategy of containment. Unlike emancipated slaves, Asians could be excluded and eliminated from the nation-state. If the rise of industrial capitalism solidified biological notions of race that subjected Indigenous populations to eliminatory assimilation on the basis of the mutability of their blood, and black populations to Jim Crow exclusion based on the contaminating reach of their blood, the logic of exclusion ascribed alien-ness and spatial vulnerability not simply to Asian blood but to the entire Asian body. Because Asian bodies could be entirely excluded from the nation-state, Asian labor was susceptible to more volatile forms of domestic exclusion than those experienced by African Americans. As a result, the history of domestic segregation and antimiscegenation laws targeting Asians in North America—evoked by racial fears of biological contamination and contagion 134 —was more uneven than its African American counterpart. 135 A much more effective means of exclusion was through immigration control. A form of Jim Crow in a transnational context, immigration policy not only determined entry into the nation but could legally bar an immigrant from naturalizing, voting, owning and transferring property, and working. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds observe, “In drawing the global colour line, immigration restriction became a version of racial segregation on an international scale.” 136 To the extent that Asians were restricted or excluded from coming to North America until the mid-1960s, and because their deportability constituted a form of what David Hernández calls “lesser citizenship,” 137 the logic of exclusion employed the national border to segregate populations and maintain social control. In a settler colonial context, these variable, exclusionary logics have resulted in the heterogeneous racialization of the alien: the African American, whose indisposability in the settler state requires a heightened form of racialized exclusion as a form of domestic social control, and the Asian North American, whose disposability from the settler state produces a less fixed and more volatile racialization by virtue of the exclusionary power of immigration restriction. In this framework of abstract labor, Asian North Americans may appear “less racial”—to adapt Lye’s language—than African Americans or Indigenous populations, whose racial essences were expressed in the relative power of blood to contaminate or to erase a population, respectively. However, if Asian racialization produced a less blood-defined racial body, it is by virtue of the exclusionary, segregationist logics that were carried out in the extraterritorial arena of immigration control that inhibited Asian exposure to more sustained domestic logics of racial exclusion and elimination. In this context, race is not only a heterogeneous formation; it is also an expression of settler power whose capacity to racialize is not, as Jodi Melamed suggests, “reducible to biology, identity, or ontology.” 138 These factors laid the settler colonial groundwork for an understanding of the abstract racialization of the Asian alien that form this book’s central concern. While a logic of elimination functions to increase white property through the decimation of Indigenous populations who stand in the way of territorial expansion, a logic of exclusion serves industrial capitalism by furnishing a vulnerable labor force whose existence could be managed at the border. Bearing some similarity to the spatial segregation of prison inmates from inner cities, the border represents a geographical solution to manage surplus populations. 139 This focus does not discount the many other exercises of racialized domestic social control, which prevented, denied, or rescinded access to naturalization, labor, the franchise, property ownership, and, in the case of Japanese North American citizens interned during World War II, due process or freedom of mobility. My point is that each of these modes of domestic racial control served a broader logic of exclusion that is inherent in immigration restriction: to underscore and preserve Asians’ alien status by creating policy that exploited the volatility of an Asian presence. From the perspective of settler colonialism, we can build on this framework by clarifying the importance of spatial alienation (rather than Indigeneity) as a factor in the exploitation of a racialized labor force. In this light, a logic of exclusion is the prerequisite for the recruitment of alien labor, functioning either to reproduce an exclusive labor force in the case of African slaves or to render an Asian labor presence highly conditional to the demands of capital. Both are subject to forms of segregation, either on a national or international scale. As each of my chapters argues, this volatility is what makes it possible to view the Asian alien as the embodiment of the abstract evils of capitalism. By clarifying the evolving triangulation of Native, alien, and settler subject positions, my purpose has been to distinguish both the heterogeneity of race and the heterogeneity of alien racialization. This formation is uniquely tied to settler colonialism, which requires a disposable reserve army labor force. In the chapters that follow, I will situate this heterogeneous racial formation within a settler colonial logic of romantic anticapitalism that hypostatizes whiteness and sublates Asianness into abstract labor and the intangible, destructive dimension of capitalist relations. Chapter Overview In order to magnify the capitalist logics of settler colonialism that account for the striking parallels in US and Canadian policy directed at Asian ethnic groups, this book’s transnational focus draws on corresponding racial policy making at key turning points since the nineteenth century: Chinese railroad labor in the 1880s and subsequent immigrant restriction laws; the expansion of anti-Asian immigration restrictions in the 1920s; the relocation and internment of Japanese civilians during and after World War II; and the late 1960s neoliberalization of immigration policy. Because one of my goals is to reframe these historical touchstones where Chinese and Japanese populations figured predominantly, the majority of my examples are limited to this East Asian scope. However, because my project is aimed at presenting a theorization of the abstract economism of the Asian alien in a settler colonial framework rather than emphasize the ethnic particularity of any one group, I have strived to construct a flexible rather than ethnically determined model that can be expanded and adapted to accommodate the specific historical circumstances of Asian populations not covered in the book. In each chapter I explore Asian North American cultural production as a genealogical archive. As such I draw from Michel Foucault’s distinction between history and genealogy, one shaped by his principle that “knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting.” 140 Rather than the traditional approach to history as a linear and unified development—“an acquisition, a possession that grows and solidifies”—a genealogy is an “unstable assemblage of faults, fissures, and heterogeneous layers that threaten the fragile inheritor from within or from underneath.” 141 As such, genealogy opens up what Foucault calls a countermemory: “a transformation of history into a totally different time.” 142 To the three modalities of counter-memory that he identifies as parodic, dissociative, and sacrificial reworkings of history, I would like to add a fourth, a “postmemory,” in order to call attention to the affective register of racial genealogies. As Marianne Hirsch defines it, postmemory is a “very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 143 She further distinguishes postmemory and memory as follows: Postmemory characterizes the experiences of those who grow up dominated by narratives that preceded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated. 144 Such a conceptualization of postmemory applies to the contemporary Asian North American cultural production I examine in the sense that these works present less of a direct or experiential connection to historical events than a collective consciousness of Asian American and Asian Canadians who have grown up with settler narratives of national identity and belonging that have relegated the Asian as other. I further adapt the notion of postmemory to indicate a form of future memory, a memory yet to come, to capture the simultaneously utopian and apocalyptic capitalist futurity explored in Asian North American reconfigurations of history. Given that my primary focus is on the economic modalities of Asian racialization that are tied to capitalism, my goal is to demonstrate how an Asian North American cultural genealogy of settler colonialism does not simply oppose this economism but, rather, opens it up for further exposure. Laid bare, the symbolic infrastructure of this economism provides a window into what Dipesh Chakrabarty terms History 2, the relations “whose reproduction does not contribute to the reproduction of the logic of capital . . . [even though they] can actually be intimately intertwined with the relations that do.” 145 History 2 expresses the potential of countermemory to subvert the social relations embedded in History 1 that reproduce the logic of capital. Most of the chapters in the book feature a dialogue between literary and visual texts. The multimedia nature of the archive that grounds my analysis of each historical episode aims to meet two objectives. First, a starting point for this book is an understanding that the ideological expression of white settler colonialism and anti-Asian sentiment in North America is a multimedia projection that has glorified whiteness in artistic constructions of landscape and delimited racial belonging in textual definitions of citizenship. Therefore the multimedia archive of Asian North American cultural production in this book is a response to both the literary and visual form of these constructions. Related to this, the visual works I incorporate attempt to address the predominance of mainstream film and television constructions of Asians that evoke untrustworthiness, mystery, or deceitfulness and collectively reinforce the destructive, unrepresentable abstraction attributed to Asian bodies. The mystery and treachery often reinforced through the visuality of Asians in popular media are distinctive because they always point to something invisible and unseen, suggesting that the negative content of Asian racialization is something that we can’t see. The visual culture presented in this book thus offers imaginative responses to the challenge of visualizing the unrepresentable. Each chapter explores how settler colonialism negatively aligns Asians with an abstract dimension of capitalism through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism—that is, through romantic anticapitalism’s misperception that social relations are defined either as concrete, natural, visible, and hence noncapitalist or abstract, unnatural, invisible, and hence capitalist. Such a misperception of capitalism presents an ideal ideology for rationalizing and forgetting the settler colonial elimination of Native peoples and exploitation of alien labor. Thus what romantic anticapitalism offers is an ideological framework for settler colonialism to respond to economic and technological crises by imagining whiteness through indigenizing tropes of purity and organic connection to land that function to distort and deflect responsibility for capitalist modernity. As such, each chapter examines the expression of white settler romantic anticapitalism both to indigenize whiteness and to align Asians with the threateningly abstract economism of capitalism. The first chapter, “Sex, Time, and the Transcontinental Railway: Abstract Labor and the Queer Temporalities of History 2,” establishes the book’s foundational claim that the economism of Asian racialization arises from a temporal alignment of Chinese bodies with abstract labor, which has implications for what constitutes socially necessary labor time. This “abstract” racialization is reinforced by romantic anticapitalism, which projects an antinomical character of capitalist social relations expressed as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions. I examine how romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, pure, and organic dimensions of white labor and leisure time, while identifying capitalism solely with the abstract dimensions of the antinomy, which is personified by Chinese labor. The chapter begins with a reflection on a nineteenth-century sketch of a Chinese laborer’s profile surrounded by financial figures drawn by William Van Horne, president of the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR ). My interpretation of the sketch, whose provocative nature the CPR itself underscored by not granting me permission to reproduce in this book, sets the stage for clarifying the sexualized intersection of race and capitalism. In taking this direction I adapt Postone’s theorization of the secular, anticapitalist dimensions of modern anti-Semitism for understanding anti-Asian sentiment. Analyzing Richard Fung’s Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes alongside Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men , two works about Chinese labor on the transcontinental railroad, I explore the identity—or sameness—relation between Chinese labor, time, and money. Focusing on the range of gender and sexual substitutions represented in these texts, I argue that these works demonstrate how the abstract racialization of Asian alien labor is established through their alignment with a perverse temporality. While Fung’s and Kingston’s works expose the fungibility of alien labor conditioned by biologized notions of time, they also point to the queer potential of History 2 that resides within abstract labor but does not reproduce the logic of capitalism. Moreover, their contemporary approach to this history highlights the ongoing construction of racialized abstraction in the era of globalization—the new nineteenth century—which is the subject of chapter 4 . The second chapter, “Unnatural Landscapes: Romantic Anticapitalism and Alien Degeneracy,” builds on the first chapter’s focus on the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations—personified by Chinese labor—by turning its attention to the concrete dimension of capitalist social relations personified in artistic depictions of the settler landscape. Turning to the photographs of Tseng Kwong Chi and Jin-me Yoon, I argue that their photographic citations of 1920s- and 1930s-era landscape art parody its romanticization of whiteness-as-nature during a heightened period of Asian immigrant restriction. In particular, Tseng and Yoon respond to themes of regenerative whiteness and autochthonophilia—a term that refers to a settler colonial desire for and identification with Indigeneity—personified in the majestic landscapes by American artists Ansel Adams and Gutzon Borglum and Canadian artists Emily Carr and the Group of Seven. Disidentifying with the romanticization of the concrete, purifying landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs expose the politics of whiteness invested in the identification with nature and Indigeneity. Further developing the theme of perversity associated with abstract labor in chapter 1 , Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs highlight how Asian bodies evolve to denote a degenerative, antinatural force associated with the abstract dimension of romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical social universe. Chapter 3 , “Japanese Internment and the Mutation of Labor,” focuses on the consequences of an increasingly unnatural, mechanical abstraction of Asian racialization developed in the previous chapters. To help contextualize the expulsion, internment, and, in the case of Japanese Canadians, postwar relocation east of the Rocky Mountains, I suggest that the modes of abstraction attributed to Japanese agriculture and fishing labor in the United States and Canada contributed to the false impression that Japanese labor held a destructive control over the creation of relative surplus-value. I suggest that Japanese internment is neither reducible to prior modalities of Asian immigrant exclusion nor a rational expression of white accumulation by racial dispossession. Instead, I argue that Japanese internment turns on the association of Japanese labor with the modernizing displacements of technological innovation, which fed a perception that Japanese labor monopolized the creation of relative surplus-value. The chapter probes how the destructive power of Japanese labor was resignified after West Coast expulsion and relocation. Focusing on Joy Kogawa’s novel Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s video-memoir History and Memory , I examine how symbolic identification with Jewish persecution before the war shifted toward an identification with Native identities after relocation. This cross-racial identification with Native contexts evokes the neutralization of Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value and reconstitution as an ideal surplus labor force. The fourth chapter, “The New Nineteenth Century: Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism,” examines the persistent and evolving economism of Asian racialization in the postexclusion era, after the United States and Canada removed race-based immigration criteria in 1965 and 1967, respectively. Turning to Ken Lum’s multimedia works, including his sculpture on the roof of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , along with Karen Tei Yamashita’s novel Tropic of Orange , I track their works’ reconceptualizations of labor, migration, and political consciousness. Their works point to the capacity of the neoliberal border to recruit and restrict surplus labor populations from around the world while preserving the racialized abstractions that surround both high-tech, flexible Asian labor and working-class labor. As such, free trade becomes a further conduit for the fungibility of bodies as capital across borders and the continuing perils of abstract labor associated with the “new Jew.” Far from symbolizing multicultural inclusion, I suggest that the border is a central motor for the expanded fulfillment of a settler colonial mode of production that relies on a disposable migrant labor system. The epilogue, “The Revenge of the Iron Chink,” offers a meditation on an exhibition featuring an early twentieth-century fish-gutting machine called the “Iron Chink” located in my hometown of Victoria, British Columbia, personifying a racist slur. To explore its contemporary significance I turn to artist Tommy Ting’s reanimation of the Iron Chink in his 2012 sculpture Machine (Iron Chink, invented in 1903, found at the Gulf of Georgia Cannery in Steveston, British Columbia, refabricated in Beijing, China) . Examining how Ting’s sculpture recontextualizes the original machine, I reflect on aesthetic and biological dimensions of capitalism that I’ve tracked through the book. Probing the question of value in capitalism as the central motor of the metaphoric work of the fetish, I consider what it might mean to imagine human incommensurability in a world beyond commodity-determined labor.

      "content": "INTRODUCTION THE NEW JEWS Settler Colonialism and the Personification of Capitalism No Jew can smell out with keener instinct an opportunity where money can be made to grow than can a Chinaman. —Atlantic Monthly , 1900 Racial Capital In August 2012, Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney issued a public apology for purging an image of a female Asian scientist from the newly designed one-hundred-dollar polymer banknote. She was replaced by a “Caucasian-looking woman” 1 who is seen peering through a microscope (figure I.1 ). In the foreground appears a bottle of insulin that symbolizes nationalist ingenuity through medical innovation. Based on internal reports obtained by the Canadian Press, the decision to remove the Asian scientist came in response to focus groups who previewed the design in Montreal and Charlottetown and felt that her Asian appearance “did not represent Canada” 2 and was “exclusionary . . . since the banknote didn’t represent other ethnicities.” 3 Although the bank declined requests to release the initial design to the public, a bank spokesperson indicated that the image of a “Caucasian-looking woman” was substituted to “restore neutral ethnicity.” 4 News of the bank’s decision met sharp criticism from Asian advocacy groups, particularly the Chinese Canadian National Council, who criticized the bank and urged it to stop “‘erasing’ visible minorities from Canada’s money.” 5 FIGURE I.1 One-hundred-dollar Canadian bill, Bank of Canada. This controversy highlights this book’s central focus on the interplay of Asian racialization, capitalism, and settler colonialism that, as I will develop below, reveals an economic modality that links constructions of the Asian and the Jew. At first glance, the controversy sheds light on the ever-simmering tension between race and national culture in Canada. In particular, the bank’s equation of a “Caucasian-looking woman” with race “neutrality” exposes the normativity of whiteness in an officially multicultural nation. That an erased woman of color’s body serves as the battleground for adjudicating cultural legitimacy participates in a long-standing objectification of nonwhite female bodies as litmus tests of racial, gender, sexual, and here national normativity and deviance. 6 The Chinese Canadian National Council’s admonishment attempts to bare these contradictions but ultimately endorses the superimposing of multicultural iconography onto capital. Even US-based blogger Phil “Angry Asian Man” Yu weighed in on the politics of representation, calling the controversy “racebending on a banknote.” 7 In response to focus group members who objected to the Asian scientist for being too stereotypical, Yu remarks, “Sure there is a stereotype of Asians excelling in math or science. But let’s be real. The reason why people didn’t want an Asian-looking woman on the $100 bill is because an Asian-looking woman couldn’t possibly represent a face of Canada. Thus, the rush to redesign her with more Caucasian features.” 8 For the Chinese Canadian National Council, “Angry Asian Man,” and countless other bloggers and YouTube vloggers, the controversy’s significance turns on the variable race of the scientist against the assumed stability of the money form of capital as a representation of nation. To restore the “Asian-looking” characteristics to the scientist would, by extension, restore equilibrium between race and nation. But what seems to be missing from this discussion is the peculiar intersection of race and money—of race as a form of money, or vice versa. How do we understand the variability of money as capitalist (rather than solely nationalist) fetish and its own racialized personas? For the purposes of this book, the controversy dramatizes ways that Asian North Americans are uncomfortably associated with capital. More benign expressions of this association arise out of recognition of the upward economic mobility of Asians in North America over the twentieth century, which, at least temporarily, secured Asian Canadian representation on the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill and have earned Asian Americans the title of the “new Jews.” 9 Both expressions refer to the increasing affluence and assimilation of a historically excluded minority. In the case of the Asian-Jewish analogy, Matthew Frye Jacobson’s discussion of the evolution of Jewish American immigrant identity from a non-Anglo-Saxon to a Caucasian social position in the nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries emphasizes the progressive and linear orientation of the analogy. 10 This progressive emphasis is amplified in the 2012 Pew Research Center study “The Rise of Asian America,” which reported that Asians were the highest-income (earning 33 percent more than median-income households), best-educated, and fastest-growing racial group in the United States. 11 Despite numerous scholarly objections to the Pew Research Center’s failure to identify the extended configuration of most Asian households, the high-cost urban residential concentration of those families, and the pronounced income disparities between Asian ethnicities, 12 these facts have had little countervailing influence on the mainstream perception that Asians are more hurt than helped by affirmative action policies. Moreover, from Thomas Friedman’s recommendation that US children adopt the competitive traits of their Chinese and Indian counterparts 13 to Québec politician François Legault’s declaration that “kids in Québec should work harder, like Asians,” 14 the attributes of Asians in Asia and North America are to be ignored at one’s economic peril. Coupled with the benign recognition of Asian North American educational and economic achievement are more unsettling aspects of the Asian-Jewish analogy. For instance, Los Angeles Times reporter Gregory Rodriguez emphasizes how “the Jewish comparison has a dark side.” 15 According to Rodriguez, the victorious narrative of the civil rights movement has contributed to the misguided belief that “economic status rises as prejudice decreases, and vice versa . . . [and] that bias is always targeted downward at the weakest and the most vulnerable in society.” 16 In other words, the Asian-Jewish analogy should not be read as an indication of what Susan Koshy refers to as a “morphing of race into ethnicity,” 17 a theory stating that Asians in North America have evolved from discriminated racial minority to assimilated ethnic group over the twentieth century. Rather, according to Rodriguez, the Asian-Jewish analogy compels recognition of the economic contexts of modern anti-Semitism, which he characterizes as “distrust or disdain of Jews [which] can sometimes be motivated by envy or resentment of an identifiably separate group that’s significantly wealthier than the population at large.” 18 The economic conflation of Asians and Jews has a long history, explains Jonathan Freedman, who notes that “like Jews, Chinese merchants were traditionally active throughout East and South Asia and faced—again like Jews—resentment, discrimination, and even the occasional pogrom as a result.” 19 Intersecting expressions of industriousness, greed, and evil have been infused in popular culture representations of both groups in Europe and North America, from novelist George Du Maurier’s 1895 creation of the Jewish-descended Svengali to novelist Sax Rohmer’s 1921 invention of Fu Manchu. 20 Both characters are perverse, evil geniuses who aspire to world domination. Turning back to the controversy over the one-hundred-dollar bill, the bank’s initial effort to present an image that promotes Canadian medical innovation through the figure of the Asian Canadian scientist aligns Asian subjects with capital in more abstract, nonhuman ways. In particular, the characteristics of the model minority stereotype—educated, disciplined, obedient—embodied by the Asian Canadian scientist increasingly emphasize economic over human attributes. As Helen Jun explains, the model minority represents the ideal neoliberal subject who manifests the qualities she refers to as “human capital,” a term coined by economist Gary Becker in the 1960s to emphasize the role that education plays in adding value to labor. 21 As human capital, the individual is regarded as an “enterprise” driven by market values who embodies an “infinite capacity for ‘self-development.’” 22 Jun draws the connection between neoliberal capital and the racialization of Asian Americans in ways that can be extended to the Canadian context: We can see that the neoliberal theory of human capital and its notion of individual enterprise and self-regulation are not merely evident in Asian American model minority discourse but are also key tenets by which Asian American racial difference came to be defined in the post-1965 period. The centrality of educational achievement and the importance of family in contemporary discourses of Asian American racial difference are no mere coincidence, as neoliberal theories of human capital championed education and parenting as the most critical investments promising the highest rates of return. 23 What this passage highlights is how key aspects of model minority discourse are reflected in Asian American racialization as a form of market-driven instrumentality. Further bridging market instrumentality and racial form, the Bank of Canada’s “Asian-looking” banknote takes Jun’s notion of Asian American human capital to another level by symbolically removing the “human.” Projected onto the one-hundred-dollar bill, the Asian Canadian scientist is not merely a form of human capital but a representation of capital itself. Moreover, the eventual jettisoning of her image suggests that she signified an offensive form of capital that had to be “neutralized” by whiteness. As the personification of bad capital, the rejected “Asian-looking” one-hundred-dollar bill evokes prior economic modalities that have shaped Asian racialization. For instance, Colleen Lye’s discussion of pre-1942 expressions of anti-Japanese sentiment in California agriculture demonstrates how economic resentment toward Japanese farmers is represented through the sphere of monopoly capitalism. In the naturalist fiction she examines, Lye notes how the “homogenizing evils of monopoly are entirely displaced onto sinister Japanese characters.” 24 It is the “inorganic quality of the Asiatic body” 25 that manifests the “intangibly abstract” threat of finance capital. 26 Reflecting on the role of economic tropes embedded in racist representations of Japanese American success in agriculture in the early twentieth century, a success mirrored by Japanese Canadians in the British Columbia fishing industry, Lye points to what she calls the “economism of Asiatic racial form—a form in which economic interests are not masked but are the primary medium of race’s historical expression.” 27 The Canadian hundred-dollar-bill controversy is a heightened expression of this economism of racial form insofar as the dehumanized economism of the Asian simultaneously represents the personification of capital. What precedes the economism of Asian racial form is the similarly destructive economism historically attributed to Jews, highlighting more disturbing implications of the “New Jews” appellation. In his essay “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism,” Moishe Postone focuses on the secular elements of anti-Semitism that flourished under National Socialism in Germany, illustrating a historical process by which Jews became associated with the abstract evils of capitalism. Because Jews had long been segregated in finance and interest-generating sectors of European society, traditional anti-Semitism identified them as owners of money. Perhaps the most notorious literary example of traditional anti-Semitism is Shakespeare’s Shylock, the sinister usurer in The Merchant of Venice , whose penalty for late payment is nothing short of a pound of flesh. However, by the nineteenth century, modern anti-Semitism not only identified Jews as the owners of money but “held [them] responsible for economic crises and identified [them] with the range of social restructuring and dislocation resulting from rapid industrialization: explosive urbanization, the decline of traditional social classes and strata, the emergence of a large, increasingly organized industrial proletariat.” 28 In short, as Postone explains, “They [Jews] became the personification of the intangible, destructive, immensely powerful, and international domination of capital as a social form.” 29 Here the attributes of “abstractness, intangibility, universality, mobility” 30 that are associated with Jews are striking in their resonance with characteristic forms of Asian racialization in North America. The racial signifiers of inscrutability, perpetual foreignness, transnational mobility, and flexibility similarly register the abstract features of Asian racialization that this book aligns with the evolution of settler colonial capitalism in North America. The controversy over the Bank of Canada’s initial design of the one-hundred-dollar bill and the “new Jews” analogy may suggest that Asian racialization has entered a new historical phase. Indeed, the model minority stereotype seems far afield from the historical repertoire of yellow perilism denoting disease, vice, and destruction. But rather than expressions associated with two distinct phases, “yellow peril” and the “model minority” stereotype function as complementary aspects of the same form of racialization, in which economic efficiency is the basis for exclusion or assimilation. This book therefore engages in the task of demonstrating how the contemporary economism of Asian racial form does not represent a break from the past but rather is part of a continuum of settler colonial capitalism and its racial formations. Building on scholarship that examines the economic modalities of “Asiatic racial form” depicted in the interplay of art and policy by white producers, 31 I focus on contemporary Asian American and Asian Canadian literature and visual culture as a transnational genealogy of settler colonialism’s capitalist logics. What Asian North American cultural producers reveal in their rearticulation of settler colonial mythologies is how capitalism operates as a system of representation that is objective but immaterial, immanent but subject to resignification. My methodology is influenced by Marx’s dialectical method, which emphasizes dynamic relations rather than causation to illuminate the dualities and contradictions that emerge from capitalism. I am similarly guided by Fredric Jameson’s argument that the most important task of cultural interpretation is to reveal a work’s “political unconscious.” 32 In this spirit, I look to ways that Asian North American cultural production similarly magnifies settler colonial mythologies to reveal a system of representation that reproduces the logic of capitalism. The expansive, transnational scope of the archive also offers a framework for highlighting patterns and convergences across settler colonial borders. This book’s primary thesis is that Asian North American literature and visual culture present a genealogy of settler colonialism that magnifies a key logic of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic anticapitalism is the misperception of the appearance of capitalist relations for their essence, a misperception that stems from Marx’s notion of the fetish. As Neil Levi points out, what romantic anticapitalism “solves is a problem of representation . . . possess[ing] an intrinsically aesthetic dimension.” 33 As an aesthetic dimension, therefore, Asians give human shape to the abstract circuits of capitalism that have “no concrete manifestation, that are quite literally unrepresentable .” 34 In the manner that Jews came to personify processes internal to finance capital under National Socialism, I argue that the Asian subject in North America personifies abstract processes of value formation anchored by labor. From the economic efficiency associated with Asian racialization, denigrated as “cheap” labor in the nineteenth century and valued as “efficient” in the twenty-first, Asian North American cultural production magnifies the manner through which Asians are aligned with “abstract labor,” a concept that anchors Marx’s labor theory of value. It is from the vantage of abstract labor, as Dipesh Chakrabarty also notes, that capitalism is both reconstituted and potentially subverted. Let me elaborate on this connection between race and abstract labor, which I would argue is a key logic of what Cedric Robinson calls “racial capitalism.” 35 In particular, by giving material and symbolic weight to the category of abstract labor, my project diverges from the important work of scholars such as Lisa Lowe, David Roediger, and others who have argued that capitalism has profited from labor not by rendering it abstract but by producing racialized difference. For instance, in Lowe’s critique of the labor theory of value, she hones in on Marx’s homogenizing definition of “abstract labor ‘as the use value which confronts money posited as capital, labour is not this or another labour, but labour pure and simple , abstract labour; absolutely indifferent to its particular specificity.’” 36 Her point is to demonstrate that capital has profited from the specifically gendered and racialized character of labor, qualities that are far from indistinguishable or abstract. She presents the notion of abstract labor as the erroneous basis of an equally flawed conception of abstract citizenship in the political sphere: Abstract labor, subject to capitalist rationalization and the logic of equivalence through wages, is the adjunct of the formal political equality granted through rights and representation by the state. Yet in the history of the United States, capital has maximized its profits not through rendering labor “abstract” but precisely through the social productions of “difference,” of restrictive particularity and illegitimacy marked by race, nation, geographical origins, and gender. The law of value has operated, instead, by creating, preserving, and reproducing the specifically racialized and gendered character of labor power. 37 In short, she writes, “Asian immigrants and Asian Americans have been neither ‘abstract labor’ nor ‘abstract citizens.’” 38 David Roediger extends this line of argument, asserting that “far from flattening difference by buying undifferentiated units of labor power, US management studiously bought into inequality, preserving and continually recreating race.” 39 While my project is in harmony with the claim that capitalism produces racialized difference, I propose that these differentiating effects are not in contradiction with Marx’s formulation of abstract labor. What is missing from Lowe’s and Roediger’s critiques of abstract labor is a recognition of its dialectical relation to concrete labor. Concrete labor represents the racial, gendered, and qualitatively distinct form of actual labor that is rendered abstract as a value expression. Where I locate the principal violence of capitalism is in the very way it abstracts (or renders homogeneous as commensurable units of labor) highly differentiated gendered and racialized labor in order to create value . It is therefore the law of value that obscures the racial and gendered character of labor power. For value itself is what necessitates what we could characterize as the metaphoric process of turning particular labor into quantifiable units of abstract labor. So in response to the suggestion that racialized labor is irreducible to the conception of abstract labor because of its gendered and racial particularity, no value would be produced if this were the case. Rather, all commodity-determined labor plays a socially mediating role that is structured by time. Capital maximizes profit by controlling time: socially necessary labor time. Nothing prevents the exploitation of racial and gendered labor from being a “social necessity” that determines average labor time. Indeed, one core logic of the settler colonial mode of production I explore in this book centers on the systematic exploitation of a racialized, gendered, and sexualized alien labor force. The structuring role of time is precisely the reason that capitalism is an abstract form of domination, what Petrus Liu characterizes as “impersonal domination.” 40 This doesn’t mean that we don’t daily bear witness to brutal working conditions or the near enslavement of racialized and gendered labor; rather, the very violence of labor abstraction, what Richard Godden calls “the founding moment of abstraction,” 41 is what subsumes the horrors of highly differentiated labor into an abstracted quantity that is commensurable with all other things. It is the duplicity of value as a social relation that Marx denounces, such that “the various proportions in which different kinds of labour are reduced to simple labour as their unit of measurement are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers.” 42 To put it another way, we don’t control the products of our labor; we are controlled by the products of our labor. Therefore, while I agree that capitalism produces racialized difference, this book defines social differentiation as a form of destructive abstraction anchored by a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism. Romantic Anticapitalism The historical processes that encode a romanticized distinction between concrete and abstract social relations grow out of Marx’s identification of an internalized duality within the commodity. Romantic anticapitalism’s confusion over the appearance and essence of the commodity is what Marx refers to as its “fetishism.” While a focus on the fetishism of the commodity appears initially removed from the realm of race and social relations, the commodity is foundational to Marx’s labor theory of value, which structures social—and hence race, gender, and sexual—relations within a capitalist mode of production. The chief effect of this fetishism is the appearance of capitalist social relations as antinomical: that an antinomy or opposition exists between concrete and abstract realms of society. Under a romantic anticapitalist view, what is real, sensory, or “thingly” is the tree in your backyard, the dusty work boots by the door, the reliable pickup truck in the driveway. These make up the concrete realm. What is unnatural, nonthingly, or intangible is capital accumulation, surplus-value, and money. These form the abstract realm. Therefore, as Levi clarifies, “romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of the antinomy.” 43 The antinomical view that characterizes romantic anticapitalism glorifies the concrete dimension while casting as evil the abstract domination of capitalism. In particular, the specific power attributed to Jews under National Socialism anthropomorphizes the internal workings of the commodity itself. What is remarkable is how the traits of mobility, abstractness, immateriality, and universality that modern anti-Semitism identifies with Jews are the very same characteristics that Marx uses to describe the commodity’s value dimension. However, as Postone clarifies, “this [value] dimension—like the supposed power of the Jews—does not appear as such, rather always in the form of a material carrier, such as the commodity. The carrier thus has a ‘double character’—value and use-value.” 44 In other words, what romantic anticapitalism misunderstands is that value, while seemingly abstract, is nonetheless objectified within the concrete, sensory form of the commodity during the exchange process. Pulling away the veil of the fetish will reveal that commodities are above all the representations (carriers) of social processes that are objectified in things, and as Marx puts it, “its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing.” 45 The main secret hidden within the commodity is that it comprises a duality of abstract and concrete dimensions. In a section of volume 1 of Capital titled “The Dual Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities,” Marx explains that the commodity internalizes two aspects: (a) use-value (a thing of use) and (b) exchange value (the exchangeability of that thing). Here we can observe a distinction between these two characteristics of the commodity; a use-value is concrete in a material sense—a table, for instance—but exchange value is abstract and immaterial in the sense that we can’t see or touch it. Dissecting the labor that produces the commodity, Marx continues by saying that “labour, too, has a dual character insofar as [when] it finds its expression in value, it no longer possesses the same characteristics as when it is the creator of use-values.” 46 Unpacking this distinction, concrete labor refers to a specific activity—whether hammering or cooking—that produces a use-value. On the other, it is “abstract labor” that objectifies a commodity’s value. Before we move on, we can pause to observe a fundamental point about value, which is that it is immaterial but objective : 47 “We may twist and turn a single commodity as we wish; it remains impossible to grasp it as a thing possessing value. . . . Commodities possess an objective character as values only in so far as they are all expressions of an identical social substance, human labor.” 48 Like gravity, value is invisible but real. What gives objectivity to the value of commodities, Marx asserts, is that they are products of human labor. A commodity’s value, therefore, is what Marx defines as “socially necessary labor time.” But what determines “social necessity”? This, it turns out, is part of the distinction between abstract and concrete labor. The main difference between concrete and abstract labor is temporal. The actual time it takes to produce a commodity in the case of concrete labor has no immediate bearing on a particular commodity’s value. If it did, a commodity would become more valuable the slower a worker labored to produce it, or as Marx puts it, a given product “would be more valuable the more unskillful and lazy the worker who produced it, because he would need more time to complete the article.” 49 Concrete labor will only tell us how well made a commodity is; it is the qualitative dimension of use-value. 50 On the other hand, abstract labor is a quantitative expression of value—it is an unfixed social average of human labor time. As Marx explains, “In the former case [of concrete labor] it was a matter of the ‘how’ and the ‘what’ of labour, in the latter [abstract labor] of the ‘how much,’ of the temporal duration of labor.” 51 Time is the ultimate measure of abstract labor and the magnitude of a commodity’s value. The quantity of time in abstract labor is not individual or provisional but socially necessary . Marx writes, “Socially necessary labour-time is the labour-time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society.” 52 From this view of the dual character of labor embodied in the commodity, we see how concrete labor is more directly aligned with the qualitative production of use-value, while abstract labor is more directly aligned with the quantitative dimension of value. While use-value and value are inseparable, internal features of each and every commodity, they nevertheless appear on the surface as discrete. Money generalizes the exchange of commodities and reinforces the fetishistic appearance that use-value and value are oppositional rather than part of the internal duality of the commodity. Marx historicizes money’s emergence through his discussion of commodity value. He explains that the only way we can determine the value of a commodity is when it is in motion: through its exchange with a different commodity. In a simple barter situation, I might exchange two forks for your bowl. The magnitude of value—the amount of socially necessary labor time—embedded in my forks and your bowl becomes visible (or objective) only in the exchange process. What we find is that your one bowl holds the equivalent value of my two forks; my two forks express the relative value of your one bowl. Over time certain commodities come to stand as the universal equivalent because they offer a stable measure of equivalent value. Historically, gold and other metals have played this role. So, rather than exchanging my two forks for your one bowl, I would give you two forks in exchange for an equivalent value in gold. While gold is useful for expressing equivalent value, carrying it around and circulating it can be cumbersome, which brings us to paper money. Paper money was once the representation of real gold held in a bank, but now it is a representation of floating value contained in a bundled commodity index. As a universal equivalent, the money commodity can be exchanged with any other commodity and express any another commodity’s value. Here’s the takeaway: after money generalizes the exchange of commodities, money seems solely an expression of value rather than of use-value (as a useful piece of colored paper with numbers on it, for example). Marx makes a further observation of the way the commodity’s internal duality is expressed externally: The internal opposition between use-value and value, hidden within the commodity, is therefore represented on the surface by an external opposition, i.e. by a relation between two commodities such that the one commodity, whose own value is supposed to be expressed, counts directly only as a use-value, whereas the other commodity, in which that value is to be expressed, counts directly only as exchange-value. Hence, the simple form of value of a commodity is the simple form of the appearance of the opposition between use-value and value which is contained within the commodity. 53 What this means is that the duality of use-value and value, which are internal characteristics of the commodity, are expressed externally as an opposition between commodities and money. The social consequences of how a binary rather than dialectical view of use-value and value is such that the use-value dimension appears empirically-grounded while the latter, value dimension appears ephemeral or abstract. Specifically, the dialectical tension between value and use-value in the commodity requires that its dual character be materially externalized in the value form, where it appears “doubled” as money (the manifest form of value) and the commodity (the manifest form of use-value). The effect of this externalization, as Postone elaborates, is that “the commodity, although it is a social form expressing both value and use-value, appears to contain only the latter, i.e., appears as purely material and ‘thingly’ ; money, on the other hand, then appears to be the sole repository of value , i.e., as the manifestation of the purely abstract, rather than as the externalized manifest form of the value dimension of the commodity itself.” 54 The point here is that even though a fork and money are both commodities that internalize use-value and value, the fork appears only as a concrete “thingly” use-value and the money as an abstract source of value. This illusory opposition is at the core of the commodity fetish, which disguises the actual basis of value, which is “socially necessary labor time.” A key aspect of the fetish, then, is the mystification of capitalist social relations that present themselves antinomically, as the opposition of the abstract and concrete . Within this antinomy, the social relations specific to capitalism appear as an opposition between the concreteness of labor, commodities, and nature, on one hand, and the abstractness of money and finance, on the other. Moreover, within this fetishistic antinomy, the very origins of value—socially necessary labor time—are completely repressed. In the nineteenth century, we can see how the social consequences of this antinomical view of capitalist social relations emerge and take on racial significance. As capitalism underwent rapid expansion, the externalization of abstract and concrete forms intrinsic to the commodity fetish became increasingly biologized and racialized in concert with prevailing socioscientific conceptions of the world. The proliferation of scientific racism with the rise of social Darwinism in the late nineteenth century is an example of how society and historical development were increasingly understood in biological terms, moving from a more mechanical or typological worldview in which events were a reflection of divine power and design to a more secularized, biologized worldview that naturalized an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Enduring features of romanticism, the aesthetic movement that emerged in the nineteenth century, exhibit such a biologized worldview in its human (and often racial and national) identification with the purity of the natural world, portrayed as the valorized antithesis to the negative influences of urbanization and industrialization. From the antimaterialism expressed in Henry David Thoreau’s excursion to Walden Pond in the nineteenth century to Christopher McCandless’s 1992 divestment of all symbols of material wealth—even setting fire to his remaining cash—for a life in the wilderness, 55 we can discern a romantic attachment to a revitalizing and pure construction of an unchanging nature, in contrast to the alienation attributed to capitalist modernity. Expressing the antinomy of concrete and abstract, nature therefore personifies concrete, perfected human relations against the social degeneration caused by the abstract circuits of capitalism. This antinomical view of capitalism finds acute biologized expression in the context of anti-Semitism. During Germany’s rapid industrialization in the nineteenth century, Jews were perceived as an all-powerful international conspiracy that orchestrated capitalism. Jews not only were identified with money but became a personification of the destructive nature and abstract domination of capital. In other words, the concrete side of this antinomy was naturalized and biologized as real, hardworking Germans. German labor and machines were glorified as concrete “counter principles to the abstract.” 56 Alternatively, the manifest abstract dimension of money and finance became biologized as the Jews. As Postone explains, “Jews were not merely identified with money, with the sphere of circulation, but with capitalism itself.” 57 Jews came to personify the “intangible, destructive, immensely powerful and international domination of capital as a social form.” 58 His insight here is to identify an anticapitalist element of National Socialism that, in misrecognizing the role of the antinomy in capitalism, strove to evacuate the world of the abstract dimensions of capitalism, which was seen as the source of all evil and oppression in the world. Jews were identified as controllers of money and thus misidentified as responsible for capitalism’s oppression, a misperception based on the erroneous notion that capitalist oppression was caused by money—despite the reality that money and commodity forms are relative expressions of value determined by socially necessary labor time. 59 Thus even though Jews were citizens, citizenship was once again deemed politically abstract compared to the more concrete notion of the nation defined by “common language, history, tradition, and religions.” 60 As Postone observes, “The only group in Europe which fulfilled the determination of citizenship as a purely political abstraction, were Jews following political emancipation in the nineteenth century. They were German or French citizens, but they were not really Germans or Frenchmen.” 61 Instead, they were of the nation only “abstractly, not concretely,” which was ultimately a fatal relation to the scourge of “capitalism” and the bourgeois state. Thus anti-Semitism solves a problem of representation by incorporating an aesthetic dimension that gives human form to the abstract circuits of capitalism. 62 As the controversy over the Canadian one-hundred-dollar bill suggests, Asians too are associated with an abstract dimension of capitalism, but in a different sense. In the case of Jews, their conflation with the abstract domination of capitalism derived from their segregation in financial sectors of the economy. Alternatively, Asians have personified the abstract dimensions of capitalism through labor time . In the nineteenth-century context of Chinese railroad building in North America, the subject of chapter 1 , the connection between the Chinese and the abstract domination of capitalism evolved through their identification with a mode of efficiency that was aligned with a perverse temporality of domestic and social reproduction. In other words, the Chinese personified the quantitative sphere of abstract labor, which threatened the concrete, qualitative sphere of white labor’s social reproduction. It is from this view of labor’s socially mediating role that each chapter explores a different aspect of dominant settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism that triangulates Indigenous, alien, and settler positions. Settler colonialism reinforces this triangulation through a fundamental misperception of capitalism as an opposition between a concrete natural world and a destructively abstract, value-driven one that is personified as Asian. In the sections that follow I clarify the racial interplay of settler colonial exclusion and elimination that frames my analysis of Asian North America and the personification of capitalism. Settler Colonialism, or Postcolonial Colonialism In this book I make the claim that the racialization of capitalism emerges from the particular contours of settler colonialism in North America whose conditions are distinct from the geopolitical context out of which modern anti-Semitism arose in Europe. At its core, settler colonialism reflects the common social, cultural, and political racial destiny of a transnational configuration that Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds refer to simply as “white men’s countries.” 63 Beginning in the nineteenth century, the spread of whiteness in nations bordering the Pacific was “a transnational form of racial identification [that was] at once global in its power and personal in its meaning, the basis of geo-political alliance and a subjective sense of self.” 64 It was against the backdrop of Indigenous dispossession and the “problem” of Asian migration that settler colonial expansion could be justified through ideologies of liberal democracy. As Adam McKeown notes of the benevolence with which border controls were implemented, “The controls were created by white settler nations around the Pacific that saw themselves as the forefront of the liberal freedoms of the nineteenth century. . . . Modern border controls are not a remnant of an ‘illiberal’ political tradition, but a product of self-conscious pioneers of political freedoms and self-rule.” 65 Thus the patterns of Indigenous decimation and dispossession, racialized labor recruitment and exploitation, immigrant restriction, and internment are evolving elements that tie Canada and the United States to a racial destiny shared by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Indeed, as Lothrop Stoddard, a xenophobic proponent of transnational solidarity among white settler colonies, put it in the 1920s: “Nothing is more striking than the instinctive and instantaneous solidarity which binds together Australians and Afrikanders, Californians and Canadians, into a ‘sacred union’ at the mere whisper of Asiatic migration.” 66 The corresponding features of Asian racialization in settler colonies capture the moving spirit of settler colonialism: a formation that is transnational but distinctively national, similar but definitely not the same, repetitive but without a predictable rhythm, structural but highly susceptible to change, everywhere but hard to isolate. This is what we might call the music of settler colonialism. It is from the past, but never stops playing. Until recently, white settler colonialism has received far less attention than its “postcolonial” counterpart among the multiplicity of colonial configurations, past and present. 67 On one hand, postcolonialism is the term that has often been applied to franchise colonies—British India or the Dutch East Indies, for instance—regions where economic exploitation occurred without large-scale white settlement. While the postcolonial condition remains a nuanced subject of theoretical debate in terms of its history and enduring social, economic, and cultural impact, the formal end of British and Dutch imperial rule and colonial administration in the late 1940s initiated a complex process of decolonization that was encoded into the “post-” of postcolonialism. Settler colonialism, on the other hand, is effectively immune to the process of decolonization. As Ian Tyrell explains, “Settler societies represented a particularly complex and resilient form of European colonial expansion often not recognized as imperial conquest by its own agents precisely because they claimed to do more than extract wealth and then return to the metropolitan space.” 68 They are “breakaway” colonies insofar as they transfer the power of the metropolitan center to the periphery, subverting a normative logic of colonialism. 69 In the establishing of settler colonies, the primary objective was land acquisition, as Patrick Wolfe points out, rather than the surplus value gained by mixing Native labor with it. 70 Because white settlement was an intentional aspect of colonization in British North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, neither the revolutionary nor the nonrevolutionary processes of detaching from British imperial rule—becoming “postcolonial,” as it were—significantly altered or ended the colonial relationship between settlers and the Indigenous population. In many ways, as Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler reflect on the irony of revolutionary settler independence movements like the United States’, “settler counter-imperialism cannot, in any sense, be considered of an emancipatory nature, but rather as a defense for atavistic forms of exploitation which by this token take on a politically anachronistic stature as well.” 71 Therefore, in settler colonies, the diminishing role of an imperial metropole facilitated successive stages of Indigenous conquest that involved invasion, removal, relocation, reservation, assimilation, termination, 72 co-optation, and self-determination. This renders a paradoxical situation where, as Robert Young describes it, “the postcolonial operates simultaneously as the colonial.” 73 In other words, what Taiaiake Alfred calls a “paradigm of post-colonial colonialism” 74 is thus a defining feature of contemporary settler colonialism in North America. Triangulating Settler Colonialism While Asians have not held any prominence in popular media projections of settler national culture, which often erases or figuratively disguises Asians as infiltrating replicants or alien invaders, 75 the opposite has been true for Indigenous identities. As Scott Lauria Morgensen explains, the settler colonial imaginary is continually underwritten by Indigenous tropes that convey settler “conquest and incorporation of primitivity.” 76 Much like the way the 2011 feature film Cowboys and Aliens aligns cowboys and Indians with each other against an invading, technologically superior alien population—read Asian—settler identity is heavily invested in appropriating Indigeneity. This is a mode of white settler identification that Shari Huhndorf calls “going Native,” 77 which functions to cover over colonial invasion and reimagine a natural affiliation to the land. The erasure of the alien and the romantic identification with the Native are two sides of the settler colonial coin. By mapping out the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions, this book moves beyond a binary theory of settler colonialism, which is predominantly structured around an opposition between Indigenous peoples and settlers. While scholarship on the settler-Indigenous dialectic has been tremendously valuable, it often falls short of clarifying the role that nonwhite migration plays within such a framework or how it intersects with other aspects of white supremacy. Reflecting on what she calls the “indigenous-settler binary,” Andrea Smith similarly cautions that this “binary certainly exists, [but] our analysis of it is insufficient if not intersected with other logics of white supremacy.” 78 In particular, key questions over the status or role that racialized migrants play within white settler colonialism often remain unasked or avoided. In a binary framework of settler colonialism—where one is either a settler or an Indigenous person—are slaves, indentured laborers, or refugees “settlers,” despite the involuntary context of their migration to North America? If we observe Jared Sexton’s claim that “no amount of tortured logic could permit the analogy to be drawn between a former slave population and an immigrant population, no matter how low-flung the latter group,” 79 do descendants of slaves exceed the conceptualization of migrants more generally? These questions highlight some of the uncertainty that surrounds the nonwhite “alien” and the role of race within settler colonialism. As the cases below signal, slavery and the abject condition of blackness complicate a straightforward approach to settler colonialism organized around a central opposition between settlers and Indigenous peoples. More directly, the “settler” classification collapses important racial distinctions between various contexts of voluntary and forced migration into one homogeneous group of “occupiers.” Recent studies of settler colonialism that have given attention to Asian or other nonwhite, non-Indigenous cultures have often distinguished settler identity by the degree to which migration is intentional. Writing about Canadian settler imperialism, for example, Adam Barker notes the changing provenance of settlers: “[They are] often people of European descent, but in the contemporary sense Settler increasingly includes peoples from around the globe who intentionally come to live in occupied Indigenous territories to seek enhanced privileges.” 80 In essence, settler identity—regardless of race—is predicated on the intentionality of migration. For those who may not have intended to migrate, however, Barker is more circumspect: “Attempts to integrate discussions of hybrid identities (such as the descendants of African peoples brought to the Americas against their will, many refugees, or Settler Muslims who are increasingly targeted by the state and other racist Settlers) with Settler and Indigenous identities are complicated and beyond the scope of this inquiry.” 81 Complicating Barker’s view of voluntarism, Jodi Byrd’s theorization of settler colonialism accounts for the involuntary conditions of migration. She offers the term arrivant “to signify those people forced into the Americas through the violence of European and Anglo-American colonialism and imperialism around the globe.” 82 For Byrd, structures of coerced migration distinguish the arrivant from the settler. Alternatively, Patrick Wolfe forcefully opposes voluntaristic approaches that attempt to differentiate the settler from coerced migrant populations such as slaves. He maintains that “the opposition between Native and settler is a structural relationship rather than an effect of the will. . . . Neither I nor other settlers can will our way out of it, whether we want to or not.” 83 In particular, he draws on the Australian context in which unfree white convict labor was imported from Britain in order to pose the rhetorical question, “Does this mean that their descendants are not settlers?” 84 Given that Wolfe concedes that white convicts in Australia did not pass on the condition of their criminality to their offspring, this example fails as a comparative equivalent to a US history of African slavery. The very content of black racialization has been based on the exclusive and transferable condition of racial slavery. Moreover, in claiming that settler identity applies even to “enslaved people [who] immigrated against their will,” Wolfe implicitly preserves the voluntarism that he otherwise rejects in his construction of the slave as an “immigrant.” Such references to immigration project a set of voluntaristic assumptions onto widely divergent conditions of voluntary and forced migration that are central features of the United States’ specific configuration as a settler colony. In the contemporary context, the racialized vulnerability to deportation of undocumented, guest-worker, or other provisional migrant populations similarly exceed the conceptual boundaries that attend “the immigrant.” Our awareness of these distinctions does not absolve any of these groups from being willing or unwitting participants in a settler colonial structure that is driven to eliminate Indigenous people. However, folding them into a generalized settler position through voluntaristic assumptions constrains our ability to understand how their racialized vulnerability and disposability supports a settler colonial project. The most unequivocal work to define Asian migrants as “settlers of color” is the edited volume Asian Settler Colonialism: From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawai‘i . Referring specifically to Asian Americans in Hawai‘i, editor Candace Fujikane states clearly that “all Asians, including those who don’t have political power, are identified in this book as settlers who participate in US settler colonialism.” 85 Acknowledging the historical exploitation of Asian plantation labor in Hawai‘i, she argues that it is equally important to acknowledge the “ways that they [Asian migrants and their descendants] are beneficiaries of US settler colonialism” and how “early Asian settlers were both active agents in the making of their own histories and unwitting recruits swept into the service of empire.” 86 In this formulation it is not necessary for migrants of color to migrate “intentionally” to become settlers; rather, settler status is a mixture of both self-determination and structural contingency . As Fujikane puts it succinctly, “Colonial intent [does not] define the status of Asians as settlers but rather the historical context of US colonialism for which they unknowingly became a part.” 87 Furthermore, she also dispels the notion that Asians represent a “third space” outside the Indigenous-settler dialectic. She admits her previous subscription to this idea, but explains her change of thinking as follows: I was attempting to create a “third space” for Asians as another category of the oppressed in Hawai‘i. The attempt to ally [Asian] “locals” with “Natives,” however, created the illusion of a “shared” struggle without acknowledging that Asians have come to constitute the very political system that has taken away from Natives their rights as indigenous peoples. 88 In this view, given the political power that Asian Americans currently enjoy in Hawai‘i, they cannot be said to represent a stable third space that is exempted from the settler-Indigenous dialectic or positioned “with” Indigenous peoples and “against” settlers. While attributing a settler identity to Asians may be germane in a demographic context such as Hawai‘i, it nevertheless remains unclear whether such a settler identity is generalizable to the situation of Asian immigrant formations that exist elsewhere. Even though Fujikane stresses that political and economical subordination does not exempt Asian ethnic groups from participating as settlers in a colonial system—particularly Filipinos 89 —her emphasis on Asian demographic majority, dominant political representation, and economic power in Hawai‘i emphasizes how political and economic authority are nonetheless dominant features of settler colonial identity. 90 The importance of economic and political leverage embedded in this characterization of settler identity may explain the absence, for example, of comparable discussions of “black settler colonialism.” A case in point is the postemancipation recruitment of black “Buffalo Soldiers” in anti-Indian wars in the western United States and during the Philippine-American War. 91 The Buffalo Soldiers are a clear example of an oppressed group’s unwitting (and sometimes unwilling) participation in settler colonialism and imperial invasion, yet the continued economic and political subjugation of African Americans seems to exempt them from most theorizing on settler colonialism, as a “third space” or otherwise. Thus the settler status of racialized migrants to Indigenous lands outside Hawai‘i remains undetermined. In some ways, the conundrum of positioning Asian North Americans within settler states highlights broader inconsistencies that mediate theories of Asian racialization in North America and the role of race in a settler colonial context. Speaking to the racial ambiguity evoked by Asians in the United States, Colleen Lye encapsulates the racial condition of Asian Americans as “racial, racialized, but lacking the certainty of a racial formation.” 92 Remarking upon the surfeit of articles and monographs that focus either on Afro-Asian interracial contexts or on how Asian Americans disrupt conceptualizations of race anchored by a foundational opposition between black and white, Lye continues to observe the uncertainty of Asian racialization: Asian America’s attenuated relation to racial conceptualization can be seen in the extent to which critical focus on the Asian American is so often couched in terms of “needing to move beyond race as a matter of black and white.” The Asian American is more easily evoked as a third term to trouble binary habits of racial classification and analysis than to illustrate the genuine multiplicity of racial logics and racisms. 93 From sophisticated approaches to Asian American racialization such as Claire Jean Kim’s theory of Asian America’s triangulated relation to black and white, to Susan Koshy’s conception of a single hierarchical axis in which Asian Americans have moved progressively away from a racialization associated with blackness toward an ethnicization associated with whiteness, most theories of Asian racialization rely, according to Lye, on the “historical agency of a racism that is foundationally antiblack.” 94 However, the problem with this approach is that it constrains our ability to elaborate the specificity of Asian racialization that isn’t merely a by-product of a foundational antiblackness. As it stands, what Lye calls an “Asian American analogical dependency” fails to clarify the way contemporary expressions of political liberalism and white supremacy seem to diverge so starkly from those of the late nineteenth century and, importantly, leaves unanswered whether contemporary “Asian American mobility confirms the persistent power of white privilege or whether it represents the detachment of whiteness’s symbolic power from material power.” 95 The Canadian context only adds to this racial uncertainty, since the absence of a similarly foundational system of racial slavery has not, as “analogical” arguments might suggest, led to divergent forms of anti-Asian racism in Canada. Indeed, the racialization of Asian Americans and Asian Canadians has unfolded as a parallel evolution of yellow peril to model minority—from immigrant restriction and segregation, wartime internment of Japanese civilians, to the 1960s-era liberalization of immigration policy. This mirrored arc of Asian racialization, therefore, cannot be entirely attributable to an inherited legacy or second-order version of antiblack racism given the absence of a similar regime of plantation-based slavery in Canada. This is not to say that structural antiblackness did not play a role in conditioning Canada’s entrance into capitalist modernity; rather, the similar pattern of policies directed at Asians in Canada and the United States indicates forces that exceed those that shape the social construction of blackness. 96 To put it another way, a transnational framework contradicts an understanding of anti-Asian racism as solely derivative of a prototypical racialization of blackness. As I will argue, the vicissitudes of racialization are grounded in settler colonial logics. This book presents a theory of settler colonialism in North America that operates as a triangulation of symbolic positions that include the Native, the alien, and the settler. The distinctions between alien and settler are by no means stable or fixed but are meant to emphasize the role of territorial entitlement that distinguish them. What initially distinguishes the settler from the alien migrant, as Lorenzo Veracini offers, is that “not all migrations are settler migrations.” 97 This is both poignantly true and, for African slaves, a profound understatement. As Frank Wilderson describes transatlantic slavery, “From the very beginning, we were meant to be accumulated and die.” 98 Alternatively, on the other end of the spectrum, the alien may not only be complicit with the settler colonial regime but may eventually inherit its sense of sovereign territorial right, such as Asian settlers in Hawai‘i. 99 Acknowledging these inconsistencies, what I demonstrate in this book is that for slaves and racialized migrants, the degree of forced or voluntary migration or level of complicity with the settler state is ultimately secondary to their subordination under a setter colonial mode of production driven by the proprietorial logics of whiteness. In this light, highly differentiated populations of African slaves and Asian migrants historically represented alien rather than settler migrations. This shared status in no way implies an equivalence in the heterogeneous racial experience of African slaves and Asian migrants. Instead, it clarifies their historical relationship to North American land, which was as exclusive and excludable alien labor forces. Their unsovereign alien status was a precondition of their exploitation and intersects with the multiple economic logics that require and reproduce alien-ness in settler colonies. While African slaves represented a system of forced migration, unfree alien labor, and property—a form of biopolitical life that was “market alienable” 100 —the later recruitment of indentured and “free” Chinese labor incorporated provisionality, excludability, and deportability into the notion of alien-ness. The heterogeneously racialized alien is a unique innovation of settler colonialism. Race is thus an organizing principle of settler colonialism in North America, a principle that we neglect at the risk of relegating African slaves “to the position of the unthought” 101 and obscuring the persistence and evolution of Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation, where “conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part.” 102 The governing logic of white supremacy embedded in a settler colonial mode of production relies on and reproduces the exploitability, disposability, and symbolic extraterritoriality of a surplus alien labor force. Therefore, complicating an Indigenous-settler binary, this book’s focus on the settler colonial alien follows Byrd’s method of “disrupt[ing] the dialectics of settler/native, master/slave, colonizer/colonized.” 103 As I attempt to clarify below, what remains fundamental to this triangulated articulation of settler colonialism is how land and labor are constitutive features of heterogeneous processes of settler colonial racialization. Indigenous Land, Alien Labor The triangulation of Native, alien, and settler populations comes into view when we examine two subjects who are the most racially antithetical to one another: the African American alien and the Native North American. While some have argued that a race-based framework potentially subsumes the critical importance of Indigenous sovereignty, 104 this exploration highlights the role that land—and land sovereignty—plays in Indigenous racial formation and what Alfred refers to as the “racism that is the foundation and core of all colonial countries.” 105 As Patrick Wolfe highlights, the logics of exclusion and elimination have profoundly shaped the distinct racial destinies of colonized groups. In this formulation, the logic of exclusion operates as a barrier within national culture to protect and reinforce settlers’ social and political control. De jure and de facto practices of segregation, disenfranchisement, exclusion, exploitation, police brutality, detention, and imprisonment are some of the ways that the settler state asserts and maintains control over an internalized alien population. On the other hand, the logic of elimination is driven to eradicate an Indigenous population rather than controlling it through various exclusionary measures. Genocide and biological absorption are two contradictory—but complementary—means of extinguishing an Indigenous population: the first attempts to kill the population off, the second assimilates them out of existence. 106 It is worth pausing here to emphasize the dire consequences of assimilation for Indigenous populations, a process that may seem benign or even beneficial to other racialized groups. As Katherine Ellinghaus clarifies, “One of the outcomes of acknowledging the links between miscegenation, assimilation policies, and genocide is . . . an acknowledgment of the underlying biological, physical, bloody aspects of assimilation policies that demonstrate the terrifying resolve of settler governments to rid themselves of the Aboriginal or Indian problem one way or another.” 107 Exclusion and elimination are not discrete logics but operate on a moving spectrum of biopolitical violence. For instance, a logic of exclusion applied to Indigenous peoples, who were conferred US citizenship in 1924 but were still denied the right to vote in many states. 108 In Canada, a logic of exclusion denied the franchise to Indigenous nations until 1958, while a logic of elimination rendered this right of citizenship conditional on the abandonment of “Indian Status” and accompanying right to live on a reservation. In both Canada and the United States, logics of exclusion and elimination inform how Indigenous peoples are incarcerated at higher rates than other groups. 109 While these examples demonstrate how these logics often work in tandem, for Indigenous peoples a logic of exclusion is underscored by an overarching logic of elimination. For aliens, similarly, the eliminatory logics expressed through police-initiated murder or death-penalty sentencing of black men are tactics that simultaneously reinforce the exclusion and exclusivity of blackness. 110 In the following section I clarify how these logics operate when land and labor are at stake in the settler colony. My focus on the comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans draws more heavily on the United States than on Canada because the former has a longer national history, and that history presents a foundation that illuminates subsequent racial developments in both countries. Historically, a distinctive feature of settler colonialism was that the primary objective of settlers was to appropriate land alone rather than appropriate Indigenous labor to expropriate that land’s resources. This distinguishes settler colonialism from franchise colonialism—in British India, for example—where Indigenous labor was exploited to produce commodities and extract the land’s wealth. Wolfe explains, “Settler colonialism seeks to replace the natives on their land rather than extract surplus value by mixing their labor with a colony’s natural resources.” 111 Therefore the primary logic of settler colonialism is one of elimination, and land establishes the relationship Indigenous peoples have with the colonizer. This is not to say that Indigenous people either never constituted a labor force or have ceased to be one. Rather, while there are numerous historical examples of Indigenous labor in settler colonies, from factory work in canneries in British Columbia to Alaska, Indigenous recruitment into surplus labor (the subject of chapter 3 ) occurs “in spite of rather than as a result of the primary tendency of settler-colonial policy.” 112 This logic of elimination helps to contextualize the sequence of actions directed at Indigenous peoples whose primary objective was extermination. A snapshot of these directives in the United States include eastern removal; genocidal actions taken by the US Cavalry; the 1877 Dawes Severalty Act, which turned tribes into individual property owners and resulted in the loss of two-thirds of Indigenous land; assimilationist policies of urban relocation and boarding schools (“residential schools” in Canada); and policy on Indigenous “self-determination.” Despite the rhetorical shift in settler discourse that now celebrates Indigenous self-determination as fully incorporated citizens of the settler state through a discourse of reconciliation, this has largely involved implementing federal rather than Indigenous Nation–specific policies. As Glen Coulthard explains, “Although the semantics of the comprehensive claims policy have changed, the legal and political outcomes remain the same.” 113 Further, Federal Indian Identification Policy functions as a form of what Annette Jaimes terms “statistical elimination”: 114 the effective meaning of the state’s definition of “Indian” as a minimum of one-quarter blood quantum is that through intermarriage, Indians will eventually “be defined out of existence.” 115 In the Canadian context, Karrmen Crey refers to this form of racial engineering as the “two-generation cutoff.” 116 Thus if elimination meant physical relocation and/or death in the period preceding the implementation of the Dawes Act, elimination came to mean absorption in the period following it. While policy history in Canada differs, the spirit of elimination does not. 117 And though the treaty process remains subject to negotiation in Canada while Indigenous nations in the United States have sovereignty, the predictable and ongoing process of treaty revision and violation indicates that treaties function as strategic forms of state accommodation designed to appease rather than to concede blame or to compensate. 118 Despite formal differences, the practice of settler colonial elimination is more consistent in the two nations than not. If the primary relationship between settler colonizers and Indigenous populations is land, in the case of African slaves transported to the United States it is labor . Rather than exhibiting a governing logic of elimination, a logic of racial exclusion clarifies the form of colonial exploitation experienced by African Americans in antebellum and postemancipation contexts. Because the relationship between colonizers and slaves was primarily based on labor, the objective was not to eliminate that population but to increase it and, by extension, increase the property value of that exclusive labor force. Consequently, a logic of exclusion applies insofar as slavery was an inherited condition, which made blackness equivalent to slavery and racial admixture assignable to it. Distinguishing the logic of elimination and exclusion, Wolfe explains that whereas Indigenous women “became conduits to whiteness . . . black women came to augment white men’s property by incubating the additional slaves whom they fathered.” 119 While this logic of exclusion functioned to reproduce and grow a discrete population of slaves who became synonymous with the condition of blackness, blackness was not the only condition for enslaveability. For instance, Indigenous peoples were also enslaveable, a lesson that Spanish colonialism in Mexico teaches us. In the most successful regimes of slavery, however, among the most important features that rendered Africans most vulnerable to enslavement was their alienation , “not just the natal alienation that Orlando Patterson has made famous, since indigenous societies . . . have also had their children taken away, but the spatial alienation that slave transportation effected.” 120 The spatial alienation experienced by African slaves made them a more manageable population to control, to thwart insurrection and overthrow, and to prevent from escaping. This form of alienation therefore helps to distinguish, in the case of African Americans, the “alien” position from the Native and settler in a triangular framework. In the United States, African Americans are the original aliens. In the post–Civil War context, race came into full emergence; it was rooted in slavery but came to life during the shift to black emancipation. Not only did Reconstruction put whiteness into crisis—whiteness was also threatened by non-Anglo-Saxon immigration of Jews and southern and eastern Europeans. Shifting the terms of the logic of exclusion, race reinforced the barrier between whites and blacks that the institution of slavery formerly performed. In other words, race became amplified with the downfall of slavery because racial domination was an implicit feature of slavery. However, in the wake of emancipation and without the barrier of slavery to designate free from unfree labor, race became unambiguously natural, reinforcing an exclusively racial division between black and white populations. By extension, without the barrier that slavery performed, whiteness became the basis of racialized privilege after emancipation. What is significant is that emancipation reproduced for African Americans an anomalous condition that similarly characterized the experience of postfrontier “incorporated” Indigenous Nations. Although freed slaves did not become anomalous as labor—in the South they continued to represent a cheap and hyperexploitable labor force—they became, as Wolfe puts it, “juridically anomalous as equals.” 121 Since the settler colonial solution was to eliminate anomalous postfrontier Indigenous peoples through racial absorption, a key question arises: Why didn’t newly freed and anomalous African Americans follow the assimilative racialization of Indigenous peoples and become similarly “eliminated”? Historical attempts to colonize African Americans abroad or assimilate them into the white population point to endeavors to apply a logic of elimination to African Americans. However, given the socially engineered disproportion in the size of the black population vis-à-vis the Indigenous population, neither attempt was practical or, in the case of assimilation, imaginable. Elaborating on the difference between the population of post-emancipated slaves and Indigenous nations, Wolfe highlights the biopolitics of settler colonialism and its “calculated management of life”: 122 In this case, it represents the difference between one group of people who had survived a centuries-long genocidal catastrophe with correspondingly depleted numbers and another group who, as commodities had been preserved, their reproduction constituting a singularly primitive form of accumulation for their owners. 123 The hereditary nature of slavery, which fused slavery to blackness, was thus carried over into the postemancipation context to fuse blackness to an “unlimited power to contaminate.” Given that emancipated African Americans were neither “immigrants” who could be deported nor a population that could be eliminated through biological absorption, African Americans became an undisposable alien labor population, which accounts for the intensity through which subsequent generations of African Americans have been subject to a logic of exclusion where the only means of disposal is death. Furthermore, the force through which blackness was excluded during the Jim Crow era highlights a broader consolidation of whiteness—of Anglo-Saxons and Protestants at first, and eventually extending to other European ethnics 124 —and intensified nation-building in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In both Canada and the United States, “white nationalism” was the ideological and policy response to nonwhite immigration and black incorporation. The comparative racialization of Indigenous peoples and African Americans highlights the heterogeneity of race that is anchored by a foundational distinction between land and labor. For Indigenous peoples of North America, race was always subject to dilution and disappearance. In both Canada and the United States, the biological constitution of Indigenous peoples was determined assimilable to whiteness. Describing this evolution in the logic of elimination, Wolfe explains that “mixed-bloodedness became the post-frontier version of the vanishing Indian.” 125 For African Americans, on the other hand, the “one-drop rule” relegated to blackness a biological permanence that would survive any amount of interracial mixing. Whereas mixed or light-skinned African Americans who passed as white frustrated the settler colonial racial regime, Indigenous people who assimilated to whiteness upheld it. Similarly, while Jim Crow and antimiscegenation laws kept the line between blacks and whites from blurring, interracial mixing was not only tolerated among Indigenous people but was often actively encouraged through policy. In the United States, the practice of “checkerboarding” during the administration of the Dawes Act (1887–1934) interpenetrated Indigenous reservations with white allotments to promote intermarriage and decrease eligible heirs to Native Title. 126 In Canada, prior to changes to the Indian Act in 1985, Indigenous women were “rewarded” with the loss of their status as “Registered Indians” for the prize of a white identity, not only if they married non-Native but non-Status men. 127 As distinct as these black and Native racial formations appear, they were still bound together by an overarching economic rationale of settler colonialism. First, for each group, race became more salient during the rise and development of industrial capitalism. For Indigenous nations, the logic of elimination became aggressively implemented as trading posts were eclipsed by industrial forms of economic production. In Canada, for instance, James Tulley explains that “the end of the British and French wars rendered the military alliances with the First Nations irrelevant. The shift from trade to settled agriculture and manufacture caused the trading treaties to decline . . . undermining Aboriginal economies and forcing Aboriginal peoples into relations of dependency.” 128 Being rendered anomalous by industrial modes of production thus signals the full onset of settler colonialism and, with it, a racial logic of elimination. In the case of African American slaves, their emancipation was contextualized by the growing challenges to plantation-based economies and the increasing demand for flexible, free labor for the emerging industrial economy. While plantation capitalism was still highly profitable before the Civil War, Southern plantations were increasingly challenged by their need to expand production into non-slave-holding states. 129 Nevertheless, in the absence of slavery, new demands of the industrial economy rendered postemancipation African Americans anomalous as people and gave rise to an intensified notion of race as a regime of social control. From the view of capitalist expansion that lies at the heart of settler colonialism, the divergent forms of racialization that Indigenous peoples of North America and African Americans have been subject to are entirely reconcilable. As Wolfe puts it unequivocally: “The simple undifferentiated product of the encounter between African labor and Indian law was European property.” 130 Mixing alien labor with Indigenous land to expand white property was the basis and objective of settler colonialism. Disposable/Undisposable Alien Labor and the Heterogeneity of Race As migrants to North America, Asians’ primary relationship to settler colonizers was historically based on labor. Similar to African Americans, Asians represented an alien labor force that mixed with Indigenous land to transform it into white property and capital. What comes to light from this framework is, yet again, the heterogeneity of race under settler colonialism. Rather than presenting a derivative model of Asian racialization that is based on a prototypical antiblackness, the vicissitudes of Asian racialization are primarily shaped by the evolving economic landscape of settler colonialism within a global economy. While African Americans and Asian North Americans share an alien status in a triangular framework, the divergent historical and economic contexts of Asian and African labor highlight the heterogeneity contained within an alien position. Asian labor migration to North America, as well as elsewhere in the Americas, occurred during the demise of plantation-based slave economies, a decline that began in the 1830s. Given shifting requirements of industrializing economies, which demanded a flexible rather than enslaved labor force, the economic context of Asian labor migration in the nineteenth century inoculated Asians from assuming the status of unfree labor. This distinction renders Asian aliens highly dependent, nevertheless, on the class of settler capitalists. This means, as Biermann and Kössler clarify, that “the migrant workers are not personally free, [although] their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 131 In addition, as Moon-Ho Jung explains, the historical importation of indentured Chinese labors to replace or supplement slave labor in the US South represented a period of dramatically destabilized labor relations that introduced new and reinvigorated conceptualizations of race and nation. 132 In this tumultuous economic context, Chinese labor migrants would assume none of the hereditary stain of slavery that defined blackness before emancipation or hereditary racialization that determined African American exclusion afterward. While the presence of African American slave labor was an important context for subsequent Asian-settler labor relations in the United States, the Canadian context demonstrates that parallel expressions of Asian racialization were not wholly contingent on the prior enslavement of black people; rather, they were overwhelmingly conditioned by industrial capitalism. Therefore, in the absence of plantation-based African slavery in Canada, the common denominator of Chinese laborers’ analogous experiences of exploitation and exclusion was their alien status rather than their proximity to a racialized notion of blackness. Because the industrial economy that Asian labor served did not require a permanent, reproducible, exclusive, and violently contained population of alien labor, as was the case under US slavery, the exclusionary tactics that Asians were subjected to never approximated those experienced by black slaves. 133 The projection of Asianness as a racial signifier of indelible, exclusively transferable attributes was less necessary as a strategy of containment. Unlike emancipated slaves, Asians could be excluded and eliminated from the nation-state. If the rise of industrial capitalism solidified biological notions of race that subjected Indigenous populations to eliminatory assimilation on the basis of the mutability of their blood, and black populations to Jim Crow exclusion based on the contaminating reach of their blood, the logic of exclusion ascribed alien-ness and spatial vulnerability not simply to Asian blood but to the entire Asian body. Because Asian bodies could be entirely excluded from the nation-state, Asian labor was susceptible to more volatile forms of domestic exclusion than those experienced by African Americans. As a result, the history of domestic segregation and antimiscegenation laws targeting Asians in North America—evoked by racial fears of biological contamination and contagion 134 —was more uneven than its African American counterpart. 135 A much more effective means of exclusion was through immigration control. A form of Jim Crow in a transnational context, immigration policy not only determined entry into the nation but could legally bar an immigrant from naturalizing, voting, owning and transferring property, and working. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds observe, “In drawing the global colour line, immigration restriction became a version of racial segregation on an international scale.” 136 To the extent that Asians were restricted or excluded from coming to North America until the mid-1960s, and because their deportability constituted a form of what David Hernández calls “lesser citizenship,” 137 the logic of exclusion employed the national border to segregate populations and maintain social control. In a settler colonial context, these variable, exclusionary logics have resulted in the heterogeneous racialization of the alien: the African American, whose indisposability in the settler state requires a heightened form of racialized exclusion as a form of domestic social control, and the Asian North American, whose disposability from the settler state produces a less fixed and more volatile racialization by virtue of the exclusionary power of immigration restriction. In this framework of abstract labor, Asian North Americans may appear “less racial”—to adapt Lye’s language—than African Americans or Indigenous populations, whose racial essences were expressed in the relative power of blood to contaminate or to erase a population, respectively. However, if Asian racialization produced a less blood-defined racial body, it is by virtue of the exclusionary, segregationist logics that were carried out in the extraterritorial arena of immigration control that inhibited Asian exposure to more sustained domestic logics of racial exclusion and elimination. In this context, race is not only a heterogeneous formation; it is also an expression of settler power whose capacity to racialize is not, as Jodi Melamed suggests, “reducible to biology, identity, or ontology.” 138 These factors laid the settler colonial groundwork for an understanding of the abstract racialization of the Asian alien that form this book’s central concern. While a logic of elimination functions to increase white property through the decimation of Indigenous populations who stand in the way of territorial expansion, a logic of exclusion serves industrial capitalism by furnishing a vulnerable labor force whose existence could be managed at the border. Bearing some similarity to the spatial segregation of prison inmates from inner cities, the border represents a geographical solution to manage surplus populations. 139 This focus does not discount the many other exercises of racialized domestic social control, which prevented, denied, or rescinded access to naturalization, labor, the franchise, property ownership, and, in the case of Japanese North American citizens interned during World War II, due process or freedom of mobility. My point is that each of these modes of domestic racial control served a broader logic of exclusion that is inherent in immigration restriction: to underscore and preserve Asians’ alien status by creating policy that exploited the volatility of an Asian presence. From the perspective of settler colonialism, we can build on this framework by clarifying the importance of spatial alienation (rather than Indigeneity) as a factor in the exploitation of a racialized labor force. In this light, a logic of exclusion is the prerequisite for the recruitment of alien labor, functioning either to reproduce an exclusive labor force in the case of African slaves or to render an Asian labor presence highly conditional to the demands of capital. Both are subject to forms of segregation, either on a national or international scale. As each of my chapters argues, this volatility is what makes it possible to view the Asian alien as the embodiment of the abstract evils of capitalism. By clarifying the evolving triangulation of Native, alien, and settler subject positions, my purpose has been to distinguish both the heterogeneity of race and the heterogeneity of alien racialization. This formation is uniquely tied to settler colonialism, which requires a disposable reserve army labor force. In the chapters that follow, I will situate this heterogeneous racial formation within a settler colonial logic of romantic anticapitalism that hypostatizes whiteness and sublates Asianness into abstract labor and the intangible, destructive dimension of capitalist relations. Chapter Overview In order to magnify the capitalist logics of settler colonialism that account for the striking parallels in US and Canadian policy directed at Asian ethnic groups, this book’s transnational focus draws on corresponding racial policy making at key turning points since the nineteenth century: Chinese railroad labor in the 1880s and subsequent immigrant restriction laws; the expansion of anti-Asian immigration restrictions in the 1920s; the relocation and internment of Japanese civilians during and after World War II; and the late 1960s neoliberalization of immigration policy. Because one of my goals is to reframe these historical touchstones where Chinese and Japanese populations figured predominantly, the majority of my examples are limited to this East Asian scope. However, because my project is aimed at presenting a theorization of the abstract economism of the Asian alien in a settler colonial framework rather than emphasize the ethnic particularity of any one group, I have strived to construct a flexible rather than ethnically determined model that can be expanded and adapted to accommodate the specific historical circumstances of Asian populations not covered in the book. In each chapter I explore Asian North American cultural production as a genealogical archive. As such I draw from Michel Foucault’s distinction between history and genealogy, one shaped by his principle that “knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting.” 140 Rather than the traditional approach to history as a linear and unified development—“an acquisition, a possession that grows and solidifies”—a genealogy is an “unstable assemblage of faults, fissures, and heterogeneous layers that threaten the fragile inheritor from within or from underneath.” 141 As such, genealogy opens up what Foucault calls a countermemory: “a transformation of history into a totally different time.” 142 To the three modalities of counter-memory that he identifies as parodic, dissociative, and sacrificial reworkings of history, I would like to add a fourth, a “postmemory,” in order to call attention to the affective register of racial genealogies. As Marianne Hirsch defines it, postmemory is a “very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 143 She further distinguishes postmemory and memory as follows: Postmemory characterizes the experiences of those who grow up dominated by narratives that preceded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation shaped by traumatic events that can be neither understood nor recreated. 144 Such a conceptualization of postmemory applies to the contemporary Asian North American cultural production I examine in the sense that these works present less of a direct or experiential connection to historical events than a collective consciousness of Asian American and Asian Canadians who have grown up with settler narratives of national identity and belonging that have relegated the Asian as other. I further adapt the notion of postmemory to indicate a form of future memory, a memory yet to come, to capture the simultaneously utopian and apocalyptic capitalist futurity explored in Asian North American reconfigurations of history. Given that my primary focus is on the economic modalities of Asian racialization that are tied to capitalism, my goal is to demonstrate how an Asian North American cultural genealogy of settler colonialism does not simply oppose this economism but, rather, opens it up for further exposure. Laid bare, the symbolic infrastructure of this economism provides a window into what Dipesh Chakrabarty terms History 2, the relations “whose reproduction does not contribute to the reproduction of the logic of capital . . . [even though they] can actually be intimately intertwined with the relations that do.” 145 History 2 expresses the potential of countermemory to subvert the social relations embedded in History 1 that reproduce the logic of capital. Most of the chapters in the book feature a dialogue between literary and visual texts. The multimedia nature of the archive that grounds my analysis of each historical episode aims to meet two objectives. First, a starting point for this book is an understanding that the ideological expression of white settler colonialism and anti-Asian sentiment in North America is a multimedia projection that has glorified whiteness in artistic constructions of landscape and delimited racial belonging in textual definitions of citizenship. Therefore the multimedia archive of Asian North American cultural production in this book is a response to both the literary and visual form of these constructions. Related to this, the visual works I incorporate attempt to address the predominance of mainstream film and television constructions of Asians that evoke untrustworthiness, mystery, or deceitfulness and collectively reinforce the destructive, unrepresentable abstraction attributed to Asian bodies. The mystery and treachery often reinforced through the visuality of Asians in popular media are distinctive because they always point to something invisible and unseen, suggesting that the negative content of Asian racialization is something that we can’t see. The visual culture presented in this book thus offers imaginative responses to the challenge of visualizing the unrepresentable. Each chapter explores how settler colonialism negatively aligns Asians with an abstract dimension of capitalism through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism—that is, through romantic anticapitalism’s misperception that social relations are defined either as concrete, natural, visible, and hence noncapitalist or abstract, unnatural, invisible, and hence capitalist. Such a misperception of capitalism presents an ideal ideology for rationalizing and forgetting the settler colonial elimination of Native peoples and exploitation of alien labor. Thus what romantic anticapitalism offers is an ideological framework for settler colonialism to respond to economic and technological crises by imagining whiteness through indigenizing tropes of purity and organic connection to land that function to distort and deflect responsibility for capitalist modernity. As such, each chapter examines the expression of white settler romantic anticapitalism both to indigenize whiteness and to align Asians with the threateningly abstract economism of capitalism. The first chapter, “Sex, Time, and the Transcontinental Railway: Abstract Labor and the Queer Temporalities of History 2,” establishes the book’s foundational claim that the economism of Asian racialization arises from a temporal alignment of Chinese bodies with abstract labor, which has implications for what constitutes socially necessary labor time. This “abstract” racialization is reinforced by romantic anticapitalism, which projects an antinomical character of capitalist social relations expressed as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions. I examine how romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, pure, and organic dimensions of white labor and leisure time, while identifying capitalism solely with the abstract dimensions of the antinomy, which is personified by Chinese labor. The chapter begins with a reflection on a nineteenth-century sketch of a Chinese laborer’s profile surrounded by financial figures drawn by William Van Horne, president of the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR ). My interpretation of the sketch, whose provocative nature the CPR itself underscored by not granting me permission to reproduce in this book, sets the stage for clarifying the sexualized intersection of race and capitalism. In taking this direction I adapt Postone’s theorization of the secular, anticapitalist dimensions of modern anti-Semitism for understanding anti-Asian sentiment. Analyzing Richard Fung’s Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes alongside Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men , two works about Chinese labor on the transcontinental railroad, I explore the identity—or sameness—relation between Chinese labor, time, and money. Focusing on the range of gender and sexual substitutions represented in these texts, I argue that these works demonstrate how the abstract racialization of Asian alien labor is established through their alignment with a perverse temporality. While Fung’s and Kingston’s works expose the fungibility of alien labor conditioned by biologized notions of time, they also point to the queer potential of History 2 that resides within abstract labor but does not reproduce the logic of capitalism. Moreover, their contemporary approach to this history highlights the ongoing construction of racialized abstraction in the era of globalization—the new nineteenth century—which is the subject of chapter 4 . The second chapter, “Unnatural Landscapes: Romantic Anticapitalism and Alien Degeneracy,” builds on the first chapter’s focus on the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations—personified by Chinese labor—by turning its attention to the concrete dimension of capitalist social relations personified in artistic depictions of the settler landscape. Turning to the photographs of Tseng Kwong Chi and Jin-me Yoon, I argue that their photographic citations of 1920s- and 1930s-era landscape art parody its romanticization of whiteness-as-nature during a heightened period of Asian immigrant restriction. In particular, Tseng and Yoon respond to themes of regenerative whiteness and autochthonophilia—a term that refers to a settler colonial desire for and identification with Indigeneity—personified in the majestic landscapes by American artists Ansel Adams and Gutzon Borglum and Canadian artists Emily Carr and the Group of Seven. Disidentifying with the romanticization of the concrete, purifying landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs expose the politics of whiteness invested in the identification with nature and Indigeneity. Further developing the theme of perversity associated with abstract labor in chapter 1 , Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs highlight how Asian bodies evolve to denote a degenerative, antinatural force associated with the abstract dimension of romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical social universe. Chapter 3 , “Japanese Internment and the Mutation of Labor,” focuses on the consequences of an increasingly unnatural, mechanical abstraction of Asian racialization developed in the previous chapters. To help contextualize the expulsion, internment, and, in the case of Japanese Canadians, postwar relocation east of the Rocky Mountains, I suggest that the modes of abstraction attributed to Japanese agriculture and fishing labor in the United States and Canada contributed to the false impression that Japanese labor held a destructive control over the creation of relative surplus-value. I suggest that Japanese internment is neither reducible to prior modalities of Asian immigrant exclusion nor a rational expression of white accumulation by racial dispossession. Instead, I argue that Japanese internment turns on the association of Japanese labor with the modernizing displacements of technological innovation, which fed a perception that Japanese labor monopolized the creation of relative surplus-value. The chapter probes how the destructive power of Japanese labor was resignified after West Coast expulsion and relocation. Focusing on Joy Kogawa’s novel Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s video-memoir History and Memory , I examine how symbolic identification with Jewish persecution before the war shifted toward an identification with Native identities after relocation. This cross-racial identification with Native contexts evokes the neutralization of Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value and reconstitution as an ideal surplus labor force. The fourth chapter, “The New Nineteenth Century: Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism,” examines the persistent and evolving economism of Asian racialization in the postexclusion era, after the United States and Canada removed race-based immigration criteria in 1965 and 1967, respectively. Turning to Ken Lum’s multimedia works, including his sculpture on the roof of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , along with Karen Tei Yamashita’s novel Tropic of Orange , I track their works’ reconceptualizations of labor, migration, and political consciousness. Their works point to the capacity of the neoliberal border to recruit and restrict surplus labor populations from around the world while preserving the racialized abstractions that surround both high-tech, flexible Asian labor and working-class labor. As such, free trade becomes a further conduit for the fungibility of bodies as capital across borders and the continuing perils of abstract labor associated with the “new Jew.” Far from symbolizing multicultural inclusion, I suggest that the border is a central motor for the expanded fulfillment of a settler colonial mode of production that relies on a disposable migrant labor system. The epilogue, “The Revenge of the Iron Chink,” offers a meditation on an exhibition featuring an early twentieth-century fish-gutting machine called the “Iron Chink” located in my hometown of Victoria, British Columbia, personifying a racist slur. To explore its contemporary significance I turn to artist Tommy Ting’s reanimation of the Iron Chink in his 2012 sculpture Machine (Iron Chink, invented in 1903, found at the Gulf of Georgia Cannery in Steveston, British Columbia, refabricated in Beijing, China) . Examining how Ting’s sculpture recontextualizes the original machine, I reflect on aesthetic and biological dimensions of capitalism that I’ve tracked through the book. Probing the question of value in capitalism as the central motor of the metaphoric work of the fetish, I consider what it might mean to imagine human incommensurability in a world beyond commodity-determined labor.

Macdonald and announces the completion of the railroad in Craigellachie, British Columbia, on November 7, 1885. Unlike the well-known photograph of the ceremonial driving of the last spike, the focal point of the telegram is time: it is the hour and minutes—9:22 A.M .—that precisely mark the consolidation of the settler nation. The telegram, itself a representation of nineteenth-century advances in communications, symbolizes a new national temporality achieved through technological innovation. Van Horne was known to frequently draw pictures on the reverse side of these kinds of telegrams. On the back side of one of the few that survived is his sketch of a Chinese laborer’s facial profile, complete with a long tapered mustache. Surrounding the man’s face are a busy series of numerical calculations that seem indicative of Van Horne’s financial worries during the railroad’s construction. The CPR , now a multi-billion-dollar corporation, objected to the reproduction of the sketch in this book. 2 What’s interesting is that the grounds for the CPR ’s censorship of the image rested on the mere association of Van Horne with the Chinese man, suggesting a perverse content attributed to the sketched figure and its capacity to corrupt Van Horne’s reputation. This chapter probes exactly what constitutes this unnatural, obscene content and why it is out of sync with the settler temporality glorified on the face of Van Horne’s telegram to the prime minister. Probing the obscene content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man further, the juxtaposition of the human profile and numerical sums evokes the economic connection between Chinese railroad labor and their low wages. Drawing out the financial significance of the image, Margot Francis explains that Chinese labor was “indispensable to the CPR ’s early financial viability as their ‘cheap wages’ saved Andrew Onderdonk, the contractor for the western section of the line, between $3 and $5 million and allowed him to escape bankruptcy.” 3 The Chinese whom Onderdonk contracted to work the western section were recruited from San Francisco. Many of them had worked on the US transcontinental railroad, which had been completed over a decade earlier, in 1869. 4 Although Chinese labor in North America was vital to the completion of the transcontinental railroads, its profound irony, as Henry Yu observes, is “that the very railroads that Chinese laborers built made it easier and cheaper to transport the settlers who arrived afterwards and demanded that ‘the Chinese must go.’” 5 Although railroads were symbols of consolidation for the white nation, they were lines to exclusion for the Chinese laborers who helped build them. In 1885, the same year the CPR was completed, Canada passed its first immigration restriction policy through the Chinese Head Tax, designed to deter laboring classes. Originally set at $50, the tax rose prohibitively, to $100 by 1900 and $500 by 1903. Following completion of the US transcontinental railroad in 1869, the 1875 Page Act was the first federal immigration policy designed to deny entry to prostitutes, overwhelmingly targeting Chinese women on the basis of presumed sexual immorality. The passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 dramatically expanded this scope by restricting entry to all skilled and unskilled Chinese labor. The outcome of these immigration controls on both sides of the Canada-US border was the formation of “bachelor” communities that, as homosocial, nonreproductive spaces, reinforced fears of contagion and perversion associated with Chinese men. The reproductive restrictions imposed on the bachelor community was, in Foucault’s terms, part of the biopolitics of settler colonialism through its “calculated management of life.” 6 The very existence of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man also offers a stark contrast to the traditional iconography associated with the building of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. The now-famous photographs taken at Promontory, Utah, and Craigellachie, British Columbia, respectively, commemorate the technological feat of white labor, erasing the thousands of Chinese men who worked and died building the western sections of these railroads. As David Eng notes, “While more than ten thousand Chinese American male laborers were exploited for the building of the western portion of Central Pacific track, no one appears in the photograph commemorating its completion.” 7 Neither are any of the seventeen thousand Chinese laborers who worked the western section of the Canadian Pacific railroad identified in what Berton calls “the most famous photograph ever taken in Canada,” celebrating the union of eastern and western tracks in Canada. 8 Therefore, in the sense that Van Horne’s illustration retrieves a repressed aspect of Chinese labor in Canada, it offers us an alternative visual example that Francis suggests “troubles the narratives that posit that only white men were sufficiently enterprising to construct the rail that connected the nation.” 9 For the purposes of this chapter, what the missing sketch also brings to the fore is a relationship between the signifiers of race and capital that overshadowed railroad construction. The tension between these signifiers gave rise to the association of Chinese labor efficiency with social perversion and fed into romantic anticapitalism’s dehumanization of Chinese workers as abstract labor. Probing this visual interplay of race and capital, a less linear vision of Chinese labor emerges from Van Horne’s sketch. In addition to the causal significance of the Chinese face and calculations, insofar as Chinese labor was instrumental for securing the financial viability of the CPR , the juxtaposition of the Chinese profile and numerical figures also projects the sameness of an identity relation. In particular, the vertical lines of the Chinese man’s mustache in the sketch repeat the tally lines surrounding him, accentuating their symbolic resemblance and projecting a quality of mutability and interchangeability. This visual assonance evokes the peculiar fungibility of the Asian alien, a figure whose interchangeability as a value expression dramatizes the properties of money itself, Marx’s “universal equivalent,” against which everything is commensurable and exchangeable. Does such a resemblance between alien labor and the universal equivalence of money suggest that racialized labor takes on the abstract qualities of capital? In light of the 2012 controversy over the Asian scientist on the Canadian hundred-dollar bill discussed in the introductory chapter, Van Horne’s doodle achieves prototypical significance. By surrounding the Chinese man’s face with a series of financial calculations, what Van Horne’s sketch prompts is a reconsideration of the relation between the concrete and the abstract, the concrete specificity of racialized labor and the abstract, universal equivalence of money, which Marx describes as “a radical leveler [that] extinguishes all distinctions.” 10 Money “extinguishes all distinctions” because it is universally exchangeable with all other commodities, and “all other commodities make [money] the material embodiment of their uniform and universal form of value.” 11 Money is the conduit and expression of commensurability. However, Van Horne’s sketch opens a view of racialized labor as money. Rather than an exchange relation—of labor for money—his sketch evokes a substitution relation. Such a relation suggests a process whereby heterogeneous (i.e., racialized) labor takes on the appearance of something entirely different: the homogeneous substance of money, whose qualities are universally commensurable. Unequal labor takes on the appearance of symbolic equivalence. This chapter explores the implications of such a symbolic substitution, particularly in terms of how racialized labor becomes progressively abstract, moving from concrete reality to the spectral domain of capital. Of course, capitalism’s key operational logic is one of abstraction, dissolving difference into homogeneous, equivalent forms so they are commensurable—exchangeable. As Dipesh Chakrabarty summarizes, “The logic of capital sublates into itself the differences of history.” 12 The question, therefore, is why the concrete particularity of Chinese labor comes to express itself culturally as “abstract labor.” Does the cultural abstraction of Chinese labor offer new ways of understanding what Yu calls the “irony” of Chinese labor restrictions introduced after the completion of the transcontinental railroads? In particular, if value is based on “socially necessary” labor time, what factors constitute social necessity? This chapter draws on two Asian North American texts that shed light on social necessity through gendered and sexual temporalities of race, labor, and capitalism in the construction of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. Addressing themes of labor exploitation and gendered and sexualized exclusion, Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains,” from her experimental memoir China Men , and Richard Fung’s experimental video documentary Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes offer imaginative responses to Van Horne’s symbolic provocation of the identity relation between Chinese labor and money. Magnifying a converging theme of gender and sexual resignification and substitution in their texts, Kingston and Fung demonstrate, to quote Elizabeth Freeman, how “time has, indeed is , a body.” 13 Specifically, in their framing of racialized labor through the interplay of sexuality and temporality, I argue that Kingston and Fung queer the disembodying effects of an accelerating temporal logic of equivalence that constitutes abstract labor. What unites their distinct texts is a recurring theme of substitutions—of ventriloquism for “real” speech, of masturbation for “real” sex, of gay sex for straight sex, of Chinese alien labor for white labor, of maternalism for paternalism, and so on—which function collectively to expose how racial, sexual, and gender difference operates as a degraded substitute within the capitalist logics of white settler colonialism. These substitutions interrupt the accelerating capitalist temporality of railroad labor, which reorganizes the social necessity of a linear, rational, normative time of family, nation, and capital. If time is a body, it is a body subject to relentless disembodiment under capitalism. Yet, for these cultural producers, disembodiment provides an opening for queer resignification that reveals the destabilizing potential of abstract labor. They draw out the potential of Queer Marxism by exposing the tension between concrete labor and abstract labor time, what Petrus Liu identifies as the “incommensurability between the value of a human being and its formal exchangeability.” 14 As alien substitutes for “real labor,” I suggest that Kingston’s and Fung’s texts allegorize a process whereby alien labor is symbolically aligned with the fluctuating duration embedded in abstract labor, which establishes value, rather than the here-and-now world of concrete labor. As I elaborated in the introductory chapter, abstract labor represents a social average of labor time to produce a commodity in order to express its quantitative value during exchange, whereas concrete labor refers to the actual time and place of a specific laboring activity that expresses its qualitative use-value. Chakrabarty offers a useful clarification of abstract labor as a “performative, practical category.” 15 He explains that “abstract labor gave Marx a way of explaining how the capitalist mode of production managed to extract, out of peoples and histories that were all different, a homogenous and common unit for measuring human activity.” 16 Abstract labor is therefore an objective force made up of what Marx describes as a spectral, phantomlike substance: Let us now look at the residue of the products of labour. There is nothing left of them in each case but the same phantom-like objectivity ; there are merely congealed quantities of homogenous human labour, i.e. of human labour-power expended without regard to the form of its expenditure. All these things now tell us is that human labour-power has been expended to produce them, human labour is accumulated in them. As crystals of this social substance, which is common to them all, they are values—commodity values. 17 By aligning Chinese bodies with abstract labor, their labor represents human labor in the abstract . It is this phantomlike objectivity of alien labor that establishes a commodity’s value. White bodies, on the other hand, are symbolically associated with concrete labor, which establishes a commodity’s quality. Such a racial bifurcation of abstract and concrete labor is the work of the commodity fetish, which disguises the social relations behind the products of human labor. In terms of this book’s overarching claim, I argue that a key anchor of North American settler colonialism is an ideology of romantic anticapitalism that reifies a distinction between concrete and abstract social relations out of a misunderstanding of the dialectical nature of capitalism. Romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and pure, on one hand, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of social relations, on the other. It glorifies what it sees as the concrete realm of social relations: white labor, the family, and the train itself—a machine whose concreteness is biologized as the “iron horse.” Alternatively, Chinese bodies are in nearly exclusive alignment with quasi-mechanized labor temporality, excluded from normative social and domestic temporalities. Once Chinese labor is no longer needed, romantic anticapitalism performs an aesthetic function by giving Chinese shape to the unrepresentable: giving bodily form to the abstract, temporal domination of capitalism. In this sense, Chinese labor allegorizes the commensurating function of abstract labor that propels capitalism forward. However, as Chakrabarty notes, for Marx the universal category of abstract labor serves two functions: “It is both a description and a critique of capital.” 18 Following a Queer Marxist approach, this chapter will explore how abstract labor can pose such a critique. The focus on temporality in Kingston’s and Fung’s work also serves to dramatize the impact of industrial technology on conceptions of time in the nineteenth century. In particular, railroad construction was intimately linked to the speed-up and internationalization of uniform time through technological innovation, time-space compression, and the standardization of Greenwich Mean Time. Completing a process of temporal secularization that began in the Middle Ages, time’s progressive detachment from the cosmos and human events was achieved in this period of national expansion and consolidation by rail. No longer did biblical events structure and determine time, as they once did within traditional Jewish and Christian conceptions of history; rather, time became increasingly continuous, homogeneous, and independent of events. 19 Postone refers to this secularized temporality as “abstract time,” “an independent framework within which motion, events, and action occur . . . divisible into equal, constant, nonqualitative units.” 20 Indeed, the progress of abstract time as a dominant form of time parallels the development of capitalism as a socially metabolic totality. In the context of this shift to a more totalizing capitalist temporality, what Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate is how conceptions of time were racialized and sexualized. Indeed, as Petrus Liu specifies, it is a mistake to view socially necessary labor time as solely the mean labor time associated with technological developments but also in terms of its moral dimensions. He clarifies that “the value of a commodity is the amount of human labor embodied in it, but the value of the commodity of human labor is determined by moral and discursive operations outside the capitalist reproduction scheme.” 21 Therefore, on one hand, white labor productivity and its heteronormative reproduction become qualitative expressions of morality and rationality associated with time discipline. As Michael O’Malley explains, there was a need “to protect time’s virtue,” its chastity tied to “scientific discipline requiring years of patient courting to master.” 22 On the other, as I suggest in this chapter, Chinese labor becomes associated with the abstract, quantitative domination of labor time. This is what Postone describes as the “temporal dimension of the abstract domination that characterizes the structures of alienated social relations in capitalism.” 23 Exposing the racialized temporalities of the labor process under capitalism, Kingston and Fung return with queer temporal revisions of labor and reproduction. Time Travel Midway through Richard Fung’s video Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes , the camera draws in on a Chinese Canadian train steward scanning a magazine article titled “Canada’s Railway: A Symbol under Threat.” Several scenes later, the steward is engaged in a passionate kiss with Roger Kwong, a Chinese Canadian journalist for the magazine. After a slow-motion montage of hands caressing undressed bodies, the scene of the two men’s sexual encounter gives way to metaphorical expression through a cut to archival film footage taken from the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR ); the grainy blackand-white film transports the viewer around a bend and into a dark tunnel. Besides the discontinuous temporality staged by the juxtaposition of these two scenes—one fictional and contemporary, the other culled from a historical archive—their temporal dissonance is further accentuated by their distinct cinematic tempos . The sex scene is slow and methodical, while the train hurtles forward on a predetermined path. The possibility of the gay encounter, Fung suggests, is contingent on but temporally dislocated from the predictable linearity of CPR time. The video pushes temporality and sexuality together in a way that simultaneously emphasizes the temporality of racialized sexuality and the sexuality of time on the transcontinental railway. Sex on trains is certainly not isolated to experimental Asian Canadian documentaries such as Fung’s. Perhaps more obviously, the rapid sequence of the scenes above presents a queer citation to a film such as Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest (1959), in which the train similarly serves as a symbolic phallus. In Hitchcock’s version, the train that disappears into a tunnel also—and comically—references sex between Cary Grant’s and Eva Marie Saint’s characters. This kind of sexual symbolism has a long history in the popular culture of the railway. Since the nineteenth century, popular film and visual art representations have commonly depicted the sexuality of trains, which, as Lynne Kirby describes, is “most often as a double for male sexuality.” 24 As a mirrored projection of male virility over a fertile, feminine body, the train symbolizes either (and often both) the aggressively violent or consummating romance of territorial penetration and domestication. Inside the train, the compression of time and space have disorienting effects, such that chance and illicit encounters are not only possible but probable. Therefore, the railway’s temporal duality of social unpredictability and technological predictability nonetheless converge under a dominant symbolism of heterosexual consummation between technology and nature. In other words, the surprise or taboo sexual encounters between passengers who feel out of time and space are not anomalous to the predetermined, linear path of the railway because, as Hitchcock’s film demonstrates, the two lovers ultimately mirror the overarching theme of spatial consummation with their bodies—white heterosexual bodies are always in sync with the temporality of the railroad. But when we loop back to Fung’s CPR , the two strangers are Asian, and gay sex replaces heterosexual white consummation. Through this substitution, the video suggests that disrupting the train’s symbolism with an Asian “anal” tunnel is one reason that the Canadian railway may be “a symbol under threat.” Fung’s documentary diverges from the traditional “romance of the rails” by presenting a montage of narrative layers where, as Lisa Lowe observes, “the journey across geography spatializes a temporal exploration of an unknown past.” 25 Interwoven through the documentary are interviews, archival film and photographic images, dramatized historical scenes, and a fictional travelogue that follows Roger Kwong’s journey from Toronto to Vancouver aboard a CPR train. The documentary does not privilege any one narrative or temporal standpoint, emphasizing instead the interplay of power and narrativity—particularly the racial power embedded in the assembly of historical archives. As Margot Francis observes of the video’s back-and-forth movement between historical analysis and fictional travelogue, “The director suggests that he didn’t want viewers of the tape to feel too secure with either fiction or history.” 26 In its approach to race and sexuality, Fung adapts Michel Foucault’s argument in History of Sexuality that the late nineteenth century did not so much repress sexuality as give rise to a cultural “incitement to speak” about it, leading to a proliferation of discourses and disciplinary apparatuses. 27 Subtitled A History of Heroes , the video examines how it was anti-Chinese sentiment in the nineteenth century that was historically linked to the proliferation of discourses about sexual perversion—at the same time that whiteness was coalescing as a normative category of national citizenship. In Foucauldian fashion, Fung demonstrates how conceptions of racial and sexual normativity were secondary to and relied on racial and sexual otherness for definition. Rather than indict the conflation of racial otherness with sexual perversion, the video’s ironic treatment of perversity is exemplified in its title, Dirty Laundry : it seeks to rework the symbolic interplay of racialized sexuality and labor. Through Roger’s discovery of his great-grandfather’s ambiguous sexuality, the video clears a space outside the temporal frame of official history to identify with sexual fluidity. Moreover, Fung’s video playfully channels the eroticism of dirty laundry, which comes into play when an accidental spill initiates the sexual encounter between Roger and the railway steward. The combination of overlapping temporalities, self-conscious narration, and dramatic reversals and substitutions bring to light the queer modalities of racialized labor history. If we move south to the transcontinental railroad of Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains” in China Men , another Chinese railroad worker performs a different kind of queer identity forged out of temporal dislocation. Whether Ah Goong is wandering alone through the Sierra woods or sitting with his family at the dinner table, he has no qualms about baring his penis and subjecting it to worldly questioning. Contrary to the steel certainty of the train’s anthropomorphized virility, he continually wonders “what it was that it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 28 Scrutinizing the function and reproductive capacity of his body, Ah Goong presents a warped mirror of the train’s phallic symbolism. Far from the pleasures of queer sexuality that Fung’s steward enjoys, Ah Goong’s inward chastisement outwardly questions the relation between male sexuality and gender. His gender and sexual dislocations are reflected in the acute temporal dissonance he experiences as a laboring body. As he works, Ah Goong continually grasps for temporal anchoring while his observations become increasingly unhinged. After he spends three years tunneling through granite with a pickaxe, time becomes a tangible, animate form divorced from a coherent sense of reality: When he stumbled out, he tried to talk about time. “I felt time,” he said. “I saw time. I saw world.” He tried again, “I saw what’s real. I saw time, and it doesn’t move. If we break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway. You translators ought to tell the foreigners that.” 29 The temporality of granite is dissociated from reality and takes on a materiality that Ah Goong feels and sees. The linear, unidirectional pressures of Ah Goong’s labor time confront the seeming immobility of nature, because “it doesn’t move.” Labor time and natural time are presented as frustratingly out of sync with each other, and even if they “break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway.” These temporal disjunctures have alienating gendered and sexual effects on Ah Goong. The temporal alienation Ah Goong experiences during labor is reinforced by the waning influence of a cosmic temporality. For instance, his ritual observance of the summer reunion of the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy—the Altair and Vega star constellations—becomes increasingly irrelevant to him in the face of a new labor temporality. Looking up at the night sky, Ah Goong “saw the order in the stars,” 30 an astrological system that brings comfort because he recognizes them from China. He recounts the story of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy, in which two lovers are so enchanted with one another, “too happy,” that they neglect their work and are punished by the Queen of the Sky. She separates the lovers, “scratch[ing] a river between them.” Taking pity on them, the King of the Sky allows them a reunion once a year: “On the seventh day of the seventh month . . . magpies form a bridge for them to cross to each other.” 31 The discovery of the stars gives Ah Goong something to look forward to: “Every night he located Altair and Vega and gauged how much closer they had come since the night before.” 32 But after the first summer, astrological time seems increasingly disconnected from his own temporal existence. Ah Goong “felt less nostalgia at the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy. . . . The Cowboy’s one year away from his lady was no time at all.” 33 For Ah Goong, cosmic time is progressively divorced from the demands of earth-bound labor time, which, he observes, has kept some Chinese men working in the country for decades. Dispensing with his yearly celebration of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy’s reunion and, later, casting aside the temptations of a pitiful sex worker brought into the camp, Ah Goong’s gender and sexuality become progressively estranged from the consummating imperatives of the railway. He begins to masturbate on the job while lowered in a basket filled with gunpowder and fuses, declaring, “I am fucking the world!” 34 Later, after the railway is complete, he is filled with longing for his own child, a daughter: “He wished for a happy daughter. . . . She would sing for him and listen to him sing.” 35 He is deemed insane by his family, and is eventually lost after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. His consciousness is shaped by an indefinite temporality, and as I develop further in this chapter, it stands in sharp contrast to the gender and sexual imperatives of a consolidating capitalist temporality of the nineteenth century. Departing from an ordered, sequential, and linear vision of time, Fung and Kingston employ forms of substitution as openings for processes of resignification that reimagine time’s relation to race, sexuality, and labor. It is from the dislocated position of abject substitution that time’s normalizing function is exposed. Elizabeth Freeman notes how “one of the most obvious ways that sex meets temporality is in the persistent description of queers as temporally backward, though paradoxically dislocated from any specific historical moment.” 36 From the displaced vantage of the historically dislocated position of Chinese labor, therefore, Kingston and Fung’s texts denaturalize capitalist temporality while reimagining “how time makes bodies and subjects.” 37 As capitalism expands and increasingly regulates all aspects of labor and social life in the nineteenth century, we can discern how the morality and character-building activity of concrete labor both structures and reinforces the social and cultural structures of family and leisure. The temporality of the home, which schedules gendered activity, moral education, heterosexual reproduction, progress, and futurity, is thus a crucial regulator of the labor process. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts elucidate, the temporality of work and family become embodied by whiteness, a category imbued with morality, belonging, and social necessity. In contrast, the Chinese are identified with a perverse domesticity whose homosociality forecloses any sense of reproductive futurity. Excluded from the moral category of concrete labor, Chinese labor is instead associated with processes of valorization associated with productivity and time, an abstract force that injects temporal volatility into the concrete labor process. Personifying the capitalist adage “Time is money,” therefore, the substitutions present in Kingston and Fung’s texts expose the aesthetic function of romantic anticapitalism. That white labor appears more “concrete” than Chinese labor is one of the fetishized tropes of capitalism that, as Marx writes, “conceals the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual workers, by making those relations appear as relations between material objects, instead of revealing them plainly.” 38 In the following two sections I explore the way Fung and Kingston respond to the capitalist imperatives of temporal consolidation, one which aligns Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism while simultaneously subverting it. As personifications of the “phantom-like objectivity” 39 of abstract labor, the Chinese laborers of Kingston’s and Fung’s texts stage alternative temporalities, inserting a queer temporal vitality that animates Chakrabarty’s conception of History 2, a historical formation that he describes as the “excess that capital . . . always needs but can never quite control or domesticate.” 40 These are the vital forces that form a constant resistance to capital: “the abstract living labor—a sum of muscles, nerves, and consciousness/will—that, according to Marx, capital posits as its contradictory starting point all the time.” 41 Alien Labor as Dangerous Supplement During the three years that Ah Goong tunnels through granite mountain in China Men , he undergoes profound psychological disembodiment insofar as he becomes progressively unable to distinguish the tangible from the abstract. As he tunnels, his sensory ability becomes estranged, and his perception of the material world reflects his temporal imprisonment in labor, where “a mountain is the same as permanence and time”: 42 His eyes couldn’t see, his nose couldn’t smell; and now his ears were filled with the noise of hammering. This rock is what is real, he thought. This rock is what real is, not clouds or mist, which make mysterious promises, and when you go through them are nothing. 43 Ah Goong’s experience of temporal suspension against the impenetrability of rock bankrupts the hope or mystery suggested by “clouds or mist.” History is reduced to rock. Later, after the bosses replace pickaxes with dynamite, which “added more accidents and ways of dying,” 44 he is further disoriented in time. After blasting through a tunnel in winter, he begins to think that “it was the task of the human race to quicken the world, blast the freeze, fire it, redden it with blood.” 45 Experiencing the shift to the quickening pace of industrial time, Ah Goong tries to counteract the disjuncture of labor speed and the delay of the natural world: He had to change the stupid slowness of one sunrise and one sunset per day. He had to enliven the silent world with sound. “The rock,” he tried to tell the others. “The ice.” “Time.” 46 Responding to the asynchrony of labor time and natural time, Ah Goong attempts to resignify the natural world using the sound of words, which fail to signify new meaning. As natural time cleaves from the laboring body, the Chinese laborers who die from explosions become increasingly disembodied forms, “like puppets [who] made Ah Goong laugh crazily as if the arms and legs would come together again.” When he is suspended in his dynamite-lined basket, Ah Goong renders human life abstract: “Godlike, he watched men whose faces he could not see and whose screams he did not hear roll and bounce and slide like a handful of sprinkled gravel.” 47 From puppets to sprinkled gravel, human life is progressively stripped of vitality. As both witness to and subject of the disembodying effects of abstract time, Ah Goong articulates both the inadequacy and potential of the living body. As he lifts his hammer, he tells the men working beside him that “a man ought to be made of tougher material than flesh. . . . Skin is too soft.” 48 The impenetrability of the wall further underscores his corporeal lack: “Nothing happened to that gray wall. . . . It had no softer or weaker spots anywhere, the same hard gray.” 49 He remarks to his friends, “Our bones ought to be filled with iron.” 50 Ah Goong’s recognition of the dehumanizing demands of abstract labor time emphasizes a central contradiction of a capitalist mode of production. Within capitalism’s drive to accumulate by speeding up time and compressing space, its tendency is to replace human labor with machines, or “bones . . . filled with iron.” As Chakrabarty notes, “Capital is thus faced with its own contradiction: it needs abstract and living labor as the starting point in its cycle of self-reproduction, but it also wants to reduce to a minimum the quantum of living labor it needs.” 51 Thus, connecting this contradiction to History 2, we find that the crucial variable embedded within abstract labor—a variable that capitalism requires but continuously tries to eliminate—is human life itself, an innately conscious and willing indeterminate force. It is the capacity of being “living” that makes labor a potential source of resistance to capitalist abstraction. The resistance of vitalism, as Chakrabarty elucidates, is such that “life, in Marx’s analysis of capital, is . . . in a ‘standing fight’ against the process of abstraction that is constitutive of the category labor.” 52 Expressing a queer vitalism that upsets the reproduction of a capitalist temporality, Ah Goong’s performance of racialized labor as a sexual act queers the value-generating temporality of abstract labor. In the much-discussed scene of Ah Goong’s compulsion to masturbate while lowered in a basket filled with dynamite and declaring, “I am fucking the world,” he taps into the vital excess of abstract labor. In debates over the political registers of the scene, critics identify these acts as expressions of either sexual frustration or resistance. For Donald Goellnicht, his masturbation signals the “loss and frustration caused by emasculation” 53 in the face of sexual deprivations in the railroad labor camps, suggesting that his sexuality is a belated formation, foreclosed until an unknown future. On the other hand, as David Eng suggests, his autoerotic behavior can be interpreted as staging an act of resistance, “us[ing] his penis to make a statement of racial protest . . . to his devalued racial position in America.” 54 Tomo Hattori extends the resistant registers of masturbation, not as a “pathetic substitution for and failure to engage in ‘real’ sex,” 55 but as an expression of Ah Goong’s “critique of the heterosexual and masculinist pretensions of his masters.” 56 In this case, his masturbation represents a suspended challenge to the linear, reproductive frame of heterosexual consummation. Extending these analyses of his act’s resistant potential, I call attention to the notion of masturbation as dangerous supplement. In Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s privileging of speech over writing, nature over culture, and presence over absence, he pays special attention to Rousseau’s discussion of masturbation. In The Confessions , Rousseau expresses guilt over frequently succumbing to the compulsion to masturbate in the absence of his lover, Therese. He calls masturbation a “dangerous supplement,” 57 regarding the act as a secondary, subordinate addition to the primary and original act of sexual intercourse. But Derrida points to the double meaning of the supplement, as both supplying something that is missing and supplying something additional. Derrida’s insight is that the supplement is what sets the terms that make possible the privileged status of the first entity. Supplementarity is the manifestation of the deferral that deconstructs the integrity of the sexual act, which is assumed to be perfect and complete. Applying this notion of supplementarity to Ah Goong’s masturbatory “fucking” of the world, we can examine how his act ventriloquizes the dynamite’s literal “fucking” of the world. As a mode of writing, Ah Goong’s masturbation gives him discursive presence and embodiment that corrupts the logic of equivalence that capitalism extracts as abstract labor. Moreover, Ah Goong’s masturbation blurs the hierarchical distinction between work and play. Masturbation becomes an expression of queer vitalism that frustrates the homogeneity of abstract labor. Simultaneously, the queer vitalism he stages frustrates the capitalist logics of heterosexual reproduction. In his examination of nationalism and sexuality in the nineteenth century, George Mosse notes that masturbation was likened to “throwing money out the window,” 58 causing impotence and threatening depopulation. And given that masturbation activates, as Tomo Hattori explains, an “autoerotic homosexuality . . . [because] the onanist, as both the subject and object of erotic action, is the same gender as itself,” 59 Ah Goong’s sexual difference defies the logic of equivalence embedded in abstract labor while disidentifying with the capitalist project of national consummation. The queer vitalism of Ah Goong’s masturbation may also leverage a more dangerous supplementarity to the temporal domination of abstract labor than the labor strike he participates in. Animating the dehumanization of technological speed-up—whereby technology expands the exploitation of human labor—the Chinese workers are presented with a “four-dollar raise per month” that comes with the “‘opportunity to put in more time’ . . . ‘Two more hours per shift.’ Ten-hour shifts inside the tunnels.” 60 The “railroad demons” reason that “‘now that you have dynamite, the work isn’t so hard.’” 61 In response, the Chinese laborers recognize the temporal domination of abstract labor through the inhuman push to mechanize their bodies: “‘A human body can’t work like that.’ ‘The demons don’t believe this is a human body. This is a chinaman’s body.’” 62 Here the racialization of labor translates into a temporal embodiment of abstract labor. When the Chinese workers decide to resist by going on strike, the strike serves to halt the capitalist temporality of labor and becomes a supplementary form of leisure time. On strike, the men emerge as nonequivalents: The ones who were sleeping slept on and rose as late as they pleased. They bathed in streams and shaved their moustaches and wild bears. Some went fishing and hunting. The violinists tuned and played their instruments. The drummers beat theirs at the punchlines of jokes. The gamblers shuffled and played their cards and tiles. The smokers passed their pipes, and the drinkers bet for drinks by making figures with their hands. The cooks made party food. 63 However, rather than a dangerous supplement that destroys the coherent division of work and labor, the strike also serves as a kind of “obscene supplement,” which Slavoj Žižek defines as less a subversion of capitalism than “an obstacle which is simultaneously the ‘condition of possibility’ of the exercise of Power.” 64 The strike operates as an obscene supplement in the sense that the China Men’s victory is a qualified one. The foremen eventually grant a four-dollar raise without lengthening the working day, but this is far less than the fourteen-dollar increase the Chinese laborers demanded. Because the Irish workers refused to join the strike, rejecting their invitation by calling the Chinese strikers “Cheap John Chinaman,” 65 Chinese labor remains aligned with the temporal domination of abstract labor. The strike ultimately serves to uphold rather than undermine capitalism by safeguarding the vital human limits of abstract labor time. Thus when the strike is over, there is no celebration. The China Men merely resume their work within a capitalist temporality. Kingston writes, “The China Men went back to work quietly. No use singing and shouting over a compromise and losing nine days’ work.” 66 In this case, abstract labor functions less as History 2 than as History 1, which Chakrabarty defines as “the past ‘established’ by capital because History 1 lends itself to the reproduction of capitalist relationships.” 67 Ultimately, Kingston presents the irony of capitalism’s demand for equivalence and substitution performed by fungible alien labor. When the railroad is complete, race complicates the logic of endless substitution—of alien supplementarity—by projecting the concreteness of white railroad laborers through photographs and commemorative celebration at Promontory, Utah, in 1869. The white workers declare that “only Americans could have done it.” 68 Chinese labor remains abstract and, as such, invisible: “Ah Goong does not appear in railroad photographs.” 69 As Eng clarifies, here “American emphatically does not include Chinese , as the China Men are driven out and their racialized labor is transformed into an abstracted whiteness.” 70 Kingston emphasizes these processes of abstraction and performative substitution at the completion ceremony when a Chinese worker becomes what Eng calls a “body double” 71 for the white man who drives in the commemorative last spike: “A white demon in a top hat tap-tapped on the gold spike, and pulled it back out. Then one China Man held the real spike, the steel one, and another hammered it in.” 72 In this scene Kingston reverses the projections of abstraction and concreteness. Here we see that the steel, as an inferior supplement to gold, is what constitutes the “real.” The Chinese man who hammers it in is as concrete as the steel that consummates the nation, while the golden spike and the white man remain abstract, fetishized symbols of value. As Eng explains, the scene “underscores the splitting of the real from representation, of reality from the ways it is reconfigured in the laminating photograph that memorializes the event.” 73 By dramatizing the role of representation in romanticized projections of concrete white labor, Kingston allegorizes the way racial difference can be sublated into an abstract supplement of white labor while also serving an aesthetic function by giving Chinese form to the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality that is otherwise unrepresentable. Unlike Kingston’s text, Dirty Laundry ’s focus is less on the actual labor process entailed in railroad construction in Canada from 1881 to 1885 than its aftermath. In particular, Fung’s video provides a complementary view of the ideological forces behind Ah Goong’s experience of “The Driving Out” 74 that follows the completion ceremony at Promontory. When Chinese labor is no longer indispensable, Ah Goong realizes, “It was dangerous to stay.” 75 What Fung’s video explores is how abstract labor becomes aligned with racialized perversity and vice that fuels the ideological basis for expulsion, making it “dangerous to stay.” Incorporating themes of substitution, Dirty Laundry further reinforces the concrete attributes of white labor and abstract qualities of Chinese labor. In the video’s dramatization of sections of the 1885 Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration , we see how concrete white labor is associated with a normativity defined by temporal discipline that sets the parameters of work, leisure, and reproduction. At the same time, Chinese exclusion from normative temporalities of domestic life become manifestations of the destructive attributes of abstract labor. Personifying the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality, the Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration casts Chinese men as a destructive, perverse force that threatens the social order. As historian Dora Nipp, one of the video’s interviewees, explains, the railroad became a historical marker that separated abstract Chinese labor from perverse labor: “Initially when Chinese labor was needed for the labor, nothing bad was said about them. Once their labor was no longer welcome, then you hear about vices; you hear about prostitution, leprosy, all kinds of illnesses. . . . [Writers] dwelled on the exotic, the exaggerated, the evil.” The range of racial, gender, and sexual substitutions that Fung’s video explores offers a different view of the perversity that becomes associated with the abstract qualities of Chinese labor. Substitution, as repetition with a difference, becomes a visual theme that anchors the video’s fictional, archival, and documentary fragments. In particular, the visual refrain that interposes the entire video begins with a Chinese couple: the woman sitting behind her husband braiding his queue before he departs for Canada. The audio that accompanies the scene is of a woman’s voice that asks, “Who will braid your hair? Who will cook your rice? Who will wash your clothes? Who will warm your bed?” This scene undergoes multiple substitutions throughout the course of the video, establishing a core thematic refrain that frames the video’s other substitutions. In the first metamorphosis, the wife is replaced by a man, and it is a male voice that asks the series of questions that ends with “Who will warm your bed?” And when we fast-forward to the video’s conclusion, the scene depicts a contemporary lesbian couple without audio to accompany the scene. In light of the fungibility of abstract labor, one significance of these substitutions is that they redefine substitution not as interchangeability but as repetition with difference. Rather than the undifferentiated assemblage of muscles and nerves that constitute abstract labor—what Marx describes as “human labour-power in its fluid state” 76 —these substitutions highlight gender and sexual difference. Further, that the scene’s visual refrain occurs in an intimate domestic space where one lover is braiding the other’s hair reinforces the affective dimensions of abstract labor. The repetition of this scene of domesticity counteracts the perverse domesticity to which Chinese labor is consigned. Moreover, working against the fetishism that misrepresents the dual character of commodity-determined labor, one that constitutes a social universe characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions, the substitutions keep the viewer alert to the normative cues and expectations that buffer and conceal the truth of social relations. As I explore below, Fung’s substitutions present an allegory of racial fetishism that emerges around abstract alien labor. Employing different forms of substitution that emphasize the defensive attributes of whiteness, Fung’s video makes explicit connections between abstract labor and vice by drawing from the Royal Commission Report on Chinese Immigration . This was a report compiled in 1884 to study “objections to the influx of the Chinese People into Canada,” which, as Fung’s video notes, “leads to a Head Tax in 1885, the year the Canadian Pacific Railway is completed and Chinese labor is no longer needed.” The study’s primary methodology is to examine the Chinese restrictions in place in sister settler colonies, the United States and Australia, gathering “evidence” in Queensland and San Francisco by interviewing diverse classes of white male “witnesses” to testify on the subject of Chinese immigration. Among the array of subjects, Fung focuses on testimony that addresses Chinese labor and “sodomy,” a subject heading that appears in the actual report. Unlike the forms of substitution in Kingston’s China Men that align Chinese labor with the technological speed-up of abstract labor, Fung’s video uses substitution ironically to examine the fungibility of whiteness. It is from the position of generic whiteness that negative, perverse content is cast onto the Chinese embodiment of abstract labor. FIGURE 1.2 Miner (video still). From Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes by Richard Fung. Courtesy of the artist. A scene depicting a white miner’s metamorphosis into a senator dramatizes the class convergence of whiteness, which Francis describes as a performance of “authorial transvestism,” observing how the “the senator’s ventriloquism (transgressing the boundaries of class) functions in the interests of white racial dominance.” 77 The white miner (figure 1.2 ), clad in a dusty work shirt and suspenders, begins the monologue discussing his heteronormative duties and domestic comforts, which become grounds for him to question the moral citizenship of Chinese men. He explains that in terms of labor, all is equivalent, but the costs of reproducing their respective labors puts the white miner at a distinct disadvantage. By the conclusion of his speech, the white miner has undergone metamorphosis into Senator Jones of Nevada, dressed in a black suit and bowtie (figure 1.3 ). The content of the testimony reveals the immorality and degraded nature of abstract labor when transposed to the temporal sanctity of the domestic realm: FIGURE 1.3 Senator (video still). From Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes by Richard Fung. Courtesy of the artist. I have hopes to bring up my daughters to be good wives and faithful mothers, and offer my son better opportunities than I had myself. I cheerfully contribute to the support of schools, churches, charitable institutions, and other objects that enter into our daily life. But after I’ve maintained my family and performed these duties, not much is left of my wages when the week is ended. How is it with the Chinese? The Chinaman can do as much work underground as I can. He has no wife and family. He performs none of these duties. Forty or fifty of his kind can live in a house no larger than mine. He craves no variety of food. He has inherited no taste for comfort or for social enjoyment. Conditions that satisfy him and make him contented would make my life not worth living. The white miner and senator align the Chinese body exclusively with a homogenized labor disposition. A Chinese body does not have the capacity for domestic enjoyment, community engagement, or social reproduction, which threatens the temporal stability of “socially necessary labor time.” He continues to exaggerate the subhuman conditions of Chinese existence by commenting on the cramped living conditions, lack of enjoyable food, and lack of social taste, conditions that “would make my life not worth living.” It is precisely the deprivations of Chinese domesticity and civic life that render Chinese labor nonhuman and therefore unfair competition. When the miner transforms into Senator Jones of Nevada, the politician’s more confident voice and political status lend further legitimacy to the miner’s complaint. Adding an air of authority to the miner’s lamentations, Senator Jones makes a strong appeal against the Chinese: “The Chinaman comes in taking advantage of our skill, of our toil, and of our struggles, driving us from fields of industry which we have created and which our race alone can create.” Conveying the unity of whiteness through the substitution of the senator for the miner, their casting of Chinese men as a destructive labor form emphasizes the parasitic effects of abstract labor on a concrete white labor host. What is also significant in the testimony is the senator’s clear glorification of industrialization—the “fields of industry we have created and which our race alone can create”—emphasizes the concrete value of white labor’s “skill . . . toil . . . struggles.” This view of the white industrial laborer becomes the romantic anticapitalist counterpoint to the abstract status of Chinese labor who has no social value except to “take advantage.” Both the miner and the senator thus attribute a destructive power to the Chinese, one that is constituted by his nonsocial, parasitic, and abstract qualities. Fung’s subsequent dramatizations of testimony from the Royal Commission report incorporate experimental forms of bodily and textual substitution that emphasize processes of signification and resignification. As Roger thumbs through the section on sodomy, the testimonies of a detective, a San Francisco merchant, and a former resident of China come to life to reinforce the perversity attached to Chinese bodies, whose temporal otherness is constituted through figurative alignment with labor duration and social nonreproduction. Their testimony on sodomy is presented in a continuous sequence: Detective C. C. Cox: Cases of the most revolting crime came before them, for instance of which all details could if necessary be supplied with that of a man who cut out the penis of another who refused to submit to his degrading desires. San Francisco Merchant Thomas H. King: Sodomy is a habit. Sometimes thirty or forty boys leaving Hong Kong in apparently good health before arriving here will be found to be afflicted about the anus with venereal diseases. And on questioning the Chinese doctors, they admitted that it was a common practice among them. Six Years Resident of China John T. Tobin: I’ve never seen sodomy committed between men and men but I have seen it with beasts and detected them in the act with hogs, dogs, and ducks. But not in a great number of cases. The cumulative effect of these testimonies is to attach bestial perversity to the disembodied form of the Chinese male body. No longer simply the socially abstract and destructive figure that the miner and senator argue “takes advantage” of hardworking, civic-minded white men of industry, perversity becomes the manifest social attribute of the abstract power of the Chinese laborer, a perversity that John T. Tobin links to animals. As queer countermemory, the video offers a parody of this “revolting” trajectory of Chinese disembodiment that coalesces around a severed penis, an infected anus, and—more humorously—a duck’s rear accompanied by an audible “quack.” A later scene depicting a doctor’s defense of Chinese sexual morality captures the relation of substitution as signification at stake in the Royal Commission testimonies. The scene opens to Roger, who appears in the role of a nineteenth-century Chinese laborer. He is bare-chested and moves slowly into a darkened room. As he moves across the screen, the text of the Royal Commission is projected onto his body, while the edge of the screen is illuminated to showcase the testimony of Mr. E. Stevenson, MD , of Victoria, British Columbia. As Mr. Stevenson speaks, his words are projected onto Roger’s body. Mr. Stevenson offers an impassioned defense of the Chinese on the subject of their sexual morality: Gentlemen, you have heard several witnesses testify unfavorably on this Chinese question and they have said they infer so-and-so. And from the fact that so many Chinese males are here and so few Chinese females, it has been inferred by certain people that, I hesitate to say it, that sodomy was by them practiced. I stamp it a damnable slander. A man who so acts bears the mark of Cain not only on his forehead but all over him. The visual effect of character substitution, of redeploying Roger into the role of Chinese laborer, is to clarify Roger’s contemporary relationship to the past, to his sexually ambiguous great-grandfather who worked on the CPR , and to the nation’s history of sexuality. Substitution thus becomes a supplementary modality for Roger’s countermemorial connection to history and sexual identity—bringing forth Derrida’s notion of supplementarity as something that both replaces and adds to. On one level, Stevenson’s testimony defends the honor of the Chinese and draws not on myth but on the demographic realities of the tremendous disparity in the population ratio of Chinese men to Chinese women, which fostered the development of segregated “bachelor” communities in North America. However, on another level, Stevenson’s testimony remains tied to the earlier white witnesses’ condemnation of Chinese perversity in asserting his symbolic power over the sign of race. Whether for or against Chinese immigration, the Chinese body remains an abstract object onto which racial and sexual discourse are literally and figuratively projected. The pages from the Royal Commission report that are projected onto Roger’s body become the textual representation of the Chinese body. He becomes an abstract screen for the projection of textual content. Moreover, Stevenson’s reference to the mark of Cain adds another layer of irony to the system of signification. When he notes how the mark of Cain appears “not only on his forehead but all over him,” Stevenson amplifies the racial meaning of the mark, connecting sexual perversion to racial embodiment. As he speaks, Roger’s body moves slowly out of the darkness; he pauses to highlight Stevenson’s words “mark of . . . ,” which remain projected on his chest until the words disappear as he exits into partial lightness toward Stevenson (figure 1.4 ). As Roger’s character comes face to face with Stevenson, it becomes clear that Stevenson himself is a holographic projection, underscoring their divergent temporalities. He falls short of reaching Stevenson before becoming shrouded again by dark shadows. The ambiguity surrounding Roger’s disappearance back into darkness is such that it is unclear whether the darkness that envelops his body is itself the “mark of Cain” or is, instead, a form of representative absence—a moment of unsignification. In either case, as the personification of abstract labor, the sexualization of the Chinese racial body is the discursively constituted and ideological effect of the disciplinary apparatus of an intensifying capitalist temporality. Moreover, rather than sanitize the “dirty laundry” of Chinese labor, Fung undercuts the heteronormative recuperation of Chinese sexual otherness by highlighting instead the discursive constitution of racialized sexual perversion and its ideological effects. Fung is careful to contextualize the range of substitutions and modes of signification that emerge from these testimonies in a broader international context. Interspersed throughout the Royal Commission testimonies are frames of onscreen text. One indicates that “in 1885, the year Canada institutes the Head Tax, Britain criminalizes all sexual activity between men as ‘gross indecency.’” Several frames later, additional onscreen text reads, “In Germany in 1892, the word homosexuality is first used in public,” which is quickly followed by “Heterosexuality is coined later.” By presenting a larger international frame for the projection of perversity onto the Chinese in Canada, Fung highlights the historical intersection of industrial capitalism and the desire to sexualize labor difference. What the video suggests is that the Royal Commission report represents less a narrative of testimony than a genealogy of settler crisis that turns on shifting social relations brought on by the new temporalities of industrial capitalism.

Queer Temporalities of History 2 In contrast to the jubilant embodiment and incorporation contained in the white settler mythology of the transcontinental railway, China Men and Dirty Laundry incorporate temporal symbols of disembodied abstraction and social exclusion. In particular, the temporality of linear progress associated with railroad technology is suspended, fractured, and defamiliarized. These texts “see” and “feel” time, as Ah Goong proclaims. But though they exemplify the dehumanizing forces of capitalism’s abstraction of labor time, Kingston’s and Fung’s texts nevertheless reject the disciplinary temporality of normative kinship, linear progress, and reproduction. If “time is a body,” their bodies gesture to a temporal embodiment whose relations and modes of belonging unfold as History 2. As Chakrabarty states, “In the reproduction of its own life-process, capital encounters relationships that present it with double possibilities. . . . History 2’s are thus not pasts separate from capital; they are pasts that inhere in capital and yet interrupt and punctuate the run of capital’s own logic.” 78 Imagining relations that do not contribute to capital’s self-reproduction, Kingston and Fung present the queer temporalities of History 2. For Ah Goong, the embodiment of a queer temporality is anchored by maternal longing and matrilineality. In his repeated, self-directed questioning of the meaning or purpose of a man’s life, the literal and symbolic value of his penis leads him to gender resignification. During the Chinese railroad strike, Ah Goong wanders the forests pondering the value of masculinity symbolized by his penis: he “just looked at it, wondering what it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 79 Within the evolution of his gender resignification, Ah Goong questions not only the norms associated with masculine power but also the symbolic burdens he’s forced to contend with. His thoughts turn to the “rumor of an Injun woman called Woman Chief, who led a nomadic fighting tribe from the eastern plains as far as these mountains. She was so powerful that she had four wives and many horses.” 80 The juxtaposition of these seemingly unrelated reflections present to Ah Goong the quandary of settler colonialism. While Ah Goong never sees Woman Chief, the rumor of her existence displaces the gender, sexual, and spatial norms he associates with masculinity. Instead of expressing paternalistic control over a virginal, “empty” landscape, the Woman Chief’s defense of her land becomes an embodiment of matrilineal power. Having experienced the disembodied passages of alien labor time, Ah Goong’s disillusionment leads him to express a distinctly maternal and matrilineal reproductive desire that reverses the normative paternalism and reproductive logic of white settler colonialism. During the “driving out” of Chinese labor after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire conveys itself through an actively resignified gender lens. As he passes a farm, he finds an “imp child”; he stops and the baby crawls into his lap. He tells the child, “I wish you were my baby. . . . ‘My daughter,’ he said. ‘My son.’ He couldn’t tell whether it was a boy or a girl.” 81 Here Ah Goong’s reproductive desire follows a matrilineal arc because it operates outside the norms of blood lineage and paternal inheritance in which strict gender codes are embedded. Not knowing whether the child is a boy or a girl, Ah Goong displaces gender codes altogether. The disembodying temporality of railroad labor here productively disorients the iterative temporality on which gender construction relies. Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire comes into fullest relief after his return to China, when he attempts to substitute the fourth of his four sons with an unwanted baby girl born to neighbors down the road. Disappointed that he has only sons and jealous of his neighbors’ daughter, Ah Goong is considered insane, a “man who did not know the value of what he had” 82 with four sons. After secretly trading his son for the daughter, he feels that “with his soul he adopted her, full diaper and all.” 83 Later, when he is forced to return the girl, “Ah Goong clung to his baby as if she were holding him up.” 84 Without hope of realizing his reproductive desires, he rejects all sense of masculine propriety. It is this reproductive failure that causes him to begin “taking his penis out at the dinner table, worrying it, wondering at it, asking why it had given him four sons and no daughter, chastising it, asking it whether it were yet capable of producing the daughter of his dreams.” 85 He becomes a figure of parodic masculinity, whose frequent exhibitionism—“yank[ing] open that greatcoat—no pants” 86 —underscores the phallic unfulfillment of normative paternalistic kinship. But Ah Goong’s story doesn’t end with the pessimism of alien temporality; rather, it emphasizes its continual deferral of linear time. After his return to China, he embarks yet again for Gold Mountain and arrives in San Francisco. But here the linear trajectory of his narrative unravels, divorcing space from temporality. Kingston offers multiple narrative possibilities. In the first, Ah Goong is in an underground arsenal under Chinatown, “inside the earth,” 87 and is presumed to have died during the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906: “Some say he died falling into the cracking earth.” 88 In another version he is brought back to China because “he was not making money; he was a homeless wanderer, a shiftless, dirty, jobless man with matted hair, ragged clothes, and fleas all over his body. He ate out of garbage cans. He was a louse eaten by lice. A fleaman.” 89 The narrator offers a final possibility: “Maybe he hadn’t died in San Francisco, it was just his papers that burned.” 90 In this version he emerges from the “miraculous earthquake and fire,” 91 which burned down the Hall of Records so that “every China Man was reborn out of that fire a citizen.” 92 Ah Goong’s rebirth is accompanied by another birth: “He had been seen carrying a child out of the fire, a child of his own in spite of the laws against marrying.” 93 Each of these versions capture elements of Ah Goong’s temporal and spatial estrangement as an undisciplined subject of capitalist social relations: living underground, as a “homeless wanderer,” and finally as a father. This reorganization of time, space, and identity is further accentuated by the earthquake, a crisis event that will interfere with the discursive constitution of Chinese bodies as “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” In the final version, where Ah Goong emerges phoenixlike from the fire, he becomes an agent of resignification. As Eng notes, “Like the elimination of a single term in a sign chain, the burning of the Hall of Records—the literal destruction of these particular documents—demands a subsequent shift in meaning, a shift in the relational terms that attempt to shore up the historical ruins of the archive.” 94 The narrator surmises, “He had built a railroad out of sweat, why not have an American child out of longing?” 95 However, the fulfillment of his “longing” for kinship does not reproduce the temporal discipline of heteronormative reproduction; rather, it expresses a mode of belonging that symbolically fulfills his matrilineal desire. Ah Goong occupies a queer temporality in which alien survival and reproduction arise outside of the temporal discipline of settler capitalism. Countering the symbolic role of the child to reproduce normative logics and values of white life, what Lee Edelman refers to as the “absolute value of reproductive futurism,” Ah Goong’s “child out of longing” represents the potentiality of matrilineal desire and, against settler biopower, expresses an alien mode of survival. In the aftermath of the earthquake and fire, many of those kin relations will be impurely, discursively constituted as “paper sons.” As such, the alien child does not represent the guaranteed futurity of white settler colonialism but a potential deferral of patrilineal reproduction while promoting the fictive, queer kinship of alien longing as one temporality of History 2. The politics of embodiment are thus expressed in China Men through Ah Goong’s gender resignification, which rejects the paternalistic codes of setter territorialization and temporal discipline. At the same time, by foregrounding a matrilineal identity that values daughters and empowers women, Ah Goong expresses various desires that intersect with transgender embodiment. Expressing gender and sexual difference as modes of embodiment, he interrupts the stability of gender and its assumed correspondence to biological sex. As an articulation of transgender identifications, Ah Goong disrupts what Susan Stryker identifies as the presumed “‘wholeness’ of the body and ‘sameness’ of its sex . . . [as] socially constructed.” 96 Desiring a daughter, “fucking the world,” and berating his penis, Ah Goong confounds the equivalence of sex and gender, highlighting instead how “‘sex’ is a mash-up, a story we mix about how the body means, which parts matter most, and how they register in our consciousness or field of vision.” 97 In the context of nineteenth-century labor, Ah Goong’s transgender expression is significant in its disidentification with a notion of equivalence. In other words, his identity is not an expression of an abstract equivalence that can be substituted under the homogenizing process of labor under capitalism, where equality is an enforced condition of alienation. 98 Indeed, as David Harvey puts it: “There is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals; how the equality presupposed in the market exchange of things deludes us into a belief in the equality of persons.” 99 In Ah Goong’s performance of gender and sexual difference, he attaches the logic of equivalence that abstracts labor into homogeneous temporal units of human labor to a profoundly masculine logic. Moreover, in his rejection of the terms of equivalence that counteract the reproduction of capitalist logic, he embodies the potential of History 2. In Dirty Laundry the themes of embodiment, retrieval, and difference are captured in the idea of “family resemblance” that becomes part of the narrative frame for the video’s historical and fictional sections. The fictional travelogue centered on Roger brings together ideas of queer temporality in order to reanimate and embody Chinese Canadian history. What’s at stake in this history is presented as a mystery surrounding the sexual identity of his great-grandfather, whose framed picture Roger’s father has insisted he take along with him on his business trip. When he accidentally breaks the frame to reveal a hidden photographic portrait of his grandfather touching hands with another man, he is unsure how to interpret the photograph. The broken picture frame becomes a visual metaphor for what Lowe calls an “alternative mode of inquiry” that allows us to move beyond “the singular history that frames a particular image of Chinese immigrant labour . . . that memorializes the static, single artifact.” 100 But in the context of figurative and thematic substitutions that the video foregrounds, the hidden photograph presents a queer opening that works against the fetish to reveal rather than conceal the features of an alien labor temporality. The analysis of the mysterious photograph expands rather than contracts the range of historical possibilities that relate to Chinese sexuality and assumed perversion. Although Roger admits to the train steward that he doesn’t “know how to read” the revealed photograph, the Chinese steward responds, “This is normal in China. . . . Men hold hands.” As Francis observes, the steward’s reply raises the “question of how the ‘normal’ is constituted in different cultural contexts and historical eras.” 101 After they have sex, Roger asks the steward, “You know what you were saying about men holding hands. What does it mean?” The steward replies, “That they like each other, they’re brothers. . . . It’s a smart thing. If they’re lovers, no one asks any questions.” This “smart thing” is the illegibility of queer historiography. The video does not impose a teleology of queer becoming. In many ways, the linear direction of identity formation in the traditional bildungsroman is frustrated here. It is the unresolved, illegible queer history that animates Roger’s quest to engage in genealogy. The ambiguity of the great-grandfather’s sexuality is what is given ontological priority in the video as an expression of pre-Stonewall conceptions of sexual difference. As Nayan Shah underscores in one of the video’s interviews, “The whole notion that sexual identity is your identity, that somehow who you desire and who you sleep with and who you have sexual pleasures with somehow says something very revealing about you, is a completely new notion.” Just as Ah Goong’s gender resignification takes on a “perverse” relation to masculinist norms, the ambiguity of Roger’s great-grandfather’s sexual identity frustrates the growing “incitement to speak” that Foucault attributes to the rise of liberal individualism in the late nineteenth century. The point is, his great-grandfather’s sexual ambiguity, its deferral of concrete meaning, stands as the content of his difference. Here again, the emphasis on sexual difference frustrates a logic of equivalence that capitalism abstracts out of human labor. In the video’s final frame, the photograph comes to life as the great-grandfather and friend/lover walk out of the frame, away from the photographer’s studio backdrop. That the photographic subjects are roles played by Roger and the steward creates a correspondence between historical and contemporary notions of same-sex affiliation without collapsing contemporary sexual identities with what Francis describes as the “homosocial ambiguities of history.” 102 Rather, the substitution of Roger and the steward for their historical predecessors highlights the role of sexuality for reanimating abstract conceptions of labor and history. In its focus on family genealogy, the video offers a narrative of literal and figurative family resemblances that traces alternative modes of affiliation and belonging that do not reproduce capitalism’s disciplinary temporalities. As countermemory, Dirty Laundry rejects the iconicity of both the lonely Chinese bachelor and the sexually perverse Chinese body and replaces them with an empty stage that frustrates the reproductive, linear trajectory of History 1. My argument in this chapter has focused on the way Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate how the fusion of temporal otherness and sexual vice converge into a biological expression of abstract alien labor. Their experimental forms offer a new context for understanding why the first immigration laws in Canada and the United States were passed in the aftermath of railroad construction to prevent the infiltration and proliferation of abstract alien labor. Although a comparatively smaller population, the fact that Chinese students, diplomats, and merchants were exempted from immigration restriction laws in the United States and Canada exemplifies the way perversity was identified with the particular features of industrial labor within a capitalist mode of production. I have situated Kingston’s and Fung’s texts as responses to the celebrated temporality of the telegram that began this chapter that exposes the censored content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese laborer. This is the literal and figurative backside of the normative settler temporality celebrated on the face of the telegram. Against the homogenizing logic of racial equivalence, Kingston and Fung present queer recuperations of the “perverse” temporalities of alien labor within the consolidating logic of settler colonial capitalism. In their countermemories of the history of settler national unification by rail, their texts expose the logics of racialized alignment between alien bodies and abstract labor. Exploring queer temporalities of History 2, they counteract the logics of substitution as equivalence that reproduce a capitalist labor temporality of expanding the working day and speed-up. In the next chapter, I turn to the other side of the antinomical view of capitalist relations: romantic anticapitalism’s hypostatizing of the concrete, natural, thingly side of the antinomy. Drawing on the 1920s and 1930s as the apex of anti-Asian animosity and exclusionary immigration policy in both Canada and the United States, I explore the development of romantic anticapitalism, which expresses its racial animus toward the abstract Asian alien through an identification with the natural landscape and Indigeneity. Within a capitalist logic of settler colonialism, the Native and the land become biologized expressions of the concrete dimension of the social world.",

      "content": "CHAPTER 1 SEX, TIME, AND THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD Abstract Labor and the Queer Temporalities of History 2 We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. —Henry David Thoreau Fungibility Figure 1.1 is the celebrated telegram sent by Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR ) president William Van Horne, an American from Chicago tasked with overseeing the construction of the CPR who became, according to Pierre Berton’s famous account, “more Canadian than any native.” 1 His telegram is addressed to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and announces the completion of the railroad in Craigellachie, British Columbia, on November 7, 1885. Unlike the well-known photograph of the ceremonial driving of the last spike, the focal point of the telegram is time: it is the hour and minutes—9:22 A.M .—that precisely mark the consolidation of the settler nation. The telegram, itself a representation of nineteenth-century advances in communications, symbolizes a new national temporality achieved through technological innovation. Van Horne was known to frequently draw pictures on the reverse side of these kinds of telegrams. On the back side of one of the few that survived is his sketch of a Chinese laborer’s facial profile, complete with a long tapered mustache. Surrounding the man’s face are a busy series of numerical calculations that seem indicative of Van Horne’s financial worries during the railroad’s construction. The CPR , now a multi-billion-dollar corporation, objected to the reproduction of the sketch in this book. 2 What’s interesting is that the grounds for the CPR ’s censorship of the image rested on the mere association of Van Horne with the Chinese man, suggesting a perverse content attributed to the sketched figure and its capacity to corrupt Van Horne’s reputation. This chapter probes exactly what constitutes this unnatural, obscene content and why it is out of sync with the settler temporality glorified on the face of Van Horne’s telegram to the prime minister. Probing the obscene content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man further, the juxtaposition of the human profile and numerical sums evokes the economic connection between Chinese railroad labor and their low wages. Drawing out the financial significance of the image, Margot Francis explains that Chinese labor was “indispensable to the CPR ’s early financial viability as their ‘cheap wages’ saved Andrew Onderdonk, the contractor for the western section of the line, between $3 and $5 million and allowed him to escape bankruptcy.” 3 The Chinese whom Onderdonk contracted to work the western section were recruited from San Francisco. Many of them had worked on the US transcontinental railroad, which had been completed over a decade earlier, in 1869. 4 Although Chinese labor in North America was vital to the completion of the transcontinental railroads, its profound irony, as Henry Yu observes, is “that the very railroads that Chinese laborers built made it easier and cheaper to transport the settlers who arrived afterwards and demanded that ‘the Chinese must go.’” 5 Although railroads were symbols of consolidation for the white nation, they were lines to exclusion for the Chinese laborers who helped build them. In 1885, the same year the CPR was completed, Canada passed its first immigration restriction policy through the Chinese Head Tax, designed to deter laboring classes. Originally set at $50, the tax rose prohibitively, to $100 by 1900 and $500 by 1903. Following completion of the US transcontinental railroad in 1869, the 1875 Page Act was the first federal immigration policy designed to deny entry to prostitutes, overwhelmingly targeting Chinese women on the basis of presumed sexual immorality. The passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 dramatically expanded this scope by restricting entry to all skilled and unskilled Chinese labor. The outcome of these immigration controls on both sides of the Canada-US border was the formation of “bachelor” communities that, as homosocial, nonreproductive spaces, reinforced fears of contagion and perversion associated with Chinese men. The reproductive restrictions imposed on the bachelor community was, in Foucault’s terms, part of the biopolitics of settler colonialism through its “calculated management of life.” 6 The very existence of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man also offers a stark contrast to the traditional iconography associated with the building of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. The now-famous photographs taken at Promontory, Utah, and Craigellachie, British Columbia, respectively, commemorate the technological feat of white labor, erasing the thousands of Chinese men who worked and died building the western sections of these railroads. As David Eng notes, “While more than ten thousand Chinese American male laborers were exploited for the building of the western portion of Central Pacific track, no one appears in the photograph commemorating its completion.” 7 Neither are any of the seventeen thousand Chinese laborers who worked the western section of the Canadian Pacific railroad identified in what Berton calls “the most famous photograph ever taken in Canada,” celebrating the union of eastern and western tracks in Canada. 8 Therefore, in the sense that Van Horne’s illustration retrieves a repressed aspect of Chinese labor in Canada, it offers us an alternative visual example that Francis suggests “troubles the narratives that posit that only white men were sufficiently enterprising to construct the rail that connected the nation.” 9 For the purposes of this chapter, what the missing sketch also brings to the fore is a relationship between the signifiers of race and capital that overshadowed railroad construction. The tension between these signifiers gave rise to the association of Chinese labor efficiency with social perversion and fed into romantic anticapitalism’s dehumanization of Chinese workers as abstract labor. Probing this visual interplay of race and capital, a less linear vision of Chinese labor emerges from Van Horne’s sketch. In addition to the causal significance of the Chinese face and calculations, insofar as Chinese labor was instrumental for securing the financial viability of the CPR , the juxtaposition of the Chinese profile and numerical figures also projects the sameness of an identity relation. In particular, the vertical lines of the Chinese man’s mustache in the sketch repeat the tally lines surrounding him, accentuating their symbolic resemblance and projecting a quality of mutability and interchangeability. This visual assonance evokes the peculiar fungibility of the Asian alien, a figure whose interchangeability as a value expression dramatizes the properties of money itself, Marx’s “universal equivalent,” against which everything is commensurable and exchangeable. Does such a resemblance between alien labor and the universal equivalence of money suggest that racialized labor takes on the abstract qualities of capital? In light of the 2012 controversy over the Asian scientist on the Canadian hundred-dollar bill discussed in the introductory chapter, Van Horne’s doodle achieves prototypical significance. By surrounding the Chinese man’s face with a series of financial calculations, what Van Horne’s sketch prompts is a reconsideration of the relation between the concrete and the abstract, the concrete specificity of racialized labor and the abstract, universal equivalence of money, which Marx describes as “a radical leveler [that] extinguishes all distinctions.” 10 Money “extinguishes all distinctions” because it is universally exchangeable with all other commodities, and “all other commodities make [money] the material embodiment of their uniform and universal form of value.” 11 Money is the conduit and expression of commensurability. However, Van Horne’s sketch opens a view of racialized labor as money. Rather than an exchange relation—of labor for money—his sketch evokes a substitution relation. Such a relation suggests a process whereby heterogeneous (i.e., racialized) labor takes on the appearance of something entirely different: the homogeneous substance of money, whose qualities are universally commensurable. Unequal labor takes on the appearance of symbolic equivalence. This chapter explores the implications of such a symbolic substitution, particularly in terms of how racialized labor becomes progressively abstract, moving from concrete reality to the spectral domain of capital. Of course, capitalism’s key operational logic is one of abstraction, dissolving difference into homogeneous, equivalent forms so they are commensurable—exchangeable. As Dipesh Chakrabarty summarizes, “The logic of capital sublates into itself the differences of history.” 12 The question, therefore, is why the concrete particularity of Chinese labor comes to express itself culturally as “abstract labor.” Does the cultural abstraction of Chinese labor offer new ways of understanding what Yu calls the “irony” of Chinese labor restrictions introduced after the completion of the transcontinental railroads? In particular, if value is based on “socially necessary” labor time, what factors constitute social necessity? This chapter draws on two Asian North American texts that shed light on social necessity through gendered and sexual temporalities of race, labor, and capitalism in the construction of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. Addressing themes of labor exploitation and gendered and sexualized exclusion, Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains,” from her experimental memoir China Men , and Richard Fung’s experimental video documentary Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes offer imaginative responses to Van Horne’s symbolic provocation of the identity relation between Chinese labor and money. Magnifying a converging theme of gender and sexual resignification and substitution in their texts, Kingston and Fung demonstrate, to quote Elizabeth Freeman, how “time has, indeed is , a body.” 13 Specifically, in their framing of racialized labor through the interplay of sexuality and temporality, I argue that Kingston and Fung queer the disembodying effects of an accelerating temporal logic of equivalence that constitutes abstract labor. What unites their distinct texts is a recurring theme of substitutions—of ventriloquism for “real” speech, of masturbation for “real” sex, of gay sex for straight sex, of Chinese alien labor for white labor, of maternalism for paternalism, and so on—which function collectively to expose how racial, sexual, and gender difference operates as a degraded substitute within the capitalist logics of white settler colonialism. These substitutions interrupt the accelerating capitalist temporality of railroad labor, which reorganizes the social necessity of a linear, rational, normative time of family, nation, and capital. If time is a body, it is a body subject to relentless disembodiment under capitalism. Yet, for these cultural producers, disembodiment provides an opening for queer resignification that reveals the destabilizing potential of abstract labor. They draw out the potential of Queer Marxism by exposing the tension between concrete labor and abstract labor time, what Petrus Liu identifies as the “incommensurability between the value of a human being and its formal exchangeability.” 14 As alien substitutes for “real labor,” I suggest that Kingston’s and Fung’s texts allegorize a process whereby alien labor is symbolically aligned with the fluctuating duration embedded in abstract labor, which establishes value, rather than the here-and-now world of concrete labor. As I elaborated in the introductory chapter, abstract labor represents a social average of labor time to produce a commodity in order to express its quantitative value during exchange, whereas concrete labor refers to the actual time and place of a specific laboring activity that expresses its qualitative use-value. Chakrabarty offers a useful clarification of abstract labor as a “performative, practical category.” 15 He explains that “abstract labor gave Marx a way of explaining how the capitalist mode of production managed to extract, out of peoples and histories that were all different, a homogenous and common unit for measuring human activity.” 16 Abstract labor is therefore an objective force made up of what Marx describes as a spectral, phantomlike substance: Let us now look at the residue of the products of labour. There is nothing left of them in each case but the same phantom-like objectivity ; there are merely congealed quantities of homogenous human labour, i.e. of human labour-power expended without regard to the form of its expenditure. All these things now tell us is that human labour-power has been expended to produce them, human labour is accumulated in them. As crystals of this social substance, which is common to them all, they are values—commodity values. 17 By aligning Chinese bodies with abstract labor, their labor represents human labor in the abstract . It is this phantomlike objectivity of alien labor that establishes a commodity’s value. White bodies, on the other hand, are symbolically associated with concrete labor, which establishes a commodity’s quality. Such a racial bifurcation of abstract and concrete labor is the work of the commodity fetish, which disguises the social relations behind the products of human labor. In terms of this book’s overarching claim, I argue that a key anchor of North American settler colonialism is an ideology of romantic anticapitalism that reifies a distinction between concrete and abstract social relations out of a misunderstanding of the dialectical nature of capitalism. Romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and pure, on one hand, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of social relations, on the other. It glorifies what it sees as the concrete realm of social relations: white labor, the family, and the train itself—a machine whose concreteness is biologized as the “iron horse.” Alternatively, Chinese bodies are in nearly exclusive alignment with quasi-mechanized labor temporality, excluded from normative social and domestic temporalities. Once Chinese labor is no longer needed, romantic anticapitalism performs an aesthetic function by giving Chinese shape to the unrepresentable: giving bodily form to the abstract, temporal domination of capitalism. In this sense, Chinese labor allegorizes the commensurating function of abstract labor that propels capitalism forward. However, as Chakrabarty notes, for Marx the universal category of abstract labor serves two functions: “It is both a description and a critique of capital.” 18 Following a Queer Marxist approach, this chapter will explore how abstract labor can pose such a critique. The focus on temporality in Kingston’s and Fung’s work also serves to dramatize the impact of industrial technology on conceptions of time in the nineteenth century. In particular, railroad construction was intimately linked to the speed-up and internationalization of uniform time through technological innovation, time-space compression, and the standardization of Greenwich Mean Time. Completing a process of temporal secularization that began in the Middle Ages, time’s progressive detachment from the cosmos and human events was achieved in this period of national expansion and consolidation by rail. No longer did biblical events structure and determine time, as they once did within traditional Jewish and Christian conceptions of history; rather, time became increasingly continuous, homogeneous, and independent of events. 19 Postone refers to this secularized temporality as “abstract time,” “an independent framework within which motion, events, and action occur . . . divisible into equal, constant, nonqualitative units.” 20 Indeed, the progress of abstract time as a dominant form of time parallels the development of capitalism as a socially metabolic totality. In the context of this shift to a more totalizing capitalist temporality, what Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate is how conceptions of time were racialized and sexualized. Indeed, as Petrus Liu specifies, it is a mistake to view socially necessary labor time as solely the mean labor time associated with technological developments but also in terms of its moral dimensions. He clarifies that “the value of a commodity is the amount of human labor embodied in it, but the value of the commodity of human labor is determined by moral and discursive operations outside the capitalist reproduction scheme.” 21 Therefore, on one hand, white labor productivity and its heteronormative reproduction become qualitative expressions of morality and rationality associated with time discipline. As Michael O’Malley explains, there was a need “to protect time’s virtue,” its chastity tied to “scientific discipline requiring years of patient courting to master.” 22 On the other, as I suggest in this chapter, Chinese labor becomes associated with the abstract, quantitative domination of labor time. This is what Postone describes as the “temporal dimension of the abstract domination that characterizes the structures of alienated social relations in capitalism.” 23 Exposing the racialized temporalities of the labor process under capitalism, Kingston and Fung return with queer temporal revisions of labor and reproduction. Time Travel Midway through Richard Fung’s video Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes , the camera draws in on a Chinese Canadian train steward scanning a magazine article titled “Canada’s Railway: A Symbol under Threat.” Several scenes later, the steward is engaged in a passionate kiss with Roger Kwong, a Chinese Canadian journalist for the magazine. After a slow-motion montage of hands caressing undressed bodies, the scene of the two men’s sexual encounter gives way to metaphorical expression through a cut to archival film footage taken from the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR ); the grainy blackand-white film transports the viewer around a bend and into a dark tunnel. Besides the discontinuous temporality staged by the juxtaposition of these two scenes—one fictional and contemporary, the other culled from a historical archive—their temporal dissonance is further accentuated by their distinct cinematic tempos . The sex scene is slow and methodical, while the train hurtles forward on a predetermined path. The possibility of the gay encounter, Fung suggests, is contingent on but temporally dislocated from the predictable linearity of CPR time. The video pushes temporality and sexuality together in a way that simultaneously emphasizes the temporality of racialized sexuality and the sexuality of time on the transcontinental railway. Sex on trains is certainly not isolated to experimental Asian Canadian documentaries such as Fung’s. Perhaps more obviously, the rapid sequence of the scenes above presents a queer citation to a film such as Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest (1959), in which the train similarly serves as a symbolic phallus. In Hitchcock’s version, the train that disappears into a tunnel also—and comically—references sex between Cary Grant’s and Eva Marie Saint’s characters. This kind of sexual symbolism has a long history in the popular culture of the railway. Since the nineteenth century, popular film and visual art representations have commonly depicted the sexuality of trains, which, as Lynne Kirby describes, is “most often as a double for male sexuality.” 24 As a mirrored projection of male virility over a fertile, feminine body, the train symbolizes either (and often both) the aggressively violent or consummating romance of territorial penetration and domestication. Inside the train, the compression of time and space have disorienting effects, such that chance and illicit encounters are not only possible but probable. Therefore, the railway’s temporal duality of social unpredictability and technological predictability nonetheless converge under a dominant symbolism of heterosexual consummation between technology and nature. In other words, the surprise or taboo sexual encounters between passengers who feel out of time and space are not anomalous to the predetermined, linear path of the railway because, as Hitchcock’s film demonstrates, the two lovers ultimately mirror the overarching theme of spatial consummation with their bodies—white heterosexual bodies are always in sync with the temporality of the railroad. But when we loop back to Fung’s CPR , the two strangers are Asian, and gay sex replaces heterosexual white consummation. Through this substitution, the video suggests that disrupting the train’s symbolism with an Asian “anal” tunnel is one reason that the Canadian railway may be “a symbol under threat.” Fung’s documentary diverges from the traditional “romance of the rails” by presenting a montage of narrative layers where, as Lisa Lowe observes, “the journey across geography spatializes a temporal exploration of an unknown past.” 25 Interwoven through the documentary are interviews, archival film and photographic images, dramatized historical scenes, and a fictional travelogue that follows Roger Kwong’s journey from Toronto to Vancouver aboard a CPR train. The documentary does not privilege any one narrative or temporal standpoint, emphasizing instead the interplay of power and narrativity—particularly the racial power embedded in the assembly of historical archives. As Margot Francis observes of the video’s back-and-forth movement between historical analysis and fictional travelogue, “The director suggests that he didn’t want viewers of the tape to feel too secure with either fiction or history.” 26 In its approach to race and sexuality, Fung adapts Michel Foucault’s argument in History of Sexuality that the late nineteenth century did not so much repress sexuality as give rise to a cultural “incitement to speak” about it, leading to a proliferation of discourses and disciplinary apparatuses. 27 Subtitled A History of Heroes , the video examines how it was anti-Chinese sentiment in the nineteenth century that was historically linked to the proliferation of discourses about sexual perversion—at the same time that whiteness was coalescing as a normative category of national citizenship. In Foucauldian fashion, Fung demonstrates how conceptions of racial and sexual normativity were secondary to and relied on racial and sexual otherness for definition. Rather than indict the conflation of racial otherness with sexual perversion, the video’s ironic treatment of perversity is exemplified in its title, Dirty Laundry : it seeks to rework the symbolic interplay of racialized sexuality and labor. Through Roger’s discovery of his great-grandfather’s ambiguous sexuality, the video clears a space outside the temporal frame of official history to identify with sexual fluidity. Moreover, Fung’s video playfully channels the eroticism of dirty laundry, which comes into play when an accidental spill initiates the sexual encounter between Roger and the railway steward. The combination of overlapping temporalities, self-conscious narration, and dramatic reversals and substitutions bring to light the queer modalities of racialized labor history. If we move south to the transcontinental railroad of Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains” in China Men , another Chinese railroad worker performs a different kind of queer identity forged out of temporal dislocation. Whether Ah Goong is wandering alone through the Sierra woods or sitting with his family at the dinner table, he has no qualms about baring his penis and subjecting it to worldly questioning. Contrary to the steel certainty of the train’s anthropomorphized virility, he continually wonders “what it was that it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 28 Scrutinizing the function and reproductive capacity of his body, Ah Goong presents a warped mirror of the train’s phallic symbolism. Far from the pleasures of queer sexuality that Fung’s steward enjoys, Ah Goong’s inward chastisement outwardly questions the relation between male sexuality and gender. His gender and sexual dislocations are reflected in the acute temporal dissonance he experiences as a laboring body. As he works, Ah Goong continually grasps for temporal anchoring while his observations become increasingly unhinged. After he spends three years tunneling through granite with a pickaxe, time becomes a tangible, animate form divorced from a coherent sense of reality: When he stumbled out, he tried to talk about time. “I felt time,” he said. “I saw time. I saw world.” He tried again, “I saw what’s real. I saw time, and it doesn’t move. If we break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway. You translators ought to tell the foreigners that.” 29 The temporality of granite is dissociated from reality and takes on a materiality that Ah Goong feels and sees. The linear, unidirectional pressures of Ah Goong’s labor time confront the seeming immobility of nature, because “it doesn’t move.” Labor time and natural time are presented as frustratingly out of sync with each other, and even if they “break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway.” These temporal disjunctures have alienating gendered and sexual effects on Ah Goong. The temporal alienation Ah Goong experiences during labor is reinforced by the waning influence of a cosmic temporality. For instance, his ritual observance of the summer reunion of the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy—the Altair and Vega star constellations—becomes increasingly irrelevant to him in the face of a new labor temporality. Looking up at the night sky, Ah Goong “saw the order in the stars,” 30 an astrological system that brings comfort because he recognizes them from China. He recounts the story of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy, in which two lovers are so enchanted with one another, “too happy,” that they neglect their work and are punished by the Queen of the Sky. She separates the lovers, “scratch[ing] a river between them.” Taking pity on them, the King of the Sky allows them a reunion once a year: “On the seventh day of the seventh month . . . magpies form a bridge for them to cross to each other.” 31 The discovery of the stars gives Ah Goong something to look forward to: “Every night he located Altair and Vega and gauged how much closer they had come since the night before.” 32 But after the first summer, astrological time seems increasingly disconnected from his own temporal existence. Ah Goong “felt less nostalgia at the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy. . . . The Cowboy’s one year away from his lady was no time at all.” 33 For Ah Goong, cosmic time is progressively divorced from the demands of earth-bound labor time, which, he observes, has kept some Chinese men working in the country for decades. Dispensing with his yearly celebration of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy’s reunion and, later, casting aside the temptations of a pitiful sex worker brought into the camp, Ah Goong’s gender and sexuality become progressively estranged from the consummating imperatives of the railway. He begins to masturbate on the job while lowered in a basket filled with gunpowder and fuses, declaring, “I am fucking the world!” 34 Later, after the railway is complete, he is filled with longing for his own child, a daughter: “He wished for a happy daughter. . . . She would sing for him and listen to him sing.” 35 He is deemed insane by his family, and is eventually lost after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. His consciousness is shaped by an indefinite temporality, and as I develop further in this chapter, it stands in sharp contrast to the gender and sexual imperatives of a consolidating capitalist temporality of the nineteenth century. Departing from an ordered, sequential, and linear vision of time, Fung and Kingston employ forms of substitution as openings for processes of resignification that reimagine time’s relation to race, sexuality, and labor. It is from the dislocated position of abject substitution that time’s normalizing function is exposed. Elizabeth Freeman notes how “one of the most obvious ways that sex meets temporality is in the persistent description of queers as temporally backward, though paradoxically dislocated from any specific historical moment.” 36 From the displaced vantage of the historically dislocated position of Chinese labor, therefore, Kingston and Fung’s texts denaturalize capitalist temporality while reimagining “how time makes bodies and subjects.” 37 As capitalism expands and increasingly regulates all aspects of labor and social life in the nineteenth century, we can discern how the morality and character-building activity of concrete labor both structures and reinforces the social and cultural structures of family and leisure. The temporality of the home, which schedules gendered activity, moral education, heterosexual reproduction, progress, and futurity, is thus a crucial regulator of the labor process. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts elucidate, the temporality of work and family become embodied by whiteness, a category imbued with morality, belonging, and social necessity. In contrast, the Chinese are identified with a perverse domesticity whose homosociality forecloses any sense of reproductive futurity. Excluded from the moral category of concrete labor, Chinese labor is instead associated with processes of valorization associated with productivity and time, an abstract force that injects temporal volatility into the concrete labor process. Personifying the capitalist adage “Time is money,” therefore, the substitutions present in Kingston and Fung’s texts expose the aesthetic function of romantic anticapitalism. That white labor appears more “concrete” than Chinese labor is one of the fetishized tropes of capitalism that, as Marx writes, “conceals the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual workers, by making those relations appear as relations between material objects, instead of revealing them plainly.” 38 In the following two sections I explore the way Fung and Kingston respond to the capitalist imperatives of temporal consolidation, one which aligns Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism while simultaneously subverting it. As personifications of the “phantom-like objectivity” 39 of abstract labor, the Chinese laborers of Kingston’s and Fung’s texts stage alternative temporalities, inserting a queer temporal vitality that animates Chakrabarty’s conception of History 2, a historical formation that he describes as the “excess that capital . . . always needs but can never quite control or domesticate.” 40 These are the vital forces that form a constant resistance to capital: “the abstract living labor—a sum of muscles, nerves, and consciousness/will—that, according to Marx, capital posits as its contradictory starting point all the time.” 41 Alien Labor as Dangerous Supplement During the three years that Ah Goong tunnels through granite mountain in China Men , he undergoes profound psychological disembodiment insofar as he becomes progressively unable to distinguish the tangible from the abstract. As he tunnels, his sensory ability becomes estranged, and his perception of the material world reflects his temporal imprisonment in labor, where “a mountain is the same as permanence and time”: 42 His eyes couldn’t see, his nose couldn’t smell; and now his ears were filled with the noise of hammering. This rock is what is real, he thought. This rock is what real is, not clouds or mist, which make mysterious promises, and when you go through them are nothing. 43 Ah Goong’s experience of temporal suspension against the impenetrability of rock bankrupts the hope or mystery suggested by “clouds or mist.” History is reduced to rock. Later, after the bosses replace pickaxes with dynamite, which “added more accidents and ways of dying,” 44 he is further disoriented in time. After blasting through a tunnel in winter, he begins to think that “it was the task of the human race to quicken the world, blast the freeze, fire it, redden it with blood.” 45 Experiencing the shift to the quickening pace of industrial time, Ah Goong tries to counteract the disjuncture of labor speed and the delay of the natural world: He had to change the stupid slowness of one sunrise and one sunset per day. He had to enliven the silent world with sound. “The rock,” he tried to tell the others. “The ice.” “Time.” 46 Responding to the asynchrony of labor time and natural time, Ah Goong attempts to resignify the natural world using the sound of words, which fail to signify new meaning. As natural time cleaves from the laboring body, the Chinese laborers who die from explosions become increasingly disembodied forms, “like puppets [who] made Ah Goong laugh crazily as if the arms and legs would come together again.” When he is suspended in his dynamite-lined basket, Ah Goong renders human life abstract: “Godlike, he watched men whose faces he could not see and whose screams he did not hear roll and bounce and slide like a handful of sprinkled gravel.” 47 From puppets to sprinkled gravel, human life is progressively stripped of vitality. As both witness to and subject of the disembodying effects of abstract time, Ah Goong articulates both the inadequacy and potential of the living body. As he lifts his hammer, he tells the men working beside him that “a man ought to be made of tougher material than flesh. . . . Skin is too soft.” 48 The impenetrability of the wall further underscores his corporeal lack: “Nothing happened to that gray wall. . . . It had no softer or weaker spots anywhere, the same hard gray.” 49 He remarks to his friends, “Our bones ought to be filled with iron.” 50 Ah Goong’s recognition of the dehumanizing demands of abstract labor time emphasizes a central contradiction of a capitalist mode of production. Within capitalism’s drive to accumulate by speeding up time and compressing space, its tendency is to replace human labor with machines, or “bones . . . filled with iron.” As Chakrabarty notes, “Capital is thus faced with its own contradiction: it needs abstract and living labor as the starting point in its cycle of self-reproduction, but it also wants to reduce to a minimum the quantum of living labor it needs.” 51 Thus, connecting this contradiction to History 2, we find that the crucial variable embedded within abstract labor—a variable that capitalism requires but continuously tries to eliminate—is human life itself, an innately conscious and willing indeterminate force. It is the capacity of being “living” that makes labor a potential source of resistance to capitalist abstraction. The resistance of vitalism, as Chakrabarty elucidates, is such that “life, in Marx’s analysis of capital, is . . . in a ‘standing fight’ against the process of abstraction that is constitutive of the category labor.” 52 Expressing a queer vitalism that upsets the reproduction of a capitalist temporality, Ah Goong’s performance of racialized labor as a sexual act queers the value-generating temporality of abstract labor. In the much-discussed scene of Ah Goong’s compulsion to masturbate while lowered in a basket filled with dynamite and declaring, “I am fucking the world,” he taps into the vital excess of abstract labor. In debates over the political registers of the scene, critics identify these acts as expressions of either sexual frustration or resistance. For Donald Goellnicht, his masturbation signals the “loss and frustration caused by emasculation” 53 in the face of sexual deprivations in the railroad labor camps, suggesting that his sexuality is a belated formation, foreclosed until an unknown future. On the other hand, as David Eng suggests, his autoerotic behavior can be interpreted as staging an act of resistance, “us[ing] his penis to make a statement of racial protest . . . to his devalued racial position in America.” 54 Tomo Hattori extends the resistant registers of masturbation, not as a “pathetic substitution for and failure to engage in ‘real’ sex,” 55 but as an expression of Ah Goong’s “critique of the heterosexual and masculinist pretensions of his masters.” 56 In this case, his masturbation represents a suspended challenge to the linear, reproductive frame of heterosexual consummation. Extending these analyses of his act’s resistant potential, I call attention to the notion of masturbation as dangerous supplement. In Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s privileging of speech over writing, nature over culture, and presence over absence, he pays special attention to Rousseau’s discussion of masturbation. In The Confessions , Rousseau expresses guilt over frequently succumbing to the compulsion to masturbate in the absence of his lover, Therese. He calls masturbation a “dangerous supplement,” 57 regarding the act as a secondary, subordinate addition to the primary and original act of sexual intercourse. But Derrida points to the double meaning of the supplement, as both supplying something that is missing and supplying something additional. Derrida’s insight is that the supplement is what sets the terms that make possible the privileged status of the first entity. Supplementarity is the manifestation of the deferral that deconstructs the integrity of the sexual act, which is assumed to be perfect and complete. Applying this notion of supplementarity to Ah Goong’s masturbatory “fucking” of the world, we can examine how his act ventriloquizes the dynamite’s literal “fucking” of the world. As a mode of writing, Ah Goong’s masturbation gives him discursive presence and embodiment that corrupts the logic of equivalence that capitalism extracts as abstract labor. Moreover, Ah Goong’s masturbation blurs the hierarchical distinction between work and play. Masturbation becomes an expression of queer vitalism that frustrates the homogeneity of abstract labor. Simultaneously, the queer vitalism he stages frustrates the capitalist logics of heterosexual reproduction. In his examination of nationalism and sexuality in the nineteenth century, George Mosse notes that masturbation was likened to “throwing money out the window,” 58 causing impotence and threatening depopulation. And given that masturbation activates, as Tomo Hattori explains, an “autoerotic homosexuality . . . [because] the onanist, as both the subject and object of erotic action, is the same gender as itself,” 59 Ah Goong’s sexual difference defies the logic of equivalence embedded in abstract labor while disidentifying with the capitalist project of national consummation. The queer vitalism of Ah Goong’s masturbation may also leverage a more dangerous supplementarity to the temporal domination of abstract labor than the labor strike he participates in. Animating the dehumanization of technological speed-up—whereby technology expands the exploitation of human labor—the Chinese workers are presented with a “four-dollar raise per month” that comes with the “‘opportunity to put in more time’ . . . ‘Two more hours per shift.’ Ten-hour shifts inside the tunnels.” 60 The “railroad demons” reason that “‘now that you have dynamite, the work isn’t so hard.’” 61 In response, the Chinese laborers recognize the temporal domination of abstract labor through the inhuman push to mechanize their bodies: “‘A human body can’t work like that.’ ‘The demons don’t believe this is a human body. This is a chinaman’s body.’” 62 Here the racialization of labor translates into a temporal embodiment of abstract labor. When the Chinese workers decide to resist by going on strike, the strike serves to halt the capitalist temporality of labor and becomes a supplementary form of leisure time. On strike, the men emerge as nonequivalents: The ones who were sleeping slept on and rose as late as they pleased. They bathed in streams and shaved their moustaches and wild bears. Some went fishing and hunting. The violinists tuned and played their instruments. The drummers beat theirs at the punchlines of jokes. The gamblers shuffled and played their cards and tiles. The smokers passed their pipes, and the drinkers bet for drinks by making figures with their hands. The cooks made party food. 63 However, rather than a dangerous supplement that destroys the coherent division of work and labor, the strike also serves as a kind of “obscene supplement,” which Slavoj Žižek defines as less a subversion of capitalism than “an obstacle which is simultaneously the ‘condition of possibility’ of the exercise of Power.” 64 The strike operates as an obscene supplement in the sense that the China Men’s victory is a qualified one. The foremen eventually grant a four-dollar raise without lengthening the working day, but this is far less than the fourteen-dollar increase the Chinese laborers demanded. Because the Irish workers refused to join the strike, rejecting their invitation by calling the Chinese strikers “Cheap John Chinaman,” 65 Chinese labor remains aligned with the temporal domination of abstract labor. The strike ultimately serves to uphold rather than undermine capitalism by safeguarding the vital human limits of abstract labor time. Thus when the strike is over, there is no celebration. The China Men merely resume their work within a capitalist temporality. Kingston writes, “The China Men went back to work quietly. No use singing and shouting over a compromise and losing nine days’ work.” 66 In this case, abstract labor functions less as History 2 than as History 1, which Chakrabarty defines as “the past ‘established’ by capital because History 1 lends itself to the reproduction of capitalist relationships.” 67 Ultimately, Kingston presents the irony of capitalism’s demand for equivalence and substitution performed by fungible alien labor. When the railroad is complete, race complicates the logic of endless substitution—of alien supplementarity—by projecting the concreteness of white railroad laborers through photographs and commemorative celebration at Promontory, Utah, in 1869. The white workers declare that “only Americans could have done it.” 68 Chinese labor remains abstract and, as such, invisible: “Ah Goong does not appear in railroad photographs.” 69 As Eng clarifies, here “American emphatically does not include Chinese , as the China Men are driven out and their racialized labor is transformed into an abstracted whiteness.” 70 Kingston emphasizes these processes of abstraction and performative substitution at the completion ceremony when a Chinese worker becomes what Eng calls a “body double” 71 for the white man who drives in the commemorative last spike: “A white demon in a top hat tap-tapped on the gold spike, and pulled it back out. Then one China Man held the real spike, the steel one, and another hammered it in.” 72 In this scene Kingston reverses the projections of abstraction and concreteness. Here we see that the steel, as an inferior supplement to gold, is what constitutes the “real.” The Chinese man who hammers it in is as concrete as the steel that consummates the nation, while the golden spike and the white man remain abstract, fetishized symbols of value. As Eng explains, the scene “underscores the splitting of the real from representation, of reality from the ways it is reconfigured in the laminating photograph that memorializes the event.” 73 By dramatizing the role of representation in romanticized projections of concrete white labor, Kingston allegorizes the way racial difference can be sublated into an abstract supplement of white labor while also serving an aesthetic function by giving Chinese form to the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality that is otherwise unrepresentable. Unlike Kingston’s text, Dirty Laundry ’s focus is less on the actual labor process entailed in railroad construction in Canada from 1881 to 1885 than its aftermath. In particular, Fung’s video provides a complementary view of the ideological forces behind Ah Goong’s experience of “The Driving Out” 74 that follows the completion ceremony at Promontory. When Chinese labor is no longer indispensable, Ah Goong realizes, “It was dangerous to stay.” 75 What Fung’s video explores is how abstract labor becomes aligned with racialized perversity and vice that fuels the ideological basis for expulsion, making it “dangerous to stay.” Incorporating themes of substitution, Dirty Laundry further reinforces the concrete attributes of white labor and abstract qualities of Chinese labor. In the video’s dramatization of sections of the 1885 Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration , we see how concrete white labor is associated with a normativity defined by temporal discipline that sets the parameters of work, leisure, and reproduction. At the same time, Chinese exclusion from normative temporalities of domestic life become manifestations of the destructive attributes of abstract labor. Personifying the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality, the Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration casts Chinese men as a destructive, perverse force that threatens the social order. As historian Dora Nipp, one of the video’s interviewees, explains, the railroad became a historical marker that separated abstract Chinese labor from perverse labor: “Initially when Chinese labor was needed for the labor, nothing bad was said about them. Once their labor was no longer welcome, then you hear about vices; you hear about prostitution, leprosy, all kinds of illnesses. . . . [Writers] dwelled on the exotic, the exaggerated, the evil.” The range of racial, gender, and sexual substitutions that Fung’s video explores offers a different view of the perversity that becomes associated with the abstract qualities of Chinese labor. Substitution, as repetition with a difference, becomes a visual theme that anchors the video’s fictional, archival, and documentary fragments. In particular, the visual refrain that interposes the entire video begins with a Chinese couple: the woman sitting behind her husband braiding his queue before he departs for Canada. The audio that accompanies the scene is of a woman’s voice that asks, “Who will braid your hair? Who will cook your rice? Who will wash your clothes? Who will warm your bed?” This scene undergoes multiple substitutions throughout the course of the video, establishing a core thematic refrain that frames the video’s other substitutions. In the first metamorphosis, the wife is replaced by a man, and it is a male voice that asks the series of questions that ends with “Who will warm your bed?” And when we fast-forward to the video’s conclusion, the scene depicts a contemporary lesbian couple without audio to accompany the scene. In light of the fungibility of abstract labor, one significance of these substitutions is that they redefine substitution not as interchangeability but as repetition with difference. Rather than the undifferentiated assemblage of muscles and nerves that constitute abstract labor—what Marx describes as “human labour-power in its fluid state” 76 —these substitutions highlight gender and sexual difference. Further, that the scene’s visual refrain occurs in an intimate domestic space where one lover is braiding the other’s hair reinforces the affective dimensions of abstract labor. The repetition of this scene of domesticity counteracts the perverse domesticity to which Chinese labor is consigned. Moreover, working against the fetishism that misrepresents the dual character of commodity-determined labor, one that constitutes a social universe characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions, the substitutions keep the viewer alert to the normative cues and expectations that buffer and conceal the truth of social relations. As I explore below, Fung’s substitutions present an allegory of racial fetishism that emerges around abstract alien labor. Employing different forms of substitution that emphasize the defensive attributes of whiteness, Fung’s video makes explicit connections between abstract labor and vice by drawing from the Royal Commission Report on Chinese Immigration . This was a report compiled in 1884 to study “objections to the influx of the Chinese People into Canada,” which, as Fung’s video notes, “leads to a Head Tax in 1885, the year the Canadian Pacific Railway is completed and Chinese labor is no longer needed.” The study’s primary methodology is to examine the Chinese restrictions in place in sister settler colonies, the United States and Australia, gathering “evidence” in Queensland and San Francisco by interviewing diverse classes of white male “witnesses” to testify on the subject of Chinese immigration. Among the array of subjects, Fung focuses on testimony that addresses Chinese labor and “sodomy,” a subject heading that appears in the actual report. Unlike the forms of substitution in Kingston’s China Men that align Chinese labor with the technological speed-up of abstract labor, Fung’s video uses substitution ironically to examine the fungibility of whiteness. It is from the position of generic whiteness that negative, perverse content is cast onto the Chinese embodiment of abstract labor. FIGURE 1.2 Miner (video still). From Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes by Richard Fung. Courtesy of the artist. A scene depicting a white miner’s metamorphosis into a senator dramatizes the class convergence of whiteness, which Francis describes as a performance of “authorial transvestism,” observing how the “the senator’s ventriloquism (transgressing the boundaries of class) functions in the interests of white racial dominance.” 77 The white miner (figure 1.2 ), clad in a dusty work shirt and suspenders, begins the monologue discussing his heteronormative duties and domestic comforts, which become grounds for him to question the moral citizenship of Chinese men. He explains that in terms of labor, all is equivalent, but the costs of reproducing their respective labors puts the white miner at a distinct disadvantage. By the conclusion of his speech, the white miner has undergone metamorphosis into Senator Jones of Nevada, dressed in a black suit and bowtie (figure 1.3 ). The content of the testimony reveals the immorality and degraded nature of abstract labor when transposed to the temporal sanctity of the domestic realm: FIGURE 1.3 Senator (video still).

But after I’ve maintained my family and performed these duties, not much is left of my wages when the week is ended. How is it with the Chinese? The Chinaman can do as much work underground as I can. He has no wife and family. He performs none of these duties. Forty or fifty of his kind can live in a house no larger than mine. He craves no variety of food. He has inherited no taste for comfort or for social enjoyment. Conditions that satisfy him and make him contented would make my life not worth living. The white miner and senator align the Chinese body exclusively with a homogenized labor disposition. A Chinese body does not have the capacity for domestic enjoyment, community engagement, or social reproduction, which threatens the temporal stability of “socially necessary labor time.” He continues to exaggerate the subhuman conditions of Chinese existence by commenting on the cramped living conditions, lack of enjoyable food, and lack of social taste, conditions that “would make my life not worth living.” It is precisely the deprivations of Chinese domesticity and civic life that render Chinese labor nonhuman and therefore unfair competition. When the miner transforms into Senator Jones of Nevada, the politician’s more confident voice and political status lend further legitimacy to the miner’s complaint. Adding an air of authority to the miner’s lamentations, Senator Jones makes a strong appeal against the Chinese: “The Chinaman comes in taking advantage of our skill, of our toil, and of our struggles, driving us from fields of industry which we have created and which our race alone can create.” Conveying the unity of whiteness through the substitution of the senator for the miner, their casting of Chinese men as a destructive labor form emphasizes the parasitic effects of abstract labor on a concrete white labor host. What is also significant in the testimony is the senator’s clear glorification of industrialization—the “fields of industry we have created and which our race alone can create”—emphasizes the concrete value of white labor’s “skill . . . toil . . . struggles.” This view of the white industrial laborer becomes the romantic anticapitalist counterpoint to the abstract status of Chinese labor who has no social value except to “take advantage.” Both the miner and the senator thus attribute a destructive power to the Chinese, one that is constituted by his nonsocial, parasitic, and abstract qualities. Fung’s subsequent dramatizations of testimony from the Royal Commission report incorporate experimental forms of bodily and textual substitution that emphasize processes of signification and resignification. As Roger thumbs through the section on sodomy, the testimonies of a detective, a San Francisco merchant, and a former resident of China come to life to reinforce the perversity attached to Chinese bodies, whose temporal otherness is constituted through figurative alignment with labor duration and social nonreproduction. Their testimony on sodomy is presented in a continuous sequence: Detective C. C. Cox: Cases of the most revolting crime came before them, for instance of which all details could if necessary be supplied with that of a man who cut out the penis of another who refused to submit to his degrading desires. San Francisco Merchant Thomas H. King: Sodomy is a habit. Sometimes thirty or forty boys leaving Hong Kong in apparently good health before arriving here will be found to be afflicted about the anus with venereal diseases. And on questioning the Chinese doctors, they admitted that it was a common practice among them. Six Years Resident of China John T. Tobin: I’ve never seen sodomy committed between men and men but I have seen it with beasts and detected them in the act with hogs, dogs, and ducks. But not in a great number of cases. The cumulative effect of these testimonies is to attach bestial perversity to the disembodied form of the Chinese male body. No longer simply the socially abstract and destructive figure that the miner and senator argue “takes advantage” of hardworking, civic-minded white men of industry, perversity becomes the manifest social attribute of the abstract power of the Chinese laborer, a perversity that John T. Tobin links to animals. As queer countermemory, the video offers a parody of this “revolting” trajectory of Chinese disembodiment that coalesces around a severed penis, an infected anus, and—more humorously—a duck’s rear accompanied by an audible “quack.” A later scene depicting a doctor’s defense of Chinese sexual morality captures the relation of substitution as signification at stake in the Royal Commission testimonies. The scene opens to Roger, who appears in the role of a nineteenth-century Chinese laborer. He is bare-chested and moves slowly into a darkened room. As he moves across the screen, the text of the Royal Commission is projected onto his body, while the edge of the screen is illuminated to showcase the testimony of Mr. E. Stevenson, MD , of Victoria, British Columbia. As Mr. Stevenson speaks, his words are projected onto Roger’s body. Mr. Stevenson offers an impassioned defense of the Chinese on the subject of their sexual morality: Gentlemen, you have heard several witnesses testify unfavorably on this Chinese question and they have said they infer so-and-so. And from the fact that so many Chinese males are here and so few Chinese females, it has been inferred by certain people that, I hesitate to say it, that sodomy was by them practiced. I stamp it a damnable slander. A man who so acts bears the mark of Cain not only on his forehead but all over him. The visual effect of character substitution, of redeploying Roger into the role of Chinese laborer, is to clarify Roger’s contemporary relationship to the past, to his sexually ambiguous great-grandfather who worked on the CPR , and to the nation’s history of sexuality. Substitution thus becomes a supplementary modality for Roger’s countermemorial connection to history and sexual identity—bringing forth Derrida’s notion of supplementarity as something that both replaces and adds to. On one level, Stevenson’s testimony defends the honor of the Chinese and draws not on myth but on the demographic realities of the tremendous disparity in the population ratio of Chinese men to Chinese women, which fostered the development of segregated “bachelor” communities in North America. However, on another level, Stevenson’s testimony remains tied to the earlier white witnesses’ condemnation of Chinese perversity in asserting his symbolic power over the sign of race. Whether for or against Chinese immigration, the Chinese body remains an abstract object onto which racial and sexual discourse are literally and figuratively projected. The pages from the Royal Commission report that are projected onto Roger’s body become the textual representation of the Chinese body. He becomes an abstract screen for the projection of textual content. Moreover, Stevenson’s reference to the mark of Cain adds another layer of irony to the system of signification. When he notes how the mark of Cain appears “not only on his forehead but all over him,” Stevenson amplifies the racial meaning of the mark, connecting sexual perversion to racial embodiment. As he speaks, Roger’s body moves slowly out of the darkness; he pauses to highlight Stevenson’s words “mark of . . . ,” which remain projected on his chest until the words disappear as he exits into partial lightness toward Stevenson (figure 1.4 ). As Roger’s character comes face to face with Stevenson, it becomes clear that Stevenson himself is a holographic projection, underscoring their divergent temporalities. He falls short of reaching Stevenson before becoming shrouded again by dark shadows. The ambiguity surrounding Roger’s disappearance back into darkness is such that it is unclear whether the darkness that envelops his body is itself the “mark of Cain” or is, instead, a form of representative absence—a moment of unsignification. In either case, as the personification of abstract labor, the sexualization of the Chinese racial body is the discursively constituted and ideological effect of the disciplinary apparatus of an intensifying capitalist temporality. Moreover, rather than sanitize the “dirty laundry” of Chinese labor, Fung undercuts the heteronormative recuperation of Chinese sexual otherness by highlighting instead the discursive constitution of racialized sexual perversion and its ideological effects. Fung is careful to contextualize the range of substitutions and modes of signification that emerge from these testimonies in a broader international context. Interspersed throughout the Royal Commission testimonies are frames of onscreen text. One indicates that “in 1885, the year Canada institutes the Head Tax, Britain criminalizes all sexual activity between men as ‘gross indecency.’” Several frames later, additional onscreen text reads, “In Germany in 1892, the word homosexuality is first used in public,” which is quickly followed by “Heterosexuality is coined later.” By presenting a larger international frame for the projection of perversity onto the Chinese in Canada, Fung highlights the historical intersection of industrial capitalism and the desire to sexualize labor difference. What the video suggests is that the Royal Commission report represents less a narrative of testimony than a genealogy of settler crisis that turns on shifting social relations brought on by the new temporalities of industrial capitalism.

Queer Temporalities of History 2 In contrast to the jubilant embodiment and incorporation contained in the white settler mythology of the transcontinental railway, China Men and Dirty Laundry incorporate temporal symbols of disembodied abstraction and social exclusion. In particular, the temporality of linear progress associated with railroad technology is suspended, fractured, and defamiliarized. These texts “see” and “feel” time, as Ah Goong proclaims. But though they exemplify the dehumanizing forces of capitalism’s abstraction of labor time, Kingston’s and Fung’s texts nevertheless reject the disciplinary temporality of normative kinship, linear progress, and reproduction. If “time is a body,” their bodies gesture to a temporal embodiment whose relations and modes of belonging unfold as History 2. As Chakrabarty states, “In the reproduction of its own life-process, capital encounters relationships that present it with double possibilities. . . . History 2’s are thus not pasts separate from capital; they are pasts that inhere in capital and yet interrupt and punctuate the run of capital’s own logic.” 78 Imagining relations that do not contribute to capital’s self-reproduction, Kingston and Fung present the queer temporalities of History 2. For Ah Goong, the embodiment of a queer temporality is anchored by maternal longing and matrilineality. In his repeated, self-directed questioning of the meaning or purpose of a man’s life, the literal and symbolic value of his penis leads him to gender resignification. During the Chinese railroad strike, Ah Goong wanders the forests pondering the value of masculinity symbolized by his penis: he “just looked at it, wondering what it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 79 Within the evolution of his gender resignification, Ah Goong questions not only the norms associated with masculine power but also the symbolic burdens he’s forced to contend with. His thoughts turn to the “rumor of an Injun woman called Woman Chief, who led a nomadic fighting tribe from the eastern plains as far as these mountains. She was so powerful that she had four wives and many horses.” 80 The juxtaposition of these seemingly unrelated reflections present to Ah Goong the quandary of settler colonialism. While Ah Goong never sees Woman Chief, the rumor of her existence displaces the gender, sexual, and spatial norms he associates with masculinity. Instead of expressing paternalistic control over a virginal, “empty” landscape, the Woman Chief’s defense of her land becomes an embodiment of matrilineal power. Having experienced the disembodied passages of alien labor time, Ah Goong’s disillusionment leads him to express a distinctly maternal and matrilineal reproductive desire that reverses the normative paternalism and reproductive logic of white settler colonialism. During the “driving out” of Chinese labor after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire conveys itself through an actively resignified gender lens. As he passes a farm, he finds an “imp child”; he stops and the baby crawls into his lap. He tells the child, “I wish you were my baby. . . . ‘My daughter,’ he said. ‘My son.’ He couldn’t tell whether it was a boy or a girl.” 81 Here Ah Goong’s reproductive desire follows a matrilineal arc because it operates outside the norms of blood lineage and paternal inheritance in which strict gender codes are embedded. Not knowing whether the child is a boy or a girl, Ah Goong displaces gender codes altogether. The disembodying temporality of railroad labor here productively disorients the iterative temporality on which gender construction relies. Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire comes into fullest relief after his return to China, when he attempts to substitute the fourth of his four sons with an unwanted baby girl born to neighbors down the road. Disappointed that he has only sons and jealous of his neighbors’ daughter, Ah Goong is considered insane, a “man who did not know the value of what he had” 82 with four sons. After secretly trading his son for the daughter, he feels that “with his soul he adopted her, full diaper and all.” 83 Later, when he is forced to return the girl, “Ah Goong clung to his baby as if she were holding him up.” 84 Without hope of realizing his reproductive desires, he rejects all sense of masculine propriety. It is this reproductive failure that causes him to begin “taking his penis out at the dinner table, worrying it, wondering at it, asking why it had given him four sons and no daughter, chastising it, asking it whether it were yet capable of producing the daughter of his dreams.” 85 He becomes a figure of parodic masculinity, whose frequent exhibitionism—“yank[ing] open that greatcoat—no pants” 86 —underscores the phallic unfulfillment of normative paternalistic kinship. But Ah Goong’s story doesn’t end with the pessimism of alien temporality; rather, it emphasizes its continual deferral of linear time. After his return to China, he embarks yet again for Gold Mountain and arrives in San Francisco. But here the linear trajectory of his narrative unravels, divorcing space from temporality. Kingston offers multiple narrative possibilities. In the first, Ah Goong is in an underground arsenal under Chinatown, “inside the earth,” 87 and is presumed to have died during the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906: “Some say he died falling into the cracking earth.” 88 In another version he is brought back to China because “he was not making money; he was a homeless wanderer, a shiftless, dirty, jobless man with matted hair, ragged clothes, and fleas all over his body. He ate out of garbage cans. He was a louse eaten by lice. A fleaman.” 89 The narrator offers a final possibility: “Maybe he hadn’t died in San Francisco, it was just his papers that burned.” 90 In this version he emerges from the “miraculous earthquake and fire,” 91 which burned down the Hall of Records so that “every China Man was reborn out of that fire a citizen.” 92 Ah Goong’s rebirth is accompanied by another birth: “He had been seen carrying a child out of the fire, a child of his own in spite of the laws against marrying.” 93 Each of these versions capture elements of Ah Goong’s temporal and spatial estrangement as an undisciplined subject of capitalist social relations: living underground, as a “homeless wanderer,” and finally as a father. This reorganization of time, space, and identity is further accentuated by the earthquake, a crisis event that will interfere with the discursive constitution of Chinese bodies as “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” In the final version, where Ah Goong emerges phoenixlike from the fire, he becomes an agent of resignification. As Eng notes, “Like the elimination of a single term in a sign chain, the burning of the Hall of Records—the literal destruction of these particular documents—demands a subsequent shift in meaning, a shift in the relational terms that attempt to shore up the historical ruins of the archive.” 94 The narrator surmises, “He had built a railroad out of sweat, why not have an American child out of longing?” 95 However, the fulfillment of his “longing” for kinship does not reproduce the temporal discipline of heteronormative reproduction; rather, it expresses a mode of belonging that symbolically fulfills his matrilineal desire. Ah Goong occupies a queer temporality in which alien survival and reproduction arise outside of the temporal discipline of settler capitalism. Countering the symbolic role of the child to reproduce normative logics and values of white life, what Lee Edelman refers to as the “absolute value of reproductive futurism,” Ah Goong’s “child out of longing” represents the potentiality of matrilineal desire and, against settler biopower, expresses an alien mode of survival. In the aftermath of the earthquake and fire, many of those kin relations will be impurely, discursively constituted as “paper sons.” As such, the alien child does not represent the guaranteed futurity of white settler colonialism but a potential deferral of patrilineal reproduction while promoting the fictive, queer kinship of alien longing as one temporality of History 2. The politics of embodiment are thus expressed in China Men through Ah Goong’s gender resignification, which rejects the paternalistic codes of setter territorialization and temporal discipline. At the same time, by foregrounding a matrilineal identity that values daughters and empowers women, Ah Goong expresses various desires that intersect with transgender embodiment. Expressing gender and sexual difference as modes of embodiment, he interrupts the stability of gender and its assumed correspondence to biological sex. As an articulation of transgender identifications, Ah Goong disrupts what Susan Stryker identifies as the presumed “‘wholeness’ of the body and ‘sameness’ of its sex . . . [as] socially constructed.” 96 Desiring a daughter, “fucking the world,” and berating his penis, Ah Goong confounds the equivalence of sex and gender, highlighting instead how “‘sex’ is a mash-up, a story we mix about how the body means, which parts matter most, and how they register in our consciousness or field of vision.” 97 In the context of nineteenth-century labor, Ah Goong’s transgender expression is significant in its disidentification with a notion of equivalence. In other words, his identity is not an expression of an abstract equivalence that can be substituted under the homogenizing process of labor under capitalism, where equality is an enforced condition of alienation. 98 Indeed, as David Harvey puts it: “There is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals; how the equality presupposed in the market exchange of things deludes us into a belief in the equality of persons.” 99 In Ah Goong’s performance of gender and sexual difference, he attaches the logic of equivalence that abstracts labor into homogeneous temporal units of human labor to a profoundly masculine logic. Moreover, in his rejection of the terms of equivalence that counteract the reproduction of capitalist logic, he embodies the potential of History 2. In Dirty Laundry the themes of embodiment, retrieval, and difference are captured in the idea of “family resemblance” that becomes part of the narrative frame for the video’s historical and fictional sections. The fictional travelogue centered on Roger brings together ideas of queer temporality in order to reanimate and embody Chinese Canadian history. What’s at stake in this history is presented as a mystery surrounding the sexual identity of his great-grandfather, whose framed picture Roger’s father has insisted he take along with him on his business trip. When he accidentally breaks the frame to reveal a hidden photographic portrait of his grandfather touching hands with another man, he is unsure how to interpret the photograph. The broken picture frame becomes a visual metaphor for what Lowe calls an “alternative mode of inquiry” that allows us to move beyond “the singular history that frames a particular image of Chinese immigrant labour . . . that memorializes the static, single artifact.” 100 But in the context of figurative and thematic substitutions that the video foregrounds, the hidden photograph presents a queer opening that works against the fetish to reveal rather than conceal the features of an alien labor temporality. The analysis of the mysterious photograph expands rather than contracts the range of historical possibilities that relate to Chinese sexuality and assumed perversion. Although Roger admits to the train steward that he doesn’t “know how to read” the revealed photograph, the Chinese steward responds, “This is normal in China. . . . Men hold hands.” As Francis observes, the steward’s reply raises the “question of how the ‘normal’ is constituted in different cultural contexts and historical eras.” 101 After they have sex, Roger asks the steward, “You know what you were saying about men holding hands. What does it mean?” The steward replies, “That they like each other, they’re brothers. . . . It’s a smart thing. If they’re lovers, no one asks any questions.” This “smart thing” is the illegibility of queer historiography. The video does not impose a teleology of queer becoming. In many ways, the linear direction of identity formation in the traditional bildungsroman is frustrated here. It is the unresolved, illegible queer history that animates Roger’s quest to engage in genealogy. The ambiguity of the great-grandfather’s sexuality is what is given ontological priority in the video as an expression of pre-Stonewall conceptions of sexual difference. As Nayan Shah underscores in one of the video’s interviews, “The whole notion that sexual identity is your identity, that somehow who you desire and who you sleep with and who you have sexual pleasures with somehow says something very revealing about you, is a completely new notion.” Just as Ah Goong’s gender resignification takes on a “perverse” relation to masculinist norms, the ambiguity of Roger’s great-grandfather’s sexual identity frustrates the growing “incitement to speak” that Foucault attributes to the rise of liberal individualism in the late nineteenth century. The point is, his great-grandfather’s sexual ambiguity, its deferral of concrete meaning, stands as the content of his difference. Here again, the emphasis on sexual difference frustrates a logic of equivalence that capitalism abstracts out of human labor. In the video’s final frame, the photograph comes to life as the great-grandfather and friend/lover walk out of the frame, away from the photographer’s studio backdrop. That the photographic subjects are roles played by Roger and the steward creates a correspondence between historical and contemporary notions of same-sex affiliation without collapsing contemporary sexual identities with what Francis describes as the “homosocial ambiguities of history.” 102 Rather, the substitution of Roger and the steward for their historical predecessors highlights the role of sexuality for reanimating abstract conceptions of labor and history. In its focus on family genealogy, the video offers a narrative of literal and figurative family resemblances that traces alternative modes of affiliation and belonging that do not reproduce capitalism’s disciplinary temporalities. As countermemory, Dirty Laundry rejects the iconicity of both the lonely Chinese bachelor and the sexually perverse Chinese body and replaces them with an empty stage that frustrates the reproductive, linear trajectory of History 1. My argument in this chapter has focused on the way Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate how the fusion of temporal otherness and sexual vice converge into a biological expression of abstract alien labor. Their experimental forms offer a new context for understanding why the first immigration laws in Canada and the United States were passed in the aftermath of railroad construction to prevent the infiltration and proliferation of abstract alien labor. Although a comparatively smaller population, the fact that Chinese students, diplomats, and merchants were exempted from immigration restriction laws in the United States and Canada exemplifies the way perversity was identified with the particular features of industrial labor within a capitalist mode of production. I have situated Kingston’s and Fung’s texts as responses to the celebrated temporality of the telegram that began this chapter that exposes the censored content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese laborer. This is the literal and figurative backside of the normative settler temporality celebrated on the face of the telegram. Against the homogenizing logic of racial equivalence, Kingston and Fung present queer recuperations of the “perverse” temporalities of alien labor within the consolidating logic of settler colonial capitalism. In their countermemories of the history of settler national unification by rail, their texts expose the logics of racialized alignment between alien bodies and abstract labor. Exploring queer temporalities of History 2, they counteract the logics of substitution as equivalence that reproduce a capitalist labor temporality of expanding the working day and speed-up. In the next chapter, I turn to the other side of the antinomical view of capitalist relations: romantic anticapitalism’s hypostatizing of the concrete, natural, thingly side of the antinomy. Drawing on the 1920s and 1930s as the apex of anti-Asian animosity and exclusionary immigration policy in both Canada and the United States, I explore the development of romantic anticapitalism, which expresses its racial animus toward the abstract Asian alien through an identification with the natural landscape and Indigeneity. Within a capitalist logic of settler colonialism, the Native and the land become biologized expressions of the concrete dimension of the social world.",

      "content": "CHAPTER 1 SEX, TIME, AND THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD Abstract Labor and the Queer Temporalities of History 2 We do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. —Henry David Thoreau Fungibility Figure 1.1 is the celebrated telegram sent by Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR ) president William Van Horne, an American from Chicago tasked with overseeing the construction of the CPR who became, according to Pierre Berton’s famous account, “more Canadian than any native.” 1 His telegram is addressed to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald and announces the completion of the railroad in Craigellachie, British Columbia, on November 7, 1885. Unlike the well-known photograph of the ceremonial driving of the last spike, the focal point of the telegram is time: it is the hour and minutes—9:22 A.M .—that precisely mark the consolidation of the settler nation. The telegram, itself a representation of nineteenth-century advances in communications, symbolizes a new national temporality achieved through technological innovation. Van Horne was known to frequently draw pictures on the reverse side of these kinds of telegrams. On the back side of one of the few that survived is his sketch of a Chinese laborer’s facial profile, complete with a long tapered mustache. Surrounding the man’s face are a busy series of numerical calculations that seem indicative of Van Horne’s financial worries during the railroad’s construction. The CPR , now a multi-billion-dollar corporation, objected to the reproduction of the sketch in this book. 2 What’s interesting is that the grounds for the CPR ’s censorship of the image rested on the mere association of Van Horne with the Chinese man, suggesting a perverse content attributed to the sketched figure and its capacity to corrupt Van Horne’s reputation. This chapter probes exactly what constitutes this unnatural, obscene content and why it is out of sync with the settler temporality glorified on the face of Van Horne’s telegram to the prime minister. Probing the obscene content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man further, the juxtaposition of the human profile and numerical sums evokes the economic connection between Chinese railroad labor and their low wages. Drawing out the financial significance of the image, Margot Francis explains that Chinese labor was “indispensable to the CPR ’s early financial viability as their ‘cheap wages’ saved Andrew Onderdonk, the contractor for the western section of the line, between $3 and $5 million and allowed him to escape bankruptcy.” 3 The Chinese whom Onderdonk contracted to work the western section were recruited from San Francisco. Many of them had worked on the US transcontinental railroad, which had been completed over a decade earlier, in 1869. 4 Although Chinese labor in North America was vital to the completion of the transcontinental railroads, its profound irony, as Henry Yu observes, is “that the very railroads that Chinese laborers built made it easier and cheaper to transport the settlers who arrived afterwards and demanded that ‘the Chinese must go.’” 5 Although railroads were symbols of consolidation for the white nation, they were lines to exclusion for the Chinese laborers who helped build them. In 1885, the same year the CPR was completed, Canada passed its first immigration restriction policy through the Chinese Head Tax, designed to deter laboring classes. Originally set at $50, the tax rose prohibitively, to $100 by 1900 and $500 by 1903. Following completion of the US transcontinental railroad in 1869, the 1875 Page Act was the first federal immigration policy designed to deny entry to prostitutes, overwhelmingly targeting Chinese women on the basis of presumed sexual immorality. The passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 dramatically expanded this scope by restricting entry to all skilled and unskilled Chinese labor. The outcome of these immigration controls on both sides of the Canada-US border was the formation of “bachelor” communities that, as homosocial, nonreproductive spaces, reinforced fears of contagion and perversion associated with Chinese men. The reproductive restrictions imposed on the bachelor community was, in Foucault’s terms, part of the biopolitics of settler colonialism through its “calculated management of life.” 6 The very existence of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese man also offers a stark contrast to the traditional iconography associated with the building of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. The now-famous photographs taken at Promontory, Utah, and Craigellachie, British Columbia, respectively, commemorate the technological feat of white labor, erasing the thousands of Chinese men who worked and died building the western sections of these railroads. As David Eng notes, “While more than ten thousand Chinese American male laborers were exploited for the building of the western portion of Central Pacific track, no one appears in the photograph commemorating its completion.” 7 Neither are any of the seventeen thousand Chinese laborers who worked the western section of the Canadian Pacific railroad identified in what Berton calls “the most famous photograph ever taken in Canada,” celebrating the union of eastern and western tracks in Canada. 8 Therefore, in the sense that Van Horne’s illustration retrieves a repressed aspect of Chinese labor in Canada, it offers us an alternative visual example that Francis suggests “troubles the narratives that posit that only white men were sufficiently enterprising to construct the rail that connected the nation.” 9 For the purposes of this chapter, what the missing sketch also brings to the fore is a relationship between the signifiers of race and capital that overshadowed railroad construction. The tension between these signifiers gave rise to the association of Chinese labor efficiency with social perversion and fed into romantic anticapitalism’s dehumanization of Chinese workers as abstract labor. Probing this visual interplay of race and capital, a less linear vision of Chinese labor emerges from Van Horne’s sketch. In addition to the causal significance of the Chinese face and calculations, insofar as Chinese labor was instrumental for securing the financial viability of the CPR , the juxtaposition of the Chinese profile and numerical figures also projects the sameness of an identity relation. In particular, the vertical lines of the Chinese man’s mustache in the sketch repeat the tally lines surrounding him, accentuating their symbolic resemblance and projecting a quality of mutability and interchangeability. This visual assonance evokes the peculiar fungibility of the Asian alien, a figure whose interchangeability as a value expression dramatizes the properties of money itself, Marx’s “universal equivalent,” against which everything is commensurable and exchangeable. Does such a resemblance between alien labor and the universal equivalence of money suggest that racialized labor takes on the abstract qualities of capital? In light of the 2012 controversy over the Asian scientist on the Canadian hundred-dollar bill discussed in the introductory chapter, Van Horne’s doodle achieves prototypical significance. By surrounding the Chinese man’s face with a series of financial calculations, what Van Horne’s sketch prompts is a reconsideration of the relation between the concrete and the abstract, the concrete specificity of racialized labor and the abstract, universal equivalence of money, which Marx describes as “a radical leveler [that] extinguishes all distinctions.” 10 Money “extinguishes all distinctions” because it is universally exchangeable with all other commodities, and “all other commodities make [money] the material embodiment of their uniform and universal form of value.” 11 Money is the conduit and expression of commensurability. However, Van Horne’s sketch opens a view of racialized labor as money. Rather than an exchange relation—of labor for money—his sketch evokes a substitution relation. Such a relation suggests a process whereby heterogeneous (i.e., racialized) labor takes on the appearance of something entirely different: the homogeneous substance of money, whose qualities are universally commensurable. Unequal labor takes on the appearance of symbolic equivalence. This chapter explores the implications of such a symbolic substitution, particularly in terms of how racialized labor becomes progressively abstract, moving from concrete reality to the spectral domain of capital. Of course, capitalism’s key operational logic is one of abstraction, dissolving difference into homogeneous, equivalent forms so they are commensurable—exchangeable. As Dipesh Chakrabarty summarizes, “The logic of capital sublates into itself the differences of history.” 12 The question, therefore, is why the concrete particularity of Chinese labor comes to express itself culturally as “abstract labor.” Does the cultural abstraction of Chinese labor offer new ways of understanding what Yu calls the “irony” of Chinese labor restrictions introduced after the completion of the transcontinental railroads? In particular, if value is based on “socially necessary” labor time, what factors constitute social necessity? This chapter draws on two Asian North American texts that shed light on social necessity through gendered and sexual temporalities of race, labor, and capitalism in the construction of the transcontinental railroads in Canada and the United States. Addressing themes of labor exploitation and gendered and sexualized exclusion, Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains,” from her experimental memoir China Men , and Richard Fung’s experimental video documentary Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes offer imaginative responses to Van Horne’s symbolic provocation of the identity relation between Chinese labor and money. Magnifying a converging theme of gender and sexual resignification and substitution in their texts, Kingston and Fung demonstrate, to quote Elizabeth Freeman, how “time has, indeed is , a body.” 13 Specifically, in their framing of racialized labor through the interplay of sexuality and temporality, I argue that Kingston and Fung queer the disembodying effects of an accelerating temporal logic of equivalence that constitutes abstract labor. What unites their distinct texts is a recurring theme of substitutions—of ventriloquism for “real” speech, of masturbation for “real” sex, of gay sex for straight sex, of Chinese alien labor for white labor, of maternalism for paternalism, and so on—which function collectively to expose how racial, sexual, and gender difference operates as a degraded substitute within the capitalist logics of white settler colonialism. These substitutions interrupt the accelerating capitalist temporality of railroad labor, which reorganizes the social necessity of a linear, rational, normative time of family, nation, and capital. If time is a body, it is a body subject to relentless disembodiment under capitalism. Yet, for these cultural producers, disembodiment provides an opening for queer resignification that reveals the destabilizing potential of abstract labor. They draw out the potential of Queer Marxism by exposing the tension between concrete labor and abstract labor time, what Petrus Liu identifies as the “incommensurability between the value of a human being and its formal exchangeability.” 14 As alien substitutes for “real labor,” I suggest that Kingston’s and Fung’s texts allegorize a process whereby alien labor is symbolically aligned with the fluctuating duration embedded in abstract labor, which establishes value, rather than the here-and-now world of concrete labor. As I elaborated in the introductory chapter, abstract labor represents a social average of labor time to produce a commodity in order to express its quantitative value during exchange, whereas concrete labor refers to the actual time and place of a specific laboring activity that expresses its qualitative use-value. Chakrabarty offers a useful clarification of abstract labor as a “performative, practical category.” 15 He explains that “abstract labor gave Marx a way of explaining how the capitalist mode of production managed to extract, out of peoples and histories that were all different, a homogenous and common unit for measuring human activity.” 16 Abstract labor is therefore an objective force made up of what Marx describes as a spectral, phantomlike substance: Let us now look at the residue of the products of labour. There is nothing left of them in each case but the same phantom-like objectivity ; there are merely congealed quantities of homogenous human labour, i.e. of human labour-power expended without regard to the form of its expenditure. All these things now tell us is that human labour-power has been expended to produce them, human labour is accumulated in them. As crystals of this social substance, which is common to them all, they are values—commodity values. 17 By aligning Chinese bodies with abstract labor, their labor represents human labor in the abstract . It is this phantomlike objectivity of alien labor that establishes a commodity’s value. White bodies, on the other hand, are symbolically associated with concrete labor, which establishes a commodity’s quality. Such a racial bifurcation of abstract and concrete labor is the work of the commodity fetish, which disguises the social relations behind the products of human labor. In terms of this book’s overarching claim, I argue that a key anchor of North American settler colonialism is an ideology of romantic anticapitalism that reifies a distinction between concrete and abstract social relations out of a misunderstanding of the dialectical nature of capitalism. Romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and pure, on one hand, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of social relations, on the other. It glorifies what it sees as the concrete realm of social relations: white labor, the family, and the train itself—a machine whose concreteness is biologized as the “iron horse.” Alternatively, Chinese bodies are in nearly exclusive alignment with quasi-mechanized labor temporality, excluded from normative social and domestic temporalities. Once Chinese labor is no longer needed, romantic anticapitalism performs an aesthetic function by giving Chinese shape to the unrepresentable: giving bodily form to the abstract, temporal domination of capitalism. In this sense, Chinese labor allegorizes the commensurating function of abstract labor that propels capitalism forward. However, as Chakrabarty notes, for Marx the universal category of abstract labor serves two functions: “It is both a description and a critique of capital.” 18 Following a Queer Marxist approach, this chapter will explore how abstract labor can pose such a critique. The focus on temporality in Kingston’s and Fung’s work also serves to dramatize the impact of industrial technology on conceptions of time in the nineteenth century. In particular, railroad construction was intimately linked to the speed-up and internationalization of uniform time through technological innovation, time-space compression, and the standardization of Greenwich Mean Time. Completing a process of temporal secularization that began in the Middle Ages, time’s progressive detachment from the cosmos and human events was achieved in this period of national expansion and consolidation by rail. No longer did biblical events structure and determine time, as they once did within traditional Jewish and Christian conceptions of history; rather, time became increasingly continuous, homogeneous, and independent of events. 19 Postone refers to this secularized temporality as “abstract time,” “an independent framework within which motion, events, and action occur . . . divisible into equal, constant, nonqualitative units.” 20 Indeed, the progress of abstract time as a dominant form of time parallels the development of capitalism as a socially metabolic totality. In the context of this shift to a more totalizing capitalist temporality, what Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate is how conceptions of time were racialized and sexualized. Indeed, as Petrus Liu specifies, it is a mistake to view socially necessary labor time as solely the mean labor time associated with technological developments but also in terms of its moral dimensions. He clarifies that “the value of a commodity is the amount of human labor embodied in it, but the value of the commodity of human labor is determined by moral and discursive operations outside the capitalist reproduction scheme.” 21 Therefore, on one hand, white labor productivity and its heteronormative reproduction become qualitative expressions of morality and rationality associated with time discipline. As Michael O’Malley explains, there was a need “to protect time’s virtue,” its chastity tied to “scientific discipline requiring years of patient courting to master.” 22 On the other, as I suggest in this chapter, Chinese labor becomes associated with the abstract, quantitative domination of labor time. This is what Postone describes as the “temporal dimension of the abstract domination that characterizes the structures of alienated social relations in capitalism.” 23 Exposing the racialized temporalities of the labor process under capitalism, Kingston and Fung return with queer temporal revisions of labor and reproduction. Time Travel Midway through Richard Fung’s video Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes , the camera draws in on a Chinese Canadian train steward scanning a magazine article titled “Canada’s Railway: A Symbol under Threat.” Several scenes later, the steward is engaged in a passionate kiss with Roger Kwong, a Chinese Canadian journalist for the magazine. After a slow-motion montage of hands caressing undressed bodies, the scene of the two men’s sexual encounter gives way to metaphorical expression through a cut to archival film footage taken from the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR ); the grainy blackand-white film transports the viewer around a bend and into a dark tunnel. Besides the discontinuous temporality staged by the juxtaposition of these two scenes—one fictional and contemporary, the other culled from a historical archive—their temporal dissonance is further accentuated by their distinct cinematic tempos . The sex scene is slow and methodical, while the train hurtles forward on a predetermined path. The possibility of the gay encounter, Fung suggests, is contingent on but temporally dislocated from the predictable linearity of CPR time. The video pushes temporality and sexuality together in a way that simultaneously emphasizes the temporality of racialized sexuality and the sexuality of time on the transcontinental railway. Sex on trains is certainly not isolated to experimental Asian Canadian documentaries such as Fung’s. Perhaps more obviously, the rapid sequence of the scenes above presents a queer citation to a film such as Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest (1959), in which the train similarly serves as a symbolic phallus. In Hitchcock’s version, the train that disappears into a tunnel also—and comically—references sex between Cary Grant’s and Eva Marie Saint’s characters. This kind of sexual symbolism has a long history in the popular culture of the railway. Since the nineteenth century, popular film and visual art representations have commonly depicted the sexuality of trains, which, as Lynne Kirby describes, is “most often as a double for male sexuality.” 24 As a mirrored projection of male virility over a fertile, feminine body, the train symbolizes either (and often both) the aggressively violent or consummating romance of territorial penetration and domestication. Inside the train, the compression of time and space have disorienting effects, such that chance and illicit encounters are not only possible but probable. Therefore, the railway’s temporal duality of social unpredictability and technological predictability nonetheless converge under a dominant symbolism of heterosexual consummation between technology and nature. In other words, the surprise or taboo sexual encounters between passengers who feel out of time and space are not anomalous to the predetermined, linear path of the railway because, as Hitchcock’s film demonstrates, the two lovers ultimately mirror the overarching theme of spatial consummation with their bodies—white heterosexual bodies are always in sync with the temporality of the railroad. But when we loop back to Fung’s CPR , the two strangers are Asian, and gay sex replaces heterosexual white consummation. Through this substitution, the video suggests that disrupting the train’s symbolism with an Asian “anal” tunnel is one reason that the Canadian railway may be “a symbol under threat.” Fung’s documentary diverges from the traditional “romance of the rails” by presenting a montage of narrative layers where, as Lisa Lowe observes, “the journey across geography spatializes a temporal exploration of an unknown past.” 25 Interwoven through the documentary are interviews, archival film and photographic images, dramatized historical scenes, and a fictional travelogue that follows Roger Kwong’s journey from Toronto to Vancouver aboard a CPR train. The documentary does not privilege any one narrative or temporal standpoint, emphasizing instead the interplay of power and narrativity—particularly the racial power embedded in the assembly of historical archives. As Margot Francis observes of the video’s back-and-forth movement between historical analysis and fictional travelogue, “The director suggests that he didn’t want viewers of the tape to feel too secure with either fiction or history.” 26 In its approach to race and sexuality, Fung adapts Michel Foucault’s argument in History of Sexuality that the late nineteenth century did not so much repress sexuality as give rise to a cultural “incitement to speak” about it, leading to a proliferation of discourses and disciplinary apparatuses. 27 Subtitled A History of Heroes , the video examines how it was anti-Chinese sentiment in the nineteenth century that was historically linked to the proliferation of discourses about sexual perversion—at the same time that whiteness was coalescing as a normative category of national citizenship. In Foucauldian fashion, Fung demonstrates how conceptions of racial and sexual normativity were secondary to and relied on racial and sexual otherness for definition. Rather than indict the conflation of racial otherness with sexual perversion, the video’s ironic treatment of perversity is exemplified in its title, Dirty Laundry : it seeks to rework the symbolic interplay of racialized sexuality and labor. Through Roger’s discovery of his great-grandfather’s ambiguous sexuality, the video clears a space outside the temporal frame of official history to identify with sexual fluidity. Moreover, Fung’s video playfully channels the eroticism of dirty laundry, which comes into play when an accidental spill initiates the sexual encounter between Roger and the railway steward. The combination of overlapping temporalities, self-conscious narration, and dramatic reversals and substitutions bring to light the queer modalities of racialized labor history. If we move south to the transcontinental railroad of Maxine Hong Kingston’s “The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains” in China Men , another Chinese railroad worker performs a different kind of queer identity forged out of temporal dislocation. Whether Ah Goong is wandering alone through the Sierra woods or sitting with his family at the dinner table, he has no qualms about baring his penis and subjecting it to worldly questioning. Contrary to the steel certainty of the train’s anthropomorphized virility, he continually wonders “what it was that it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 28 Scrutinizing the function and reproductive capacity of his body, Ah Goong presents a warped mirror of the train’s phallic symbolism. Far from the pleasures of queer sexuality that Fung’s steward enjoys, Ah Goong’s inward chastisement outwardly questions the relation between male sexuality and gender. His gender and sexual dislocations are reflected in the acute temporal dissonance he experiences as a laboring body. As he works, Ah Goong continually grasps for temporal anchoring while his observations become increasingly unhinged. After he spends three years tunneling through granite with a pickaxe, time becomes a tangible, animate form divorced from a coherent sense of reality: When he stumbled out, he tried to talk about time. “I felt time,” he said. “I saw time. I saw world.” He tried again, “I saw what’s real. I saw time, and it doesn’t move. If we break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway. You translators ought to tell the foreigners that.” 29 The temporality of granite is dissociated from reality and takes on a materiality that Ah Goong feels and sees. The linear, unidirectional pressures of Ah Goong’s labor time confront the seeming immobility of nature, because “it doesn’t move.” Labor time and natural time are presented as frustratingly out of sync with each other, and even if they “break through the mountain, hollow it, time won’t have moved anyway.” These temporal disjunctures have alienating gendered and sexual effects on Ah Goong. The temporal alienation Ah Goong experiences during labor is reinforced by the waning influence of a cosmic temporality. For instance, his ritual observance of the summer reunion of the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy—the Altair and Vega star constellations—becomes increasingly irrelevant to him in the face of a new labor temporality. Looking up at the night sky, Ah Goong “saw the order in the stars,” 30 an astrological system that brings comfort because he recognizes them from China. He recounts the story of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy, in which two lovers are so enchanted with one another, “too happy,” that they neglect their work and are punished by the Queen of the Sky. She separates the lovers, “scratch[ing] a river between them.” Taking pity on them, the King of the Sky allows them a reunion once a year: “On the seventh day of the seventh month . . . magpies form a bridge for them to cross to each other.” 31 The discovery of the stars gives Ah Goong something to look forward to: “Every night he located Altair and Vega and gauged how much closer they had come since the night before.” 32 But after the first summer, astrological time seems increasingly disconnected from his own temporal existence. Ah Goong “felt less nostalgia at the Spinning Girl and the Cowboy. . . . The Cowboy’s one year away from his lady was no time at all.” 33 For Ah Goong, cosmic time is progressively divorced from the demands of earth-bound labor time, which, he observes, has kept some Chinese men working in the country for decades. Dispensing with his yearly celebration of the Spinning Girl and Cowboy’s reunion and, later, casting aside the temptations of a pitiful sex worker brought into the camp, Ah Goong’s gender and sexuality become progressively estranged from the consummating imperatives of the railway. He begins to masturbate on the job while lowered in a basket filled with gunpowder and fuses, declaring, “I am fucking the world!” 34 Later, after the railway is complete, he is filled with longing for his own child, a daughter: “He wished for a happy daughter. . . . She would sing for him and listen to him sing.” 35 He is deemed insane by his family, and is eventually lost after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. His consciousness is shaped by an indefinite temporality, and as I develop further in this chapter, it stands in sharp contrast to the gender and sexual imperatives of a consolidating capitalist temporality of the nineteenth century. Departing from an ordered, sequential, and linear vision of time, Fung and Kingston employ forms of substitution as openings for processes of resignification that reimagine time’s relation to race, sexuality, and labor. It is from the dislocated position of abject substitution that time’s normalizing function is exposed. Elizabeth Freeman notes how “one of the most obvious ways that sex meets temporality is in the persistent description of queers as temporally backward, though paradoxically dislocated from any specific historical moment.” 36 From the displaced vantage of the historically dislocated position of Chinese labor, therefore, Kingston and Fung’s texts denaturalize capitalist temporality while reimagining “how time makes bodies and subjects.” 37 As capitalism expands and increasingly regulates all aspects of labor and social life in the nineteenth century, we can discern how the morality and character-building activity of concrete labor both structures and reinforces the social and cultural structures of family and leisure. The temporality of the home, which schedules gendered activity, moral education, heterosexual reproduction, progress, and futurity, is thus a crucial regulator of the labor process. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts elucidate, the temporality of work and family become embodied by whiteness, a category imbued with morality, belonging, and social necessity. In contrast, the Chinese are identified with a perverse domesticity whose homosociality forecloses any sense of reproductive futurity. Excluded from the moral category of concrete labor, Chinese labor is instead associated with processes of valorization associated with productivity and time, an abstract force that injects temporal volatility into the concrete labor process. Personifying the capitalist adage “Time is money,” therefore, the substitutions present in Kingston and Fung’s texts expose the aesthetic function of romantic anticapitalism. That white labor appears more “concrete” than Chinese labor is one of the fetishized tropes of capitalism that, as Marx writes, “conceals the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual workers, by making those relations appear as relations between material objects, instead of revealing them plainly.” 38 In the following two sections I explore the way Fung and Kingston respond to the capitalist imperatives of temporal consolidation, one which aligns Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism while simultaneously subverting it. As personifications of the “phantom-like objectivity” 39 of abstract labor, the Chinese laborers of Kingston’s and Fung’s texts stage alternative temporalities, inserting a queer temporal vitality that animates Chakrabarty’s conception of History 2, a historical formation that he describes as the “excess that capital . . . always needs but can never quite control or domesticate.” 40 These are the vital forces that form a constant resistance to capital: “the abstract living labor—a sum of muscles, nerves, and consciousness/will—that, according to Marx, capital posits as its contradictory starting point all the time.” 41 Alien Labor as Dangerous Supplement During the three years that Ah Goong tunnels through granite mountain in China Men , he undergoes profound psychological disembodiment insofar as he becomes progressively unable to distinguish the tangible from the abstract. As he tunnels, his sensory ability becomes estranged, and his perception of the material world reflects his temporal imprisonment in labor, where “a mountain is the same as permanence and time”: 42 His eyes couldn’t see, his nose couldn’t smell; and now his ears were filled with the noise of hammering. This rock is what is real, he thought. This rock is what real is, not clouds or mist, which make mysterious promises, and when you go through them are nothing. 43 Ah Goong’s experience of temporal suspension against the impenetrability of rock bankrupts the hope or mystery suggested by “clouds or mist.” History is reduced to rock. Later, after the bosses replace pickaxes with dynamite, which “added more accidents and ways of dying,” 44 he is further disoriented in time. After blasting through a tunnel in winter, he begins to think that “it was the task of the human race to quicken the world, blast the freeze, fire it, redden it with blood.” 45 Experiencing the shift to the quickening pace of industrial time, Ah Goong tries to counteract the disjuncture of labor speed and the delay of the natural world: He had to change the stupid slowness of one sunrise and one sunset per day. He had to enliven the silent world with sound. “The rock,” he tried to tell the others. “The ice.” “Time.” 46 Responding to the asynchrony of labor time and natural time, Ah Goong attempts to resignify the natural world using the sound of words, which fail to signify new meaning. As natural time cleaves from the laboring body, the Chinese laborers who die from explosions become increasingly disembodied forms, “like puppets [who] made Ah Goong laugh crazily as if the arms and legs would come together again.” When he is suspended in his dynamite-lined basket, Ah Goong renders human life abstract: “Godlike, he watched men whose faces he could not see and whose screams he did not hear roll and bounce and slide like a handful of sprinkled gravel.” 47 From puppets to sprinkled gravel, human life is progressively stripped of vitality. As both witness to and subject of the disembodying effects of abstract time, Ah Goong articulates both the inadequacy and potential of the living body. As he lifts his hammer, he tells the men working beside him that “a man ought to be made of tougher material than flesh. . . . Skin is too soft.” 48 The impenetrability of the wall further underscores his corporeal lack: “Nothing happened to that gray wall. . . . It had no softer or weaker spots anywhere, the same hard gray.” 49 He remarks to his friends, “Our bones ought to be filled with iron.” 50 Ah Goong’s recognition of the dehumanizing demands of abstract labor time emphasizes a central contradiction of a capitalist mode of production. Within capitalism’s drive to accumulate by speeding up time and compressing space, its tendency is to replace human labor with machines, or “bones . . . filled with iron.” As Chakrabarty notes, “Capital is thus faced with its own contradiction: it needs abstract and living labor as the starting point in its cycle of self-reproduction, but it also wants to reduce to a minimum the quantum of living labor it needs.” 51 Thus, connecting this contradiction to History 2, we find that the crucial variable embedded within abstract labor—a variable that capitalism requires but continuously tries to eliminate—is human life itself, an innately conscious and willing indeterminate force. It is the capacity of being “living” that makes labor a potential source of resistance to capitalist abstraction. The resistance of vitalism, as Chakrabarty elucidates, is such that “life, in Marx’s analysis of capital, is . . . in a ‘standing fight’ against the process of abstraction that is constitutive of the category labor.” 52 Expressing a queer vitalism that upsets the reproduction of a capitalist temporality, Ah Goong’s performance of racialized labor as a sexual act queers the value-generating temporality of abstract labor. In the much-discussed scene of Ah Goong’s compulsion to masturbate while lowered in a basket filled with dynamite and declaring, “I am fucking the world,” he taps into the vital excess of abstract labor. In debates over the political registers of the scene, critics identify these acts as expressions of either sexual frustration or resistance. For Donald Goellnicht, his masturbation signals the “loss and frustration caused by emasculation” 53 in the face of sexual deprivations in the railroad labor camps, suggesting that his sexuality is a belated formation, foreclosed until an unknown future. On the other hand, as David Eng suggests, his autoerotic behavior can be interpreted as staging an act of resistance, “us[ing] his penis to make a statement of racial protest . . . to his devalued racial position in America.” 54 Tomo Hattori extends the resistant registers of masturbation, not as a “pathetic substitution for and failure to engage in ‘real’ sex,” 55 but as an expression of Ah Goong’s “critique of the heterosexual and masculinist pretensions of his masters.” 56 In this case, his masturbation represents a suspended challenge to the linear, reproductive frame of heterosexual consummation. Extending these analyses of his act’s resistant potential, I call attention to the notion of masturbation as dangerous supplement. In Jacques Derrida’s deconstruction of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s privileging of speech over writing, nature over culture, and presence over absence, he pays special attention to Rousseau’s discussion of masturbation. In The Confessions , Rousseau expresses guilt over frequently succumbing to the compulsion to masturbate in the absence of his lover, Therese. He calls masturbation a “dangerous supplement,” 57 regarding the act as a secondary, subordinate addition to the primary and original act of sexual intercourse. But Derrida points to the double meaning of the supplement, as both supplying something that is missing and supplying something additional. Derrida’s insight is that the supplement is what sets the terms that make possible the privileged status of the first entity. Supplementarity is the manifestation of the deferral that deconstructs the integrity of the sexual act, which is assumed to be perfect and complete. Applying this notion of supplementarity to Ah Goong’s masturbatory “fucking” of the world, we can examine how his act ventriloquizes the dynamite’s literal “fucking” of the world. As a mode of writing, Ah Goong’s masturbation gives him discursive presence and embodiment that corrupts the logic of equivalence that capitalism extracts as abstract labor. Moreover, Ah Goong’s masturbation blurs the hierarchical distinction between work and play. Masturbation becomes an expression of queer vitalism that frustrates the homogeneity of abstract labor. Simultaneously, the queer vitalism he stages frustrates the capitalist logics of heterosexual reproduction. In his examination of nationalism and sexuality in the nineteenth century, George Mosse notes that masturbation was likened to “throwing money out the window,” 58 causing impotence and threatening depopulation. And given that masturbation activates, as Tomo Hattori explains, an “autoerotic homosexuality . . . [because] the onanist, as both the subject and object of erotic action, is the same gender as itself,” 59 Ah Goong’s sexual difference defies the logic of equivalence embedded in abstract labor while disidentifying with the capitalist project of national consummation. The queer vitalism of Ah Goong’s masturbation may also leverage a more dangerous supplementarity to the temporal domination of abstract labor than the labor strike he participates in. Animating the dehumanization of technological speed-up—whereby technology expands the exploitation of human labor—the Chinese workers are presented with a “four-dollar raise per month” that comes with the “‘opportunity to put in more time’ . . . ‘Two more hours per shift.’ Ten-hour shifts inside the tunnels.” 60 The “railroad demons” reason that “‘now that you have dynamite, the work isn’t so hard.’” 61 In response, the Chinese laborers recognize the temporal domination of abstract labor through the inhuman push to mechanize their bodies: “‘A human body can’t work like that.’ ‘The demons don’t believe this is a human body. This is a chinaman’s body.’” 62 Here the racialization of labor translates into a temporal embodiment of abstract labor. When the Chinese workers decide to resist by going on strike, the strike serves to halt the capitalist temporality of labor and becomes a supplementary form of leisure time. On strike, the men emerge as nonequivalents: The ones who were sleeping slept on and rose as late as they pleased. They bathed in streams and shaved their moustaches and wild bears. Some went fishing and hunting. The violinists tuned and played their instruments. The drummers beat theirs at the punchlines of jokes. The gamblers shuffled and played their cards and tiles. The smokers passed their pipes, and the drinkers bet for drinks by making figures with their hands. The cooks made party food. 63 However, rather than a dangerous supplement that destroys the coherent division of work and labor, the strike also serves as a kind of “obscene supplement,” which Slavoj Žižek defines as less a subversion of capitalism than “an obstacle which is simultaneously the ‘condition of possibility’ of the exercise of Power.” 64 The strike operates as an obscene supplement in the sense that the China Men’s victory is a qualified one. The foremen eventually grant a four-dollar raise without lengthening the working day, but this is far less than the fourteen-dollar increase the Chinese laborers demanded. Because the Irish workers refused to join the strike, rejecting their invitation by calling the Chinese strikers “Cheap John Chinaman,” 65 Chinese labor remains aligned with the temporal domination of abstract labor. The strike ultimately serves to uphold rather than undermine capitalism by safeguarding the vital human limits of abstract labor time. Thus when the strike is over, there is no celebration. The China Men merely resume their work within a capitalist temporality. Kingston writes, “The China Men went back to work quietly. No use singing and shouting over a compromise and losing nine days’ work.” 66 In this case, abstract labor functions less as History 2 than as History 1, which Chakrabarty defines as “the past ‘established’ by capital because History 1 lends itself to the reproduction of capitalist relationships.” 67 Ultimately, Kingston presents the irony of capitalism’s demand for equivalence and substitution performed by fungible alien labor. When the railroad is complete, race complicates the logic of endless substitution—of alien supplementarity—by projecting the concreteness of white railroad laborers through photographs and commemorative celebration at Promontory, Utah, in 1869. The white workers declare that “only Americans could have done it.” 68 Chinese labor remains abstract and, as such, invisible: “Ah Goong does not appear in railroad photographs.” 69 As Eng clarifies, here “American emphatically does not include Chinese , as the China Men are driven out and their racialized labor is transformed into an abstracted whiteness.” 70 Kingston emphasizes these processes of abstraction and performative substitution at the completion ceremony when a Chinese worker becomes what Eng calls a “body double” 71 for the white man who drives in the commemorative last spike: “A white demon in a top hat tap-tapped on the gold spike, and pulled it back out. Then one China Man held the real spike, the steel one, and another hammered it in.” 72 In this scene Kingston reverses the projections of abstraction and concreteness. Here we see that the steel, as an inferior supplement to gold, is what constitutes the “real.” The Chinese man who hammers it in is as concrete as the steel that consummates the nation, while the golden spike and the white man remain abstract, fetishized symbols of value. As Eng explains, the scene “underscores the splitting of the real from representation, of reality from the ways it is reconfigured in the laminating photograph that memorializes the event.” 73 By dramatizing the role of representation in romanticized projections of concrete white labor, Kingston allegorizes the way racial difference can be sublated into an abstract supplement of white labor while also serving an aesthetic function by giving Chinese form to the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality that is otherwise unrepresentable. Unlike Kingston’s text, Dirty Laundry ’s focus is less on the actual labor process entailed in railroad construction in Canada from 1881 to 1885 than its aftermath. In particular, Fung’s video provides a complementary view of the ideological forces behind Ah Goong’s experience of “The Driving Out” 74 that follows the completion ceremony at Promontory. When Chinese labor is no longer indispensable, Ah Goong realizes, “It was dangerous to stay.” 75 What Fung’s video explores is how abstract labor becomes aligned with racialized perversity and vice that fuels the ideological basis for expulsion, making it “dangerous to stay.” Incorporating themes of substitution, Dirty Laundry further reinforces the concrete attributes of white labor and abstract qualities of Chinese labor. In the video’s dramatization of sections of the 1885 Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration , we see how concrete white labor is associated with a normativity defined by temporal discipline that sets the parameters of work, leisure, and reproduction. At the same time, Chinese exclusion from normative temporalities of domestic life become manifestations of the destructive attributes of abstract labor. Personifying the abstract domination of a capitalist temporality, the Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration casts Chinese men as a destructive, perverse force that threatens the social order. As historian Dora Nipp, one of the video’s interviewees, explains, the railroad became a historical marker that separated abstract Chinese labor from perverse labor: “Initially when Chinese labor was needed for the labor, nothing bad was said about them. Once their labor was no longer welcome, then you hear about vices; you hear about prostitution, leprosy, all kinds of illnesses. . . . [Writers] dwelled on the exotic, the exaggerated, the evil.” The range of racial, gender, and sexual substitutions that Fung’s video explores offers a different view of the perversity that becomes associated with the abstract qualities of Chinese labor. Substitution, as repetition with a difference, becomes a visual theme that anchors the video’s fictional, archival, and documentary fragments. In particular, the visual refrain that interposes the entire video begins with a Chinese couple: the woman sitting behind her husband braiding his queue before he departs for Canada. The audio that accompanies the scene is of a woman’s voice that asks, “Who will braid your hair? Who will cook your rice? Who will wash your clothes? Who will warm your bed?” This scene undergoes multiple substitutions throughout the course of the video, establishing a core thematic refrain that frames the video’s other substitutions. In the first metamorphosis, the wife is replaced by a man, and it is a male voice that asks the series of questions that ends with “Who will warm your bed?” And when we fast-forward to the video’s conclusion, the scene depicts a contemporary lesbian couple without audio to accompany the scene. In light of the fungibility of abstract labor, one significance of these substitutions is that they redefine substitution not as interchangeability but as repetition with difference. Rather than the undifferentiated assemblage of muscles and nerves that constitute abstract labor—what Marx describes as “human labour-power in its fluid state” 76 —these substitutions highlight gender and sexual difference. Further, that the scene’s visual refrain occurs in an intimate domestic space where one lover is braiding the other’s hair reinforces the affective dimensions of abstract labor. The repetition of this scene of domesticity counteracts the perverse domesticity to which Chinese labor is consigned. Moreover, working against the fetishism that misrepresents the dual character of commodity-determined labor, one that constitutes a social universe characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions, the substitutions keep the viewer alert to the normative cues and expectations that buffer and conceal the truth of social relations. As I explore below, Fung’s substitutions present an allegory of racial fetishism that emerges around abstract alien labor. Employing different forms of substitution that emphasize the defensive attributes of whiteness, Fung’s video makes explicit connections between abstract labor and vice by drawing from the Royal Commission Report on Chinese Immigration . This was a report compiled in 1884 to study “objections to the influx of the Chinese People into Canada,” which, as Fung’s video notes, “leads to a Head Tax in 1885, the year the Canadian Pacific Railway is completed and Chinese labor is no longer needed.” The study’s primary methodology is to examine the Chinese restrictions in place in sister settler colonies, the United States and Australia, gathering “evidence” in Queensland and San Francisco by interviewing diverse classes of white male “witnesses” to testify on the subject of Chinese immigration. Among the array of subjects, Fung focuses on testimony that addresses Chinese labor and “sodomy,” a subject heading that appears in the actual report. Unlike the forms of substitution in Kingston’s China Men that align Chinese labor with the technological speed-up of abstract labor, Fung’s video uses substitution ironically to examine the fungibility of whiteness. It is from the position of generic whiteness that negative, perverse content is cast onto the Chinese embodiment of abstract labor. FIGURE 1.2 Miner (video still). From Dirty Laundry: A History of Heroes by Richard Fung. Courtesy of the artist. A scene depicting a white miner’s metamorphosis into a senator dramatizes the class convergence of whiteness, which Francis describes as a performance of “authorial transvestism,” observing how the “the senator’s ventriloquism (transgressing the boundaries of class) functions in the interests of white racial dominance.” 77 The white miner (figure 1.2 ), clad in a dusty work shirt and suspenders, begins the monologue discussing his heteronormative duties and domestic comforts, which become grounds for him to question the moral citizenship of Chinese men. He explains that in terms of labor, all is equivalent, but the costs of reproducing their respective labors puts the white miner at a distinct disadvantage. By the conclusion of his speech, the white miner has undergone metamorphosis into Senator Jones of Nevada, dressed in a black suit and bowtie (figure 1.3 ). The content of the testimony reveals the immorality and degraded nature of abstract labor when transposed to the temporal sanctity of the domestic realm: FIGURE 1.3 Senator (video still).

I cheerfully contribute to the support of schools, churches, charitable institutions, and other objects that enter into our daily life. But after I’ve maintained my family and performed these duties, not much is left of my wages when the week is ended. How is it with the Chinese? The Chinaman can do as much work underground as I can. He has no wife and family. He performs none of these duties. Forty or fifty of his kind can live in a house no larger than mine. He craves no variety of food. He has inherited no taste for comfort or for social enjoyment. Conditions that satisfy him and make him contented would make my life not worth living. The white miner and senator align the Chinese body exclusively with a homogenized labor disposition. A Chinese body does not have the capacity for domestic enjoyment, community engagement, or social reproduction, which threatens the temporal stability of “socially necessary labor time.” He continues to exaggerate the subhuman conditions of Chinese existence by commenting on the cramped living conditions, lack of enjoyable food, and lack of social taste, conditions that “would make my life not worth living.” It is precisely the deprivations of Chinese domesticity and civic life that render Chinese labor nonhuman and therefore unfair competition. When the miner transforms into Senator Jones of Nevada, the politician’s more confident voice and political status lend further legitimacy to the miner’s complaint. Adding an air of authority to the miner’s lamentations, Senator Jones makes a strong appeal against the Chinese: “The Chinaman comes in taking advantage of our skill, of our toil, and of our struggles, driving us from fields of industry which we have created and which our race alone can create.” Conveying the unity of whiteness through the substitution of the senator for the miner, their casting of Chinese men as a destructive labor form emphasizes the parasitic effects of abstract labor on a concrete white labor host. What is also significant in the testimony is the senator’s clear glorification of industrialization—the “fields of industry we have created and which our race alone can create”—emphasizes the concrete value of white labor’s “skill . . . toil . . . struggles.” This view of the white industrial laborer becomes the romantic anticapitalist counterpoint to the abstract status of Chinese labor who has no social value except to “take advantage.” Both the miner and the senator thus attribute a destructive power to the Chinese, one that is constituted by his nonsocial, parasitic, and abstract qualities. Fung’s subsequent dramatizations of testimony from the Royal Commission report incorporate experimental forms of bodily and textual substitution that emphasize processes of signification and resignification. As Roger thumbs through the section on sodomy, the testimonies of a detective, a San Francisco merchant, and a former resident of China come to life to reinforce the perversity attached to Chinese bodies, whose temporal otherness is constituted through figurative alignment with labor duration and social nonreproduction. Their testimony on sodomy is presented in a continuous sequence: Detective C. C. Cox: Cases of the most revolting crime came before them, for instance of which all details could if necessary be supplied with that of a man who cut out the penis of another who refused to submit to his degrading desires. San Francisco Merchant Thomas H. King: Sodomy is a habit. Sometimes thirty or forty boys leaving Hong Kong in apparently good health before arriving here will be found to be afflicted about the anus with venereal diseases. And on questioning the Chinese doctors, they admitted that it was a common practice among them. Six Years Resident of China John T. Tobin: I’ve never seen sodomy committed between men and men but I have seen it with beasts and detected them in the act with hogs, dogs, and ducks. But not in a great number of cases. The cumulative effect of these testimonies is to attach bestial perversity to the disembodied form of the Chinese male body. No longer simply the socially abstract and destructive figure that the miner and senator argue “takes advantage” of hardworking, civic-minded white men of industry, perversity becomes the manifest social attribute of the abstract power of the Chinese laborer, a perversity that John T. Tobin links to animals. As queer countermemory, the video offers a parody of this “revolting” trajectory of Chinese disembodiment that coalesces around a severed penis, an infected anus, and—more humorously—a duck’s rear accompanied by an audible “quack.” A later scene depicting a doctor’s defense of Chinese sexual morality captures the relation of substitution as signification at stake in the Royal Commission testimonies. The scene opens to Roger, who appears in the role of a nineteenth-century Chinese laborer. He is bare-chested and moves slowly into a darkened room. As he moves across the screen, the text of the Royal Commission is projected onto his body, while the edge of the screen is illuminated to showcase the testimony of Mr. E. Stevenson, MD , of Victoria, British Columbia. As Mr. Stevenson speaks, his words are projected onto Roger’s body. Mr. Stevenson offers an impassioned defense of the Chinese on the subject of their sexual morality: Gentlemen, you have heard several witnesses testify unfavorably on this Chinese question and they have said they infer so-and-so. And from the fact that so many Chinese males are here and so few Chinese females, it has been inferred by certain people that, I hesitate to say it, that sodomy was by them practiced. I stamp it a damnable slander. A man who so acts bears the mark of Cain not only on his forehead but all over him. The visual effect of character substitution, of redeploying Roger into the role of Chinese laborer, is to clarify Roger’s contemporary relationship to the past, to his sexually ambiguous great-grandfather who worked on the CPR , and to the nation’s history of sexuality. Substitution thus becomes a supplementary modality for Roger’s countermemorial connection to history and sexual identity—bringing forth Derrida’s notion of supplementarity as something that both replaces and adds to. On one level, Stevenson’s testimony defends the honor of the Chinese and draws not on myth but on the demographic realities of the tremendous disparity in the population ratio of Chinese men to Chinese women, which fostered the development of segregated “bachelor” communities in North America. However, on another level, Stevenson’s testimony remains tied to the earlier white witnesses’ condemnation of Chinese perversity in asserting his symbolic power over the sign of race. Whether for or against Chinese immigration, the Chinese body remains an abstract object onto which racial and sexual discourse are literally and figuratively projected. The pages from the Royal Commission report that are projected onto Roger’s body become the textual representation of the Chinese body. He becomes an abstract screen for the projection of textual content. Moreover, Stevenson’s reference to the mark of Cain adds another layer of irony to the system of signification. When he notes how the mark of Cain appears “not only on his forehead but all over him,” Stevenson amplifies the racial meaning of the mark, connecting sexual perversion to racial embodiment. As he speaks, Roger’s body moves slowly out of the darkness; he pauses to highlight Stevenson’s words “mark of . . . ,” which remain projected on his chest until the words disappear as he exits into partial lightness toward Stevenson (figure 1.4 ). As Roger’s character comes face to face with Stevenson, it becomes clear that Stevenson himself is a holographic projection, underscoring their divergent temporalities. He falls short of reaching Stevenson before becoming shrouded again by dark shadows. The ambiguity surrounding Roger’s disappearance back into darkness is such that it is unclear whether the darkness that envelops his body is itself the “mark of Cain” or is, instead, a form of representative absence—a moment of unsignification. In either case, as the personification of abstract labor, the sexualization of the Chinese racial body is the discursively constituted and ideological effect of the disciplinary apparatus of an intensifying capitalist temporality. Moreover, rather than sanitize the “dirty laundry” of Chinese labor, Fung undercuts the heteronormative recuperation of Chinese sexual otherness by highlighting instead the discursive constitution of racialized sexual perversion and its ideological effects. Fung is careful to contextualize the range of substitutions and modes of signification that emerge from these testimonies in a broader international context. Interspersed throughout the Royal Commission testimonies are frames of onscreen text. One indicates that “in 1885, the year Canada institutes the Head Tax, Britain criminalizes all sexual activity between men as ‘gross indecency.’” Several frames later, additional onscreen text reads, “In Germany in 1892, the word homosexuality is first used in public,” which is quickly followed by “Heterosexuality is coined later.” By presenting a larger international frame for the projection of perversity onto the Chinese in Canada, Fung highlights the historical intersection of industrial capitalism and the desire to sexualize labor difference. What the video suggests is that the Royal Commission report represents less a narrative of testimony than a genealogy of settler crisis that turns on shifting social relations brought on by the new temporalities of industrial capitalism.

Queer Temporalities of History 2 In contrast to the jubilant embodiment and incorporation contained in the white settler mythology of the transcontinental railway, China Men and Dirty Laundry incorporate temporal symbols of disembodied abstraction and social exclusion. In particular, the temporality of linear progress associated with railroad technology is suspended, fractured, and defamiliarized. These texts “see” and “feel” time, as Ah Goong proclaims. But though they exemplify the dehumanizing forces of capitalism’s abstraction of labor time, Kingston’s and Fung’s texts nevertheless reject the disciplinary temporality of normative kinship, linear progress, and reproduction. If “time is a body,” their bodies gesture to a temporal embodiment whose relations and modes of belonging unfold as History 2. As Chakrabarty states, “In the reproduction of its own life-process, capital encounters relationships that present it with double possibilities. . . . History 2’s are thus not pasts separate from capital; they are pasts that inhere in capital and yet interrupt and punctuate the run of capital’s own logic.” 78 Imagining relations that do not contribute to capital’s self-reproduction, Kingston and Fung present the queer temporalities of History 2. For Ah Goong, the embodiment of a queer temporality is anchored by maternal longing and matrilineality. In his repeated, self-directed questioning of the meaning or purpose of a man’s life, the literal and symbolic value of his penis leads him to gender resignification. During the Chinese railroad strike, Ah Goong wanders the forests pondering the value of masculinity symbolized by his penis: he “just looked at it, wondering what it was for, what a man was for, what he had to have a penis for.” 79 Within the evolution of his gender resignification, Ah Goong questions not only the norms associated with masculine power but also the symbolic burdens he’s forced to contend with. His thoughts turn to the “rumor of an Injun woman called Woman Chief, who led a nomadic fighting tribe from the eastern plains as far as these mountains. She was so powerful that she had four wives and many horses.” 80 The juxtaposition of these seemingly unrelated reflections present to Ah Goong the quandary of settler colonialism. While Ah Goong never sees Woman Chief, the rumor of her existence displaces the gender, sexual, and spatial norms he associates with masculinity. Instead of expressing paternalistic control over a virginal, “empty” landscape, the Woman Chief’s defense of her land becomes an embodiment of matrilineal power. Having experienced the disembodied passages of alien labor time, Ah Goong’s disillusionment leads him to express a distinctly maternal and matrilineal reproductive desire that reverses the normative paternalism and reproductive logic of white settler colonialism. During the “driving out” of Chinese labor after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire conveys itself through an actively resignified gender lens. As he passes a farm, he finds an “imp child”; he stops and the baby crawls into his lap. He tells the child, “I wish you were my baby. . . . ‘My daughter,’ he said. ‘My son.’ He couldn’t tell whether it was a boy or a girl.” 81 Here Ah Goong’s reproductive desire follows a matrilineal arc because it operates outside the norms of blood lineage and paternal inheritance in which strict gender codes are embedded. Not knowing whether the child is a boy or a girl, Ah Goong displaces gender codes altogether. The disembodying temporality of railroad labor here productively disorients the iterative temporality on which gender construction relies. Ah Goong’s matrilineal desire comes into fullest relief after his return to China, when he attempts to substitute the fourth of his four sons with an unwanted baby girl born to neighbors down the road. Disappointed that he has only sons and jealous of his neighbors’ daughter, Ah Goong is considered insane, a “man who did not know the value of what he had” 82 with four sons. After secretly trading his son for the daughter, he feels that “with his soul he adopted her, full diaper and all.” 83 Later, when he is forced to return the girl, “Ah Goong clung to his baby as if she were holding him up.” 84 Without hope of realizing his reproductive desires, he rejects all sense of masculine propriety. It is this reproductive failure that causes him to begin “taking his penis out at the dinner table, worrying it, wondering at it, asking why it had given him four sons and no daughter, chastising it, asking it whether it were yet capable of producing the daughter of his dreams.” 85 He becomes a figure of parodic masculinity, whose frequent exhibitionism—“yank[ing] open that greatcoat—no pants” 86 —underscores the phallic unfulfillment of normative paternalistic kinship. But Ah Goong’s story doesn’t end with the pessimism of alien temporality; rather, it emphasizes its continual deferral of linear time. After his return to China, he embarks yet again for Gold Mountain and arrives in San Francisco. But here the linear trajectory of his narrative unravels, divorcing space from temporality. Kingston offers multiple narrative possibilities. In the first, Ah Goong is in an underground arsenal under Chinatown, “inside the earth,” 87 and is presumed to have died during the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906: “Some say he died falling into the cracking earth.” 88 In another version he is brought back to China because “he was not making money; he was a homeless wanderer, a shiftless, dirty, jobless man with matted hair, ragged clothes, and fleas all over his body. He ate out of garbage cans. He was a louse eaten by lice. A fleaman.” 89 The narrator offers a final possibility: “Maybe he hadn’t died in San Francisco, it was just his papers that burned.” 90 In this version he emerges from the “miraculous earthquake and fire,” 91 which burned down the Hall of Records so that “every China Man was reborn out of that fire a citizen.” 92 Ah Goong’s rebirth is accompanied by another birth: “He had been seen carrying a child out of the fire, a child of his own in spite of the laws against marrying.” 93 Each of these versions capture elements of Ah Goong’s temporal and spatial estrangement as an undisciplined subject of capitalist social relations: living underground, as a “homeless wanderer,” and finally as a father. This reorganization of time, space, and identity is further accentuated by the earthquake, a crisis event that will interfere with the discursive constitution of Chinese bodies as “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” In the final version, where Ah Goong emerges phoenixlike from the fire, he becomes an agent of resignification. As Eng notes, “Like the elimination of a single term in a sign chain, the burning of the Hall of Records—the literal destruction of these particular documents—demands a subsequent shift in meaning, a shift in the relational terms that attempt to shore up the historical ruins of the archive.” 94 The narrator surmises, “He had built a railroad out of sweat, why not have an American child out of longing?” 95 However, the fulfillment of his “longing” for kinship does not reproduce the temporal discipline of heteronormative reproduction; rather, it expresses a mode of belonging that symbolically fulfills his matrilineal desire. Ah Goong occupies a queer temporality in which alien survival and reproduction arise outside of the temporal discipline of settler capitalism. Countering the symbolic role of the child to reproduce normative logics and values of white life, what Lee Edelman refers to as the “absolute value of reproductive futurism,” Ah Goong’s “child out of longing” represents the potentiality of matrilineal desire and, against settler biopower, expresses an alien mode of survival. In the aftermath of the earthquake and fire, many of those kin relations will be impurely, discursively constituted as “paper sons.” As such, the alien child does not represent the guaranteed futurity of white settler colonialism but a potential deferral of patrilineal reproduction while promoting the fictive, queer kinship of alien longing as one temporality of History 2. The politics of embodiment are thus expressed in China Men through Ah Goong’s gender resignification, which rejects the paternalistic codes of setter territorialization and temporal discipline. At the same time, by foregrounding a matrilineal identity that values daughters and empowers women, Ah Goong expresses various desires that intersect with transgender embodiment. Expressing gender and sexual difference as modes of embodiment, he interrupts the stability of gender and its assumed correspondence to biological sex. As an articulation of transgender identifications, Ah Goong disrupts what Susan Stryker identifies as the presumed “‘wholeness’ of the body and ‘sameness’ of its sex . . . [as] socially constructed.” 96 Desiring a daughter, “fucking the world,” and berating his penis, Ah Goong confounds the equivalence of sex and gender, highlighting instead how “‘sex’ is a mash-up, a story we mix about how the body means, which parts matter most, and how they register in our consciousness or field of vision.” 97 In the context of nineteenth-century labor, Ah Goong’s transgender expression is significant in its disidentification with a notion of equivalence. In other words, his identity is not an expression of an abstract equivalence that can be substituted under the homogenizing process of labor under capitalism, where equality is an enforced condition of alienation. 98 Indeed, as David Harvey puts it: “There is nothing more unequal than the equal treatment of unequals; how the equality presupposed in the market exchange of things deludes us into a belief in the equality of persons.” 99 In Ah Goong’s performance of gender and sexual difference, he attaches the logic of equivalence that abstracts labor into homogeneous temporal units of human labor to a profoundly masculine logic. Moreover, in his rejection of the terms of equivalence that counteract the reproduction of capitalist logic, he embodies the potential of History 2. In Dirty Laundry the themes of embodiment, retrieval, and difference are captured in the idea of “family resemblance” that becomes part of the narrative frame for the video’s historical and fictional sections. The fictional travelogue centered on Roger brings together ideas of queer temporality in order to reanimate and embody Chinese Canadian history. What’s at stake in this history is presented as a mystery surrounding the sexual identity of his great-grandfather, whose framed picture Roger’s father has insisted he take along with him on his business trip. When he accidentally breaks the frame to reveal a hidden photographic portrait of his grandfather touching hands with another man, he is unsure how to interpret the photograph. The broken picture frame becomes a visual metaphor for what Lowe calls an “alternative mode of inquiry” that allows us to move beyond “the singular history that frames a particular image of Chinese immigrant labour . . . that memorializes the static, single artifact.” 100 But in the context of figurative and thematic substitutions that the video foregrounds, the hidden photograph presents a queer opening that works against the fetish to reveal rather than conceal the features of an alien labor temporality. The analysis of the mysterious photograph expands rather than contracts the range of historical possibilities that relate to Chinese sexuality and assumed perversion. Although Roger admits to the train steward that he doesn’t “know how to read” the revealed photograph, the Chinese steward responds, “This is normal in China. . . . Men hold hands.” As Francis observes, the steward’s reply raises the “question of how the ‘normal’ is constituted in different cultural contexts and historical eras.” 101 After they have sex, Roger asks the steward, “You know what you were saying about men holding hands. What does it mean?” The steward replies, “That they like each other, they’re brothers. . . . It’s a smart thing. If they’re lovers, no one asks any questions.” This “smart thing” is the illegibility of queer historiography. The video does not impose a teleology of queer becoming. In many ways, the linear direction of identity formation in the traditional bildungsroman is frustrated here. It is the unresolved, illegible queer history that animates Roger’s quest to engage in genealogy. The ambiguity of the great-grandfather’s sexuality is what is given ontological priority in the video as an expression of pre-Stonewall conceptions of sexual difference. As Nayan Shah underscores in one of the video’s interviews, “The whole notion that sexual identity is your identity, that somehow who you desire and who you sleep with and who you have sexual pleasures with somehow says something very revealing about you, is a completely new notion.” Just as Ah Goong’s gender resignification takes on a “perverse” relation to masculinist norms, the ambiguity of Roger’s great-grandfather’s sexual identity frustrates the growing “incitement to speak” that Foucault attributes to the rise of liberal individualism in the late nineteenth century. The point is, his great-grandfather’s sexual ambiguity, its deferral of concrete meaning, stands as the content of his difference. Here again, the emphasis on sexual difference frustrates a logic of equivalence that capitalism abstracts out of human labor. In the video’s final frame, the photograph comes to life as the great-grandfather and friend/lover walk out of the frame, away from the photographer’s studio backdrop. That the photographic subjects are roles played by Roger and the steward creates a correspondence between historical and contemporary notions of same-sex affiliation without collapsing contemporary sexual identities with what Francis describes as the “homosocial ambiguities of history.” 102 Rather, the substitution of Roger and the steward for their historical predecessors highlights the role of sexuality for reanimating abstract conceptions of labor and history. In its focus on family genealogy, the video offers a narrative of literal and figurative family resemblances that traces alternative modes of affiliation and belonging that do not reproduce capitalism’s disciplinary temporalities. As countermemory, Dirty Laundry rejects the iconicity of both the lonely Chinese bachelor and the sexually perverse Chinese body and replaces them with an empty stage that frustrates the reproductive, linear trajectory of History 1. My argument in this chapter has focused on the way Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminate how the fusion of temporal otherness and sexual vice converge into a biological expression of abstract alien labor. Their experimental forms offer a new context for understanding why the first immigration laws in Canada and the United States were passed in the aftermath of railroad construction to prevent the infiltration and proliferation of abstract alien labor. Although a comparatively smaller population, the fact that Chinese students, diplomats, and merchants were exempted from immigration restriction laws in the United States and Canada exemplifies the way perversity was identified with the particular features of industrial labor within a capitalist mode of production. I have situated Kingston’s and Fung’s texts as responses to the celebrated temporality of the telegram that began this chapter that exposes the censored content of Van Horne’s sketch of the Chinese laborer. This is the literal and figurative backside of the normative settler temporality celebrated on the face of the telegram. Against the homogenizing logic of racial equivalence, Kingston and Fung present queer recuperations of the “perverse” temporalities of alien labor within the consolidating logic of settler colonial capitalism. In their countermemories of the history of settler national unification by rail, their texts expose the logics of racialized alignment between alien bodies and abstract labor. Exploring queer temporalities of History 2, they counteract the logics of substitution as equivalence that reproduce a capitalist labor temporality of expanding the working day and speed-up. In the next chapter, I turn to the other side of the antinomical view of capitalist relations: romantic anticapitalism’s hypostatizing of the concrete, natural, thingly side of the antinomy. Drawing on the 1920s and 1930s as the apex of anti-Asian animosity and exclusionary immigration policy in both Canada and the United States, I explore the development of romantic anticapitalism, which expresses its racial animus toward the abstract Asian alien through an identification with the natural landscape and Indigeneity. Within a capitalist logic of settler colonialism, the Native and the land become biologized expressions of the concrete dimension of the social world.",

J. T. Mitchell, “Imperial Landscape” Undoing Landscape I begin this chapter with an unnatural scene: an old photograph of a tree surrounded by a crowd of onlookers (figure 2.1 ). It is nighttime. White men under gleaming hats stand with their hands in their pockets. On the left appear the blurred faces of a couple, walking arm in arm toward the camera. They are dressed as if they are on a date at the movies. Some of the bystanders look ahead, away from the camera, while others look back, impervious to the glare of the flash. There seems to be nothing aesthetically remarkable about the tree in the background except its sturdiness, emphasized by its proportional dominance, and its three solid branches jutting out like tines on a pitchfork. It turns out that the photograph is lying. What we do not see is that the occasion for the social gathering is the body of a lynched man who hangs from one of the tree’s branches. The photograph belongs to a series by artist Ken Gonzales-Day entitled Erased Lynching , in which he digitally removes the victim from the lynching scene. These are scenes that were captured and circulated on postcards in western states from 1850 to the 1930s, and most of the victims were not black. As Gonzales-Day explains, “Native Americans, Chinese, and Latinos of Mexican and Latin American descent were lynched in California . . . guided by anti-immigration sentiments, the fear of miscegenation, a deep frustration with the judicial system, or in combination with white supremacy.” 1 The vast majority of lynching victims he uncovered were of Latino descent. FIGURE 2.1 Ken Gonzales-Day, Erased Lynching , 2006. Courtesy of the artist. Gonzales-Day’s manipulation of lynching scenes is remarkable for the way it produces visibility out of erasure, inverting the power of the visual field. By shifting the spectacular nature of the lynched body onto the spectators, Erased Lynching moves the viewer’s attention to the visuality of lynching itself. Not only does it draw our attention to the expressions of the spectators, but we are also confronted by the cultural apparatus and circulation of lynching images, what Gonzales-Day refers to as the “aesthetics of the event, from the physical act to the creation of the lynching photograph and its progeny, the souvenir card, view card, and postcard.” 2 It also draws our attention back to the tree, whose former innocence is replaced by purposeful attributes of branch height and species—primarily native oak species 3 —that facilitated the mechanics of lynching. In addition, the large, life-size scale of Gonzales-Day’s photographic rendering serves to insert the contemporary viewer into the lynching scene, implicating us as consumers of the spectacle of racial violence and participants in their circulation. For the purposes of this chapter, Gonzales-Day’s photograph is significant not only for the way it counteracts the spectacle of the lynched racial body, but also for how it reverses the normative power we associate with landscape. The anchoring tree, as the primary subject of the viewing public, is stripped of the romanticism we attach to “scenery.” As a photograph rather than a painting, it communicates less the spiritual aesthetic of landscape than what Gonzales-Day describes as an artifact that “remains trapped somewhere between memento and evidence.” 4 In its inversion of the visual content of the image—rendering the white spectators, rather than the lynched body, as racial spectacle—Gonzales-Day exposes the power of perspective and subjective identification, elements that are intrinsic to the aesthetic technology of landscape. In manipulating viewers’ capacity to identify with the scene, Erased Lynching activates the notion of landscape as a medium rather than strictly a genre of art. This follows W. J. T. Mitchell’s insistence that we examine “not just what landscape ‘is’ or ‘means’ but what it does , how it works as a cultural practice.” 5 In this case, the landscape functions as both a witness and accomplice to racial violence. Following the last chapter’s focus on the racialization of Chinese workers as abstract labor, an economism that aligned Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism, this chapter probes how settler colonial constructions of the landscape express the other side of the antinomy: the concrete, thingly, natural dimension Postone describes as that which “appears as the variegated surface of immediate sensuous experience.” 6 While Asian labor personifies the abstract circuits of capitalism, settler colonial constructions of landscape express the opposite: the concrete, pure, and authentic noncapitalist dimension of nature. That the social world appears antinomical—that is, characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions—is a function of the fetish, which conceals the social relations behind products of human labor, repressing the duality of commodity-determined labor. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminated in the last chapter, Chinese labor was associated with a perverse temporality, one that rendered Chinese bodies fungible (like currency) and a signifier of moral corruption. As such, Chinese bodies occupied the abstract dimension of the antinomy, as subjects “abstracted from all particularity” 7 insofar as Chinese bodies are interchangeable with other Chinese bodies. White labor, on the other hand, was individual, tangible, concrete, and of social value. Postone describes this structure of social relations as a “quasi-natural opposition” of two objective worlds: “The relation of these two worlds of objectivity can then be construed as that of essence and appearance, or as that of an opposition (as has been expressed historically, for example, in the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought).” 8 Postone’s emphasis on the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought is particularly germane for our consideration of landscape, which is associated with both western romanticism and an imperialist aesthetic. As Mitchell observes, the Chinese antecedents of western landscape “flourished most notably at the height of Chinese imperial power and began to decline in the eighteenth century as China itself became an object of English fascination and appropriation at the moment England was beginning to experience itself as an imperial power.” 9 From this view, landscape can be seen to function as a fetish itself, “symptom[atic] of the rise and development of capitalism; the ‘harmony’ sought in landscape [can be] read as a compensation for and screening off of the actual violence perpetrated there.” 10 It is precisely because landscape appears real, natural, and thingly, rather than a way of seeing and a culturally mediated representation of nature, that it seems antithetical to the very circuits of capitalism and imperialism that Mitchell identifies with it. Here, as Postone clarifies, “the opposition of its abstract and concrete dimensions allows capitalism to be perceived and understood in terms of its abstract dimension alone; its concrete dimension can thereby be apprehended as noncapitalist.” 11 In other words, capitalism is understood in terms of its abstract dimension, noncapitalism (and anticapitalism) with its concrete dimension. Thus, building on the last chapter’s examination of settler exclusion of abstract alien labor because of its “perverse” alignment with capital, this chapter examines the settler identification with the western landscape and idealization of Native peoples as a further expression of the romantic anticapitalism of anti-Asian sentiment and the indigenizing project of settler colonialism. We will see how settler colonialism constructs a landscape that is simultaneously a site of Native erasure and a site of indigenizing purity and authenticity. In order to excavate the racial logics of landscape in a manner that foregrounds, as Gonzales-Day’s photograph does, the interplay of racial violence, settler identification, and landscape, I look to the landscape photography of Vancouver-based artist Jin-me Yoon and the late New York–based photographer Tseng Kwong Chi. As photographic countermemory, their re-envisioning of western landscapes in Canada and the United States identifies romantic anticapitalism as a key ideology of settler colonialism. Their respective photographs of Mount Rushmore, the Canadian Rockies, and the Pacific coast parody the conventions of landscape art of the 1920s and 1930s that were established by artists such as Ansel Adams, Gutzon Borglum, the Canadian Group of Seven, and Emily Carr. In doing so, Tseng and Yoon expose how romantic anticapitalism flourished during the height of anti-Asian immigration restriction to project a settler identification with a personified, Indigenous landscape. The way early twentieth-century artists anchored white settler identity in the landscape reflects contradictory identifications with the “Native” that effectively erased the history of conquest and dispossession while expressing nostalgia for a time before capitalist modernity. This romantic idealization of nature and the “noble savage” captures the settler valorization of the concrete realm of social relations under capitalism, particularly under conditions of rapid industrialization and economic flux leading up to and following the stock market crash of 1929. Within the romantic anticapitalist logics of settler colonialism, the valorization of the concrete over the abstract realms misconstrues the appearance of capitalist relations for their reality. As Neil Levi puts it, “Romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations.” 12 In this chapter I look at the way works by Tseng and Yoon emphasize how the eugenicism embedded in an expanding conception of whiteness increasingly appropriates Indigeneity as a mode of biologizing the landscape. I situate Tseng’s and Yoon’s parodic strategies of countermemory within the theoretical framework of disidentification articulated by José Esteban Muñoz. For Muñoz, disidentification works alternatively as an artistic process, a mode of performance, and a critical hermeneutic. It is a mode of “shuffling back and forth between reception and production.” 13 By highlighting disidentification as a frame for Tseng’s and Yoon’s artistic process and performance, I read their engagement with landscape neither as assimilative identification nor as a wholesale rejection of it. Neither is it, as Muñoz clarifies, an “apolitical middle ground.” 14 Rather, disidentification operates as a third mode of dealing with dominant ideology that emerges from the recognition that the subject is constituted inside ideology—that there is no privileged position outside ideology from which the subject can oppose its own formation—and that resistance can occur through “negotiations between desire, identification, and ideology.” 15 Disidentification, therefore, is about “recycling or reforming an object that has already been invested with powerful energy.” 16 Tseng’s and Yoon’s projections of their alien excess against a landscape of normative racial, cultural, and aesthetic values captures the political potential that Judith Butler further ascribes to the disidentificatory encounter, “this uneasy sense of standing under a sign to which one does and does not belong.” 17 By analyzing their engagement with the cultural values it activates, I propose that Tseng’s Expeditionary Series and Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven enact modes of parody that both recycle the dominant codes associated with the landscape and transform them with their racial excess. Their encounters perform a repetition with a racial difference. As British settler nations whose colonial objective was primarily land appropriation rather than the exploitation of Indigenous labor, 18 national identity in Canada and the United States has often been defined as a product of the landscape. As Angela Miller explains of the US context, the nineteenth-century landscape encapsulated “the nationalist myth—that the physical environment itself produced national character.” 19 Similarly, in the early twentieth century in Canada, as Erin Manning suggests, the “quest for national identity [was sought] through the image of the landscape . . . where the unity of states and citizens [was] constructed on the putative ethnic or racial identity of a nation, which, in turn, is anchored to the representation of landscape.” 20 As a vital source for the expression of national identity in both nations, the continuing appeal of landscape art into the early twentieth century was often coupled with disdain for the rise of modernism. In a revealing glimpse of such antimodernist sentiment, when the Group of Seven traveled to New York State in 1913, it was not to attend the influential exhibition of international modern art at the Armory Show but to attend an exhibition of traditional Scandinavian art. 21 Within the diverse media that form the landscapes by Adams, Borglum, the Group of Seven, and Carr, none ironize or subvert—as modernist art often does—nationalist subject matter or the hierarchy of high and popular cultural forms. Instead, their works contain a romantic reverence for and spiritual identification to land as a symbolic anchor for their aestheticized “defense” of national identity. Uncovering the eugenic and Indigenizing subtexts of romantic anticapitalism that are embedded in the settler landscape, I turn first to Tseng’s Expeditionary Series to explore its citations to US photographer Ansel Adams, the Group of Seven, and Mount Rushmore sculptor and architect Gutzon Borglum. I demonstrate how his photographs prompt a recognition of landscape as both a biopolitical expression of white supremacy and a personification of white male dominion. Such a personification of the land is precisely a form of what Postone refers to as the biologization of the concrete that constitutes “expressions of that antinomic fetish, which gives rise to the notion that the concrete is ‘natural,’ and which increasingly presents the socially ‘natural’ in such a way that it is perceived in biological terms.” 22 The final section of this chapter turns to Yoon’s photographic collage Group of Sixty-Seven , whose title makes reference both to the Group of Seven painters and to 1967, the year Canada removed racial barriers to immigration. This legislation was the Canadian corollary to the Hart-Celler Immigration Reform Act of 1965 in the United States, which similarly removed race-based immigration criteria. Building on Tseng’s parody of the eugenic whiteness of the landscape, Yoon’s project highlights the fusion of the Group of Seven’s eugenic ideology with Emily Carr’s own autochthonophilia and her intense desire to “go native.” 23 Thus, Group of Sixty-Seven exposes the eugenic ideology at the core of romantic anticapitalism and the contradictory logics of exclusion and elimination that condition the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions within settler colonialism in North America. Eugenic Landscapes In 1978 the artist Tseng Kwong Chi transformed himself from an invisible minority to a visible alien. His metamorphosis came about after an experience he had on a family lunch outing at a high-end New York restaurant. Respecting the restaurant’s dress code, Tseng arrived wearing the only suit he owned: a Chinese uniform he had purchased at a Montreal thrift store. To his amusement he was greeted by the restaurant’s staff and patrons as a Chinese Communist dignitary, much to the displeasure of his parents, who years earlier had escaped from Communist China. His sister, Muna Tseng, recalls the royal treatment her brother received at the restaurant, recounting, “When we arrived . . . the maître d’ took one look at [Tseng] and treated him like a V.I.P., a gentleman from the East, an emissary from Cathay. My parents were not amused.” 24 The attention he attracted at the restaurant nevertheless produced an artistic breakthrough that led Tseng to undergo a process of orientalization, beginning with his name, which went from Joseph Tseng to Tseng Kwong Chi. Completing his wardrobe with mirrored glasses and a clip-on “Slut for Art” ID badge, Tseng reinvented himself in the stereotypical role of the inscrutable and perpetually foreign Asian. It was an identity that his friend the choreographer Bill T. Jones described as “Chinese drag.” 25 Henceforth, in Chinese drag, he took to the streets of New York, gaining unparalleled access to exclusive social events, most famously in 1980 when he crashed the opening night of the Ch’ing dynasty costume exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum. There he mingled with the rich and famous, including Henry Kissinger, William F. Buckley Jr., and Yves Saint Laurent, who, as the art critic Grady Turner relates, “commended Tseng for his fluency in French and asked if he had served in the Chinese embassy in Paris.” 26 What Tseng realized during these experiences was the vastness of Westerners’ ignorance of Asians. Therefore, drawing on a persona that simultaneously evoked foreigner, visitor, tourist, alien, and imposter, he exploited that ignorance in his photographs, which offered surprising reconfigurations of clichéd tourist scenes in North America and around the world. FIGURE 2.2 Seven Peaks, Alberta, Canada, 1986 . Photograph by Tseng Kwong Chi, East Meets West , a.k.a. The Expeditionary Self-Portrait Series 1979–1989 . © Muna Tseng Dance Projects, Inc., New York. www.tsengkwongchi.com . In the diverse fields in which Tseng’s photographs have been analyzed, from performance studies to Asian American studies, the majority of critical attention has focused on the photographs from the earlier period of his East Meets West series, for their clever juxtaposition of caricatured foreignness and touristy familiarity of Western monuments and icons, such as the Statue of Liberty, Disneyland, and the Hollywood sign. Reflecting the historical moment, the series title aptly parodied the anticommunist sentiment being reignited in 1979, on the eve of the Reagan Revolution. What many critics found remarkable about his photographs, as Margo Machida explains, is that they “counter[ed] a long history of Orientalist painting and photography by explicitly re-representing the West as if seen through a possessive ‘Occidentalist’ gaze.” 27 In contrast to this reception, however, Tseng’s later photographs featured in the same series, renamed Expeditionary Series , have garnered less attention, perhaps because they appear attenuated from the overt culture clash staged in his earlier work. For instance, Tseng’s photographs of majestic US and Canadian landscapes, such as the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and the Rocky Mountains, have been described as offering more solitary explorations of the individual’s relation to nature, which his sister describes as “recalling Chinese landscape paintings of man balanced between sky and earth.” 28 Turner further marks the shift toward natural landscapes in Tseng’s series as evidence of a romantic turn in his oeuvre: [He] put aside the confrontational implications of the earlier title to concentrate on [his] own transformation from alien tourist to American explorer. . . . The Mao suit has become irrelevant. . . . He offers us brief glimpses of a Romantic figure, an artist who has put aside his disguise to revel in the sheer power of nature. 29 This chapter reconsiders this assessment by asking whether the concerns of the latter phase of his series are absent of “confrontational implications.” Rather than a romantic homage to nature’s sublimity, I interpret Tseng’s Expeditionary Series as a queer parody of the Western conventions associated with Canadian and American landscape art of the early twentieth century. Given that landscape art of this period was broadly concerned with honoring nature’s vitality and universalizing power, the intrusion of Tseng’s alien body is a sign not of life-affirming incorporation but of extravagant degeneration. Reading the managed interplay of life, degeneration, and death as a central feature of settler colonialism and projected onto nature, I argue that Tseng’s photographs animate the biopolitics of the settler landscape in Canada and the United States. In consideration of the vexed modalities of racial impersonation that Tseng’s work elicits in Chinese drag, Butler’s discussion of gender and drag performance is useful for highlighting the ambivalent agency of parodic recycling that surrounds his work. When Butler evaluates the subversive potential of drag to expose gender constructions through imitation, she locates gender transgression less in the volitional agency of the drag queen than with the drag performance itself: “[Drag] serves a subversive function to the extent that it reflects the mundane impersonations by which heterosexual ideal genders are performed and naturalized and undermines their power by effecting that exposure.” 30 In other words, drag allegorizes the imitative structure of gender, as a recycled copy that has no original. Butler’s theorization of gender and drag presents an opening for considering race through the terms of drag performance, without collapsing the distinctions between the processes of gendering and racialization—or disregarding their intersection. 31 In particular, both racialization and gendering are processes that are historically constituted through a racist and heterosexist system that reproduces itself through its iteration in bodies, institutions, and law. It is a system that both “precedes and exceeds” the intentions of the racialized and gendered subject. 32 In the case of Tseng’s photographs, although he taps into the symbolic construction of the Asian alien through his performance, Tseng does not invent or choose the terms of his own racialization. Thus, by engaging a disidentificatory hermeneutic, my reading of Tseng’s photographs harnesses the ambivalence of queer of color parody as an opportunity to further demystify and denaturalize what Muñoz calls the “universalizing ruse of dominant culture.” 33 At one level, this mode of reading registers Tseng’s deliberate efforts to choreograph the visual dissonance in the juxtaposition of two figurative constructions: the Chinese as alien and the settler nation as landscape. At another, my analysis also mines the unintentional gaps between parodic repetition and difference that magnify how, as a queer man of color in racial drag, he epitomizes what Chandan Reddy refers to as a “material nonequivalence” to the settler landscape as an alien abstraction against a concrete expression of nature. 34 It is in this spirit of disidentification that I draw on the way Tseng’s photographs evoke the conventions of landscape art produced in the 1920s by the Canadian Group of Seven painters, the American sculptor Gutzon Borglum, and the American photographer Ansel Adams. Comprising a significant portion of the 150 black-and-white photographs Tseng took from 1979 to 1989, the Expeditionary Series captures the variation and range of landscapes he photographed in North America and around the world. A Hong Kong–born Canadian immigrant who attended art school in Paris and lived his adult years in New York among a vibrant set of artists until his death from AIDS in 1990, 35 Tseng’s perception of the landscape in North America and elsewhere was undoubtedly informed by his transnational movements. Excavating the historical context surrounding his photographic references to North American landscapes of the 1920s, a generative period of landscape art in Canada and the United States, I focus on Tseng’s Seven Peaks Snowfield and Lake Moraine , both located in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, and Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. As “natural wonders” of the West, Banff National Park and Mount Rushmore are two sites firmly positioned in settler colonial mythologies of the North American landscape. Banff owes much of this popular mythology to the Group of Seven landscape painters who made Canada’s Western landscape a central subject of many of their paintings. In the United States this mythology is indebted to Gutzon Borglum, the architect behind the colossal sculpture of the four presidents’ faces at Mount Rushmore. With respect to the highly aestheticized quality of Tseng’s dramatic black-and-white photographs, they also recall the visually operatic Yosemite photographs of Ansel Adams. However, unlike Adams, Tseng disrupts the sublime tranquility of the natural landscape by inserting his caricatured body into the frame. Tseng engages with the mythic landscape as an artistic subject that was foundational for the legacy of the Group of Seven and Adams, as well as in terms of the way space and scale are crucial components of the visual impact of Mount Rushmore. Confronting the tangled strands of national history, artistic convention, and regenerative racial power that are projected onto these diverse landscapes, Tseng’s photographs capture what Mitchell calls the “dreamwork” of settler colonialism. 36 By putting his alien excess into racial tension with the landscape, Tseng’s parody of early twentieth-century landscape art brings to light a romantic idealization of nature that, in the context of North America, is infused with eugenic ideologies of white racial regeneration. Evolving out of social Darwinist theory, eugenics emerged in the late nineteenth century and grew in the early decades of the twentieth century with the support of both conservatives and progressives. As Daniel Kevles explains, “The progressives and the conservatives found common ground in attributing phenomena such as crime, slums, prostitution, and alcoholism primarily to biology and in believing that biology might be used to eliminate these discordances of modern, urban, industrial society.” 37 According to Kevles, racial thinking “played a major part in American and Canadian versions of this [eugenic] creed,” 38 based on fears raised from the influx of non–Anglo Saxon immigrants and the social degeneracy those groups were associated with. The 1920s and early 1930s represented the apex in the eugenics movement, with the passage of numerous eugenics sterilization laws—particularly in California, British Columbia, and Alberta—which inordinately targeted racial minorities and immigrants. 39 While the scientific justification for eugenics had waned slightly after World War I, eugenics nevertheless persisted in institutionalized forms. Knowledge of eugenics’ false claims did not, as Mary Coutts and Pat McCarrick explain, “decrease the pressure for legislation, judicial action, or immigration controls.” 40 Indeed, immigration restrictions directed at Chinese migrants to the United States and Canada coincided with the intensification of eugenic ideology from the nineteenth century into the twentieth. After passage of the 1875 Page Act, which effectively restricted the entry of Chinese women for their presumed sexual immorality, the United States passed its first race-based federal immigration restriction through the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was in effect from 1882 to 1943. In 1885 the Canadian government passed its own race-based immigration restriction through the Chinese Head Tax, a tax designed to deter Chinese migrants from entering Canada. By the mid-1920s, both Canada and the United States had intensified and expanded earlier restrictions on Chinese migrants. In Canada these measures extended restrictions to other Asian migrants and further deterred Chinese immigration through the passage of the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which excluded most classes of Chinese migrants until 1947. The United States, having also broadened restrictions to encompass other Asian migrants, passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which intensified previous race-based restrictions through its exclusion of most Asian ethnic groups and foreigners who were deemed “biologically inferior.” 41 The persistence and growth of anti-Asian policy from the 1880s to the 1940s reflects what Erika Lee refers to as the “hemispheric Orientalism” that took hold along the West Coast of North America. 42 Despite their nationalist pretensions, Canada and the United States were bound by a shared commitment to preserving the transnational power and normativity of whiteness. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds put it, the “project of whiteness was a paradoxical politics, at once transnational in its inspiration and identifications but nationalist in its method and goals.” 43 Fears over the degeneration of Anglo-Saxon stock were present in the art world as well. The Canadian Group of Seven painters reflected these anxieties over the diminishing strength of the white Nordic race in their painting, believing that the Canadian landscape held “replenishing power” that could disinfect what one member called a “low receptive reservoir into which pours the chaos of ages, the mixed concord and discord of many varied peoples.” 44 Employing tropes associated with hygiene and mental health, they put forward a mission to “clean this reservoir . . . or we will remain a confused people.” 45 In the US context, Deborah Bright draws out the anticapitalist basis of Ansel Adams’s romanticism, noting that his early twentieth-century photographs represented a “mixture of Progressive Era phobias about industrialization and encroaching alien populations with an equally conservative nostalgia for the myth of preindustrial organic society.” 46 Fears of white race suicide also informed Gutzon Borglum’s vision of Mount Rushmore, a colossal-scale sculptural project that he began in 1924 and did not live to see completed seventeen years later. Expressing his fears of miscegenation, he once wrote, “Here we have in the filtering of Asiatic and North African blood [into Europe] the complete vitiating of the vigor and intellect of the civilization existing in these once pure European peoples.” 47 Thus romantic, regenerative, and preservationist motifs were infused in North American landscape art of the period and reflected deep anxieties over the racial “health” of the industrializing settler nation. And despite the absence of human or nonwhite representation in many of these works, my analysis of these landscapes heeds Martin Berger’s assessment that in North American art since the nineteenth century, “a decidedly racialized perspective animated even those cultural products most removed from racial concerns.” 48 The hyperbolic orientalism of Tseng’s persona in the Expeditionary Series confronts these defensive logics embedded in the romanticized colonial landscape in ways that denaturalize the abstract, universalizing, and absorptive power of its conventions. As such, Tseng’s photographs tap into the historicism of parody, which Linda Hutcheon defines as “an inscription of the past in the present [that] embod[ies] and bring[s] to life actual historical tensions.” 49 In Chinese drag, Tseng’s exaggerated performance “mimes and renders hyperbolic” a host of normative race, gendered, and sexual conventions that are literally and figuratively naturalized in the landscape. 50 As the alien, the dissonance between his body and the landscape delineates the racialized abstraction of Asians and their symbolic excess to national culture. The Chinese male body in North America was historically constituted as nonreproductive, perverse, and feminized, which was reinforced through legal and extralegal restrictions on interracial intimacies, restrictions on the immigration of Chinese women, and aggressive enclosure in the domestic labor market. Thus the alien sexuality Tseng elicits can also be seen as the product of a biopolitical landscape whose regenerative energy is directed at the degeneration and exclusion of alien bodies. Moreover, as a queer artist who referred to himself as a “snow queen” because of his preference for white men, 51 Tseng’s queer white desire—a desire for incorporation into a white landscape of artists and gay culture—creates a productive tension with the gender and sexual objectification of the Asian body. The conflicted relations and identifications that Tseng’s photography stages capture a mode of disidentification that negotiates “between desire, identification, and ideology.” 52 Disrupting an exceptionalist imagining of Canada or the United States as a concrete, pristine wilderness, Tseng’s photographs reframe the settler colonial landscape as a racial borderland of symbolic violence. With the exception of a handful of photographs taken in British Columbia, the main focus of Tseng’s Canadian landscapes is the Rocky Mountains of Banff National Park in Alberta. Established in 1885 as Canada’s first national park and modeled after Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Banff National Park is one of the most iconic wilderness symbols of Canadian national identity. In Rob Shields’s analysis of Banff’s nationalist symbolism, he suggests that “Banff can serve as a metaphor for the Canadian condition: the peremptory Canadian self of the present clings to an image of a European past (or an ideal future) and refuses to confront the violence and paradox of its own making.” 53 In short, Banff reflects the worldview of European settlers who modeled the area after nineteenth-century European spas and tourist retreats. The city itself is named for a country seat on the northeast coast of Scotland between Aberdeen and Inverness, a name indicative of the vast colonial respatialization of Native territory. Resignified and repackaged in an endless series of tourist photographs and postcards, Banff conveys the purity of nature that contrasts with the impurities associated with the urban environment. What is evacuated from Banff’s symbolic repository is the displacement of First Nations peoples as the region’s original inhabitants. Native voices have largely been silenced, while their identities have been appropriated as tourist commodities that serve to authenticate the “naturalness” of the environment. The birth of Canada’s first national park in 1885 also coincides with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the transcontinental railroad responsible for the park’s creation. 54 As discussed in the last chapter, construction of the railroad employed thousands of Chinese railroad workers recruited from the United States, who tunneled through the most treacherous sections of British Columbia’s Fraser Canyon. Only after the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed did a Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration persuade the Canadian government to take measures to restrict the entry of Chinese migrants. As noted earlier, the government responded by enacting its first race-based immigration restriction, the Chinese Head Tax, which required that Chinese migrants pay $50 to disembark in Canada. By 1903 this sum had climbed to $500. Hence the very conditions of possibility for Banff’s pristine environment depended on appropriating and eliminating Indigenous peoples and exploiting and excluding aliens. Here, as in other settler states, elimination and exclusion are two ways that settler colonialism cuts both ways. 55 Despite the fact that Banff National Park is located in the valley of the Bow River in the southern part of Alberta, Banff’s snowy alpine landscape nevertheless evokes Canada’s nationalist identification with the North. Shelagh Grant explains that conceptualizations of the Canadian North have been informed by both British and American romantic idealizations of nature in the nineteenth century: “British aesthetic myth blended with American wilderness myth to reinforce a Romantic image of north.” 56 An integral feature of Canada’s national identity—showcased no less in the first verse of the national anthem, “O Canada, our true North strong and free”—the North is nonetheless a moving construction that is articulated through representations ranging from the Canadian arctic to Banff’s alpine elevation. The unfixed character of the North is what Sherrill E. Grace calls “magnetic north,” a “north whose parameters seem always to be shifting.” 57 The development of Canada’s northern identity is often attributed to the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven artists. An artist collective that rose to national fame in the 1920s and was credited with producing the first “national” art, their landscapes set out to reflect what they saw as an authentic Canadian spirit that was not derivative of European or American art traditions. Manning explains that “while the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven do not create the type of nationalism that is based on an ideology of the land, they do play a role in supporting the myth of the ‘great white north.’” 58 Drawing on tropes of purity, rugged masculine strength, and individualism, Group of Seven founder and spokesperson Lawren Harris saw the North as a spiritual realm untouched by history, humanity, or capitalist modernity. Harris writes in “The Story of the Group of Seven” that “what I was groping toward [was] Canada painted in her own spirit,” 59 and he elaborates the connections between race, nation, and northernness in his essay “Revelation of Art in Canada”: We are in the fringe of the great North and its living whiteness, its loneliness and replenishment, its resignations and release, its call and answer—its cleansing rhythms. It seems that the top of the continent is the spiritual flow that will ever shed clarity into the growing race of America, and we Canadians being closest to this source seem destined to produce an art somewhat different from our Southern fellows—an art more spacious, of a greater living quiet, perhaps of a more certain conviction of eternal values. 60 Harris’s conceptualization of a North equipped with the spiritual powers that could “cleanse” the nation through an interplay of “living whiteness” and “loneliness and replenishment” is indicative of his racial anxieties of immigrants who contributed to “the growing race of America.” Moreover, crafting an exceptionalist narrative around Canada as the most northerly nation in the Americas, Harris attributes to Canada a primary role as spiritual compass and regenerative source for the continent. Tseng’s Rocky Mountain landscapes contain sly allusions to a romantic conceptualization of wilderness as a purifying and regenerative national symbol that the Group of Seven idealized. For instance, Tseng’s Seven Peaks, Alberta, Canada, 1986 (figure 2.2 ) references the phallic majesty of mountains, trees, and icebergs that dominate the Group’s paintings. 61 Commenting on the Group’s authority over the Canadian landscape, Manning remarks that “for many years the quintessential Canadian landscape painting was an image of an unpopulated wilderness, with Tom Thomson’s ancient pine tree or Lawren Harris’s icebergs at the forefront.” 62 The Group’s tendency to position these natural subjects—mountains, trees, and icebergs—as visual anchors in their paintings has been well documented as reflecting heavily gendered ideas of nature. Towering mountains and trees were associated with a heroic masculinity that exercised their superiority over the changing, ephemeral, and feminized qualities of water and wind. A case in point is Harris’s renowned painting Mt. Lefroy , which depicts a large snowcapped mountain that evokes qualities of nobility, imperviousness to change, and purity and expresses, Berger states, “a distinctly masculine aesthetic.” 63 In particular, Mt. Lefroy ’s peak seems to almost puncture the overhead clouds, while light ripples away from the site of entry—as if to illuminate the nobility of the peak’s act of penetration. The connotations of forced sexual penetration and feminized submission are intentional, Joan Murray explains, given that Harris “believed in expressing sexuality in symbolic terms, and in his Lake Superior and Rockies subjects, the use of such semi-symbolic sexual imagery (penal [sic ] mountains and vaginal clouds) [is] overt.” 64 In Mt. Lefroy , masculine virility constitutes the power of the mountain and its domination of the feminine ephemera that lie below and hover overhead. These anthropomorphic motifs are consistent with the Group of Seven’s broader symbolic language, in which mountains and trees represent white, heterosexual, and paternal resistance to what Robert Linsley calls “inundation from below, and submission to the powers above . . . like a spike that is meant to pin together a stable identity out of spiritual, social, and sexual experiences that are all by nature transitory.” 65 The sturdy tree or towering mountain therefore celebrates a virile masculine individualism that is in constant tension with threatening lower elements that allegorized the Group’s fears, widespread in the 1920s and 1930s, about racial and ethnic mixing and the corresponding degeneration of a white, Nordic race. 66 Some of the racial implications of the Group’s landscapes come into further relief in the way Tseng’s photographs echo Adams’s environmentalist photography. Originating in the late nineteenth century, the American environmentalist movement regained momentum after World War I and bore the imprint of escalating eugenicist thought. In particular, eugenic ideology fused wilderness protection with white racial preservation through analogies that linked the degradation of the natural environment with the degeneration of the white race through miscegenation and rising nonwhite populations. Alexandra Minna Stern explains that during the 1920s, efforts to save redwood trees in California served as a “metaphor for defending race purity and ensuring the survival of white America.” 67 Inspired by Sierra Club founder John Muir, Bright explains, Adams “se[t] out to produce a photographic version of the nature publicist’s writings” and played an immense role in constructing an environmentally focused vision of the American landscape. 68 Despite the progressive agenda attributed to Adams’s landscapes, Bright points out that “the rugged western wilderness [was] a locus for the sentiments of white, middle-class Americans around nationalistic and ethnocentric ideals [that] cannot be overlooked in any discussion of the development of environmentally concerned photography.” 69 As such, the grandeur of Adams’s landscapes, analogous to the Group of Seven’s, could provide spiritual reassurance of the durability of the white race, its ability to persevere in the face of lower castes. Stern explains that eugenicists “profoundly shaped California’s landscapes” and subscribed to the belief—reflected in Adams’ and the Group of Seven’s regenerative narratives about nature—that “exposure to nature” was a “method of containing the worst and actualizing the best of human’s evolutionary and hereditary predispositions.” 70 Exemplified in Monolith (figure 2.3 ), the mountains and trees featured in Adams’s photography stood for what many conservationists viewed as the “stateliness, grandeur, and perseverance—represent[ing] the ‘great race.’” 71 Discussing the way conservationists collapsed distinctions between the redwood and white America, Stern writes: “Like Anglo-Saxon America, which was being engulfed by hordes of defectives and mongrels and menaced by the excessive breeding of undesirables, the redwood was imperiled by ‘race suicide’ from rampant logging, urban encroachment, and human ignorance.” 72 While mobilizing against the expropriation and destruction of natural resources was certainly a worthwhile cause, romantic anticapitalism framed the struggle in racial terms. For both the Group of Seven and Adams, racial ideologies could be invisibly projected onto the impermeable mountains in Banff and at Yosemite. As a cultural practice, then, the landscape aestheticized defensive racial ideologies of white supremacy. Tseng’s Seven Peaks also plays with what Linsley describes as the “great freeze out of Canadian painting” in the 1920s, 73 referring to the Group of Seven’s emphasis on snow and ice, and exhibits an attention to lighting that recalls Adams’s compositional details. However, the inclusion of Tseng’s body displaces the anchoring image of Harris’s and Adams’s trees and mountains. If these anchoring images symbolically project the white masculine mastery over inferior forces, Tseng’s body fails to convey a sense of stability, permanence, or purity associated with the landscape. Unlike the imposing and phallic tree or mountain peak, Tseng neither dominates the surrounding landscape nor stands, to quote Linsley’s assessment of Harris’s natural imagery, as “a spike meant to pin together a stable identity.” 74 Contrasting the whiteness of his snow-filled environment, Tseng’s body highlights his dissonance with the landscape. His isolation does not suggest a rugged individualism in symbolic struggle with the surrounding elements; rather, it evokes the incongruity of his alien body against the overwhelming whiteness of the natural background. As an evolving sign of yellow peril, moreover, Tseng’s body exposes the eugenic logics of purity present in the early twentieth-century landscapes he references. As an index of the abstract, degenerative value of nonreproductive, alien sexualities, he highlights the eugenic spirit of white racial reproduction and regeneration projected onto the landscape. Finally, dwarfed by the massive mountain peaks in the background, Tseng animates the desire for what Albert Boime calls a commanding “magisterial gaze” over the landscape, “the perspective of the [North] American on the heights searching for new worlds to conquer.” 75 Although the tradition of North American landscape art promotes what Berger identifies as a “natural affirmation of white culture” through a decidedly white male gaze, 76 Tseng’s gaze is largely unreadable behind his mirrored glasses. The direction of his gaze only points back to the camera and ultimately to the viewer. In this reversal, Tseng’s photographs highlight the racial limits of the landscape’s regenerative symbolism in its reflection of white settler identification with an uncorrupted nature that exists outside the circuits of capitalism. FIGURE 2.3 Monolith , 1927. Photograph by Ansel Adams. © 2014 The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. Tseng’s photograph of Moraine Lake (figure 2.4 ) also makes references to the intersecting discourses of northernness and tourism that produce Alberta’s national parks. His deliberate or unintentional misidentification of Lake Moraine’s location in the Northwest Territories—way, way up north—humorously underscores the north ness of its more southern location in Banff National Park. Commodified by Rocky Mountain tourists who frequent the lake and rent canoes, the most literal commodification of the lake occurred when the Bank of Canada issued twenty-dollar bills featuring the lake on the reverse side of the 1969 and 1978 bills (figure 2.5 ). The scene on the bill that Tseng perfectly captures is known as the “Twenty-Dollar View.” Tseng’s recreation scene flaunts the irony at the core of the Group of Seven’s conceptualization of nature. His photograph demonstrates that, far from a space untouched by modernity where a pure white wilderness exists as a refuge from corrupting human influences, Moraine Lake represents instead the capitalist conversion of Indigenous territory into tourist sites. The high aestheticism of the mundane tourist snapshot also amplifies what Jody Berland refers to as a form of “staged authenticity,” a concept derived from Dean MacCannell’s work on the western tourist to “describe the ways in which diverse regional cultures produce themselves as touristic objects.” 77 Berland goes on to explain that “because tourists seek new experience through interaction with the other . . . they place themselves in contact with personalities and spaces that seem to represent the inside of another culture but which in fact are carefully staged to represent that inside to outsiders.” 78 Tseng adds another parodic layer to the notion of staged authenticity insofar as his photograph confuses the relation between tourist and other. He is both tourist and other. Playing with the various codes of “authenticity” that produce the tourist site, the tourist, and the alien other, he reduces the scene’s commodified grandeur to a stage that dramatizes the fetishization of the imagined colonial encounter.

On a more humorous note, Tseng’s pose, with oar raised in midstroke, also evokes the figure of the wilderness sportsman. The sportsman movement began in Canada in the late nineteenth century and promoted an ideology of the wilderness that, analogous to the burgeoning conservation movement, represented a domain of white masculine regeneration. As Lynda Jessup explains, nineteenth-century landscape paintings that depicted sportsmen coincided with the rise of sportsman clubs that aimed to “revitaliz[e] manhood” against what they perceived were the “degenerative, emasculating, effects of capitalist modernity.” 79 The sportsman was thus the antithesis of the Chinese “bachelor” of the exclusion period, who exemplified respective racial and sexual threats to white labor and white female bourgeois respectability. Pictured as an unlikely sportsman, Tseng further underscores his exclusion from the regenerative scripts associated with this wilderness genre of masculinity. In stark contrast to the leisure associated with the sportsman’s wilderness enterprise, labor defined the lives of early twentieth-century Chinese male immigrants. As discussed in the first chapter, the colonial management of Asian reproduction was largely accomplished through immigration restriction, antimiscegenation law, and segregation practices that produced “bachelor societies” in Canada and the United States. The constraints on Chinese masculinity amounted to what David Eng calls “racial castration,” the “psychic and the material limits circumscribing Asian American male subjectivity.” 80 However, in Tseng’s adaptation of the iconic nationalist scene, his parody highlights foremost the commodification of nature while prompting recognition of the white racial investment in regenerative narratives embedded in its mythology. FIGURE 2.5 Twenty-dollar Canadian bill, 1969–1979 Series, Scenes of Canada . Bank of Canada. As a multisensory medium that expresses cultural values, the landscape can be “found” in Banff National Park and Yosemite or, as Mitchell outlines, “put there by the physical transformation of a place.” 81 Examining the latter, I turn to one of Tseng’s US landscapes, Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 (figure 2.6 ), to demonstrate how Tseng’s intrusion onto the patently manufactured natural landscape also prompts an excavation of the racial logics embedded in the “shrine of democracy.” Mount Rushmore, South Dakota is in many ways exemplary of the Expeditionary Series title in its engagement with the heroic forefathers of the nation and the monument’s fearless creator, Gutzon Borglum. Four presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt—were carved into stone in a project that took seventeen years from inception to completion. As the presidents set their gaze on the westward frontier, Tseng’s body faces the presidents. What does he see? FIGURE 2.6 Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 .

Since its completion in 1941, Mount Rushmore has become such an embedded symbol of US nationalism that Cher once admitted to believing that the monument was a naturally occurring rock formation. 82 Even for those who recognize the transparent constructedness of the rock landscape, the monument nevertheless appeals to similar ideals of authenticity and purity present in the Group of Seven’s landscape paintings. Fears over the potential degeneration of a superior “Nordic” race that were projected onto the landscape reflected the transnational currency of alarmist race theories in white settler nations. Similar to the Group of Seven, whose trees and icy mountains can be interpreted as personified symbols of white paternalistic dominion over the Canadian nation, Mount Rushmore’s granite rock face brings this symbolism to a literal realm in its depiction of the nation’s heroic “forefathers.” Borglum’s rock, a medium that expresses both impermeability and permanence, shares with the Group’s paintings a reverence for nature’s strength, stability, and resistance to change. As Borglum wrote of his intentions for the memorial, “The purpose of the memorial is to communicate the founding, expansion, preservation, and unification of the United States.” 83 Interestingly, although the Group’s landscapes and Borglum’s mountain sculpture represent spaces of spiritual relief and separation from alienating bureaucratic structures and the economic determinism associated with the city, their artistic undertakings would have been impossible without substantial government funding. And, similar to the Group’s romantic pursuit of the true North, Borglum fashioned himself as a rugged explorer who “discovered” the site in the Black Hills. During the memorial’s formal dedication ceremony in 1925, he climbed the vertical face of the mountain and planted a flag on its peak. Boime explains that in this feat “Borglum was emulating [John C.] Frémont’s dramatic unfurling of the flag on the summit of the Rockies.” 84 Thus Borglum and his monument provided for Tseng a rich corpus of heroic, white, masculine, and colonial associations to emulate in his own Expeditionary Series . If the effect of the Group of Seven’s paintings was to naturalize conquest by erasing human involvement in the landscape, Borglum’s Mount Rushmore was an even more explicit homage to the ideology of Manifest Destiny. Boime observes that the monument “allegorizes the idea of Manifest Destiny” in that all four presidents had a role in the myth of divine territorial intervention. 85 These included Washington’s extensive surveying of the frontier; Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase; Lincoln’s transcontinental railroad; and Roosevelt’s role in the conquest of New Spain and construction of the Panama Canal, which provided an expedient water route to Pacific markets. In short, the monument exemplifies Mitchell’s suggestion that the “rise of landscape” is intimately connected with imperial expansion. 86 Similar to his parodic engagement with the Group of Seven, Tseng’s pose and manipulation of scale recalls a romantic tradition of landscape art that privileges a single perspective. Mount Rushmore’s participation in this tradition is rendered to the point of exaggeration, captured in the monument’s grandiose point of view. This perspective epitomizes what Boime refers to as a “magisterial aesthetics,” one that reinforces an “imperial point of view that is often expressed in American landscape painting of the nineteenth century and that remains deeply embedded in the national consciousness.” 87 In Mount Rushmore, South Dakota , the elevated perspective of the gigantic presidents’ faces symbolizes their authority over the land they govern, which is contrasted with Tseng’s subordinated and ambiguous perspective. Reversing the direction of their magisterial gaze, Tseng’s body is turned away from the viewer, and his concealed face points upward toward the four presidents. And unlike in the earlier East Meets West phase of Tseng’s series, where he often blew up the scale of his body to give the impression he was a Godzilla-esque figure threatening the various national icons he stood beside—such as the Statue of the Liberty or the Empire State Building—here Tseng’s body is dwarfed in the presence of Borglum’s homage to the nation’s forefathers. The pose Tseng adopts in this photograph brings to mind the Byronic hero, the lone romantic figure cast in relief against the natural landscape. A well-known example of these “magisterial aesthetics” is captured in a nineteenth-century piece called The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818) by the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Contained in Friedrich’s painting (figure 2.7 ) are the frequently recycled tropes of romanticism. For instance, the clouds and mountaintops intermingle in the painting to emphasize the inseparability of nature from the heavens above. At the center is the solitary traveler, who has climbed to a dangerous vantage point, his back turned to us so that the viewer can share his point of view and spiritual identification with the purity of nature. The mountains in this painting similarly evoke permanence and steadfastness. Joining earth and heaven, the intermingling craggy rocks and clouds convey both endurance and immortality. The anticapitalist subtext of this romantic vision is underscored by the wanderer’s traditional folk attire, which valorizes the cultural purity of folk life over the abstract degradations of capitalist modernity.

Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Tseng stands with his back to the viewer. However, he is standing so close that the monument loses its illusions of grandeur. Boime suggests that Mount Rushmore, “like the statue of liberty, . . . succeeds [only] through the impact of scale rather than aesthetic quality.” 88 From where Tseng stands, unable to appreciate the impact of scale, the monument cannot succeed. Using his body to emphasize distinctions of scale, Tseng also evokes Chinese landscape paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties. 89 The small scale of the human figures depicted in the paintings of these periods emphasizes the sanctuary offered by nature and the relative insignificance of human beings against an overpowering natural environment. Maxwell Hearn explains that the disintegration of the Tang dynasty was the main catalyst for the Romantic antidynastic retreat into nature: “Faced with the failure of the human order, learned men sought permanence within the natural world, retreating into the mountains to find a sanctuary from the chaos of dynastic collapse.” 90 Whether deliberate or not, the allusion to Chinese landscape painting in Tseng’s photograph is amusingly out of place at Mount Rushmore because it subverts, as Mitchell explains, “any claims for the uniquely modern or Western lineage of landscape.” 91 In particular, in the context of Mount Rushmore’s celebration of Manifest Destiny, the photograph’s connection to Chinese landscape painting further underscores the circuits of dynastic power and capital that give rise to imperial dimensions of landscape art. Through the parodic gaps between repetition and difference, Tseng’s photography brings to view the imperial dimensions of landscape art that are conditioned by the violent elimination of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of land resources. Toying with these elements of scale, Tseng dramatizes his insignificance in the face of these forefathers in a parody of heroic frontier masculinity. This parody underscores the cultural importance of frontier masculinity as a constitutive element of US national identity while emphasizing how Asian men literally fall short of its larger-than-life romanticization. As a queer Asian man, moreover, Tseng and his near invisibility underscore the multiple registers of his alienation: from constructions of white masculinity, from the whiteness of US gay male identity, and from patriarchal Asian American cultural nationalisms that reinforce a staunchly heterosexist “heroic” masculinity to combat anti-Asian racism. For instance, according to Frank Chin, Jeffery Paul Chan, Lawson Fusao Inada, and Shawn Hsu Wong of the Aiiieeeee! Collective, Asian American cultural politics must challenge the social and cultural emasculation of Asian American men by subverting stereotypes of the “good Chinese man . . . [as] the fulfillment of white male homosexual fantasy, literally kissing white ass.” 92 While Tseng assumes the guise of the explorer, however parodic, his contemplation of the four presidents might very well be read as “kissing white ass.” Thus, in Tseng’s disruption of cultural nationalist prescriptions, his physical inconsequentiality may suggest that a masculinist and heterosexist Asian American cultural nationalism falls short precisely because it further entrenches a cultural standard of white masculinity. At the same time, Tseng’s diminutiveness can also be read as a tacit acknowledgment of what Malini Johar Schueller calls “the gendered imperatives of Western imperialism and orientalism that have produced the stereotype of the effeminate Asian male.” 93 Refusing to adopt the “magisterial gaze” of the four presidents, Tseng turns his attention to the gaze itself and its presumed authority. He faces east rather than west, reversing the westward direction of the frontier that the presidents seem to be surveying. His eastward gaze counters the normative conventions of landscape that, as Patricia Nelson Limerick observes, “ran on an east-to-west track, following the physical and mental migrations of white English-speaking men.” 94 Most importantly, his eastward gaze demonstrates the fact that the westward movement of white settlers was only one small part of the process of “discovery.” A disoriented explorer, Tseng evokes the historical fact that for nonwhite immigrants, as they moved along the west–east axis of labor, internment, and other displacements, the landscape was not the simple, pure, virgin wilderness of the settler colonial imagination. Indeed, Chinese labor in North America offers a salient illustration of Raymond Williams’s remark that “a working country is hardly ever a landscape.” 95 The subtle lighting in the black-and-white photograph also has the effect of nearly disappearing Tseng. On the one hand, his invisibility underscores the illegibility of his queer Asian difference within the regenerative myths and expansionist ideologies that Mount Rushmore stands for. On the other hand, his disappearance allegorizes the repressed histories that are not etched in stone, most notably the history of the Sioux Nation: the Sioux campaigned vigorously against the monument, which was built on stolen land and commemorated the murder and dispossession of Indigenous peoples. As Boime points out, “Consistent with the pattern of destruction characteristic of national exploration and empire building, the creation and the dedication of the Mount Rushmore monument was one more symbol of the white man’s racist and intolerant Indian policy.” 96 The site of Mount Rushmore is between what is now Harney National Forest and Custer State Park, what Boime refers to as the “two most hated names in the Sioux lexicon” because of William S. Harney’s and George Armstrong Custer’s massacres of Sioux populations that led to illegal gold mining in the Black Hills. 97 The Black Hills, where Mount Rushmore is situated, houses the sacred site of Paha Sapa and is designated by the Sioux as a ceremonial place of prayer and meditation. The memorial was built despite the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which gave Dakota Indians exclusive rights to the Black Hills. Predictably, as soon as gold was discovered, white miners swiftly breached the treaty agreement to begin the illegal expropriation of natural resources and, in the case of Borglum, to blast 450,000 tons of granite from the face of the sacred Black Hills. This history underscores the contradictory logics of settler colonialism, which engages in the violent elimination and dispossession of Indigenous peoples and simultaneously expresses a desire to become Indigenous to the landscape, to naturalize settler colonialism through symbolic projection. Another history not etched into stone includes the many Chinese who worked in the Black Hills in what Liping Zhu calls the “largest Chinatown east of San Francisco from 1876 to 1910.” 98 Only since 2001, when extensive archaeological excavations of Deadwood’s Chinatown began, have widespread signs of Chinese life been revealed for examination. As Zhu notes, the gold rush brought thousands of Chinese miners to the western states, including South Dakota—although the population did not surpass 250 residents. Zhu explains that “as soon as the news spread of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer’s expedition finding gold in the mountains of western Dakota Territory, Chinese immigrants joined the last major gold rush in the nineteenth century, arriving in the Black Hills by the winter of 1875–1876.” 99 They were subject to labor exploitation and racial violence. Only recently have the Chinese, who played such an important role in this South Dakota borderland, emerged from historical repression into partial visibility, giving new meaning to the hazy outline of Tseng’s body at Mount Rushmore. But as Tseng’s suit nearly blends into the rock—suggesting that he is part of the rock—the Chinese of the Black Hills are also embedded in this borderland of invasion, dispossession, and ongoing political struggle. Like the Group of Seven, Borglum’s nationalist project was shaped by his own reactionary beliefs. Despite the rhetoric of democracy he invoked to characterize Mount Rushmore’s commemorative spirit, he was unambiguous about the perils of miscegenation. In particular, in addition to expansions in anti-immigration law, the period saw the rise in white supremacist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK ), an organization that had earlier commissioned Borglum to create a Confederate monument at Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia. His ties to the KKK were not insignificant. Borglum was an impassioned reader of Madison Grant’s Passing of the Great Race , a scaremongering, pseudoscientific treatise that “became a sacred text for eugenicists, the Klan, and proto-Nazis everywhere.” 100 Influenced by Grant’s treatise, Borglum also took to the page. In a 1923 letter to prominent Indianapolis Klansman David C. Stephenson, Borglum boasted, “I wrote 2500 to 3000 words on the evils of the alien races.” 101 In other letters to Stephenson in the early 1920s he also expressed a profound anti-Semitism in his fears of hypodescent through miscegenation, writing as follows: If you cross a thorough-bred with a jackass you get a mule. . . . The lowest race in civilization is the strongest physically and breeding (crossed) is always down. A Negro and a Jew will produce Negro, but Hindu and Jew—Jew; Chinese and Jew, offspring Jew; Italian and Jew, offspring Jew; and European race and Jew, offspring Jew. 102 As John Taliaferro notes, “He labeled immigrants ‘slippered assassins,’ . . . [and] warned that America was becoming an alien ‘scrap heap.’” 103 Even though Borglum opposed slavery, he blamed African slaves for the degeneration of the white race, writing that “it has been the character of the cargo that has eaten into the very moral fiber of our race character, rather than the moral depravity of Anglo-Saxon traders.” 104 His eugenic vision was also explicitly gendered. Boime explains that Borglum’s admiration of Benito Mussolini’s virile masculinity was in direct contrast to the effeminacy and weakness he associated with Jews. For these reasons he attempted to disassociate himself from stereotypes of the effete artist by engaging in rigorous physical activities such as rock climbing, boxing, and wrestling and crafting an aesthetic vision based on colossal forms. In this light, Tseng’s presence on the face of Mount Rushmore stages a confrontation with the manifest masculinity embedded in the shrine of democracy, a confrontation captured in his eastward gaze and richly evocative of the earlier title of the series, East Meets West . In sum, the degenerative excess signaled by Tseng’s abstract alien body powerfully underscores the romantic anticapitalism embedded in the settler colonial personification of the landscape as a concrete, racially pure, and masculine expression of a noncapitalist universe.

Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. Our Home and Native Landscape To conclude this chapter I turn to Jin-me Yoon’s 1996 photographic work Group of Sixty-Seven , which usefully complements Tseng’s parodic exposure of romantic anticapitalist ideology projected onto the nationalist landscape. Group of Sixty-Seven extends the focus on racial constructions of national landscape that first appeared in her 1991 Souvenirs of the Self postcard series, in which Yoon poses, much like Tseng, in front of familiar tourist sites in Banff National Park. Continuing her exploration of the interplay of race and landscape, Group of Sixty-Seven connects romantic anticapitalism with the fetishization of Indigenous identity and racializes Asians as a negative abstraction. Here Yoon incorporates the paintings of two iconic Canadian painters, Lawren Harris of the Group of Seven and Emily Carr, an artist deeply inspired by the Group of Seven’s nationalist vision who became renowned for her artistic interaction with Native populations in British Columbia. From the view of settler colonialism’s triangulation of settler, Native, and alien identities, Yoon’s work exemplifies how the Native and the Asian personify opposite sides of an antinomical view of capitalist relations, in which the concrete, noncapitalist dimension is Indigenous and the abstract representation of capitalist modernity is Asian. Group of Sixty-Seven (figure 2.8 ) consists of two gridlike panels, each panel containing sixty-seven photographs of Korean Canadians from Vancouver, British Columbia. On the left panel, they face away from us (figure 2.9 ), and on the right, they face us (figure 2.10 ). We can first observe the various layers of national citation in this piece. The title, Group of Sixty-Seven , makes an overt reference to the Group of Seven. The number “sixty-seven” in the title also cites Canadian confederation in 1867 and the elimination of national origins immigration quotas a hundred years later, in 1967—the crucial legal prerequisite for the appearance of many of the sixty-seven Korean Canadian faces featured in the piece. Adding another layer of citation to the Group of Seven artists, we note that behind the heads on the right panel is Lawren Harris’s Rocky Mountain painting Maligne Lake, Jasper Park . Building on Tseng’s references to the Group of Seven painters and their association of white male nationhood with landscape, Yoon’s work highlights the commodification of landscape in her use of repetition, recalling the seriality of Andy Warhol’s pop art.

Like Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroe portraits, Yoon’s piece similarly inverts high and low aestheticism and the values associated with originality and duplication. Her postmodern play of surface and depth presents a dramatic recontextualization of Harris’s Maligne Lake , which was considered the most influential painting in Toronto from the time it was painted in 1924 to 1930. 105 As one of the most celebrated nationalist works of art in Canada, art historian Dennis Reid describes Harris’s painting as a “tribute to the spiritualizing force of the country, an incentive to the spiritual capacity in us all.” 106 In keeping with his romantic views of a nation united under a spiritual conception of the North, Maligne Lake expresses a sense of control and order that defended against the turbulent social realities of the 1920s. This was a period of increasing industrialization, urbanization, and class struggle that fomented increasing antipathy toward racialized aliens, particularly Chinese labor migrants, who were subject to the Chinese Head Tax and would face exclusion through passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act. Thus the “rise of landscape” 107 and escape into a primordial, frozen wilderness in this context can be attributed to an increasing sense of chaos spurred by modernity. By invoking Harris and the Group of Seven so explicitly in this piece, Yoon invites the viewer to explore the intersection of race and romantic anticapitalism in the Group of Seven’s artwork, particularly in the racial and spatial depiction of Canada’s national identity constructed around the idea of the “Great White North.” More confrontationally, Yoon prompts the viewer to consider the relationship between these Korean faces and the essence of Nordic purity celebrated in the Group’s depiction of the landscape. By photographing sixty-seven Korean faces in front of Harris’s painted landscape, Yoon imposes what Hutcheon calls “an external order upon a work that is presumed to be original.” 108 However, Yoon manipulates the line between the authenticity of the original by repeating Harris’s landscape sixty-seven times. In terms of the dissonant media presented in the work, Yoon emphasizes the modernity of the Korean faces through her use of photography—a medium whose infinite capacity for reproduction represents an antithesis to notions of artistic originality contained in Harris’s piece. In doing so, Yoon allegorizes the way Korean Canadian bodies become racial signifiers of the abstract dimension of capitalist modernity and, alternatively, how the painted landscape becomes a signifier of the concrete dimension of nature, purity, and originality. But Yoon ultimately frustrates a view of the abstract homogeneity associated with Asians by emphasizing the gender and generational diversity of her Korean Canadian subjects against a Maligne Lake that is here reduced to “background,” its unoriginality reinforced again by Yoon’s repetition of the image. In a twist on the visual codes of the tourist snapshot, what is “real” about the photograph are the Korean faces, emphasizing both the commodification of landscape as tourist scene and its artificiality. The jarring superimposition of Asian faces onto the constructed landscape also serves as an invitation to consider why Asians have or have not been incorporated into the dominant social and cultural landscape in Canada. While Maligne Lake is celebrated as a timeless and noncontradictory representation of Canadian nationalism, it is interesting to note that it was completed one year after the passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act, in a period that saw the rise in organized anti-Asian labor agitation and the continual revision of anti-Asian legislation. What Yoon’s piece suggests, then, is that romantic expressions of Canadian nationalism that are conveyed as pastoral retreat must be read as inseparable from a history of yellow peril and anti-immigrant sentiment. If we shift to a more contemporary context, Yoon’s faces comment on the xenophobic responses to ways recent Asian immigration has redrawn the racial landscape in large urban cities such as Vancouver. Indeed, the public outcry against Hong Kong immigrant “monster houses” in Vancouver’s historically white Shaughnessy and Kerrisdale neighborhoods is one example of how the influx of Asian residential settlement outside the spatial and class confines of segregated Chinatowns reflects, as geographer Katharyne Mitchell observes, “anxiety about the loss of both economic and symbolic control over the defining and marking of place.” 109 Thus the images of these unsmiling faces blocking our view of the aestheticized landscape suggest that these faces are always in excess of nationalist constructions of landscape. By superimposing these faces onto Harris’s painting in a gridlike parody of Canada’s so-called multicultural “mosaic,” Yoon suggests that we can draw no unifying, ideological comfort from the retreat into landscape. FIGURE 2.11 Emily Carr, Old Time, Coast Village , 1929–1930. Oil on canvas, 91.3 × 128.7 cm. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Emily Carr Trust. Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. The left panel of Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven offers a related parody of the national landscape by emphasizing the romanticization of Indigenous themes. This panel draws on a painting titled Old Time, Coast Village (figure 2.11 ) by British Columbia painter Emily Carr—an iconic figure in her own right. Emily Carr’s association with the Group of Seven was established in 1927 when she was invited by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa to participate in an exhibition of West Coast painting. There she met Lawren Harris, whose praise for the Native themes in her art and subsequent years of encouragement became a key motivator for the artistic and literary projects she undertook, including her Governor General award-winning autobiography, Klee Wyck , recounting her experiences with Pacific Coast First Nations communities. The book’s title is based on the nickname given to her by the Tlingit Nation—an Indigenous people she strongly identified with—which translates to “the laughing one.” 110 In a revealing journal entry about the 1927 exhibition, Carr notes proudly, “I felt my work looked dead and dull, but they [Group of Seven] all say I have more of the spirit of the Indian than the others.” 111 Not only for Carr, who identified with the First Nations to the point that she imagined herself an Indian, the merit of her own work was judged on its capacity to reflect Native spirituality and cultural vision. Because she was a female artist and assumed to be lesbian, the First Nations themes Carr drew out in her work, which included reproducing their art forms in her own art practice, are often lauded as exemplary of her anticonformism, which challenged patriarchal and heteronormative gender scripts. Carr traveled alone to Native communities in British Columbia, such as the coastal Haida, Tsmishian, and Tlingit Nations, and began to feature their totem poles in her paintings. In her pursuit of a Native vision, Carr exemplified the role of the romantic hero—but as a woman. Her attraction to First Nations cultures was clearly based on romanticized notions of the “noble savage,” who she believed existed in a vanishing state of purity in nature. Art historian Dorothy Shadbolt attests to this belief, explaining that Carr “intuitively grasped the sense in which Indian art was an expression of the native’s relation to the natural and supernatural world as he understood it.” 112 In figure 2.9 we can observe the proximity Carr observed in the relation between First Nations and “real” nature. In particular, the light-colored totem poles at the center of the piece echo the brown trees in the background, suggesting the indistinguishable features of First Nations culture and nature. From an antinomical view of capitalist social relations, First Nations culture comes to express concrete nature, purity, and originality against the abstract, antinatural oppressions of capitalist modernity. But what complicates Carr’s romanticization of First Nations culture here is the overwhelming foliage that drapes the village in a heavy, molten green and serves as protective cover. The trees in the foreground appear human in form, leaning toward the village in cautious observance. Recalling Alexandra Minna Stern’s examination of the racial undertones of early twentieth-century conservationism and wilderness protection, Carr’s painting betrays not only an ideology of romantic anticapitalism at the core of the settler colonial retreat into nature, but also a suffocating management and control of First Nations cultures. Thus her desire to “go Native” was ultimately more revealing of a defensive investment in whiteness than a respect for Indigenous sovereignty and land claims. More extreme than the Group of Seven’s northern retreat from social and political upheavals of the 1920s that marked life in urban centers, Carr’s psychological withdrawal from urbanization manifested itself in illnesses, to the extent that it appeared she was allergic to the city—an ailment Reid refers to as the “‘city disease’ that was to attack [Carr] whenever she settled in a metropolis.” 113 Her loathing of the city, coupled with her idealization of and identification with First Nations culture and appropriation of their art, exemplifies Shari Huhndorf’s description of “going Native” as an appropriation of the identity, images, culture, or practices of Indigenous peoples. A settler colonial logic that finds equal expression in Canada as in the United States, she explains that going Native “reinforces the racial hierarchies it claims to destabilize”: 114 Over the last century, going native has become a cherished American tradition, an important—even necessary—means of defining European American identities and histories. In its various forms, going native articulates and attempts to resolve widespread ambivalence about modernity as well as anxieties about the terrible violence marking the nation’s origins. 115 From this perspective we can reread Carr’s gender transgressions as symptomatic of her own white colonial identity crisis, one she attempted to resolve by appropriating and identifying herself with a First Nations identity. While Carr may have viewed going Native as simultaneously anticapitalist in shunning modernity’s spoils and ruins alike, antiracial in her idealization of the coastal First Nations communities onto which she imposed herself, and gender-bending in her adoption of the persona of the lonely romantic genius, she actually reinforced rather than dismantled these structures. In particular, rather than challenging capitalism, Carr’s journey to remove herself from the toxic industrial and immigrant-filled environment of the city to find personal and artistic inspiration in Native cultures reinforces capitalism’s main values. As Huhndorf explains, “The fixation on self-discovery and self-healing articulate the very Western ideologies of bourgeois individualism.” 116 Because her oeuvre relied on the appropriation of First Nations art practice, her relationship with First Nations cultures was largely economic insofar as she profited immensely from appropriating their cultural practices. Finally, Carr’s idealization of the naturalness of the “noble savages” of the Pacific coast was contradicted by her antipathy toward the large urban population of Songhees who lived in her hometown of Victoria. As Janice Stewart explains, Carr’s view of the Songhees was in keeping with prevailing ideas at the time: they were seen as “‘lazy, gambling, drunks’ who were ‘a nuisance and trouble to the authorities’ as ‘individuals warranting charity.’” 117 The practice of either idealizing Native peoples as noble savages or denigrating them as inferior and requiring colonial management ultimately performs the same ideological work. On one hand, the romanticization of Native cultures functions to distance North Americans from their European settler roots, thereby displacing responsibility for the conquest and dispossession of the First Nations. 118 It also reinforces racial hierarchies when settlers identify and imagine themselves as “super-Indian” and therefore the rightful inheritors of the land and its resources. On the other, the denigration of Native communities naturalizes European dominance and its ideologies of western progress. It rationalizes the colonization of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of their resources through suggestions that Natives cannot “accept” modernity and civilization. Last but not least, while Carr’s adoption of the Tlingit name Klee Wyck can be read as a rejection of Victorian notions of womanhood and the rigid organization of her father’s house; as Stewart observes, “For most of her life, Carr turned to masculine authorities . . . for final judgment of her work rather than to her circle of reading ladies or other women artists.” 119 As an artist who rose to iconic fame in the 1930s, after the Group of Seven disbanded, by extending their project of defining a distinctively Canadian art, Carr’s persona reveals a problematic desire to escape from a social world marked by social upheavals, anti-immigrant sentiment, and industrialization, and a colonial desire to possess First Nations culture to promote the authenticity of her “Canadian” art. If spiritual replenishment for the nation did not spring from the “true North strong and free,” as the Group believed, then according to Carr, “our home and Native land” 120 became a national symbol of cultural purity and wholeness. Yoon’s engagement with Carr in the left panel must therefore be read as an engagement with Carr’s autochthonophilia and appropriation of First Nations cultural identity. The way Yoon’s work performs a disidentification of Carr’s painting is registered on multiple levels. If we focus on the way the Korean Canadian heads are turned away from the viewer, we can interpret this “faceless” gesture as a disidentification with the ethnographic gaze embedded in Carr’s painting, a gaze that appropriates the Native other for artistic legitimacy and produces art that becomes a romantic index to a defensive settler colonial identity. But at another level, they stage a disidentificatory encounter for the settler looking in. Given that these Korean heads block the view of the village, they foreclose a settler desire to identify with the Native landscape, whose commodification is reinforced through the repetition of Carr’s painting. A further irony embedded in this panel is that not only do Yoon’s Korean Canadian subjects block an identification with the landscape, but the blackness of the back-turned heads also allegorize the inability of settler culture to “identify” Asians as anything but abstractly homogeneous—as unidentifiable as the black hair in each frame. Adding, then, to the degenerative excess that Tseng’s body performs in the romanticized landscape, here Yoon suggests that Asian bodies are an alien antithesis of settler colonialism’s indigenizing desire. In short, by viewing capitalism as an antinomy of abstract and concrete dimensions, Asians are as unnatural to the landscape as Indigenous peoples are natural. This is the double edge of settler colonialism. Conclusion In Tseng’s and Yoon’s disidentification with iconic landscapes of North America, their photographs present, to quote Hutcheon again, “inscription[s] of the past in the present [that] embody and bring to life actual historical tensions” and prompt us to delve into the genealogy of landscape art of the early twentieth century. 121 Disidentifying with a shifting set of clichés and stereotypes associated with Asian North Americans and the landscape while preserving the aesthetic beauty of the latter tradition, their photographs use landscape “as raw material for representing a disempowered politics or positionality that has been rendered unthinkable by the dominant culture.” 122 Indeed, the alien presence of Asian bodies set against these landscapes foregrounds messy intersections of race science, white nativism, and settler nationalism projected onto the landscape. For Tseng, his parodic repetition of early twentieth-century landscape conventions associated with the Group of Seven’s, Adams’s, and Borglum’s landscapes brings forth the eugenic ideology that conveyed a white, masculine, and paternalistic identification with mountains and trees. Despite conservationists’ progressive environmental agenda, their efforts were often intertwined with a eugenic agenda that opposed the degeneration of the white race by alien races. Juxtaposed with Tseng’s alien excess, their projection of virility and obstinate resistance to change onto a mountainous and tree-filled landscape expresses the contradictory way that racist ideology formed a key subtext of so-called progressive, anticapitalist visions of national unity, conservation, and democracy. In a complementary manner, Yoon draws out the indigenizing dimension of romantic anticapitalism that collapse Native cultures into an unchanging natural purity and authenticity. She also builds on Tseng’s evocation of the degenerative excess signified by Asian bodies to exemplify the abstractness and unnaturalness of the Asian body against the landscape. From the period of railroad labor discussed in the last chapter to Asian immigrant exclusion in this chapter, the perverse abstraction associated with Chinese labor had by the 1920s and 1930s been supplanted by the settler retreat into the aestheticized landscape, whose unnatural antithesis is the Asian alien. Despite the romantic tribute to national culture embedded in landscape art of the early twentieth century, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographic countermemories suggest that such a “progressive” vision of national culture was “born in the apprehension of imminent loss,” as Lake and Reynolds indicate, and part of the anxious growth of “whiteness as a transnational mode of racial identification in settler societies.” 123 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, territorial symbols of regenerative whiteness expressed the proprietorial dimension of British settler colonialism and became, over time, synonymous with whiteness. As W. E. B. Du Bois observed succinctly on the whiteness of territorial expansion, “Whiteness is the ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen.” 124 Finally, in the spirit of Kingston’s and Fung’s reimagining of abstract labor as History 2, the potential of Tseng’s and Yoon’s parody is not in articulating a more ideal landscape of normative inclusion to symbolize the self-identity of the settler nation. Rather, by queering the aestheticized landscape, Tseng’s alien difference animates the contradictions, exclusions, and violent eliminations of settler colonialism that the landscape, as aesthetic object, fetishizes and naturalizes. Similarly, Yoon’s iteration of the interrupted landscape lays bare the fetishized commodity function of the landscape. It is from the ambivalence of the parodic gaps between Tseng’s and Yoon’s difference to the landscape that their photographs allegorize a state of nonequivalence. Nonequivalence, as Chandan Reddy explains, represents subjects “who are not ‘unified’ by a prior identity.” 125 Disidentifying with the white regenerative ideal projected onto the romantic landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs interrupt and denaturalize the mundane iteration of its symbolic violence. Following from the first chapter’s examination of the perverse temporality of abstract labor and this chapter’s focus on antinatural landscapes during a converging period of anti-Asian immigration restriction in North America, the next chapter moves forward to the internment of Japanese North Americans. If Asian North American cultural producers have thus far exposed and recircuited the abstract and unnatural signifiers attached to Asian bodies, what might a transnational approach to Japanese internment narratives expose as internment’s governing logics? Continuing my exploration of Asian racialization as a fetishistic alignment with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, I track the evolution of romantic anticapitalism and its antinomical view of concrete and abstract dimensions of capitalism. Probing Asian North American representations of labor and landscape in chapter 3 , I demonstrate how Joy Kogawa’s Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory reflect how the perverse abstraction of Asian labor takes on mechanical, nonhuman representation that must be eradicated from West Coast agriculture and fishing industries. However, through the process of labor resignification established through symbolic proximity with Indigeneity, Japanese North Americans emerge renaturalized and recorporealized as surplus labor.",

J. T. Mitchell, “Imperial Landscape” Undoing Landscape I begin this chapter with an unnatural scene: an old photograph of a tree surrounded by a crowd of onlookers (figure 2.1 ). It is nighttime. White men under gleaming hats stand with their hands in their pockets. On the left appear the blurred faces of a couple, walking arm in arm toward the camera. They are dressed as if they are on a date at the movies. Some of the bystanders look ahead, away from the camera, while others look back, impervious to the glare of the flash. There seems to be nothing aesthetically remarkable about the tree in the background except its sturdiness, emphasized by its proportional dominance, and its three solid branches jutting out like tines on a pitchfork. It turns out that the photograph is lying. What we do not see is that the occasion for the social gathering is the body of a lynched man who hangs from one of the tree’s branches. The photograph belongs to a series by artist Ken Gonzales-Day entitled Erased Lynching , in which he digitally removes the victim from the lynching scene. These are scenes that were captured and circulated on postcards in western states from 1850 to the 1930s, and most of the victims were not black. As Gonzales-Day explains, “Native Americans, Chinese, and Latinos of Mexican and Latin American descent were lynched in California . . . guided by anti-immigration sentiments, the fear of miscegenation, a deep frustration with the judicial system, or in combination with white supremacy.” 1 The vast majority of lynching victims he uncovered were of Latino descent. FIGURE 2.1 Ken Gonzales-Day, Erased Lynching , 2006. Courtesy of the artist. Gonzales-Day’s manipulation of lynching scenes is remarkable for the way it produces visibility out of erasure, inverting the power of the visual field. By shifting the spectacular nature of the lynched body onto the spectators, Erased Lynching moves the viewer’s attention to the visuality of lynching itself. Not only does it draw our attention to the expressions of the spectators, but we are also confronted by the cultural apparatus and circulation of lynching images, what Gonzales-Day refers to as the “aesthetics of the event, from the physical act to the creation of the lynching photograph and its progeny, the souvenir card, view card, and postcard.” 2 It also draws our attention back to the tree, whose former innocence is replaced by purposeful attributes of branch height and species—primarily native oak species 3 —that facilitated the mechanics of lynching. In addition, the large, life-size scale of Gonzales-Day’s photographic rendering serves to insert the contemporary viewer into the lynching scene, implicating us as consumers of the spectacle of racial violence and participants in their circulation. For the purposes of this chapter, Gonzales-Day’s photograph is significant not only for the way it counteracts the spectacle of the lynched racial body, but also for how it reverses the normative power we associate with landscape. The anchoring tree, as the primary subject of the viewing public, is stripped of the romanticism we attach to “scenery.” As a photograph rather than a painting, it communicates less the spiritual aesthetic of landscape than what Gonzales-Day describes as an artifact that “remains trapped somewhere between memento and evidence.” 4 In its inversion of the visual content of the image—rendering the white spectators, rather than the lynched body, as racial spectacle—Gonzales-Day exposes the power of perspective and subjective identification, elements that are intrinsic to the aesthetic technology of landscape. In manipulating viewers’ capacity to identify with the scene, Erased Lynching activates the notion of landscape as a medium rather than strictly a genre of art. This follows W. J. T. Mitchell’s insistence that we examine “not just what landscape ‘is’ or ‘means’ but what it does , how it works as a cultural practice.” 5 In this case, the landscape functions as both a witness and accomplice to racial violence. Following the last chapter’s focus on the racialization of Chinese workers as abstract labor, an economism that aligned Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism, this chapter probes how settler colonial constructions of the landscape express the other side of the antinomy: the concrete, thingly, natural dimension Postone describes as that which “appears as the variegated surface of immediate sensuous experience.” 6 While Asian labor personifies the abstract circuits of capitalism, settler colonial constructions of landscape express the opposite: the concrete, pure, and authentic noncapitalist dimension of nature. That the social world appears antinomical—that is, characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions—is a function of the fetish, which conceals the social relations behind products of human labor, repressing the duality of commodity-determined labor. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminated in the last chapter, Chinese labor was associated with a perverse temporality, one that rendered Chinese bodies fungible (like currency) and a signifier of moral corruption. As such, Chinese bodies occupied the abstract dimension of the antinomy, as subjects “abstracted from all particularity” 7 insofar as Chinese bodies are interchangeable with other Chinese bodies. White labor, on the other hand, was individual, tangible, concrete, and of social value. Postone describes this structure of social relations as a “quasi-natural opposition” of two objective worlds: “The relation of these two worlds of objectivity can then be construed as that of essence and appearance, or as that of an opposition (as has been expressed historically, for example, in the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought).” 8 Postone’s emphasis on the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought is particularly germane for our consideration of landscape, which is associated with both western romanticism and an imperialist aesthetic. As Mitchell observes, the Chinese antecedents of western landscape “flourished most notably at the height of Chinese imperial power and began to decline in the eighteenth century as China itself became an object of English fascination and appropriation at the moment England was beginning to experience itself as an imperial power.” 9 From this view, landscape can be seen to function as a fetish itself, “symptom[atic] of the rise and development of capitalism; the ‘harmony’ sought in landscape [can be] read as a compensation for and screening off of the actual violence perpetrated there.” 10 It is precisely because landscape appears real, natural, and thingly, rather than a way of seeing and a culturally mediated representation of nature, that it seems antithetical to the very circuits of capitalism and imperialism that Mitchell identifies with it. Here, as Postone clarifies, “the opposition of its abstract and concrete dimensions allows capitalism to be perceived and understood in terms of its abstract dimension alone; its concrete dimension can thereby be apprehended as noncapitalist.” 11 In other words, capitalism is understood in terms of its abstract dimension, noncapitalism (and anticapitalism) with its concrete dimension. Thus, building on the last chapter’s examination of settler exclusion of abstract alien labor because of its “perverse” alignment with capital, this chapter examines the settler identification with the western landscape and idealization of Native peoples as a further expression of the romantic anticapitalism of anti-Asian sentiment and the indigenizing project of settler colonialism. We will see how settler colonialism constructs a landscape that is simultaneously a site of Native erasure and a site of indigenizing purity and authenticity. In order to excavate the racial logics of landscape in a manner that foregrounds, as Gonzales-Day’s photograph does, the interplay of racial violence, settler identification, and landscape, I look to the landscape photography of Vancouver-based artist Jin-me Yoon and the late New York–based photographer Tseng Kwong Chi. As photographic countermemory, their re-envisioning of western landscapes in Canada and the United States identifies romantic anticapitalism as a key ideology of settler colonialism. Their respective photographs of Mount Rushmore, the Canadian Rockies, and the Pacific coast parody the conventions of landscape art of the 1920s and 1930s that were established by artists such as Ansel Adams, Gutzon Borglum, the Canadian Group of Seven, and Emily Carr. In doing so, Tseng and Yoon expose how romantic anticapitalism flourished during the height of anti-Asian immigration restriction to project a settler identification with a personified, Indigenous landscape. The way early twentieth-century artists anchored white settler identity in the landscape reflects contradictory identifications with the “Native” that effectively erased the history of conquest and dispossession while expressing nostalgia for a time before capitalist modernity. This romantic idealization of nature and the “noble savage” captures the settler valorization of the concrete realm of social relations under capitalism, particularly under conditions of rapid industrialization and economic flux leading up to and following the stock market crash of 1929. Within the romantic anticapitalist logics of settler colonialism, the valorization of the concrete over the abstract realms misconstrues the appearance of capitalist relations for their reality. As Neil Levi puts it, “Romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations.” 12 In this chapter I look at the way works by Tseng and Yoon emphasize how the eugenicism embedded in an expanding conception of whiteness increasingly appropriates Indigeneity as a mode of biologizing the landscape. I situate Tseng’s and Yoon’s parodic strategies of countermemory within the theoretical framework of disidentification articulated by José Esteban Muñoz. For Muñoz, disidentification works alternatively as an artistic process, a mode of performance, and a critical hermeneutic. It is a mode of “shuffling back and forth between reception and production.” 13 By highlighting disidentification as a frame for Tseng’s and Yoon’s artistic process and performance, I read their engagement with landscape neither as assimilative identification nor as a wholesale rejection of it. Neither is it, as Muñoz clarifies, an “apolitical middle ground.” 14 Rather, disidentification operates as a third mode of dealing with dominant ideology that emerges from the recognition that the subject is constituted inside ideology—that there is no privileged position outside ideology from which the subject can oppose its own formation—and that resistance can occur through “negotiations between desire, identification, and ideology.” 15 Disidentification, therefore, is about “recycling or reforming an object that has already been invested with powerful energy.” 16 Tseng’s and Yoon’s projections of their alien excess against a landscape of normative racial, cultural, and aesthetic values captures the political potential that Judith Butler further ascribes to the disidentificatory encounter, “this uneasy sense of standing under a sign to which one does and does not belong.” 17 By analyzing their engagement with the cultural values it activates, I propose that Tseng’s Expeditionary Series and Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven enact modes of parody that both recycle the dominant codes associated with the landscape and transform them with their racial excess. Their encounters perform a repetition with a racial difference. As British settler nations whose colonial objective was primarily land appropriation rather than the exploitation of Indigenous labor, 18 national identity in Canada and the United States has often been defined as a product of the landscape. As Angela Miller explains of the US context, the nineteenth-century landscape encapsulated “the nationalist myth—that the physical environment itself produced national character.” 19 Similarly, in the early twentieth century in Canada, as Erin Manning suggests, the “quest for national identity [was sought] through the image of the landscape . . . where the unity of states and citizens [was] constructed on the putative ethnic or racial identity of a nation, which, in turn, is anchored to the representation of landscape.” 20 As a vital source for the expression of national identity in both nations, the continuing appeal of landscape art into the early twentieth century was often coupled with disdain for the rise of modernism. In a revealing glimpse of such antimodernist sentiment, when the Group of Seven traveled to New York State in 1913, it was not to attend the influential exhibition of international modern art at the Armory Show but to attend an exhibition of traditional Scandinavian art. 21 Within the diverse media that form the landscapes by Adams, Borglum, the Group of Seven, and Carr, none ironize or subvert—as modernist art often does—nationalist subject matter or the hierarchy of high and popular cultural forms. Instead, their works contain a romantic reverence for and spiritual identification to land as a symbolic anchor for their aestheticized “defense” of national identity. Uncovering the eugenic and Indigenizing subtexts of romantic anticapitalism that are embedded in the settler landscape, I turn first to Tseng’s Expeditionary Series to explore its citations to US photographer Ansel Adams, the Group of Seven, and Mount Rushmore sculptor and architect Gutzon Borglum. I demonstrate how his photographs prompt a recognition of landscape as both a biopolitical expression of white supremacy and a personification of white male dominion. Such a personification of the land is precisely a form of what Postone refers to as the biologization of the concrete that constitutes “expressions of that antinomic fetish, which gives rise to the notion that the concrete is ‘natural,’ and which increasingly presents the socially ‘natural’ in such a way that it is perceived in biological terms.” 22 The final section of this chapter turns to Yoon’s photographic collage Group of Sixty-Seven , whose title makes reference both to the Group of Seven painters and to 1967, the year Canada removed racial barriers to immigration. This legislation was the Canadian corollary to the Hart-Celler Immigration Reform Act of 1965 in the United States, which similarly removed race-based immigration criteria. Building on Tseng’s parody of the eugenic whiteness of the landscape, Yoon’s project highlights the fusion of the Group of Seven’s eugenic ideology with Emily Carr’s own autochthonophilia and her intense desire to “go native.” 23 Thus, Group of Sixty-Seven exposes the eugenic ideology at the core of romantic anticapitalism and the contradictory logics of exclusion and elimination that condition the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions within settler colonialism in North America. Eugenic Landscapes In 1978 the artist Tseng Kwong Chi transformed himself from an invisible minority to a visible alien. His metamorphosis came about after an experience he had on a family lunch outing at a high-end New York restaurant. Respecting the restaurant’s dress code, Tseng arrived wearing the only suit he owned: a Chinese uniform he had purchased at a Montreal thrift store. To his amusement he was greeted by the restaurant’s staff and patrons as a Chinese Communist dignitary, much to the displeasure of his parents, who years earlier had escaped from Communist China. His sister, Muna Tseng, recalls the royal treatment her brother received at the restaurant, recounting, “When we arrived . . . the maître d’ took one look at [Tseng] and treated him like a V.I.P., a gentleman from the East, an emissary from Cathay. My parents were not amused.” 24 The attention he attracted at the restaurant nevertheless produced an artistic breakthrough that led Tseng to undergo a process of orientalization, beginning with his name, which went from Joseph Tseng to Tseng Kwong Chi. Completing his wardrobe with mirrored glasses and a clip-on “Slut for Art” ID badge, Tseng reinvented himself in the stereotypical role of the inscrutable and perpetually foreign Asian. It was an identity that his friend the choreographer Bill T. Jones described as “Chinese drag.” 25 Henceforth, in Chinese drag, he took to the streets of New York, gaining unparalleled access to exclusive social events, most famously in 1980 when he crashed the opening night of the Ch’ing dynasty costume exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum. There he mingled with the rich and famous, including Henry Kissinger, William F. Buckley Jr., and Yves Saint Laurent, who, as the art critic Grady Turner relates, “commended Tseng for his fluency in French and asked if he had served in the Chinese embassy in Paris.” 26 What Tseng realized during these experiences was the vastness of Westerners’ ignorance of Asians. Therefore, drawing on a persona that simultaneously evoked foreigner, visitor, tourist, alien, and imposter, he exploited that ignorance in his photographs, which offered surprising reconfigurations of clichéd tourist scenes in North America and around the world.

The Expeditionary Self-Portrait Series 1979–1989 . © Muna Tseng Dance Projects, Inc., New York. www.tsengkwongchi.com . In the diverse fields in which Tseng’s photographs have been analyzed, from performance studies to Asian American studies, the majority of critical attention has focused on the photographs from the earlier period of his East Meets West series, for their clever juxtaposition of caricatured foreignness and touristy familiarity of Western monuments and icons, such as the Statue of Liberty, Disneyland, and the Hollywood sign. Reflecting the historical moment, the series title aptly parodied the anticommunist sentiment being reignited in 1979, on the eve of the Reagan Revolution. What many critics found remarkable about his photographs, as Margo Machida explains, is that they “counter[ed] a long history of Orientalist painting and photography by explicitly re-representing the West as if seen through a possessive ‘Occidentalist’ gaze.” 27 In contrast to this reception, however, Tseng’s later photographs featured in the same series, renamed Expeditionary Series , have garnered less attention, perhaps because they appear attenuated from the overt culture clash staged in his earlier work. For instance, Tseng’s photographs of majestic US and Canadian landscapes, such as the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and the Rocky Mountains, have been described as offering more solitary explorations of the individual’s relation to nature, which his sister describes as “recalling Chinese landscape paintings of man balanced between sky and earth.” 28 Turner further marks the shift toward natural landscapes in Tseng’s series as evidence of a romantic turn in his oeuvre: [He] put aside the confrontational implications of the earlier title to concentrate on [his] own transformation from alien tourist to American explorer. . . . The Mao suit has become irrelevant. . . . He offers us brief glimpses of a Romantic figure, an artist who has put aside his disguise to revel in the sheer power of nature. 29 This chapter reconsiders this assessment by asking whether the concerns of the latter phase of his series are absent of “confrontational implications.” Rather than a romantic homage to nature’s sublimity, I interpret Tseng’s Expeditionary Series as a queer parody of the Western conventions associated with Canadian and American landscape art of the early twentieth century. Given that landscape art of this period was broadly concerned with honoring nature’s vitality and universalizing power, the intrusion of Tseng’s alien body is a sign not of life-affirming incorporation but of extravagant degeneration. Reading the managed interplay of life, degeneration, and death as a central feature of settler colonialism and projected onto nature, I argue that Tseng’s photographs animate the biopolitics of the settler landscape in Canada and the United States. In consideration of the vexed modalities of racial impersonation that Tseng’s work elicits in Chinese drag, Butler’s discussion of gender and drag performance is useful for highlighting the ambivalent agency of parodic recycling that surrounds his work. When Butler evaluates the subversive potential of drag to expose gender constructions through imitation, she locates gender transgression less in the volitional agency of the drag queen than with the drag performance itself: “[Drag] serves a subversive function to the extent that it reflects the mundane impersonations by which heterosexual ideal genders are performed and naturalized and undermines their power by effecting that exposure.” 30 In other words, drag allegorizes the imitative structure of gender, as a recycled copy that has no original. Butler’s theorization of gender and drag presents an opening for considering race through the terms of drag performance, without collapsing the distinctions between the processes of gendering and racialization—or disregarding their intersection. 31 In particular, both racialization and gendering are processes that are historically constituted through a racist and heterosexist system that reproduces itself through its iteration in bodies, institutions, and law. It is a system that both “precedes and exceeds” the intentions of the racialized and gendered subject. 32 In the case of Tseng’s photographs, although he taps into the symbolic construction of the Asian alien through his performance, Tseng does not invent or choose the terms of his own racialization. Thus, by engaging a disidentificatory hermeneutic, my reading of Tseng’s photographs harnesses the ambivalence of queer of color parody as an opportunity to further demystify and denaturalize what Muñoz calls the “universalizing ruse of dominant culture.” 33 At one level, this mode of reading registers Tseng’s deliberate efforts to choreograph the visual dissonance in the juxtaposition of two figurative constructions: the Chinese as alien and the settler nation as landscape. At another, my analysis also mines the unintentional gaps between parodic repetition and difference that magnify how, as a queer man of color in racial drag, he epitomizes what Chandan Reddy refers to as a “material nonequivalence” to the settler landscape as an alien abstraction against a concrete expression of nature. 34 It is in this spirit of disidentification that I draw on the way Tseng’s photographs evoke the conventions of landscape art produced in the 1920s by the Canadian Group of Seven painters, the American sculptor Gutzon Borglum, and the American photographer Ansel Adams. Comprising a significant portion of the 150 black-and-white photographs Tseng took from 1979 to 1989, the Expeditionary Series captures the variation and range of landscapes he photographed in North America and around the world. A Hong Kong–born Canadian immigrant who attended art school in Paris and lived his adult years in New York among a vibrant set of artists until his death from AIDS in 1990, 35 Tseng’s perception of the landscape in North America and elsewhere was undoubtedly informed by his transnational movements. Excavating the historical context surrounding his photographic references to North American landscapes of the 1920s, a generative period of landscape art in Canada and the United States, I focus on Tseng’s Seven Peaks Snowfield and Lake Moraine , both located in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, and Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. As “natural wonders” of the West, Banff National Park and Mount Rushmore are two sites firmly positioned in settler colonial mythologies of the North American landscape. Banff owes much of this popular mythology to the Group of Seven landscape painters who made Canada’s Western landscape a central subject of many of their paintings. In the United States this mythology is indebted to Gutzon Borglum, the architect behind the colossal sculpture of the four presidents’ faces at Mount Rushmore. With respect to the highly aestheticized quality of Tseng’s dramatic black-and-white photographs, they also recall the visually operatic Yosemite photographs of Ansel Adams. However, unlike Adams, Tseng disrupts the sublime tranquility of the natural landscape by inserting his caricatured body into the frame. Tseng engages with the mythic landscape as an artistic subject that was foundational for the legacy of the Group of Seven and Adams, as well as in terms of the way space and scale are crucial components of the visual impact of Mount Rushmore. Confronting the tangled strands of national history, artistic convention, and regenerative racial power that are projected onto these diverse landscapes, Tseng’s photographs capture what Mitchell calls the “dreamwork” of settler colonialism. 36 By putting his alien excess into racial tension with the landscape, Tseng’s parody of early twentieth-century landscape art brings to light a romantic idealization of nature that, in the context of North America, is infused with eugenic ideologies of white racial regeneration. Evolving out of social Darwinist theory, eugenics emerged in the late nineteenth century and grew in the early decades of the twentieth century with the support of both conservatives and progressives. As Daniel Kevles explains, “The progressives and the conservatives found common ground in attributing phenomena such as crime, slums, prostitution, and alcoholism primarily to biology and in believing that biology might be used to eliminate these discordances of modern, urban, industrial society.” 37 According to Kevles, racial thinking “played a major part in American and Canadian versions of this [eugenic] creed,” 38 based on fears raised from the influx of non–Anglo Saxon immigrants and the social degeneracy those groups were associated with. The 1920s and early 1930s represented the apex in the eugenics movement, with the passage of numerous eugenics sterilization laws—particularly in California, British Columbia, and Alberta—which inordinately targeted racial minorities and immigrants. 39 While the scientific justification for eugenics had waned slightly after World War I, eugenics nevertheless persisted in institutionalized forms. Knowledge of eugenics’ false claims did not, as Mary Coutts and Pat McCarrick explain, “decrease the pressure for legislation, judicial action, or immigration controls.” 40 Indeed, immigration restrictions directed at Chinese migrants to the United States and Canada coincided with the intensification of eugenic ideology from the nineteenth century into the twentieth. After passage of the 1875 Page Act, which effectively restricted the entry of Chinese women for their presumed sexual immorality, the United States passed its first race-based federal immigration restriction through the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was in effect from 1882 to 1943. In 1885 the Canadian government passed its own race-based immigration restriction through the Chinese Head Tax, a tax designed to deter Chinese migrants from entering Canada. By the mid-1920s, both Canada and the United States had intensified and expanded earlier restrictions on Chinese migrants. In Canada these measures extended restrictions to other Asian migrants and further deterred Chinese immigration through the passage of the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which excluded most classes of Chinese migrants until 1947. The United States, having also broadened restrictions to encompass other Asian migrants, passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which intensified previous race-based restrictions through its exclusion of most Asian ethnic groups and foreigners who were deemed “biologically inferior.” 41 The persistence and growth of anti-Asian policy from the 1880s to the 1940s reflects what Erika Lee refers to as the “hemispheric Orientalism” that took hold along the West Coast of North America. 42 Despite their nationalist pretensions, Canada and the United States were bound by a shared commitment to preserving the transnational power and normativity of whiteness. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds put it, the “project of whiteness was a paradoxical politics, at once transnational in its inspiration and identifications but nationalist in its method and goals.” 43 Fears over the degeneration of Anglo-Saxon stock were present in the art world as well. The Canadian Group of Seven painters reflected these anxieties over the diminishing strength of the white Nordic race in their painting, believing that the Canadian landscape held “replenishing power” that could disinfect what one member called a “low receptive reservoir into which pours the chaos of ages, the mixed concord and discord of many varied peoples.” 44 Employing tropes associated with hygiene and mental health, they put forward a mission to “clean this reservoir . . . or we will remain a confused people.” 45 In the US context, Deborah Bright draws out the anticapitalist basis of Ansel Adams’s romanticism, noting that his early twentieth-century photographs represented a “mixture of Progressive Era phobias about industrialization and encroaching alien populations with an equally conservative nostalgia for the myth of preindustrial organic society.” 46 Fears of white race suicide also informed Gutzon Borglum’s vision of Mount Rushmore, a colossal-scale sculptural project that he began in 1924 and did not live to see completed seventeen years later. Expressing his fears of miscegenation, he once wrote, “Here we have in the filtering of Asiatic and North African blood [into Europe] the complete vitiating of the vigor and intellect of the civilization existing in these once pure European peoples.” 47 Thus romantic, regenerative, and preservationist motifs were infused in North American landscape art of the period and reflected deep anxieties over the racial “health” of the industrializing settler nation. And despite the absence of human or nonwhite representation in many of these works, my analysis of these landscapes heeds Martin Berger’s assessment that in North American art since the nineteenth century, “a decidedly racialized perspective animated even those cultural products most removed from racial concerns.” 48 The hyperbolic orientalism of Tseng’s persona in the Expeditionary Series confronts these defensive logics embedded in the romanticized colonial landscape in ways that denaturalize the abstract, universalizing, and absorptive power of its conventions. As such, Tseng’s photographs tap into the historicism of parody, which Linda Hutcheon defines as “an inscription of the past in the present [that] embod[ies] and bring[s] to life actual historical tensions.” 49 In Chinese drag, Tseng’s exaggerated performance “mimes and renders hyperbolic” a host of normative race, gendered, and sexual conventions that are literally and figuratively naturalized in the landscape. 50 As the alien, the dissonance between his body and the landscape delineates the racialized abstraction of Asians and their symbolic excess to national culture. The Chinese male body in North America was historically constituted as nonreproductive, perverse, and feminized, which was reinforced through legal and extralegal restrictions on interracial intimacies, restrictions on the immigration of Chinese women, and aggressive enclosure in the domestic labor market. Thus the alien sexuality Tseng elicits can also be seen as the product of a biopolitical landscape whose regenerative energy is directed at the degeneration and exclusion of alien bodies. Moreover, as a queer artist who referred to himself as a “snow queen” because of his preference for white men, 51 Tseng’s queer white desire—a desire for incorporation into a white landscape of artists and gay culture—creates a productive tension with the gender and sexual objectification of the Asian body. The conflicted relations and identifications that Tseng’s photography stages capture a mode of disidentification that negotiates “between desire, identification, and ideology.” 52 Disrupting an exceptionalist imagining of Canada or the United States as a concrete, pristine wilderness, Tseng’s photographs reframe the settler colonial landscape as a racial borderland of symbolic violence. With the exception of a handful of photographs taken in British Columbia, the main focus of Tseng’s Canadian landscapes is the Rocky Mountains of Banff National Park in Alberta. Established in 1885 as Canada’s first national park and modeled after Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Banff National Park is one of the most iconic wilderness symbols of Canadian national identity. In Rob Shields’s analysis of Banff’s nationalist symbolism, he suggests that “Banff can serve as a metaphor for the Canadian condition: the peremptory Canadian self of the present clings to an image of a European past (or an ideal future) and refuses to confront the violence and paradox of its own making.” 53 In short, Banff reflects the worldview of European settlers who modeled the area after nineteenth-century European spas and tourist retreats. The city itself is named for a country seat on the northeast coast of Scotland between Aberdeen and Inverness, a name indicative of the vast colonial respatialization of Native territory. Resignified and repackaged in an endless series of tourist photographs and postcards, Banff conveys the purity of nature that contrasts with the impurities associated with the urban environment. What is evacuated from Banff’s symbolic repository is the displacement of First Nations peoples as the region’s original inhabitants. Native voices have largely been silenced, while their identities have been appropriated as tourist commodities that serve to authenticate the “naturalness” of the environment. The birth of Canada’s first national park in 1885 also coincides with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the transcontinental railroad responsible for the park’s creation. 54 As discussed in the last chapter, construction of the railroad employed thousands of Chinese railroad workers recruited from the United States, who tunneled through the most treacherous sections of British Columbia’s Fraser Canyon. Only after the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed did a Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration persuade the Canadian government to take measures to restrict the entry of Chinese migrants. As noted earlier, the government responded by enacting its first race-based immigration restriction, the Chinese Head Tax, which required that Chinese migrants pay $50 to disembark in Canada. By 1903 this sum had climbed to $500. Hence the very conditions of possibility for Banff’s pristine environment depended on appropriating and eliminating Indigenous peoples and exploiting and excluding aliens. Here, as in other settler states, elimination and exclusion are two ways that settler colonialism cuts both ways. 55 Despite the fact that Banff National Park is located in the valley of the Bow River in the southern part of Alberta, Banff’s snowy alpine landscape nevertheless evokes Canada’s nationalist identification with the North. Shelagh Grant explains that conceptualizations of the Canadian North have been informed by both British and American romantic idealizations of nature in the nineteenth century: “British aesthetic myth blended with American wilderness myth to reinforce a Romantic image of north.” 56 An integral feature of Canada’s national identity—showcased no less in the first verse of the national anthem, “O Canada, our true North strong and free”—the North is nonetheless a moving construction that is articulated through representations ranging from the Canadian arctic to Banff’s alpine elevation. The unfixed character of the North is what Sherrill E. Grace calls “magnetic north,” a “north whose parameters seem always to be shifting.” 57 The development of Canada’s northern identity is often attributed to the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven artists. An artist collective that rose to national fame in the 1920s and was credited with producing the first “national” art, their landscapes set out to reflect what they saw as an authentic Canadian spirit that was not derivative of European or American art traditions. Manning explains that “while the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven do not create the type of nationalism that is based on an ideology of the land, they do play a role in supporting the myth of the ‘great white north.’” 58 Drawing on tropes of purity, rugged masculine strength, and individualism, Group of Seven founder and spokesperson Lawren Harris saw the North as a spiritual realm untouched by history, humanity, or capitalist modernity. Harris writes in “The Story of the Group of Seven” that “what I was groping toward [was] Canada painted in her own spirit,” 59 and he elaborates the connections between race, nation, and northernness in his essay “Revelation of Art in Canada”: We are in the fringe of the great North and its living whiteness, its loneliness and replenishment, its resignations and release, its call and answer—its cleansing rhythms. It seems that the top of the continent is the spiritual flow that will ever shed clarity into the growing race of America, and we Canadians being closest to this source seem destined to produce an art somewhat different from our Southern fellows—an art more spacious, of a greater living quiet, perhaps of a more certain conviction of eternal values. 60 Harris’s conceptualization of a North equipped with the spiritual powers that could “cleanse” the nation through an interplay of “living whiteness” and “loneliness and replenishment” is indicative of his racial anxieties of immigrants who contributed to “the growing race of America.” Moreover, crafting an exceptionalist narrative around Canada as the most northerly nation in the Americas, Harris attributes to Canada a primary role as spiritual compass and regenerative source for the continent. Tseng’s Rocky Mountain landscapes contain sly allusions to a romantic conceptualization of wilderness as a purifying and regenerative national symbol that the Group of Seven idealized. For instance, Tseng’s Seven Peaks, Alberta, Canada, 1986 (figure 2.2 ) references the phallic majesty of mountains, trees, and icebergs that dominate the Group’s paintings. 61 Commenting on the Group’s authority over the Canadian landscape, Manning remarks that “for many years the quintessential Canadian landscape painting was an image of an unpopulated wilderness, with Tom Thomson’s ancient pine tree or Lawren Harris’s icebergs at the forefront.” 62 The Group’s tendency to position these natural subjects—mountains, trees, and icebergs—as visual anchors in their paintings has been well documented as reflecting heavily gendered ideas of nature. Towering mountains and trees were associated with a heroic masculinity that exercised their superiority over the changing, ephemeral, and feminized qualities of water and wind. A case in point is Harris’s renowned painting Mt. Lefroy , which depicts a large snowcapped mountain that evokes qualities of nobility, imperviousness to change, and purity and expresses, Berger states, “a distinctly masculine aesthetic.” 63 In particular, Mt. Lefroy ’s peak seems to almost puncture the overhead clouds, while light ripples away from the site of entry—as if to illuminate the nobility of the peak’s act of penetration. The connotations of forced sexual penetration and feminized submission are intentional, Joan Murray explains, given that Harris “believed in expressing sexuality in symbolic terms, and in his Lake Superior and Rockies subjects, the use of such semi-symbolic sexual imagery (penal [sic ] mountains and vaginal clouds) [is] overt.” 64 In Mt. Lefroy , masculine virility constitutes the power of the mountain and its domination of the feminine ephemera that lie below and hover overhead. These anthropomorphic motifs are consistent with the Group of Seven’s broader symbolic language, in which mountains and trees represent white, heterosexual, and paternal resistance to what Robert Linsley calls “inundation from below, and submission to the powers above . . . like a spike that is meant to pin together a stable identity out of spiritual, social, and sexual experiences that are all by nature transitory.” 65 The sturdy tree or towering mountain therefore celebrates a virile masculine individualism that is in constant tension with threatening lower elements that allegorized the Group’s fears, widespread in the 1920s and 1930s, about racial and ethnic mixing and the corresponding degeneration of a white, Nordic race. 66 Some of the racial implications of the Group’s landscapes come into further relief in the way Tseng’s photographs echo Adams’s environmentalist photography. Originating in the late nineteenth century, the American environmentalist movement regained momentum after World War I and bore the imprint of escalating eugenicist thought. In particular, eugenic ideology fused wilderness protection with white racial preservation through analogies that linked the degradation of the natural environment with the degeneration of the white race through miscegenation and rising nonwhite populations. Alexandra Minna Stern explains that during the 1920s, efforts to save redwood trees in California served as a “metaphor for defending race purity and ensuring the survival of white America.” 67 Inspired by Sierra Club founder John Muir, Bright explains, Adams “se[t] out to produce a photographic version of the nature publicist’s writings” and played an immense role in constructing an environmentally focused vision of the American landscape. 68 Despite the progressive agenda attributed to Adams’s landscapes, Bright points out that “the rugged western wilderness [was] a locus for the sentiments of white, middle-class Americans around nationalistic and ethnocentric ideals [that] cannot be overlooked in any discussion of the development of environmentally concerned photography.” 69 As such, the grandeur of Adams’s landscapes, analogous to the Group of Seven’s, could provide spiritual reassurance of the durability of the white race, its ability to persevere in the face of lower castes. Stern explains that eugenicists “profoundly shaped California’s landscapes” and subscribed to the belief—reflected in Adams’ and the Group of Seven’s regenerative narratives about nature—that “exposure to nature” was a “method of containing the worst and actualizing the best of human’s evolutionary and hereditary predispositions.” 70 Exemplified in Monolith (figure 2.3 ), the mountains and trees featured in Adams’s photography stood for what many conservationists viewed as the “stateliness, grandeur, and perseverance—represent[ing] the ‘great race.’” 71 Discussing the way conservationists collapsed distinctions between the redwood and white America, Stern writes: “Like Anglo-Saxon America, which was being engulfed by hordes of defectives and mongrels and menaced by the excessive breeding of undesirables, the redwood was imperiled by ‘race suicide’ from rampant logging, urban encroachment, and human ignorance.” 72 While mobilizing against the expropriation and destruction of natural resources was certainly a worthwhile cause, romantic anticapitalism framed the struggle in racial terms. For both the Group of Seven and Adams, racial ideologies could be invisibly projected onto the impermeable mountains in Banff and at Yosemite. As a cultural practice, then, the landscape aestheticized defensive racial ideologies of white supremacy. Tseng’s Seven Peaks also plays with what Linsley describes as the “great freeze out of Canadian painting” in the 1920s, 73 referring to the Group of Seven’s emphasis on snow and ice, and exhibits an attention to lighting that recalls Adams’s compositional details. However, the inclusion of Tseng’s body displaces the anchoring image of Harris’s and Adams’s trees and mountains. If these anchoring images symbolically project the white masculine mastery over inferior forces, Tseng’s body fails to convey a sense of stability, permanence, or purity associated with the landscape. Unlike the imposing and phallic tree or mountain peak, Tseng neither dominates the surrounding landscape nor stands, to quote Linsley’s assessment of Harris’s natural imagery, as “a spike meant to pin together a stable identity.” 74 Contrasting the whiteness of his snow-filled environment, Tseng’s body highlights his dissonance with the landscape. His isolation does not suggest a rugged individualism in symbolic struggle with the surrounding elements; rather, it evokes the incongruity of his alien body against the overwhelming whiteness of the natural background. As an evolving sign of yellow peril, moreover, Tseng’s body exposes the eugenic logics of purity present in the early twentieth-century landscapes he references. As an index of the abstract, degenerative value of nonreproductive, alien sexualities, he highlights the eugenic spirit of white racial reproduction and regeneration projected onto the landscape. Finally, dwarfed by the massive mountain peaks in the background, Tseng animates the desire for what Albert Boime calls a commanding “magisterial gaze” over the landscape, “the perspective of the [North] American on the heights searching for new worlds to conquer.” 75 Although the tradition of North American landscape art promotes what Berger identifies as a “natural affirmation of white culture” through a decidedly white male gaze, 76 Tseng’s gaze is largely unreadable behind his mirrored glasses. The direction of his gaze only points back to the camera and ultimately to the viewer. In this reversal, Tseng’s photographs highlight the racial limits of the landscape’s regenerative symbolism in its reflection of white settler identification with an uncorrupted nature that exists outside the circuits of capitalism. FIGURE 2.3 Monolith , 1927. Photograph by Ansel Adams. © 2014 The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. Tseng’s photograph of Moraine Lake (figure 2.4 ) also makes references to the intersecting discourses of northernness and tourism that produce Alberta’s national parks. His deliberate or unintentional misidentification of Lake Moraine’s location in the Northwest Territories—way, way up north—humorously underscores the north ness of its more southern location in Banff National Park. Commodified by Rocky Mountain tourists who frequent the lake and rent canoes, the most literal commodification of the lake occurred when the Bank of Canada issued twenty-dollar bills featuring the lake on the reverse side of the 1969 and 1978 bills (figure 2.5 ). The scene on the bill that Tseng perfectly captures is known as the “Twenty-Dollar View.” Tseng’s recreation scene flaunts the irony at the core of the Group of Seven’s conceptualization of nature. His photograph demonstrates that, far from a space untouched by modernity where a pure white wilderness exists as a refuge from corrupting human influences, Moraine Lake represents instead the capitalist conversion of Indigenous territory into tourist sites. The high aestheticism of the mundane tourist snapshot also amplifies what Jody Berland refers to as a form of “staged authenticity,” a concept derived from Dean MacCannell’s work on the western tourist to “describe the ways in which diverse regional cultures produce themselves as touristic objects.” 77 Berland goes on to explain that “because tourists seek new experience through interaction with the other . . . they place themselves in contact with personalities and spaces that seem to represent the inside of another culture but which in fact are carefully staged to represent that inside to outsiders.” 78 Tseng adds another parodic layer to the notion of staged authenticity insofar as his photograph confuses the relation between tourist and other. He is both tourist and other. Playing with the various codes of “authenticity” that produce the tourist site, the tourist, and the alien other, he reduces the scene’s commodified grandeur to a stage that dramatizes the fetishization of the imagined colonial encounter.

On a more humorous note, Tseng’s pose, with oar raised in midstroke, also evokes the figure of the wilderness sportsman. The sportsman movement began in Canada in the late nineteenth century and promoted an ideology of the wilderness that, analogous to the burgeoning conservation movement, represented a domain of white masculine regeneration. As Lynda Jessup explains, nineteenth-century landscape paintings that depicted sportsmen coincided with the rise of sportsman clubs that aimed to “revitaliz[e] manhood” against what they perceived were the “degenerative, emasculating, effects of capitalist modernity.” 79 The sportsman was thus the antithesis of the Chinese “bachelor” of the exclusion period, who exemplified respective racial and sexual threats to white labor and white female bourgeois respectability. Pictured as an unlikely sportsman, Tseng further underscores his exclusion from the regenerative scripts associated with this wilderness genre of masculinity. In stark contrast to the leisure associated with the sportsman’s wilderness enterprise, labor defined the lives of early twentieth-century Chinese male immigrants. As discussed in the first chapter, the colonial management of Asian reproduction was largely accomplished through immigration restriction, antimiscegenation law, and segregation practices that produced “bachelor societies” in Canada and the United States. The constraints on Chinese masculinity amounted to what David Eng calls “racial castration,” the “psychic and the material limits circumscribing Asian American male subjectivity.” 80 However, in Tseng’s adaptation of the iconic nationalist scene, his parody highlights foremost the commodification of nature while prompting recognition of the white racial investment in regenerative narratives embedded in its mythology. FIGURE 2.5 Twenty-dollar Canadian bill, 1969–1979 Series, Scenes of Canada . Bank of Canada. As a multisensory medium that expresses cultural values, the landscape can be “found” in Banff National Park and Yosemite or, as Mitchell outlines, “put there by the physical transformation of a place.” 81 Examining the latter, I turn to one of Tseng’s US landscapes, Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 (figure 2.6 ), to demonstrate how Tseng’s intrusion onto the patently manufactured natural landscape also prompts an excavation of the racial logics embedded in the “shrine of democracy.” Mount Rushmore, South Dakota is in many ways exemplary of the Expeditionary Series title in its engagement with the heroic forefathers of the nation and the monument’s fearless creator, Gutzon Borglum. Four presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt—were carved into stone in a project that took seventeen years from inception to completion. As the presidents set their gaze on the westward frontier, Tseng’s body faces the presidents. What does he see? FIGURE 2.6 Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 . Tseng Kwong Chi, East Meets West , a.k.a. The Expeditionary Self-Portrait Series 1979–1989 . © Muna Tseng Dance Projects, Inc., New York. www.tsengkwongchi.com . Since its completion in 1941, Mount Rushmore has become such an embedded symbol of US nationalism that Cher once admitted to believing that the monument was a naturally occurring rock formation. 82 Even for those who recognize the transparent constructedness of the rock landscape, the monument nevertheless appeals to similar ideals of authenticity and purity present in the Group of Seven’s landscape paintings. Fears over the potential degeneration of a superior “Nordic” race that were projected onto the landscape reflected the transnational currency of alarmist race theories in white settler nations. Similar to the Group of Seven, whose trees and icy mountains can be interpreted as personified symbols of white paternalistic dominion over the Canadian nation, Mount Rushmore’s granite rock face brings this symbolism to a literal realm in its depiction of the nation’s heroic “forefathers.” Borglum’s rock, a medium that expresses both impermeability and permanence, shares with the Group’s paintings a reverence for nature’s strength, stability, and resistance to change. As Borglum wrote of his intentions for the memorial, “The purpose of the memorial is to communicate the founding, expansion, preservation, and unification of the United States.” 83 Interestingly, although the Group’s landscapes and Borglum’s mountain sculpture represent spaces of spiritual relief and separation from alienating bureaucratic structures and the economic determinism associated with the city, their artistic undertakings would have been impossible without substantial government funding. And, similar to the Group’s romantic pursuit of the true North, Borglum fashioned himself as a rugged explorer who “discovered” the site in the Black Hills. During the memorial’s formal dedication ceremony in 1925, he climbed the vertical face of the mountain and planted a flag on its peak. Boime explains that in this feat “Borglum was emulating [John C.] Frémont’s dramatic unfurling of the flag on the summit of the Rockies.” 84 Thus Borglum and his monument provided for Tseng a rich corpus of heroic, white, masculine, and colonial associations to emulate in his own Expeditionary Series . If the effect of the Group of Seven’s paintings was to naturalize conquest by erasing human involvement in the landscape, Borglum’s Mount Rushmore was an even more explicit homage to the ideology of Manifest Destiny. Boime observes that the monument “allegorizes the idea of Manifest Destiny” in that all four presidents had a role in the myth of divine territorial intervention. 85 These included Washington’s extensive surveying of the frontier; Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase; Lincoln’s transcontinental railroad; and Roosevelt’s role in the conquest of New Spain and construction of the Panama Canal, which provided an expedient water route to Pacific markets. In short, the monument exemplifies Mitchell’s suggestion that the “rise of landscape” is intimately connected with imperial expansion. 86 Similar to his parodic engagement with the Group of Seven, Tseng’s pose and manipulation of scale recalls a romantic tradition of landscape art that privileges a single perspective. Mount Rushmore’s participation in this tradition is rendered to the point of exaggeration, captured in the monument’s grandiose point of view. This perspective epitomizes what Boime refers to as a “magisterial aesthetics,” one that reinforces an “imperial point of view that is often expressed in American landscape painting of the nineteenth century and that remains deeply embedded in the national consciousness.” 87 In Mount Rushmore, South Dakota , the elevated perspective of the gigantic presidents’ faces symbolizes their authority over the land they govern, which is contrasted with Tseng’s subordinated and ambiguous perspective. Reversing the direction of their magisterial gaze, Tseng’s body is turned away from the viewer, and his concealed face points upward toward the four presidents. And unlike in the earlier East Meets West phase of Tseng’s series, where he often blew up the scale of his body to give the impression he was a Godzilla-esque figure threatening the various national icons he stood beside—such as the Statue of the Liberty or the Empire State Building—here Tseng’s body is dwarfed in the presence of Borglum’s homage to the nation’s forefathers. The pose Tseng adopts in this photograph brings to mind the Byronic hero, the lone romantic figure cast in relief against the natural landscape. A well-known example of these “magisterial aesthetics” is captured in a nineteenth-century piece called The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818) by the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Contained in Friedrich’s painting (figure 2.7 ) are the frequently recycled tropes of romanticism. For instance, the clouds and mountaintops intermingle in the painting to emphasize the inseparability of nature from the heavens above. At the center is the solitary traveler, who has climbed to a dangerous vantage point, his back turned to us so that the viewer can share his point of view and spiritual identification with the purity of nature. The mountains in this painting similarly evoke permanence and steadfastness. Joining earth and heaven, the intermingling craggy rocks and clouds convey both endurance and immortality. The anticapitalist subtext of this romantic vision is underscored by the wanderer’s traditional folk attire, which valorizes the cultural purity of folk life over the abstract degradations of capitalist modernity.

Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Tseng stands with his back to the viewer. However, he is standing so close that the monument loses its illusions of grandeur. Boime suggests that Mount Rushmore, “like the statue of liberty, . . . succeeds [only] through the impact of scale rather than aesthetic quality.” 88 From where Tseng stands, unable to appreciate the impact of scale, the monument cannot succeed. Using his body to emphasize distinctions of scale, Tseng also evokes Chinese landscape paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties. 89 The small scale of the human figures depicted in the paintings of these periods emphasizes the sanctuary offered by nature and the relative insignificance of human beings against an overpowering natural environment. Maxwell Hearn explains that the disintegration of the Tang dynasty was the main catalyst for the Romantic antidynastic retreat into nature: “Faced with the failure of the human order, learned men sought permanence within the natural world, retreating into the mountains to find a sanctuary from the chaos of dynastic collapse.” 90 Whether deliberate or not, the allusion to Chinese landscape painting in Tseng’s photograph is amusingly out of place at Mount Rushmore because it subverts, as Mitchell explains, “any claims for the uniquely modern or Western lineage of landscape.” 91 In particular, in the context of Mount Rushmore’s celebration of Manifest Destiny, the photograph’s connection to Chinese landscape painting further underscores the circuits of dynastic power and capital that give rise to imperial dimensions of landscape art. Through the parodic gaps between repetition and difference, Tseng’s photography brings to view the imperial dimensions of landscape art that are conditioned by the violent elimination of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of land resources. Toying with these elements of scale, Tseng dramatizes his insignificance in the face of these forefathers in a parody of heroic frontier masculinity. This parody underscores the cultural importance of frontier masculinity as a constitutive element of US national identity while emphasizing how Asian men literally fall short of its larger-than-life romanticization. As a queer Asian man, moreover, Tseng and his near invisibility underscore the multiple registers of his alienation: from constructions of white masculinity, from the whiteness of US gay male identity, and from patriarchal Asian American cultural nationalisms that reinforce a staunchly heterosexist “heroic” masculinity to combat anti-Asian racism. For instance, according to Frank Chin, Jeffery Paul Chan, Lawson Fusao Inada, and Shawn Hsu Wong of the Aiiieeeee! Collective, Asian American cultural politics must challenge the social and cultural emasculation of Asian American men by subverting stereotypes of the “good Chinese man . . . [as] the fulfillment of white male homosexual fantasy, literally kissing white ass.” 92 While Tseng assumes the guise of the explorer, however parodic, his contemplation of the four presidents might very well be read as “kissing white ass.” Thus, in Tseng’s disruption of cultural nationalist prescriptions, his physical inconsequentiality may suggest that a masculinist and heterosexist Asian American cultural nationalism falls short precisely because it further entrenches a cultural standard of white masculinity. At the same time, Tseng’s diminutiveness can also be read as a tacit acknowledgment of what Malini Johar Schueller calls “the gendered imperatives of Western imperialism and orientalism that have produced the stereotype of the effeminate Asian male.” 93 Refusing to adopt the “magisterial gaze” of the four presidents, Tseng turns his attention to the gaze itself and its presumed authority. He faces east rather than west, reversing the westward direction of the frontier that the presidents seem to be surveying. His eastward gaze counters the normative conventions of landscape that, as Patricia Nelson Limerick observes, “ran on an east-to-west track, following the physical and mental migrations of white English-speaking men.” 94 Most importantly, his eastward gaze demonstrates the fact that the westward movement of white settlers was only one small part of the process of “discovery.” A disoriented explorer, Tseng evokes the historical fact that for nonwhite immigrants, as they moved along the west–east axis of labor, internment, and other displacements, the landscape was not the simple, pure, virgin wilderness of the settler colonial imagination. Indeed, Chinese labor in North America offers a salient illustration of Raymond Williams’s remark that “a working country is hardly ever a landscape.” 95 The subtle lighting in the black-and-white photograph also has the effect of nearly disappearing Tseng. On the one hand, his invisibility underscores the illegibility of his queer Asian difference within the regenerative myths and expansionist ideologies that Mount Rushmore stands for. On the other hand, his disappearance allegorizes the repressed histories that are not etched in stone, most notably the history of the Sioux Nation: the Sioux campaigned vigorously against the monument, which was built on stolen land and commemorated the murder and dispossession of Indigenous peoples. As Boime points out, “Consistent with the pattern of destruction characteristic of national exploration and empire building, the creation and the dedication of the Mount Rushmore monument was one more symbol of the white man’s racist and intolerant Indian policy.” 96 The site of Mount Rushmore is between what is now Harney National Forest and Custer State Park, what Boime refers to as the “two most hated names in the Sioux lexicon” because of William S. Harney’s and George Armstrong Custer’s massacres of Sioux populations that led to illegal gold mining in the Black Hills. 97 The Black Hills, where Mount Rushmore is situated, houses the sacred site of Paha Sapa and is designated by the Sioux as a ceremonial place of prayer and meditation. The memorial was built despite the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which gave Dakota Indians exclusive rights to the Black Hills. Predictably, as soon as gold was discovered, white miners swiftly breached the treaty agreement to begin the illegal expropriation of natural resources and, in the case of Borglum, to blast 450,000 tons of granite from the face of the sacred Black Hills. This history underscores the contradictory logics of settler colonialism, which engages in the violent elimination and dispossession of Indigenous peoples and simultaneously expresses a desire to become Indigenous to the landscape, to naturalize settler colonialism through symbolic projection. Another history not etched into stone includes the many Chinese who worked in the Black Hills in what Liping Zhu calls the “largest Chinatown east of San Francisco from 1876 to 1910.” 98 Only since 2001, when extensive archaeological excavations of Deadwood’s Chinatown began, have widespread signs of Chinese life been revealed for examination. As Zhu notes, the gold rush brought thousands of Chinese miners to the western states, including South Dakota—although the population did not surpass 250 residents. Zhu explains that “as soon as the news spread of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer’s expedition finding gold in the mountains of western Dakota Territory, Chinese immigrants joined the last major gold rush in the nineteenth century, arriving in the Black Hills by the winter of 1875–1876.” 99 They were subject to labor exploitation and racial violence. Only recently have the Chinese, who played such an important role in this South Dakota borderland, emerged from historical repression into partial visibility, giving new meaning to the hazy outline of Tseng’s body at Mount Rushmore. But as Tseng’s suit nearly blends into the rock—suggesting that he is part of the rock—the Chinese of the Black Hills are also embedded in this borderland of invasion, dispossession, and ongoing political struggle. Like the Group of Seven, Borglum’s nationalist project was shaped by his own reactionary beliefs. Despite the rhetoric of democracy he invoked to characterize Mount Rushmore’s commemorative spirit, he was unambiguous about the perils of miscegenation. In particular, in addition to expansions in anti-immigration law, the period saw the rise in white supremacist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK ), an organization that had earlier commissioned Borglum to create a Confederate monument at Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia. His ties to the KKK were not insignificant. Borglum was an impassioned reader of Madison Grant’s Passing of the Great Race , a scaremongering, pseudoscientific treatise that “became a sacred text for eugenicists, the Klan, and proto-Nazis everywhere.” 100 Influenced by Grant’s treatise, Borglum also took to the page. In a 1923 letter to prominent Indianapolis Klansman David C. Stephenson, Borglum boasted, “I wrote 2500 to 3000 words on the evils of the alien races.” 101 In other letters to Stephenson in the early 1920s he also expressed a profound anti-Semitism in his fears of hypodescent through miscegenation, writing as follows: If you cross a thorough-bred with a jackass you get a mule. . . . The lowest race in civilization is the strongest physically and breeding (crossed) is always down. A Negro and a Jew will produce Negro, but Hindu and Jew—Jew; Chinese and Jew, offspring Jew; Italian and Jew, offspring Jew; and European race and Jew, offspring Jew. 102 As John Taliaferro notes, “He labeled immigrants ‘slippered assassins,’ . . . [and] warned that America was becoming an alien ‘scrap heap.’” 103 Even though Borglum opposed slavery, he blamed African slaves for the degeneration of the white race, writing that “it has been the character of the cargo that has eaten into the very moral fiber of our race character, rather than the moral depravity of Anglo-Saxon traders.” 104 His eugenic vision was also explicitly gendered. Boime explains that Borglum’s admiration of Benito Mussolini’s virile masculinity was in direct contrast to the effeminacy and weakness he associated with Jews. For these reasons he attempted to disassociate himself from stereotypes of the effete artist by engaging in rigorous physical activities such as rock climbing, boxing, and wrestling and crafting an aesthetic vision based on colossal forms. In this light, Tseng’s presence on the face of Mount Rushmore stages a confrontation with the manifest masculinity embedded in the shrine of democracy, a confrontation captured in his eastward gaze and richly evocative of the earlier title of the series, East Meets West . In sum, the degenerative excess signaled by Tseng’s abstract alien body powerfully underscores the romantic anticapitalism embedded in the settler colonial personification of the landscape as a concrete, racially pure, and masculine expression of a noncapitalist universe.

Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. Our Home and Native Landscape To conclude this chapter I turn to Jin-me Yoon’s 1996 photographic work Group of Sixty-Seven , which usefully complements Tseng’s parodic exposure of romantic anticapitalist ideology projected onto the nationalist landscape. Group of Sixty-Seven extends the focus on racial constructions of national landscape that first appeared in her 1991 Souvenirs of the Self postcard series, in which Yoon poses, much like Tseng, in front of familiar tourist sites in Banff National Park. Continuing her exploration of the interplay of race and landscape, Group of Sixty-Seven connects romantic anticapitalism with the fetishization of Indigenous identity and racializes Asians as a negative abstraction. Here Yoon incorporates the paintings of two iconic Canadian painters, Lawren Harris of the Group of Seven and Emily Carr, an artist deeply inspired by the Group of Seven’s nationalist vision who became renowned for her artistic interaction with Native populations in British Columbia. From the view of settler colonialism’s triangulation of settler, Native, and alien identities, Yoon’s work exemplifies how the Native and the Asian personify opposite sides of an antinomical view of capitalist relations, in which the concrete, noncapitalist dimension is Indigenous and the abstract representation of capitalist modernity is Asian. Group of Sixty-Seven (figure 2.8 ) consists of two gridlike panels, each panel containing sixty-seven photographs of Korean Canadians from Vancouver, British Columbia. On the left panel, they face away from us (figure 2.9 ), and on the right, they face us (figure 2.10 ). We can first observe the various layers of national citation in this piece. The title, Group of Sixty-Seven , makes an overt reference to the Group of Seven. The number “sixty-seven” in the title also cites Canadian confederation in 1867 and the elimination of national origins immigration quotas a hundred years later, in 1967—the crucial legal prerequisite for the appearance of many of the sixty-seven Korean Canadian faces featured in the piece. Adding another layer of citation to the Group of Seven artists, we note that behind the heads on the right panel is Lawren Harris’s Rocky Mountain painting Maligne Lake, Jasper Park . Building on Tseng’s references to the Group of Seven painters and their association of white male nationhood with landscape, Yoon’s work highlights the commodification of landscape in her use of repetition, recalling the seriality of Andy Warhol’s pop art.

Like Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroe portraits, Yoon’s piece similarly inverts high and low aestheticism and the values associated with originality and duplication. Her postmodern play of surface and depth presents a dramatic recontextualization of Harris’s Maligne Lake , which was considered the most influential painting in Toronto from the time it was painted in 1924 to 1930. 105 As one of the most celebrated nationalist works of art in Canada, art historian Dennis Reid describes Harris’s painting as a “tribute to the spiritualizing force of the country, an incentive to the spiritual capacity in us all.” 106 In keeping with his romantic views of a nation united under a spiritual conception of the North, Maligne Lake expresses a sense of control and order that defended against the turbulent social realities of the 1920s. This was a period of increasing industrialization, urbanization, and class struggle that fomented increasing antipathy toward racialized aliens, particularly Chinese labor migrants, who were subject to the Chinese Head Tax and would face exclusion through passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act. Thus the “rise of landscape” 107 and escape into a primordial, frozen wilderness in this context can be attributed to an increasing sense of chaos spurred by modernity. By invoking Harris and the Group of Seven so explicitly in this piece, Yoon invites the viewer to explore the intersection of race and romantic anticapitalism in the Group of Seven’s artwork, particularly in the racial and spatial depiction of Canada’s national identity constructed around the idea of the “Great White North.” More confrontationally, Yoon prompts the viewer to consider the relationship between these Korean faces and the essence of Nordic purity celebrated in the Group’s depiction of the landscape. By photographing sixty-seven Korean faces in front of Harris’s painted landscape, Yoon imposes what Hutcheon calls “an external order upon a work that is presumed to be original.” 108 However, Yoon manipulates the line between the authenticity of the original by repeating Harris’s landscape sixty-seven times. In terms of the dissonant media presented in the work, Yoon emphasizes the modernity of the Korean faces through her use of photography—a medium whose infinite capacity for reproduction represents an antithesis to notions of artistic originality contained in Harris’s piece. In doing so, Yoon allegorizes the way Korean Canadian bodies become racial signifiers of the abstract dimension of capitalist modernity and, alternatively, how the painted landscape becomes a signifier of the concrete dimension of nature, purity, and originality. But Yoon ultimately frustrates a view of the abstract homogeneity associated with Asians by emphasizing the gender and generational diversity of her Korean Canadian subjects against a Maligne Lake that is here reduced to “background,” its unoriginality reinforced again by Yoon’s repetition of the image. In a twist on the visual codes of the tourist snapshot, what is “real” about the photograph are the Korean faces, emphasizing both the commodification of landscape as tourist scene and its artificiality. The jarring superimposition of Asian faces onto the constructed landscape also serves as an invitation to consider why Asians have or have not been incorporated into the dominant social and cultural landscape in Canada. While Maligne Lake is celebrated as a timeless and noncontradictory representation of Canadian nationalism, it is interesting to note that it was completed one year after the passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act, in a period that saw the rise in organized anti-Asian labor agitation and the continual revision of anti-Asian legislation. What Yoon’s piece suggests, then, is that romantic expressions of Canadian nationalism that are conveyed as pastoral retreat must be read as inseparable from a history of yellow peril and anti-immigrant sentiment. If we shift to a more contemporary context, Yoon’s faces comment on the xenophobic responses to ways recent Asian immigration has redrawn the racial landscape in large urban cities such as Vancouver. Indeed, the public outcry against Hong Kong immigrant “monster houses” in Vancouver’s historically white Shaughnessy and Kerrisdale neighborhoods is one example of how the influx of Asian residential settlement outside the spatial and class confines of segregated Chinatowns reflects, as geographer Katharyne Mitchell observes, “anxiety about the loss of both economic and symbolic control over the defining and marking of place.” 109 Thus the images of these unsmiling faces blocking our view of the aestheticized landscape suggest that these faces are always in excess of nationalist constructions of landscape. By superimposing these faces onto Harris’s painting in a gridlike parody of Canada’s so-called multicultural “mosaic,” Yoon suggests that we can draw no unifying, ideological comfort from the retreat into landscape.

The left panel of Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven offers a related parody of the national landscape by emphasizing the romanticization of Indigenous themes. This panel draws on a painting titled Old Time, Coast Village (figure 2.11 ) by British Columbia painter Emily Carr—an iconic figure in her own right. Emily Carr’s association with the Group of Seven was established in 1927 when she was invited by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa to participate in an exhibition of West Coast painting. There she met Lawren Harris, whose praise for the Native themes in her art and subsequent years of encouragement became a key motivator for the artistic and literary projects she undertook, including her Governor General award-winning autobiography, Klee Wyck , recounting her experiences with Pacific Coast First Nations communities. The book’s title is based on the nickname given to her by the Tlingit Nation—an Indigenous people she strongly identified with—which translates to “the laughing one.” 110 In a revealing journal entry about the 1927 exhibition, Carr notes proudly, “I felt my work looked dead and dull, but they [Group of Seven] all say I have more of the spirit of the Indian than the others.” 111 Not only for Carr, who identified with the First Nations to the point that she imagined herself an Indian, the merit of her own work was judged on its capacity to reflect Native spirituality and cultural vision. Because she was a female artist and assumed to be lesbian, the First Nations themes Carr drew out in her work, which included reproducing their art forms in her own art practice, are often lauded as exemplary of her anticonformism, which challenged patriarchal and heteronormative gender scripts. Carr traveled alone to Native communities in British Columbia, such as the coastal Haida, Tsmishian, and Tlingit Nations, and began to feature their totem poles in her paintings. In her pursuit of a Native vision, Carr exemplified the role of the romantic hero—but as a woman. Her attraction to First Nations cultures was clearly based on romanticized notions of the “noble savage,” who she believed existed in a vanishing state of purity in nature. Art historian Dorothy Shadbolt attests to this belief, explaining that Carr “intuitively grasped the sense in which Indian art was an expression of the native’s relation to the natural and supernatural world as he understood it.” 112 In figure 2.9 we can observe the proximity Carr observed in the relation between First Nations and “real” nature. In particular, the light-colored totem poles at the center of the piece echo the brown trees in the background, suggesting the indistinguishable features of First Nations culture and nature. From an antinomical view of capitalist social relations, First Nations culture comes to express concrete nature, purity, and originality against the abstract, antinatural oppressions of capitalist modernity. But what complicates Carr’s romanticization of First Nations culture here is the overwhelming foliage that drapes the village in a heavy, molten green and serves as protective cover. The trees in the foreground appear human in form, leaning toward the village in cautious observance. Recalling Alexandra Minna Stern’s examination of the racial undertones of early twentieth-century conservationism and wilderness protection, Carr’s painting betrays not only an ideology of romantic anticapitalism at the core of the settler colonial retreat into nature, but also a suffocating management and control of First Nations cultures. Thus her desire to “go Native” was ultimately more revealing of a defensive investment in whiteness than a respect for Indigenous sovereignty and land claims. More extreme than the Group of Seven’s northern retreat from social and political upheavals of the 1920s that marked life in urban centers, Carr’s psychological withdrawal from urbanization manifested itself in illnesses, to the extent that it appeared she was allergic to the city—an ailment Reid refers to as the “‘city disease’ that was to attack [Carr] whenever she settled in a metropolis.” 113 Her loathing of the city, coupled with her idealization of and identification with First Nations culture and appropriation of their art, exemplifies Shari Huhndorf’s description of “going Native” as an appropriation of the identity, images, culture, or practices of Indigenous peoples. A settler colonial logic that finds equal expression in Canada as in the United States, she explains that going Native “reinforces the racial hierarchies it claims to destabilize”: 114 Over the last century, going native has become a cherished American tradition, an important—even necessary—means of defining European American identities and histories. In its various forms, going native articulates and attempts to resolve widespread ambivalence about modernity as well as anxieties about the terrible violence marking the nation’s origins. 115 From this perspective we can reread Carr’s gender transgressions as symptomatic of her own white colonial identity crisis, one she attempted to resolve by appropriating and identifying herself with a First Nations identity. While Carr may have viewed going Native as simultaneously anticapitalist in shunning modernity’s spoils and ruins alike, antiracial in her idealization of the coastal First Nations communities onto which she imposed herself, and gender-bending in her adoption of the persona of the lonely romantic genius, she actually reinforced rather than dismantled these structures. In particular, rather than challenging capitalism, Carr’s journey to remove herself from the toxic industrial and immigrant-filled environment of the city to find personal and artistic inspiration in Native cultures reinforces capitalism’s main values. As Huhndorf explains, “The fixation on self-discovery and self-healing articulate the very Western ideologies of bourgeois individualism.” 116 Because her oeuvre relied on the appropriation of First Nations art practice, her relationship with First Nations cultures was largely economic insofar as she profited immensely from appropriating their cultural practices. Finally, Carr’s idealization of the naturalness of the “noble savages” of the Pacific coast was contradicted by her antipathy toward the large urban population of Songhees who lived in her hometown of Victoria. As Janice Stewart explains, Carr’s view of the Songhees was in keeping with prevailing ideas at the time: they were seen as “‘lazy, gambling, drunks’ who were ‘a nuisance and trouble to the authorities’ as ‘individuals warranting charity.’” 117 The practice of either idealizing Native peoples as noble savages or denigrating them as inferior and requiring colonial management ultimately performs the same ideological work. On one hand, the romanticization of Native cultures functions to distance North Americans from their European settler roots, thereby displacing responsibility for the conquest and dispossession of the First Nations. 118 It also reinforces racial hierarchies when settlers identify and imagine themselves as “super-Indian” and therefore the rightful inheritors of the land and its resources. On the other, the denigration of Native communities naturalizes European dominance and its ideologies of western progress. It rationalizes the colonization of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of their resources through suggestions that Natives cannot “accept” modernity and civilization. Last but not least, while Carr’s adoption of the Tlingit name Klee Wyck can be read as a rejection of Victorian notions of womanhood and the rigid organization of her father’s house; as Stewart observes, “For most of her life, Carr turned to masculine authorities . . . for final judgment of her work rather than to her circle of reading ladies or other women artists.” 119 As an artist who rose to iconic fame in the 1930s, after the Group of Seven disbanded, by extending their project of defining a distinctively Canadian art, Carr’s persona reveals a problematic desire to escape from a social world marked by social upheavals, anti-immigrant sentiment, and industrialization, and a colonial desire to possess First Nations culture to promote the authenticity of her “Canadian” art. If spiritual replenishment for the nation did not spring from the “true North strong and free,” as the Group believed, then according to Carr, “our home and Native land” 120 became a national symbol of cultural purity and wholeness. Yoon’s engagement with Carr in the left panel must therefore be read as an engagement with Carr’s autochthonophilia and appropriation of First Nations cultural identity. The way Yoon’s work performs a disidentification of Carr’s painting is registered on multiple levels. If we focus on the way the Korean Canadian heads are turned away from the viewer, we can interpret this “faceless” gesture as a disidentification with the ethnographic gaze embedded in Carr’s painting, a gaze that appropriates the Native other for artistic legitimacy and produces art that becomes a romantic index to a defensive settler colonial identity. But at another level, they stage a disidentificatory encounter for the settler looking in. Given that these Korean heads block the view of the village, they foreclose a settler desire to identify with the Native landscape, whose commodification is reinforced through the repetition of Carr’s painting. A further irony embedded in this panel is that not only do Yoon’s Korean Canadian subjects block an identification with the landscape, but the blackness of the back-turned heads also allegorize the inability of settler culture to “identify” Asians as anything but abstractly homogeneous—as unidentifiable as the black hair in each frame. Adding, then, to the degenerative excess that Tseng’s body performs in the romanticized landscape, here Yoon suggests that Asian bodies are an alien antithesis of settler colonialism’s indigenizing desire. In short, by viewing capitalism as an antinomy of abstract and concrete dimensions, Asians are as unnatural to the landscape as Indigenous peoples are natural. This is the double edge of settler colonialism. Conclusion In Tseng’s and Yoon’s disidentification with iconic landscapes of North America, their photographs present, to quote Hutcheon again, “inscription[s] of the past in the present [that] embody and bring to life actual historical tensions” and prompt us to delve into the genealogy of landscape art of the early twentieth century. 121 Disidentifying with a shifting set of clichés and stereotypes associated with Asian North Americans and the landscape while preserving the aesthetic beauty of the latter tradition, their photographs use landscape “as raw material for representing a disempowered politics or positionality that has been rendered unthinkable by the dominant culture.” 122 Indeed, the alien presence of Asian bodies set against these landscapes foregrounds messy intersections of race science, white nativism, and settler nationalism projected onto the landscape. For Tseng, his parodic repetition of early twentieth-century landscape conventions associated with the Group of Seven’s, Adams’s, and Borglum’s landscapes brings forth the eugenic ideology that conveyed a white, masculine, and paternalistic identification with mountains and trees. Despite conservationists’ progressive environmental agenda, their efforts were often intertwined with a eugenic agenda that opposed the degeneration of the white race by alien races. Juxtaposed with Tseng’s alien excess, their projection of virility and obstinate resistance to change onto a mountainous and tree-filled landscape expresses the contradictory way that racist ideology formed a key subtext of so-called progressive, anticapitalist visions of national unity, conservation, and democracy. In a complementary manner, Yoon draws out the indigenizing dimension of romantic anticapitalism that collapse Native cultures into an unchanging natural purity and authenticity. She also builds on Tseng’s evocation of the degenerative excess signified by Asian bodies to exemplify the abstractness and unnaturalness of the Asian body against the landscape. From the period of railroad labor discussed in the last chapter to Asian immigrant exclusion in this chapter, the perverse abstraction associated with Chinese labor had by the 1920s and 1930s been supplanted by the settler retreat into the aestheticized landscape, whose unnatural antithesis is the Asian alien. Despite the romantic tribute to national culture embedded in landscape art of the early twentieth century, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographic countermemories suggest that such a “progressive” vision of national culture was “born in the apprehension of imminent loss,” as Lake and Reynolds indicate, and part of the anxious growth of “whiteness as a transnational mode of racial identification in settler societies.” 123 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, territorial symbols of regenerative whiteness expressed the proprietorial dimension of British settler colonialism and became, over time, synonymous with whiteness. As W. E. B. Du Bois observed succinctly on the whiteness of territorial expansion, “Whiteness is the ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen.” 124 Finally, in the spirit of Kingston’s and Fung’s reimagining of abstract labor as History 2, the potential of Tseng’s and Yoon’s parody is not in articulating a more ideal landscape of normative inclusion to symbolize the self-identity of the settler nation. Rather, by queering the aestheticized landscape, Tseng’s alien difference animates the contradictions, exclusions, and violent eliminations of settler colonialism that the landscape, as aesthetic object, fetishizes and naturalizes. Similarly, Yoon’s iteration of the interrupted landscape lays bare the fetishized commodity function of the landscape. It is from the ambivalence of the parodic gaps between Tseng’s and Yoon’s difference to the landscape that their photographs allegorize a state of nonequivalence. Nonequivalence, as Chandan Reddy explains, represents subjects “who are not ‘unified’ by a prior identity.” 125 Disidentifying with the white regenerative ideal projected onto the romantic landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs interrupt and denaturalize the mundane iteration of its symbolic violence. Following from the first chapter’s examination of the perverse temporality of abstract labor and this chapter’s focus on antinatural landscapes during a converging period of anti-Asian immigration restriction in North America, the next chapter moves forward to the internment of Japanese North Americans. If Asian North American cultural producers have thus far exposed and recircuited the abstract and unnatural signifiers attached to Asian bodies, what might a transnational approach to Japanese internment narratives expose as internment’s governing logics? Continuing my exploration of Asian racialization as a fetishistic alignment with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, I track the evolution of romantic anticapitalism and its antinomical view of concrete and abstract dimensions of capitalism. Probing Asian North American representations of labor and landscape in chapter 3 , I demonstrate how Joy Kogawa’s Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory reflect how the perverse abstraction of Asian labor takes on mechanical, nonhuman representation that must be eradicated from West Coast agriculture and fishing industries. However, through the process of labor resignification established through symbolic proximity with Indigeneity, Japanese North Americans emerge renaturalized and recorporealized as surplus labor.",

J. T. Mitchell, “Imperial Landscape” Undoing Landscape I begin this chapter with an unnatural scene: an old photograph of a tree surrounded by a crowd of onlookers (figure 2.1 ). It is nighttime. White men under gleaming hats stand with their hands in their pockets. On the left appear the blurred faces of a couple, walking arm in arm toward the camera. They are dressed as if they are on a date at the movies. Some of the bystanders look ahead, away from the camera, while others look back, impervious to the glare of the flash. There seems to be nothing aesthetically remarkable about the tree in the background except its sturdiness, emphasized by its proportional dominance, and its three solid branches jutting out like tines on a pitchfork. It turns out that the photograph is lying. What we do not see is that the occasion for the social gathering is the body of a lynched man who hangs from one of the tree’s branches. The photograph belongs to a series by artist Ken Gonzales-Day entitled Erased Lynching , in which he digitally removes the victim from the lynching scene. These are scenes that were captured and circulated on postcards in western states from 1850 to the 1930s, and most of the victims were not black. As Gonzales-Day explains, “Native Americans, Chinese, and Latinos of Mexican and Latin American descent were lynched in California . . . guided by anti-immigration sentiments, the fear of miscegenation, a deep frustration with the judicial system, or in combination with white supremacy.” 1 The vast majority of lynching victims he uncovered were of Latino descent. FIGURE 2.1 Ken Gonzales-Day, Erased Lynching , 2006. Courtesy of the artist. Gonzales-Day’s manipulation of lynching scenes is remarkable for the way it produces visibility out of erasure, inverting the power of the visual field. By shifting the spectacular nature of the lynched body onto the spectators, Erased Lynching moves the viewer’s attention to the visuality of lynching itself. Not only does it draw our attention to the expressions of the spectators, but we are also confronted by the cultural apparatus and circulation of lynching images, what Gonzales-Day refers to as the “aesthetics of the event, from the physical act to the creation of the lynching photograph and its progeny, the souvenir card, view card, and postcard.” 2 It also draws our attention back to the tree, whose former innocence is replaced by purposeful attributes of branch height and species—primarily native oak species 3 —that facilitated the mechanics of lynching. In addition, the large, life-size scale of Gonzales-Day’s photographic rendering serves to insert the contemporary viewer into the lynching scene, implicating us as consumers of the spectacle of racial violence and participants in their circulation. For the purposes of this chapter, Gonzales-Day’s photograph is significant not only for the way it counteracts the spectacle of the lynched racial body, but also for how it reverses the normative power we associate with landscape. The anchoring tree, as the primary subject of the viewing public, is stripped of the romanticism we attach to “scenery.” As a photograph rather than a painting, it communicates less the spiritual aesthetic of landscape than what Gonzales-Day describes as an artifact that “remains trapped somewhere between memento and evidence.” 4 In its inversion of the visual content of the image—rendering the white spectators, rather than the lynched body, as racial spectacle—Gonzales-Day exposes the power of perspective and subjective identification, elements that are intrinsic to the aesthetic technology of landscape. In manipulating viewers’ capacity to identify with the scene, Erased Lynching activates the notion of landscape as a medium rather than strictly a genre of art. This follows W. J. T. Mitchell’s insistence that we examine “not just what landscape ‘is’ or ‘means’ but what it does , how it works as a cultural practice.” 5 In this case, the landscape functions as both a witness and accomplice to racial violence. Following the last chapter’s focus on the racialization of Chinese workers as abstract labor, an economism that aligned Chinese labor with the temporal domination of capitalism, this chapter probes how settler colonial constructions of the landscape express the other side of the antinomy: the concrete, thingly, natural dimension Postone describes as that which “appears as the variegated surface of immediate sensuous experience.” 6 While Asian labor personifies the abstract circuits of capitalism, settler colonial constructions of landscape express the opposite: the concrete, pure, and authentic noncapitalist dimension of nature. That the social world appears antinomical—that is, characterized by concrete and abstract dimensions—is a function of the fetish, which conceals the social relations behind products of human labor, repressing the duality of commodity-determined labor. As Kingston’s and Fung’s texts illuminated in the last chapter, Chinese labor was associated with a perverse temporality, one that rendered Chinese bodies fungible (like currency) and a signifier of moral corruption. As such, Chinese bodies occupied the abstract dimension of the antinomy, as subjects “abstracted from all particularity” 7 insofar as Chinese bodies are interchangeable with other Chinese bodies. White labor, on the other hand, was individual, tangible, concrete, and of social value. Postone describes this structure of social relations as a “quasi-natural opposition” of two objective worlds: “The relation of these two worlds of objectivity can then be construed as that of essence and appearance, or as that of an opposition (as has been expressed historically, for example, in the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought).” 8 Postone’s emphasis on the opposition between romantic and positive-rational modes of thought is particularly germane for our consideration of landscape, which is associated with both western romanticism and an imperialist aesthetic. As Mitchell observes, the Chinese antecedents of western landscape “flourished most notably at the height of Chinese imperial power and began to decline in the eighteenth century as China itself became an object of English fascination and appropriation at the moment England was beginning to experience itself as an imperial power.” 9 From this view, landscape can be seen to function as a fetish itself, “symptom[atic] of the rise and development of capitalism; the ‘harmony’ sought in landscape [can be] read as a compensation for and screening off of the actual violence perpetrated there.” 10 It is precisely because landscape appears real, natural, and thingly, rather than a way of seeing and a culturally mediated representation of nature, that it seems antithetical to the very circuits of capitalism and imperialism that Mitchell identifies with it. Here, as Postone clarifies, “the opposition of its abstract and concrete dimensions allows capitalism to be perceived and understood in terms of its abstract dimension alone; its concrete dimension can thereby be apprehended as noncapitalist.” 11 In other words, capitalism is understood in terms of its abstract dimension, noncapitalism (and anticapitalism) with its concrete dimension. Thus, building on the last chapter’s examination of settler exclusion of abstract alien labor because of its “perverse” alignment with capital, this chapter examines the settler identification with the western landscape and idealization of Native peoples as a further expression of the romantic anticapitalism of anti-Asian sentiment and the indigenizing project of settler colonialism. We will see how settler colonialism constructs a landscape that is simultaneously a site of Native erasure and a site of indigenizing purity and authenticity. In order to excavate the racial logics of landscape in a manner that foregrounds, as Gonzales-Day’s photograph does, the interplay of racial violence, settler identification, and landscape, I look to the landscape photography of Vancouver-based artist Jin-me Yoon and the late New York–based photographer Tseng Kwong Chi. As photographic countermemory, their re-envisioning of western landscapes in Canada and the United States identifies romantic anticapitalism as a key ideology of settler colonialism. Their respective photographs of Mount Rushmore, the Canadian Rockies, and the Pacific coast parody the conventions of landscape art of the 1920s and 1930s that were established by artists such as Ansel Adams, Gutzon Borglum, the Canadian Group of Seven, and Emily Carr. In doing so, Tseng and Yoon expose how romantic anticapitalism flourished during the height of anti-Asian immigration restriction to project a settler identification with a personified, Indigenous landscape. The way early twentieth-century artists anchored white settler identity in the landscape reflects contradictory identifications with the “Native” that effectively erased the history of conquest and dispossession while expressing nostalgia for a time before capitalist modernity. This romantic idealization of nature and the “noble savage” captures the settler valorization of the concrete realm of social relations under capitalism, particularly under conditions of rapid industrialization and economic flux leading up to and following the stock market crash of 1929. Within the romantic anticapitalist logics of settler colonialism, the valorization of the concrete over the abstract realms misconstrues the appearance of capitalist relations for their reality. As Neil Levi puts it, “Romantic anticapitalism . . . hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations.” 12 In this chapter I look at the way works by Tseng and Yoon emphasize how the eugenicism embedded in an expanding conception of whiteness increasingly appropriates Indigeneity as a mode of biologizing the landscape. I situate Tseng’s and Yoon’s parodic strategies of countermemory within the theoretical framework of disidentification articulated by José Esteban Muñoz. For Muñoz, disidentification works alternatively as an artistic process, a mode of performance, and a critical hermeneutic. It is a mode of “shuffling back and forth between reception and production.” 13 By highlighting disidentification as a frame for Tseng’s and Yoon’s artistic process and performance, I read their engagement with landscape neither as assimilative identification nor as a wholesale rejection of it. Neither is it, as Muñoz clarifies, an “apolitical middle ground.” 14 Rather, disidentification operates as a third mode of dealing with dominant ideology that emerges from the recognition that the subject is constituted inside ideology—that there is no privileged position outside ideology from which the subject can oppose its own formation—and that resistance can occur through “negotiations between desire, identification, and ideology.” 15 Disidentification, therefore, is about “recycling or reforming an object that has already been invested with powerful energy.” 16 Tseng’s and Yoon’s projections of their alien excess against a landscape of normative racial, cultural, and aesthetic values captures the political potential that Judith Butler further ascribes to the disidentificatory encounter, “this uneasy sense of standing under a sign to which one does and does not belong.” 17 By analyzing their engagement with the cultural values it activates, I propose that Tseng’s Expeditionary Series and Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven enact modes of parody that both recycle the dominant codes associated with the landscape and transform them with their racial excess. Their encounters perform a repetition with a racial difference. As British settler nations whose colonial objective was primarily land appropriation rather than the exploitation of Indigenous labor, 18 national identity in Canada and the United States has often been defined as a product of the landscape. As Angela Miller explains of the US context, the nineteenth-century landscape encapsulated “the nationalist myth—that the physical environment itself produced national character.” 19 Similarly, in the early twentieth century in Canada, as Erin Manning suggests, the “quest for national identity [was sought] through the image of the landscape . . . where the unity of states and citizens [was] constructed on the putative ethnic or racial identity of a nation, which, in turn, is anchored to the representation of landscape.” 20 As a vital source for the expression of national identity in both nations, the continuing appeal of landscape art into the early twentieth century was often coupled with disdain for the rise of modernism. In a revealing glimpse of such antimodernist sentiment, when the Group of Seven traveled to New York State in 1913, it was not to attend the influential exhibition of international modern art at the Armory Show but to attend an exhibition of traditional Scandinavian art. 21 Within the diverse media that form the landscapes by Adams, Borglum, the Group of Seven, and Carr, none ironize or subvert—as modernist art often does—nationalist subject matter or the hierarchy of high and popular cultural forms. Instead, their works contain a romantic reverence for and spiritual identification to land as a symbolic anchor for their aestheticized “defense” of national identity. Uncovering the eugenic and Indigenizing subtexts of romantic anticapitalism that are embedded in the settler landscape, I turn first to Tseng’s Expeditionary Series to explore its citations to US photographer Ansel Adams, the Group of Seven, and Mount Rushmore sculptor and architect Gutzon Borglum. I demonstrate how his photographs prompt a recognition of landscape as both a biopolitical expression of white supremacy and a personification of white male dominion. Such a personification of the land is precisely a form of what Postone refers to as the biologization of the concrete that constitutes “expressions of that antinomic fetish, which gives rise to the notion that the concrete is ‘natural,’ and which increasingly presents the socially ‘natural’ in such a way that it is perceived in biological terms.” 22 The final section of this chapter turns to Yoon’s photographic collage Group of Sixty-Seven , whose title makes reference both to the Group of Seven painters and to 1967, the year Canada removed racial barriers to immigration. This legislation was the Canadian corollary to the Hart-Celler Immigration Reform Act of 1965 in the United States, which similarly removed race-based immigration criteria. Building on Tseng’s parody of the eugenic whiteness of the landscape, Yoon’s project highlights the fusion of the Group of Seven’s eugenic ideology with Emily Carr’s own autochthonophilia and her intense desire to “go native.” 23 Thus, Group of Sixty-Seven exposes the eugenic ideology at the core of romantic anticapitalism and the contradictory logics of exclusion and elimination that condition the triangulation of Native, alien, and settler positions within settler colonialism in North America. Eugenic Landscapes In 1978 the artist Tseng Kwong Chi transformed himself from an invisible minority to a visible alien. His metamorphosis came about after an experience he had on a family lunch outing at a high-end New York restaurant. Respecting the restaurant’s dress code, Tseng arrived wearing the only suit he owned: a Chinese uniform he had purchased at a Montreal thrift store. To his amusement he was greeted by the restaurant’s staff and patrons as a Chinese Communist dignitary, much to the displeasure of his parents, who years earlier had escaped from Communist China. His sister, Muna Tseng, recalls the royal treatment her brother received at the restaurant, recounting, “When we arrived . . . the maître d’ took one look at [Tseng] and treated him like a V.I.P., a gentleman from the East, an emissary from Cathay. My parents were not amused.” 24 The attention he attracted at the restaurant nevertheless produced an artistic breakthrough that led Tseng to undergo a process of orientalization, beginning with his name, which went from Joseph Tseng to Tseng Kwong Chi. Completing his wardrobe with mirrored glasses and a clip-on “Slut for Art” ID badge, Tseng reinvented himself in the stereotypical role of the inscrutable and perpetually foreign Asian. It was an identity that his friend the choreographer Bill T. Jones described as “Chinese drag.” 25 Henceforth, in Chinese drag, he took to the streets of New York, gaining unparalleled access to exclusive social events, most famously in 1980 when he crashed the opening night of the Ch’ing dynasty costume exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum. There he mingled with the rich and famous, including Henry Kissinger, William F. Buckley Jr., and Yves Saint Laurent, who, as the art critic Grady Turner relates, “commended Tseng for his fluency in French and asked if he had served in the Chinese embassy in Paris.” 26 What Tseng realized during these experiences was the vastness of Westerners’ ignorance of Asians. Therefore, drawing on a persona that simultaneously evoked foreigner, visitor, tourist, alien, and imposter, he exploited that ignorance in his photographs, which offered surprising reconfigurations of clichéd tourist scenes in North America and around the world.

In the diverse fields in which Tseng’s photographs have been analyzed, from performance studies to Asian American studies, the majority of critical attention has focused on the photographs from the earlier period of his East Meets West series, for their clever juxtaposition of caricatured foreignness and touristy familiarity of Western monuments and icons, such as the Statue of Liberty, Disneyland, and the Hollywood sign. Reflecting the historical moment, the series title aptly parodied the anticommunist sentiment being reignited in 1979, on the eve of the Reagan Revolution. What many critics found remarkable about his photographs, as Margo Machida explains, is that they “counter[ed] a long history of Orientalist painting and photography by explicitly re-representing the West as if seen through a possessive ‘Occidentalist’ gaze.” 27 In contrast to this reception, however, Tseng’s later photographs featured in the same series, renamed Expeditionary Series , have garnered less attention, perhaps because they appear attenuated from the overt culture clash staged in his earlier work. For instance, Tseng’s photographs of majestic US and Canadian landscapes, such as the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and the Rocky Mountains, have been described as offering more solitary explorations of the individual’s relation to nature, which his sister describes as “recalling Chinese landscape paintings of man balanced between sky and earth.” 28 Turner further marks the shift toward natural landscapes in Tseng’s series as evidence of a romantic turn in his oeuvre: [He] put aside the confrontational implications of the earlier title to concentrate on [his] own transformation from alien tourist to American explorer. . . . The Mao suit has become irrelevant. . . . He offers us brief glimpses of a Romantic figure, an artist who has put aside his disguise to revel in the sheer power of nature. 29 This chapter reconsiders this assessment by asking whether the concerns of the latter phase of his series are absent of “confrontational implications.” Rather than a romantic homage to nature’s sublimity, I interpret Tseng’s Expeditionary Series as a queer parody of the Western conventions associated with Canadian and American landscape art of the early twentieth century. Given that landscape art of this period was broadly concerned with honoring nature’s vitality and universalizing power, the intrusion of Tseng’s alien body is a sign not of life-affirming incorporation but of extravagant degeneration. Reading the managed interplay of life, degeneration, and death as a central feature of settler colonialism and projected onto nature, I argue that Tseng’s photographs animate the biopolitics of the settler landscape in Canada and the United States. In consideration of the vexed modalities of racial impersonation that Tseng’s work elicits in Chinese drag, Butler’s discussion of gender and drag performance is useful for highlighting the ambivalent agency of parodic recycling that surrounds his work. When Butler evaluates the subversive potential of drag to expose gender constructions through imitation, she locates gender transgression less in the volitional agency of the drag queen than with the drag performance itself: “[Drag] serves a subversive function to the extent that it reflects the mundane impersonations by which heterosexual ideal genders are performed and naturalized and undermines their power by effecting that exposure.” 30 In other words, drag allegorizes the imitative structure of gender, as a recycled copy that has no original. Butler’s theorization of gender and drag presents an opening for considering race through the terms of drag performance, without collapsing the distinctions between the processes of gendering and racialization—or disregarding their intersection. 31 In particular, both racialization and gendering are processes that are historically constituted through a racist and heterosexist system that reproduces itself through its iteration in bodies, institutions, and law. It is a system that both “precedes and exceeds” the intentions of the racialized and gendered subject. 32 In the case of Tseng’s photographs, although he taps into the symbolic construction of the Asian alien through his performance, Tseng does not invent or choose the terms of his own racialization. Thus, by engaging a disidentificatory hermeneutic, my reading of Tseng’s photographs harnesses the ambivalence of queer of color parody as an opportunity to further demystify and denaturalize what Muñoz calls the “universalizing ruse of dominant culture.” 33 At one level, this mode of reading registers Tseng’s deliberate efforts to choreograph the visual dissonance in the juxtaposition of two figurative constructions: the Chinese as alien and the settler nation as landscape. At another, my analysis also mines the unintentional gaps between parodic repetition and difference that magnify how, as a queer man of color in racial drag, he epitomizes what Chandan Reddy refers to as a “material nonequivalence” to the settler landscape as an alien abstraction against a concrete expression of nature. 34 It is in this spirit of disidentification that I draw on the way Tseng’s photographs evoke the conventions of landscape art produced in the 1920s by the Canadian Group of Seven painters, the American sculptor Gutzon Borglum, and the American photographer Ansel Adams. Comprising a significant portion of the 150 black-and-white photographs Tseng took from 1979 to 1989, the Expeditionary Series captures the variation and range of landscapes he photographed in North America and around the world. A Hong Kong–born Canadian immigrant who attended art school in Paris and lived his adult years in New York among a vibrant set of artists until his death from AIDS in 1990, 35 Tseng’s perception of the landscape in North America and elsewhere was undoubtedly informed by his transnational movements. Excavating the historical context surrounding his photographic references to North American landscapes of the 1920s, a generative period of landscape art in Canada and the United States, I focus on Tseng’s Seven Peaks Snowfield and Lake Moraine , both located in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, and Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. As “natural wonders” of the West, Banff National Park and Mount Rushmore are two sites firmly positioned in settler colonial mythologies of the North American landscape. Banff owes much of this popular mythology to the Group of Seven landscape painters who made Canada’s Western landscape a central subject of many of their paintings. In the United States this mythology is indebted to Gutzon Borglum, the architect behind the colossal sculpture of the four presidents’ faces at Mount Rushmore. With respect to the highly aestheticized quality of Tseng’s dramatic black-and-white photographs, they also recall the visually operatic Yosemite photographs of Ansel Adams. However, unlike Adams, Tseng disrupts the sublime tranquility of the natural landscape by inserting his caricatured body into the frame. Tseng engages with the mythic landscape as an artistic subject that was foundational for the legacy of the Group of Seven and Adams, as well as in terms of the way space and scale are crucial components of the visual impact of Mount Rushmore. Confronting the tangled strands of national history, artistic convention, and regenerative racial power that are projected onto these diverse landscapes, Tseng’s photographs capture what Mitchell calls the “dreamwork” of settler colonialism. 36 By putting his alien excess into racial tension with the landscape, Tseng’s parody of early twentieth-century landscape art brings to light a romantic idealization of nature that, in the context of North America, is infused with eugenic ideologies of white racial regeneration. Evolving out of social Darwinist theory, eugenics emerged in the late nineteenth century and grew in the early decades of the twentieth century with the support of both conservatives and progressives. As Daniel Kevles explains, “The progressives and the conservatives found common ground in attributing phenomena such as crime, slums, prostitution, and alcoholism primarily to biology and in believing that biology might be used to eliminate these discordances of modern, urban, industrial society.” 37 According to Kevles, racial thinking “played a major part in American and Canadian versions of this [eugenic] creed,” 38 based on fears raised from the influx of non–Anglo Saxon immigrants and the social degeneracy those groups were associated with. The 1920s and early 1930s represented the apex in the eugenics movement, with the passage of numerous eugenics sterilization laws—particularly in California, British Columbia, and Alberta—which inordinately targeted racial minorities and immigrants. 39 While the scientific justification for eugenics had waned slightly after World War I, eugenics nevertheless persisted in institutionalized forms. Knowledge of eugenics’ false claims did not, as Mary Coutts and Pat McCarrick explain, “decrease the pressure for legislation, judicial action, or immigration controls.” 40 Indeed, immigration restrictions directed at Chinese migrants to the United States and Canada coincided with the intensification of eugenic ideology from the nineteenth century into the twentieth. After passage of the 1875 Page Act, which effectively restricted the entry of Chinese women for their presumed sexual immorality, the United States passed its first race-based federal immigration restriction through the Chinese Exclusion Act, which was in effect from 1882 to 1943. In 1885 the Canadian government passed its own race-based immigration restriction through the Chinese Head Tax, a tax designed to deter Chinese migrants from entering Canada. By the mid-1920s, both Canada and the United States had intensified and expanded earlier restrictions on Chinese migrants. In Canada these measures extended restrictions to other Asian migrants and further deterred Chinese immigration through the passage of the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which excluded most classes of Chinese migrants until 1947. The United States, having also broadened restrictions to encompass other Asian migrants, passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which intensified previous race-based restrictions through its exclusion of most Asian ethnic groups and foreigners who were deemed “biologically inferior.” 41 The persistence and growth of anti-Asian policy from the 1880s to the 1940s reflects what Erika Lee refers to as the “hemispheric Orientalism” that took hold along the West Coast of North America. 42 Despite their nationalist pretensions, Canada and the United States were bound by a shared commitment to preserving the transnational power and normativity of whiteness. As Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds put it, the “project of whiteness was a paradoxical politics, at once transnational in its inspiration and identifications but nationalist in its method and goals.” 43 Fears over the degeneration of Anglo-Saxon stock were present in the art world as well. The Canadian Group of Seven painters reflected these anxieties over the diminishing strength of the white Nordic race in their painting, believing that the Canadian landscape held “replenishing power” that could disinfect what one member called a “low receptive reservoir into which pours the chaos of ages, the mixed concord and discord of many varied peoples.” 44 Employing tropes associated with hygiene and mental health, they put forward a mission to “clean this reservoir . . . or we will remain a confused people.” 45 In the US context, Deborah Bright draws out the anticapitalist basis of Ansel Adams’s romanticism, noting that his early twentieth-century photographs represented a “mixture of Progressive Era phobias about industrialization and encroaching alien populations with an equally conservative nostalgia for the myth of preindustrial organic society.” 46 Fears of white race suicide also informed Gutzon Borglum’s vision of Mount Rushmore, a colossal-scale sculptural project that he began in 1924 and did not live to see completed seventeen years later. Expressing his fears of miscegenation, he once wrote, “Here we have in the filtering of Asiatic and North African blood [into Europe] the complete vitiating of the vigor and intellect of the civilization existing in these once pure European peoples.” 47 Thus romantic, regenerative, and preservationist motifs were infused in North American landscape art of the period and reflected deep anxieties over the racial “health” of the industrializing settler nation. And despite the absence of human or nonwhite representation in many of these works, my analysis of these landscapes heeds Martin Berger’s assessment that in North American art since the nineteenth century, “a decidedly racialized perspective animated even those cultural products most removed from racial concerns.” 48 The hyperbolic orientalism of Tseng’s persona in the Expeditionary Series confronts these defensive logics embedded in the romanticized colonial landscape in ways that denaturalize the abstract, universalizing, and absorptive power of its conventions. As such, Tseng’s photographs tap into the historicism of parody, which Linda Hutcheon defines as “an inscription of the past in the present [that] embod[ies] and bring[s] to life actual historical tensions.” 49 In Chinese drag, Tseng’s exaggerated performance “mimes and renders hyperbolic” a host of normative race, gendered, and sexual conventions that are literally and figuratively naturalized in the landscape. 50 As the alien, the dissonance between his body and the landscape delineates the racialized abstraction of Asians and their symbolic excess to national culture. The Chinese male body in North America was historically constituted as nonreproductive, perverse, and feminized, which was reinforced through legal and extralegal restrictions on interracial intimacies, restrictions on the immigration of Chinese women, and aggressive enclosure in the domestic labor market. Thus the alien sexuality Tseng elicits can also be seen as the product of a biopolitical landscape whose regenerative energy is directed at the degeneration and exclusion of alien bodies. Moreover, as a queer artist who referred to himself as a “snow queen” because of his preference for white men, 51 Tseng’s queer white desire—a desire for incorporation into a white landscape of artists and gay culture—creates a productive tension with the gender and sexual objectification of the Asian body. The conflicted relations and identifications that Tseng’s photography stages capture a mode of disidentification that negotiates “between desire, identification, and ideology.” 52 Disrupting an exceptionalist imagining of Canada or the United States as a concrete, pristine wilderness, Tseng’s photographs reframe the settler colonial landscape as a racial borderland of symbolic violence. With the exception of a handful of photographs taken in British Columbia, the main focus of Tseng’s Canadian landscapes is the Rocky Mountains of Banff National Park in Alberta. Established in 1885 as Canada’s first national park and modeled after Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Banff National Park is one of the most iconic wilderness symbols of Canadian national identity. In Rob Shields’s analysis of Banff’s nationalist symbolism, he suggests that “Banff can serve as a metaphor for the Canadian condition: the peremptory Canadian self of the present clings to an image of a European past (or an ideal future) and refuses to confront the violence and paradox of its own making.” 53 In short, Banff reflects the worldview of European settlers who modeled the area after nineteenth-century European spas and tourist retreats. The city itself is named for a country seat on the northeast coast of Scotland between Aberdeen and Inverness, a name indicative of the vast colonial respatialization of Native territory. Resignified and repackaged in an endless series of tourist photographs and postcards, Banff conveys the purity of nature that contrasts with the impurities associated with the urban environment. What is evacuated from Banff’s symbolic repository is the displacement of First Nations peoples as the region’s original inhabitants. Native voices have largely been silenced, while their identities have been appropriated as tourist commodities that serve to authenticate the “naturalness” of the environment. The birth of Canada’s first national park in 1885 also coincides with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the transcontinental railroad responsible for the park’s creation. 54 As discussed in the last chapter, construction of the railroad employed thousands of Chinese railroad workers recruited from the United States, who tunneled through the most treacherous sections of British Columbia’s Fraser Canyon. Only after the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed did a Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration persuade the Canadian government to take measures to restrict the entry of Chinese migrants. As noted earlier, the government responded by enacting its first race-based immigration restriction, the Chinese Head Tax, which required that Chinese migrants pay $50 to disembark in Canada. By 1903 this sum had climbed to $500. Hence the very conditions of possibility for Banff’s pristine environment depended on appropriating and eliminating Indigenous peoples and exploiting and excluding aliens. Here, as in other settler states, elimination and exclusion are two ways that settler colonialism cuts both ways. 55 Despite the fact that Banff National Park is located in the valley of the Bow River in the southern part of Alberta, Banff’s snowy alpine landscape nevertheless evokes Canada’s nationalist identification with the North. Shelagh Grant explains that conceptualizations of the Canadian North have been informed by both British and American romantic idealizations of nature in the nineteenth century: “British aesthetic myth blended with American wilderness myth to reinforce a Romantic image of north.” 56 An integral feature of Canada’s national identity—showcased no less in the first verse of the national anthem, “O Canada, our true North strong and free”—the North is nonetheless a moving construction that is articulated through representations ranging from the Canadian arctic to Banff’s alpine elevation. The unfixed character of the North is what Sherrill E. Grace calls “magnetic north,” a “north whose parameters seem always to be shifting.” 57 The development of Canada’s northern identity is often attributed to the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven artists. An artist collective that rose to national fame in the 1920s and was credited with producing the first “national” art, their landscapes set out to reflect what they saw as an authentic Canadian spirit that was not derivative of European or American art traditions. Manning explains that “while the landscape paintings of the Group of Seven do not create the type of nationalism that is based on an ideology of the land, they do play a role in supporting the myth of the ‘great white north.’” 58 Drawing on tropes of purity, rugged masculine strength, and individualism, Group of Seven founder and spokesperson Lawren Harris saw the North as a spiritual realm untouched by history, humanity, or capitalist modernity. Harris writes in “The Story of the Group of Seven” that “what I was groping toward [was] Canada painted in her own spirit,” 59 and he elaborates the connections between race, nation, and northernness in his essay “Revelation of Art in Canada”: We are in the fringe of the great North and its living whiteness, its loneliness and replenishment, its resignations and release, its call and answer—its cleansing rhythms. It seems that the top of the continent is the spiritual flow that will ever shed clarity into the growing race of America, and we Canadians being closest to this source seem destined to produce an art somewhat different from our Southern fellows—an art more spacious, of a greater living quiet, perhaps of a more certain conviction of eternal values. 60 Harris’s conceptualization of a North equipped with the spiritual powers that could “cleanse” the nation through an interplay of “living whiteness” and “loneliness and replenishment” is indicative of his racial anxieties of immigrants who contributed to “the growing race of America.” Moreover, crafting an exceptionalist narrative around Canada as the most northerly nation in the Americas, Harris attributes to Canada a primary role as spiritual compass and regenerative source for the continent. Tseng’s Rocky Mountain landscapes contain sly allusions to a romantic conceptualization of wilderness as a purifying and regenerative national symbol that the Group of Seven idealized. For instance, Tseng’s Seven Peaks, Alberta, Canada, 1986 (figure 2.2 ) references the phallic majesty of mountains, trees, and icebergs that dominate the Group’s paintings. 61 Commenting on the Group’s authority over the Canadian landscape, Manning remarks that “for many years the quintessential Canadian landscape painting was an image of an unpopulated wilderness, with Tom Thomson’s ancient pine tree or Lawren Harris’s icebergs at the forefront.” 62 The Group’s tendency to position these natural subjects—mountains, trees, and icebergs—as visual anchors in their paintings has been well documented as reflecting heavily gendered ideas of nature. Towering mountains and trees were associated with a heroic masculinity that exercised their superiority over the changing, ephemeral, and feminized qualities of water and wind. A case in point is Harris’s renowned painting Mt. Lefroy , which depicts a large snowcapped mountain that evokes qualities of nobility, imperviousness to change, and purity and expresses, Berger states, “a distinctly masculine aesthetic.” 63 In particular, Mt. Lefroy ’s peak seems to almost puncture the overhead clouds, while light ripples away from the site of entry—as if to illuminate the nobility of the peak’s act of penetration. The connotations of forced sexual penetration and feminized submission are intentional, Joan Murray explains, given that Harris “believed in expressing sexuality in symbolic terms, and in his Lake Superior and Rockies subjects, the use of such semi-symbolic sexual imagery (penal [sic ] mountains and vaginal clouds) [is] overt.” 64 In Mt. Lefroy , masculine virility constitutes the power of the mountain and its domination of the feminine ephemera that lie below and hover overhead. These anthropomorphic motifs are consistent with the Group of Seven’s broader symbolic language, in which mountains and trees represent white, heterosexual, and paternal resistance to what Robert Linsley calls “inundation from below, and submission to the powers above . . . like a spike that is meant to pin together a stable identity out of spiritual, social, and sexual experiences that are all by nature transitory.” 65 The sturdy tree or towering mountain therefore celebrates a virile masculine individualism that is in constant tension with threatening lower elements that allegorized the Group’s fears, widespread in the 1920s and 1930s, about racial and ethnic mixing and the corresponding degeneration of a white, Nordic race. 66 Some of the racial implications of the Group’s landscapes come into further relief in the way Tseng’s photographs echo Adams’s environmentalist photography. Originating in the late nineteenth century, the American environmentalist movement regained momentum after World War I and bore the imprint of escalating eugenicist thought. In particular, eugenic ideology fused wilderness protection with white racial preservation through analogies that linked the degradation of the natural environment with the degeneration of the white race through miscegenation and rising nonwhite populations. Alexandra Minna Stern explains that during the 1920s, efforts to save redwood trees in California served as a “metaphor for defending race purity and ensuring the survival of white America.” 67 Inspired by Sierra Club founder John Muir, Bright explains, Adams “se[t] out to produce a photographic version of the nature publicist’s writings” and played an immense role in constructing an environmentally focused vision of the American landscape. 68 Despite the progressive agenda attributed to Adams’s landscapes, Bright points out that “the rugged western wilderness [was] a locus for the sentiments of white, middle-class Americans around nationalistic and ethnocentric ideals [that] cannot be overlooked in any discussion of the development of environmentally concerned photography.” 69 As such, the grandeur of Adams’s landscapes, analogous to the Group of Seven’s, could provide spiritual reassurance of the durability of the white race, its ability to persevere in the face of lower castes. Stern explains that eugenicists “profoundly shaped California’s landscapes” and subscribed to the belief—reflected in Adams’ and the Group of Seven’s regenerative narratives about nature—that “exposure to nature” was a “method of containing the worst and actualizing the best of human’s evolutionary and hereditary predispositions.” 70 Exemplified in Monolith (figure 2.3 ), the mountains and trees featured in Adams’s photography stood for what many conservationists viewed as the “stateliness, grandeur, and perseverance—represent[ing] the ‘great race.’” 71 Discussing the way conservationists collapsed distinctions between the redwood and white America, Stern writes: “Like Anglo-Saxon America, which was being engulfed by hordes of defectives and mongrels and menaced by the excessive breeding of undesirables, the redwood was imperiled by ‘race suicide’ from rampant logging, urban encroachment, and human ignorance.” 72 While mobilizing against the expropriation and destruction of natural resources was certainly a worthwhile cause, romantic anticapitalism framed the struggle in racial terms. For both the Group of Seven and Adams, racial ideologies could be invisibly projected onto the impermeable mountains in Banff and at Yosemite. As a cultural practice, then, the landscape aestheticized defensive racial ideologies of white supremacy. Tseng’s Seven Peaks also plays with what Linsley describes as the “great freeze out of Canadian painting” in the 1920s, 73 referring to the Group of Seven’s emphasis on snow and ice, and exhibits an attention to lighting that recalls Adams’s compositional details. However, the inclusion of Tseng’s body displaces the anchoring image of Harris’s and Adams’s trees and mountains. If these anchoring images symbolically project the white masculine mastery over inferior forces, Tseng’s body fails to convey a sense of stability, permanence, or purity associated with the landscape. Unlike the imposing and phallic tree or mountain peak, Tseng neither dominates the surrounding landscape nor stands, to quote Linsley’s assessment of Harris’s natural imagery, as “a spike meant to pin together a stable identity.” 74 Contrasting the whiteness of his snow-filled environment, Tseng’s body highlights his dissonance with the landscape. His isolation does not suggest a rugged individualism in symbolic struggle with the surrounding elements; rather, it evokes the incongruity of his alien body against the overwhelming whiteness of the natural background. As an evolving sign of yellow peril, moreover, Tseng’s body exposes the eugenic logics of purity present in the early twentieth-century landscapes he references. As an index of the abstract, degenerative value of nonreproductive, alien sexualities, he highlights the eugenic spirit of white racial reproduction and regeneration projected onto the landscape. Finally, dwarfed by the massive mountain peaks in the background, Tseng animates the desire for what Albert Boime calls a commanding “magisterial gaze” over the landscape, “the perspective of the [North] American on the heights searching for new worlds to conquer.” 75 Although the tradition of North American landscape art promotes what Berger identifies as a “natural affirmation of white culture” through a decidedly white male gaze, 76 Tseng’s gaze is largely unreadable behind his mirrored glasses. The direction of his gaze only points back to the camera and ultimately to the viewer. In this reversal, Tseng’s photographs highlight the racial limits of the landscape’s regenerative symbolism in its reflection of white settler identification with an uncorrupted nature that exists outside the circuits of capitalism. FIGURE 2.3 Monolith , 1927. Photograph by Ansel Adams. © 2014 The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. Tseng’s photograph of Moraine Lake (figure 2.4 ) also makes references to the intersecting discourses of northernness and tourism that produce Alberta’s national parks. His deliberate or unintentional misidentification of Lake Moraine’s location in the Northwest Territories—way, way up north—humorously underscores the north ness of its more southern location in Banff National Park. Commodified by Rocky Mountain tourists who frequent the lake and rent canoes, the most literal commodification of the lake occurred when the Bank of Canada issued twenty-dollar bills featuring the lake on the reverse side of the 1969 and 1978 bills (figure 2.5 ). The scene on the bill that Tseng perfectly captures is known as the “Twenty-Dollar View.” Tseng’s recreation scene flaunts the irony at the core of the Group of Seven’s conceptualization of nature. His photograph demonstrates that, far from a space untouched by modernity where a pure white wilderness exists as a refuge from corrupting human influences, Moraine Lake represents instead the capitalist conversion of Indigenous territory into tourist sites. The high aestheticism of the mundane tourist snapshot also amplifies what Jody Berland refers to as a form of “staged authenticity,” a concept derived from Dean MacCannell’s work on the western tourist to “describe the ways in which diverse regional cultures produce themselves as touristic objects.” 77 Berland goes on to explain that “because tourists seek new experience through interaction with the other . . . they place themselves in contact with personalities and spaces that seem to represent the inside of another culture but which in fact are carefully staged to represent that inside to outsiders.” 78 Tseng adds another parodic layer to the notion of staged authenticity insofar as his photograph confuses the relation between tourist and other. He is both tourist and other. Playing with the various codes of “authenticity” that produce the tourist site, the tourist, and the alien other, he reduces the scene’s commodified grandeur to a stage that dramatizes the fetishization of the imagined colonial encounter.

On a more humorous note, Tseng’s pose, with oar raised in midstroke, also evokes the figure of the wilderness sportsman. The sportsman movement began in Canada in the late nineteenth century and promoted an ideology of the wilderness that, analogous to the burgeoning conservation movement, represented a domain of white masculine regeneration. As Lynda Jessup explains, nineteenth-century landscape paintings that depicted sportsmen coincided with the rise of sportsman clubs that aimed to “revitaliz[e] manhood” against what they perceived were the “degenerative, emasculating, effects of capitalist modernity.” 79 The sportsman was thus the antithesis of the Chinese “bachelor” of the exclusion period, who exemplified respective racial and sexual threats to white labor and white female bourgeois respectability. Pictured as an unlikely sportsman, Tseng further underscores his exclusion from the regenerative scripts associated with this wilderness genre of masculinity. In stark contrast to the leisure associated with the sportsman’s wilderness enterprise, labor defined the lives of early twentieth-century Chinese male immigrants. As discussed in the first chapter, the colonial management of Asian reproduction was largely accomplished through immigration restriction, antimiscegenation law, and segregation practices that produced “bachelor societies” in Canada and the United States. The constraints on Chinese masculinity amounted to what David Eng calls “racial castration,” the “psychic and the material limits circumscribing Asian American male subjectivity.” 80 However, in Tseng’s adaptation of the iconic nationalist scene, his parody highlights foremost the commodification of nature while prompting recognition of the white racial investment in regenerative narratives embedded in its mythology. FIGURE 2.5 Twenty-dollar Canadian bill, 1969–1979 Series, Scenes of Canada . Bank of Canada. As a multisensory medium that expresses cultural values, the landscape can be “found” in Banff National Park and Yosemite or, as Mitchell outlines, “put there by the physical transformation of a place.” 81 Examining the latter, I turn to one of Tseng’s US landscapes, Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 (figure 2.6 ), to demonstrate how Tseng’s intrusion onto the patently manufactured natural landscape also prompts an excavation of the racial logics embedded in the “shrine of democracy.” Mount Rushmore, South Dakota is in many ways exemplary of the Expeditionary Series title in its engagement with the heroic forefathers of the nation and the monument’s fearless creator, Gutzon Borglum. Four presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt—were carved into stone in a project that took seventeen years from inception to completion. As the presidents set their gaze on the westward frontier, Tseng’s body faces the presidents. What does he see? FIGURE 2.6 Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, 1986 .

Since its completion in 1941, Mount Rushmore has become such an embedded symbol of US nationalism that Cher once admitted to believing that the monument was a naturally occurring rock formation. 82 Even for those who recognize the transparent constructedness of the rock landscape, the monument nevertheless appeals to similar ideals of authenticity and purity present in the Group of Seven’s landscape paintings. Fears over the potential degeneration of a superior “Nordic” race that were projected onto the landscape reflected the transnational currency of alarmist race theories in white settler nations. Similar to the Group of Seven, whose trees and icy mountains can be interpreted as personified symbols of white paternalistic dominion over the Canadian nation, Mount Rushmore’s granite rock face brings this symbolism to a literal realm in its depiction of the nation’s heroic “forefathers.” Borglum’s rock, a medium that expresses both impermeability and permanence, shares with the Group’s paintings a reverence for nature’s strength, stability, and resistance to change. As Borglum wrote of his intentions for the memorial, “The purpose of the memorial is to communicate the founding, expansion, preservation, and unification of the United States.” 83 Interestingly, although the Group’s landscapes and Borglum’s mountain sculpture represent spaces of spiritual relief and separation from alienating bureaucratic structures and the economic determinism associated with the city, their artistic undertakings would have been impossible without substantial government funding. And, similar to the Group’s romantic pursuit of the true North, Borglum fashioned himself as a rugged explorer who “discovered” the site in the Black Hills. During the memorial’s formal dedication ceremony in 1925, he climbed the vertical face of the mountain and planted a flag on its peak. Boime explains that in this feat “Borglum was emulating [John C.] Frémont’s dramatic unfurling of the flag on the summit of the Rockies.” 84 Thus Borglum and his monument provided for Tseng a rich corpus of heroic, white, masculine, and colonial associations to emulate in his own Expeditionary Series . If the effect of the Group of Seven’s paintings was to naturalize conquest by erasing human involvement in the landscape, Borglum’s Mount Rushmore was an even more explicit homage to the ideology of Manifest Destiny. Boime observes that the monument “allegorizes the idea of Manifest Destiny” in that all four presidents had a role in the myth of divine territorial intervention. 85 These included Washington’s extensive surveying of the frontier; Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase; Lincoln’s transcontinental railroad; and Roosevelt’s role in the conquest of New Spain and construction of the Panama Canal, which provided an expedient water route to Pacific markets. In short, the monument exemplifies Mitchell’s suggestion that the “rise of landscape” is intimately connected with imperial expansion. 86 Similar to his parodic engagement with the Group of Seven, Tseng’s pose and manipulation of scale recalls a romantic tradition of landscape art that privileges a single perspective. Mount Rushmore’s participation in this tradition is rendered to the point of exaggeration, captured in the monument’s grandiose point of view. This perspective epitomizes what Boime refers to as a “magisterial aesthetics,” one that reinforces an “imperial point of view that is often expressed in American landscape painting of the nineteenth century and that remains deeply embedded in the national consciousness.” 87 In Mount Rushmore, South Dakota , the elevated perspective of the gigantic presidents’ faces symbolizes their authority over the land they govern, which is contrasted with Tseng’s subordinated and ambiguous perspective. Reversing the direction of their magisterial gaze, Tseng’s body is turned away from the viewer, and his concealed face points upward toward the four presidents. And unlike in the earlier East Meets West phase of Tseng’s series, where he often blew up the scale of his body to give the impression he was a Godzilla-esque figure threatening the various national icons he stood beside—such as the Statue of the Liberty or the Empire State Building—here Tseng’s body is dwarfed in the presence of Borglum’s homage to the nation’s forefathers. The pose Tseng adopts in this photograph brings to mind the Byronic hero, the lone romantic figure cast in relief against the natural landscape. A well-known example of these “magisterial aesthetics” is captured in a nineteenth-century piece called The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog (1818) by the German painter Caspar David Friedrich. Contained in Friedrich’s painting (figure 2.7 ) are the frequently recycled tropes of romanticism. For instance, the clouds and mountaintops intermingle in the painting to emphasize the inseparability of nature from the heavens above. At the center is the solitary traveler, who has climbed to a dangerous vantage point, his back turned to us so that the viewer can share his point of view and spiritual identification with the purity of nature. The mountains in this painting similarly evoke permanence and steadfastness. Joining earth and heaven, the intermingling craggy rocks and clouds convey both endurance and immortality. The anticapitalist subtext of this romantic vision is underscored by the wanderer’s traditional folk attire, which valorizes the cultural purity of folk life over the abstract degradations of capitalist modernity.

Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Tseng stands with his back to the viewer. However, he is standing so close that the monument loses its illusions of grandeur. Boime suggests that Mount Rushmore, “like the statue of liberty, . . . succeeds [only] through the impact of scale rather than aesthetic quality.” 88 From where Tseng stands, unable to appreciate the impact of scale, the monument cannot succeed. Using his body to emphasize distinctions of scale, Tseng also evokes Chinese landscape paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties. 89 The small scale of the human figures depicted in the paintings of these periods emphasizes the sanctuary offered by nature and the relative insignificance of human beings against an overpowering natural environment. Maxwell Hearn explains that the disintegration of the Tang dynasty was the main catalyst for the Romantic antidynastic retreat into nature: “Faced with the failure of the human order, learned men sought permanence within the natural world, retreating into the mountains to find a sanctuary from the chaos of dynastic collapse.” 90 Whether deliberate or not, the allusion to Chinese landscape painting in Tseng’s photograph is amusingly out of place at Mount Rushmore because it subverts, as Mitchell explains, “any claims for the uniquely modern or Western lineage of landscape.” 91 In particular, in the context of Mount Rushmore’s celebration of Manifest Destiny, the photograph’s connection to Chinese landscape painting further underscores the circuits of dynastic power and capital that give rise to imperial dimensions of landscape art. Through the parodic gaps between repetition and difference, Tseng’s photography brings to view the imperial dimensions of landscape art that are conditioned by the violent elimination of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of land resources. Toying with these elements of scale, Tseng dramatizes his insignificance in the face of these forefathers in a parody of heroic frontier masculinity. This parody underscores the cultural importance of frontier masculinity as a constitutive element of US national identity while emphasizing how Asian men literally fall short of its larger-than-life romanticization. As a queer Asian man, moreover, Tseng and his near invisibility underscore the multiple registers of his alienation: from constructions of white masculinity, from the whiteness of US gay male identity, and from patriarchal Asian American cultural nationalisms that reinforce a staunchly heterosexist “heroic” masculinity to combat anti-Asian racism. For instance, according to Frank Chin, Jeffery Paul Chan, Lawson Fusao Inada, and Shawn Hsu Wong of the Aiiieeeee! Collective, Asian American cultural politics must challenge the social and cultural emasculation of Asian American men by subverting stereotypes of the “good Chinese man . . . [as] the fulfillment of white male homosexual fantasy, literally kissing white ass.” 92 While Tseng assumes the guise of the explorer, however parodic, his contemplation of the four presidents might very well be read as “kissing white ass.” Thus, in Tseng’s disruption of cultural nationalist prescriptions, his physical inconsequentiality may suggest that a masculinist and heterosexist Asian American cultural nationalism falls short precisely because it further entrenches a cultural standard of white masculinity. At the same time, Tseng’s diminutiveness can also be read as a tacit acknowledgment of what Malini Johar Schueller calls “the gendered imperatives of Western imperialism and orientalism that have produced the stereotype of the effeminate Asian male.” 93 Refusing to adopt the “magisterial gaze” of the four presidents, Tseng turns his attention to the gaze itself and its presumed authority. He faces east rather than west, reversing the westward direction of the frontier that the presidents seem to be surveying. His eastward gaze counters the normative conventions of landscape that, as Patricia Nelson Limerick observes, “ran on an east-to-west track, following the physical and mental migrations of white English-speaking men.” 94 Most importantly, his eastward gaze demonstrates the fact that the westward movement of white settlers was only one small part of the process of “discovery.” A disoriented explorer, Tseng evokes the historical fact that for nonwhite immigrants, as they moved along the west–east axis of labor, internment, and other displacements, the landscape was not the simple, pure, virgin wilderness of the settler colonial imagination. Indeed, Chinese labor in North America offers a salient illustration of Raymond Williams’s remark that “a working country is hardly ever a landscape.” 95 The subtle lighting in the black-and-white photograph also has the effect of nearly disappearing Tseng. On the one hand, his invisibility underscores the illegibility of his queer Asian difference within the regenerative myths and expansionist ideologies that Mount Rushmore stands for. On the other hand, his disappearance allegorizes the repressed histories that are not etched in stone, most notably the history of the Sioux Nation: the Sioux campaigned vigorously against the monument, which was built on stolen land and commemorated the murder and dispossession of Indigenous peoples. As Boime points out, “Consistent with the pattern of destruction characteristic of national exploration and empire building, the creation and the dedication of the Mount Rushmore monument was one more symbol of the white man’s racist and intolerant Indian policy.” 96 The site of Mount Rushmore is between what is now Harney National Forest and Custer State Park, what Boime refers to as the “two most hated names in the Sioux lexicon” because of William S. Harney’s and George Armstrong Custer’s massacres of Sioux populations that led to illegal gold mining in the Black Hills. 97 The Black Hills, where Mount Rushmore is situated, houses the sacred site of Paha Sapa and is designated by the Sioux as a ceremonial place of prayer and meditation. The memorial was built despite the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which gave Dakota Indians exclusive rights to the Black Hills. Predictably, as soon as gold was discovered, white miners swiftly breached the treaty agreement to begin the illegal expropriation of natural resources and, in the case of Borglum, to blast 450,000 tons of granite from the face of the sacred Black Hills. This history underscores the contradictory logics of settler colonialism, which engages in the violent elimination and dispossession of Indigenous peoples and simultaneously expresses a desire to become Indigenous to the landscape, to naturalize settler colonialism through symbolic projection. Another history not etched into stone includes the many Chinese who worked in the Black Hills in what Liping Zhu calls the “largest Chinatown east of San Francisco from 1876 to 1910.” 98 Only since 2001, when extensive archaeological excavations of Deadwood’s Chinatown began, have widespread signs of Chinese life been revealed for examination. As Zhu notes, the gold rush brought thousands of Chinese miners to the western states, including South Dakota—although the population did not surpass 250 residents. Zhu explains that “as soon as the news spread of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer’s expedition finding gold in the mountains of western Dakota Territory, Chinese immigrants joined the last major gold rush in the nineteenth century, arriving in the Black Hills by the winter of 1875–1876.” 99 They were subject to labor exploitation and racial violence. Only recently have the Chinese, who played such an important role in this South Dakota borderland, emerged from historical repression into partial visibility, giving new meaning to the hazy outline of Tseng’s body at Mount Rushmore. But as Tseng’s suit nearly blends into the rock—suggesting that he is part of the rock—the Chinese of the Black Hills are also embedded in this borderland of invasion, dispossession, and ongoing political struggle. Like the Group of Seven, Borglum’s nationalist project was shaped by his own reactionary beliefs. Despite the rhetoric of democracy he invoked to characterize Mount Rushmore’s commemorative spirit, he was unambiguous about the perils of miscegenation. In particular, in addition to expansions in anti-immigration law, the period saw the rise in white supremacist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK ), an organization that had earlier commissioned Borglum to create a Confederate monument at Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia. His ties to the KKK were not insignificant. Borglum was an impassioned reader of Madison Grant’s Passing of the Great Race , a scaremongering, pseudoscientific treatise that “became a sacred text for eugenicists, the Klan, and proto-Nazis everywhere.” 100 Influenced by Grant’s treatise, Borglum also took to the page. In a 1923 letter to prominent Indianapolis Klansman David C. Stephenson, Borglum boasted, “I wrote 2500 to 3000 words on the evils of the alien races.” 101 In other letters to Stephenson in the early 1920s he also expressed a profound anti-Semitism in his fears of hypodescent through miscegenation, writing as follows: If you cross a thorough-bred with a jackass you get a mule. . . . The lowest race in civilization is the strongest physically and breeding (crossed) is always down. A Negro and a Jew will produce Negro, but Hindu and Jew—Jew; Chinese and Jew, offspring Jew; Italian and Jew, offspring Jew; and European race and Jew, offspring Jew. 102 As John Taliaferro notes, “He labeled immigrants ‘slippered assassins,’ . . . [and] warned that America was becoming an alien ‘scrap heap.’” 103 Even though Borglum opposed slavery, he blamed African slaves for the degeneration of the white race, writing that “it has been the character of the cargo that has eaten into the very moral fiber of our race character, rather than the moral depravity of Anglo-Saxon traders.” 104 His eugenic vision was also explicitly gendered. Boime explains that Borglum’s admiration of Benito Mussolini’s virile masculinity was in direct contrast to the effeminacy and weakness he associated with Jews. For these reasons he attempted to disassociate himself from stereotypes of the effete artist by engaging in rigorous physical activities such as rock climbing, boxing, and wrestling and crafting an aesthetic vision based on colossal forms. In this light, Tseng’s presence on the face of Mount Rushmore stages a confrontation with the manifest masculinity embedded in the shrine of democracy, a confrontation captured in his eastward gaze and richly evocative of the earlier title of the series, East Meets West . In sum, the degenerative excess signaled by Tseng’s abstract alien body powerfully underscores the romantic anticapitalism embedded in the settler colonial personification of the landscape as a concrete, racially pure, and masculine expression of a noncapitalist universe.

Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. Our Home and Native Landscape To conclude this chapter I turn to Jin-me Yoon’s 1996 photographic work Group of Sixty-Seven , which usefully complements Tseng’s parodic exposure of romantic anticapitalist ideology projected onto the nationalist landscape. Group of Sixty-Seven extends the focus on racial constructions of national landscape that first appeared in her 1991 Souvenirs of the Self postcard series, in which Yoon poses, much like Tseng, in front of familiar tourist sites in Banff National Park. Continuing her exploration of the interplay of race and landscape, Group of Sixty-Seven connects romantic anticapitalism with the fetishization of Indigenous identity and racializes Asians as a negative abstraction. Here Yoon incorporates the paintings of two iconic Canadian painters, Lawren Harris of the Group of Seven and Emily Carr, an artist deeply inspired by the Group of Seven’s nationalist vision who became renowned for her artistic interaction with Native populations in British Columbia. From the view of settler colonialism’s triangulation of settler, Native, and alien identities, Yoon’s work exemplifies how the Native and the Asian personify opposite sides of an antinomical view of capitalist relations, in which the concrete, noncapitalist dimension is Indigenous and the abstract representation of capitalist modernity is Asian. Group of Sixty-Seven (figure 2.8 ) consists of two gridlike panels, each panel containing sixty-seven photographs of Korean Canadians from Vancouver, British Columbia. On the left panel, they face away from us (figure 2.9 ), and on the right, they face us (figure 2.10 ). We can first observe the various layers of national citation in this piece. The title, Group of Sixty-Seven , makes an overt reference to the Group of Seven. The number “sixty-seven” in the title also cites Canadian confederation in 1867 and the elimination of national origins immigration quotas a hundred years later, in 1967—the crucial legal prerequisite for the appearance of many of the sixty-seven Korean Canadian faces featured in the piece. Adding another layer of citation to the Group of Seven artists, we note that behind the heads on the right panel is Lawren Harris’s Rocky Mountain painting Maligne Lake, Jasper Park . Building on Tseng’s references to the Group of Seven painters and their association of white male nationhood with landscape, Yoon’s work highlights the commodification of landscape in her use of repetition, recalling the seriality of Andy Warhol’s pop art.

Like Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroe portraits, Yoon’s piece similarly inverts high and low aestheticism and the values associated with originality and duplication. Her postmodern play of surface and depth presents a dramatic recontextualization of Harris’s Maligne Lake , which was considered the most influential painting in Toronto from the time it was painted in 1924 to 1930. 105 As one of the most celebrated nationalist works of art in Canada, art historian Dennis Reid describes Harris’s painting as a “tribute to the spiritualizing force of the country, an incentive to the spiritual capacity in us all.” 106 In keeping with his romantic views of a nation united under a spiritual conception of the North, Maligne Lake expresses a sense of control and order that defended against the turbulent social realities of the 1920s. This was a period of increasing industrialization, urbanization, and class struggle that fomented increasing antipathy toward racialized aliens, particularly Chinese labor migrants, who were subject to the Chinese Head Tax and would face exclusion through passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act. Thus the “rise of landscape” 107 and escape into a primordial, frozen wilderness in this context can be attributed to an increasing sense of chaos spurred by modernity. By invoking Harris and the Group of Seven so explicitly in this piece, Yoon invites the viewer to explore the intersection of race and romantic anticapitalism in the Group of Seven’s artwork, particularly in the racial and spatial depiction of Canada’s national identity constructed around the idea of the “Great White North.” More confrontationally, Yoon prompts the viewer to consider the relationship between these Korean faces and the essence of Nordic purity celebrated in the Group’s depiction of the landscape. By photographing sixty-seven Korean faces in front of Harris’s painted landscape, Yoon imposes what Hutcheon calls “an external order upon a work that is presumed to be original.” 108 However, Yoon manipulates the line between the authenticity of the original by repeating Harris’s landscape sixty-seven times. In terms of the dissonant media presented in the work, Yoon emphasizes the modernity of the Korean faces through her use of photography—a medium whose infinite capacity for reproduction represents an antithesis to notions of artistic originality contained in Harris’s piece. In doing so, Yoon allegorizes the way Korean Canadian bodies become racial signifiers of the abstract dimension of capitalist modernity and, alternatively, how the painted landscape becomes a signifier of the concrete dimension of nature, purity, and originality. But Yoon ultimately frustrates a view of the abstract homogeneity associated with Asians by emphasizing the gender and generational diversity of her Korean Canadian subjects against a Maligne Lake that is here reduced to “background,” its unoriginality reinforced again by Yoon’s repetition of the image. In a twist on the visual codes of the tourist snapshot, what is “real” about the photograph are the Korean faces, emphasizing both the commodification of landscape as tourist scene and its artificiality. The jarring superimposition of Asian faces onto the constructed landscape also serves as an invitation to consider why Asians have or have not been incorporated into the dominant social and cultural landscape in Canada. While Maligne Lake is celebrated as a timeless and noncontradictory representation of Canadian nationalism, it is interesting to note that it was completed one year after the passage of the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act, in a period that saw the rise in organized anti-Asian labor agitation and the continual revision of anti-Asian legislation. What Yoon’s piece suggests, then, is that romantic expressions of Canadian nationalism that are conveyed as pastoral retreat must be read as inseparable from a history of yellow peril and anti-immigrant sentiment. If we shift to a more contemporary context, Yoon’s faces comment on the xenophobic responses to ways recent Asian immigration has redrawn the racial landscape in large urban cities such as Vancouver. Indeed, the public outcry against Hong Kong immigrant “monster houses” in Vancouver’s historically white Shaughnessy and Kerrisdale neighborhoods is one example of how the influx of Asian residential settlement outside the spatial and class confines of segregated Chinatowns reflects, as geographer Katharyne Mitchell observes, “anxiety about the loss of both economic and symbolic control over the defining and marking of place.” 109 Thus the images of these unsmiling faces blocking our view of the aestheticized landscape suggest that these faces are always in excess of nationalist constructions of landscape. By superimposing these faces onto Harris’s painting in a gridlike parody of Canada’s so-called multicultural “mosaic,” Yoon suggests that we can draw no unifying, ideological comfort from the retreat into landscape. FIGURE 2.11 Emily Carr, Old Time, Coast Village , 1929–1930. Oil on canvas, 91.3 × 128.7 cm. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Emily Carr Trust. Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. The left panel of Yoon’s Group of Sixty-Seven offers a related parody of the national landscape by emphasizing the romanticization of Indigenous themes. This panel draws on a painting titled Old Time, Coast Village (figure 2.11 ) by British Columbia painter Emily Carr—an iconic figure in her own right. Emily Carr’s association with the Group of Seven was established in 1927 when she was invited by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa to participate in an exhibition of West Coast painting. There she met Lawren Harris, whose praise for the Native themes in her art and subsequent years of encouragement became a key motivator for the artistic and literary projects she undertook, including her Governor General award-winning autobiography, Klee Wyck , recounting her experiences with Pacific Coast First Nations communities. The book’s title is based on the nickname given to her by the Tlingit Nation—an Indigenous people she strongly identified with—which translates to “the laughing one.” 110 In a revealing journal entry about the 1927 exhibition, Carr notes proudly, “I felt my work looked dead and dull, but they [Group of Seven] all say I have more of the spirit of the Indian than the others.” 111 Not only for Carr, who identified with the First Nations to the point that she imagined herself an Indian, the merit of her own work was judged on its capacity to reflect Native spirituality and cultural vision. Because she was a female artist and assumed to be lesbian, the First Nations themes Carr drew out in her work, which included reproducing their art forms in her own art practice, are often lauded as exemplary of her anticonformism, which challenged patriarchal and heteronormative gender scripts. Carr traveled alone to Native communities in British Columbia, such as the coastal Haida, Tsmishian, and Tlingit Nations, and began to feature their totem poles in her paintings. In her pursuit of a Native vision, Carr exemplified the role of the romantic hero—but as a woman. Her attraction to First Nations cultures was clearly based on romanticized notions of the “noble savage,” who she believed existed in a vanishing state of purity in nature. Art historian Dorothy Shadbolt attests to this belief, explaining that Carr “intuitively grasped the sense in which Indian art was an expression of the native’s relation to the natural and supernatural world as he understood it.” 112 In figure 2.9 we can observe the proximity Carr observed in the relation between First Nations and “real” nature. In particular, the light-colored totem poles at the center of the piece echo the brown trees in the background, suggesting the indistinguishable features of First Nations culture and nature. From an antinomical view of capitalist social relations, First Nations culture comes to express concrete nature, purity, and originality against the abstract, antinatural oppressions of capitalist modernity. But what complicates Carr’s romanticization of First Nations culture here is the overwhelming foliage that drapes the village in a heavy, molten green and serves as protective cover. The trees in the foreground appear human in form, leaning toward the village in cautious observance. Recalling Alexandra Minna Stern’s examination of the racial undertones of early twentieth-century conservationism and wilderness protection, Carr’s painting betrays not only an ideology of romantic anticapitalism at the core of the settler colonial retreat into nature, but also a suffocating management and control of First Nations cultures. Thus her desire to “go Native” was ultimately more revealing of a defensive investment in whiteness than a respect for Indigenous sovereignty and land claims. More extreme than the Group of Seven’s northern retreat from social and political upheavals of the 1920s that marked life in urban centers, Carr’s psychological withdrawal from urbanization manifested itself in illnesses, to the extent that it appeared she was allergic to the city—an ailment Reid refers to as the “‘city disease’ that was to attack [Carr] whenever she settled in a metropolis.” 113 Her loathing of the city, coupled with her idealization of and identification with First Nations culture and appropriation of their art, exemplifies Shari Huhndorf’s description of “going Native” as an appropriation of the identity, images, culture, or practices of Indigenous peoples. A settler colonial logic that finds equal expression in Canada as in the United States, she explains that going Native “reinforces the racial hierarchies it claims to destabilize”: 114 Over the last century, going native has become a cherished American tradition, an important—even necessary—means of defining European American identities and histories. In its various forms, going native articulates and attempts to resolve widespread ambivalence about modernity as well as anxieties about the terrible violence marking the nation’s origins. 115 From this perspective we can reread Carr’s gender transgressions as symptomatic of her own white colonial identity crisis, one she attempted to resolve by appropriating and identifying herself with a First Nations identity. While Carr may have viewed going Native as simultaneously anticapitalist in shunning modernity’s spoils and ruins alike, antiracial in her idealization of the coastal First Nations communities onto which she imposed herself, and gender-bending in her adoption of the persona of the lonely romantic genius, she actually reinforced rather than dismantled these structures. In particular, rather than challenging capitalism, Carr’s journey to remove herself from the toxic industrial and immigrant-filled environment of the city to find personal and artistic inspiration in Native cultures reinforces capitalism’s main values. As Huhndorf explains, “The fixation on self-discovery and self-healing articulate the very Western ideologies of bourgeois individualism.” 116 Because her oeuvre relied on the appropriation of First Nations art practice, her relationship with First Nations cultures was largely economic insofar as she profited immensely from appropriating their cultural practices. Finally, Carr’s idealization of the naturalness of the “noble savages” of the Pacific coast was contradicted by her antipathy toward the large urban population of Songhees who lived in her hometown of Victoria. As Janice Stewart explains, Carr’s view of the Songhees was in keeping with prevailing ideas at the time: they were seen as “‘lazy, gambling, drunks’ who were ‘a nuisance and trouble to the authorities’ as ‘individuals warranting charity.’” 117 The practice of either idealizing Native peoples as noble savages or denigrating them as inferior and requiring colonial management ultimately performs the same ideological work. On one hand, the romanticization of Native cultures functions to distance North Americans from their European settler roots, thereby displacing responsibility for the conquest and dispossession of the First Nations. 118 It also reinforces racial hierarchies when settlers identify and imagine themselves as “super-Indian” and therefore the rightful inheritors of the land and its resources. On the other, the denigration of Native communities naturalizes European dominance and its ideologies of western progress. It rationalizes the colonization of Indigenous peoples and expropriation of their resources through suggestions that Natives cannot “accept” modernity and civilization. Last but not least, while Carr’s adoption of the Tlingit name Klee Wyck can be read as a rejection of Victorian notions of womanhood and the rigid organization of her father’s house; as Stewart observes, “For most of her life, Carr turned to masculine authorities . . . for final judgment of her work rather than to her circle of reading ladies or other women artists.” 119 As an artist who rose to iconic fame in the 1930s, after the Group of Seven disbanded, by extending their project of defining a distinctively Canadian art, Carr’s persona reveals a problematic desire to escape from a social world marked by social upheavals, anti-immigrant sentiment, and industrialization, and a colonial desire to possess First Nations culture to promote the authenticity of her “Canadian” art. If spiritual replenishment for the nation did not spring from the “true North strong and free,” as the Group believed, then according to Carr, “our home and Native land” 120 became a national symbol of cultural purity and wholeness. Yoon’s engagement with Carr in the left panel must therefore be read as an engagement with Carr’s autochthonophilia and appropriation of First Nations cultural identity. The way Yoon’s work performs a disidentification of Carr’s painting is registered on multiple levels. If we focus on the way the Korean Canadian heads are turned away from the viewer, we can interpret this “faceless” gesture as a disidentification with the ethnographic gaze embedded in Carr’s painting, a gaze that appropriates the Native other for artistic legitimacy and produces art that becomes a romantic index to a defensive settler colonial identity. But at another level, they stage a disidentificatory encounter for the settler looking in. Given that these Korean heads block the view of the village, they foreclose a settler desire to identify with the Native landscape, whose commodification is reinforced through the repetition of Carr’s painting. A further irony embedded in this panel is that not only do Yoon’s Korean Canadian subjects block an identification with the landscape, but the blackness of the back-turned heads also allegorize the inability of settler culture to “identify” Asians as anything but abstractly homogeneous—as unidentifiable as the black hair in each frame. Adding, then, to the degenerative excess that Tseng’s body performs in the romanticized landscape, here Yoon suggests that Asian bodies are an alien antithesis of settler colonialism’s indigenizing desire. In short, by viewing capitalism as an antinomy of abstract and concrete dimensions, Asians are as unnatural to the landscape as Indigenous peoples are natural. This is the double edge of settler colonialism. Conclusion In Tseng’s and Yoon’s disidentification with iconic landscapes of North America, their photographs present, to quote Hutcheon again, “inscription[s] of the past in the present [that] embody and bring to life actual historical tensions” and prompt us to delve into the genealogy of landscape art of the early twentieth century. 121 Disidentifying with a shifting set of clichés and stereotypes associated with Asian North Americans and the landscape while preserving the aesthetic beauty of the latter tradition, their photographs use landscape “as raw material for representing a disempowered politics or positionality that has been rendered unthinkable by the dominant culture.” 122 Indeed, the alien presence of Asian bodies set against these landscapes foregrounds messy intersections of race science, white nativism, and settler nationalism projected onto the landscape. For Tseng, his parodic repetition of early twentieth-century landscape conventions associated with the Group of Seven’s, Adams’s, and Borglum’s landscapes brings forth the eugenic ideology that conveyed a white, masculine, and paternalistic identification with mountains and trees. Despite conservationists’ progressive environmental agenda, their efforts were often intertwined with a eugenic agenda that opposed the degeneration of the white race by alien races. Juxtaposed with Tseng’s alien excess, their projection of virility and obstinate resistance to change onto a mountainous and tree-filled landscape expresses the contradictory way that racist ideology formed a key subtext of so-called progressive, anticapitalist visions of national unity, conservation, and democracy. In a complementary manner, Yoon draws out the indigenizing dimension of romantic anticapitalism that collapse Native cultures into an unchanging natural purity and authenticity. She also builds on Tseng’s evocation of the degenerative excess signified by Asian bodies to exemplify the abstractness and unnaturalness of the Asian body against the landscape. From the period of railroad labor discussed in the last chapter to Asian immigrant exclusion in this chapter, the perverse abstraction associated with Chinese labor had by the 1920s and 1930s been supplanted by the settler retreat into the aestheticized landscape, whose unnatural antithesis is the Asian alien. Despite the romantic tribute to national culture embedded in landscape art of the early twentieth century, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographic countermemories suggest that such a “progressive” vision of national culture was “born in the apprehension of imminent loss,” as Lake and Reynolds indicate, and part of the anxious growth of “whiteness as a transnational mode of racial identification in settler societies.” 123 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, territorial symbols of regenerative whiteness expressed the proprietorial dimension of British settler colonialism and became, over time, synonymous with whiteness. As W. E. B. Du Bois observed succinctly on the whiteness of territorial expansion, “Whiteness is the ownership of the earth forever and ever, Amen.” 124 Finally, in the spirit of Kingston’s and Fung’s reimagining of abstract labor as History 2, the potential of Tseng’s and Yoon’s parody is not in articulating a more ideal landscape of normative inclusion to symbolize the self-identity of the settler nation. Rather, by queering the aestheticized landscape, Tseng’s alien difference animates the contradictions, exclusions, and violent eliminations of settler colonialism that the landscape, as aesthetic object, fetishizes and naturalizes. Similarly, Yoon’s iteration of the interrupted landscape lays bare the fetishized commodity function of the landscape. It is from the ambivalence of the parodic gaps between Tseng’s and Yoon’s difference to the landscape that their photographs allegorize a state of nonequivalence. Nonequivalence, as Chandan Reddy explains, represents subjects “who are not ‘unified’ by a prior identity.” 125 Disidentifying with the white regenerative ideal projected onto the romantic landscape, Tseng’s and Yoon’s photographs interrupt and denaturalize the mundane iteration of its symbolic violence. Following from the first chapter’s examination of the perverse temporality of abstract labor and this chapter’s focus on antinatural landscapes during a converging period of anti-Asian immigration restriction in North America, the next chapter moves forward to the internment of Japanese North Americans. If Asian North American cultural producers have thus far exposed and recircuited the abstract and unnatural signifiers attached to Asian bodies, what might a transnational approach to Japanese internment narratives expose as internment’s governing logics? Continuing my exploration of Asian racialization as a fetishistic alignment with the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, I track the evolution of romantic anticapitalism and its antinomical view of concrete and abstract dimensions of capitalism. Probing Asian North American representations of labor and landscape in chapter 3 , I demonstrate how Joy Kogawa’s Obasan and Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory reflect how the perverse abstraction of Asian labor takes on mechanical, nonhuman representation that must be eradicated from West Coast agriculture and fishing industries. However, through the process of labor resignification established through symbolic proximity with Indigeneity, Japanese North Americans emerge renaturalized and recorporealized as surplus labor.",

      "content": "CHAPTER 3 JAPANESE INTERNMENT AND THE MUTATION OF LABOR The only tree here is dead. —Joy Kogawa, Obasan Underworlds Paradox defined the late Ruth Asawa in life and art. Born into a poor Japanese farming family in Norwalk, California, in 1926, relocated in February 1942 to Santa Anita Racetrack and later interned at Rohwer Relocation Center, she was by 1946 an unlikely art student at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. When she emerged on the art scene in the mid-1950s, Asawa and her art were, perhaps inevitably, viewed through the prism of race and gender stereotypes. Critics were intent on either casting her sculptures as typically “Oriental” or dismissing them as decorative, feminine craft rather than modernist sculpture. 1 Because of their lack of grandiosity (in stark contrast to Gutzon Borglum’s colossal sculpture examined in the last chapter), Asawa’s sculptures were interpreted as insubstantial and thus feminine. Unlike the scale and orientation of Mount Rushmore, most of her sculptures are hanging or lie on the floor. In a telling review of her work in 1956, art critic Eleanor Munro contrasts her sculptures to the monumental and masculine qualities we could easily associate with Borglum: FIGURE 3.1 Ruth Asawa, Untitled , ca. 1960–1965. Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. © Ruth Asawa. These are “domestic” sculptures in a feminine, handiwork mode—small and light and unobtrusive for home decoration, not meant, as is much contemporary sculpture, to be hoisted by cranes, carted by vans and installed on mountainsides. 2 At a time when modernist aesthetics were defined through heroic, masculine traits, such as welding and cutting iron, 3 her innovative technique of weaving and tying industrial wire into shapes required viewers to engage with contradictory modalities of hardness and softness, heaviness and weightlessness, and movement and suspension. Asawa would eventually gain recognition for expanding the boundaries of sculpture by bringing visibility to the power of what she referred to as “negative space,” 4 the tension produced by the space inside and surrounding the materiality of the sculpture. In Asawa’s work, this negative space functions as an invisible force field that defines and directs the flow of energy. For the purposes of this chapter, Asawa’s work offers a visual metaphor for the negative space within and surrounding Japanese internment in North America. In particular, her tied-wire sculptures (figure 3.1 ) present a contextual frame for this chapter’s continuing focus on romantic anticapitalism. In her art practice Asawa was intent on exploring the limits of duality, making a “shape that was inside and outside at the same time . . . [something] that continually reverses itself.” 5 Her tied-wire sculptures’ continual inversions and reversals offer a visual motif of dialectical process—in stark contrast to romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical view of capitalist social relations as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions, between universalism and particularism. As I will develop in this chapter, this antinomical view led to an association of Japanese labor with the creation of unnatural value. Fusing the natural and the unnatural, Asawa’s sculptures hang from the ceiling as clusters of branches, bringing to mind a tree growing downward. As John Yau observes, “There is the forceful suggestion of an inverted world , reinforced by the downward pointing branching shadows cast on the wall.” 6 Reversing the properties of the trees depicted in the last chapter—the sturdy hang tree of Gonzales-Day’s photograph or anchoring trees of the Group of Seven’s paintings—this tree’s branches grow ever thinner and more delicate into fine needles. The fragility of the needles is paradoxically suggestive of both regeneration and evanescence. Yau points out the haunting effect of the shadows cast by the sculpture against the gallery wall: “The shadows branch down the nearby walls, conveying a ghostly domain in which everything is in reverse.” 7 Gravity, too, whose invisible, abstract force compels her forest of tied-wire trees upsidedown, captures the downward pull of mortality. The sculpture ultimately suspends the duality of the material and immaterial worlds, showcasing the interplay of wire, space, and shadow—whose impact is achieved by what is concretely visible and invisible, abstract. Encapsulating the human activity of tying wire with the abstract representation of natural forms, Asawa transcends personal biography while evoking those “things that your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” As such, her work offers an allegory of the dialectics of Japanese internment expressed in forms that are both figurative and nonfigurative. If Asawa’s inverted forest suggests an underworld where the immaterial but objective laws of gravity collapse into the concrete materiality of form, the works by Joy Kogawa and Rea Tajiri that I examine in this chapter extend this vision into both the concrete and affective dimensions of Japanese internment. Unlike the romantic landscapes of the last chapter, onto which a eugenic “natural” white settler identity could be projected, this chapter focuses on its unnatural, negatively abstract counterpart. In this sense, Asawa’s art’s abstract qualities also serve to capture aspects of Japanese internment in North America that defy concrete representational form, elements that contribute to the way Japanese internment can never be fully compartmentalized in the past. If Asawa’s upside-down tree serves as an unnatural marker of those “things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind,” its gravitational pull also suggests the weight of psychic excess. For Kogawa and Tajiri, the nightmares, visions, and complex identifications similarly constitute the haunting excess of Japanese internment, of a world mysteriously turned over. Attending to the competing theories that attribute Japanese internment to economic and/or racial causes, I probe the affective registers of Japanese internment—its negative space—whose insights exceed the empiricism of national historiography. In my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s shifting modes of cross-racial identification, first with Jewish and then Native intersections, I suggest that the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians to internment sites was motivated by a perception of the excessive industry of Japanese labor. This excessive efficiency was associated with having control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. Both texts offer a complementary view of this racialization expressed through modes of identification with Jewish peoples under Nazi persecution, animating a corresponding condition of destructive economic abstraction. After West Coast expulsion and relocation, however, Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value is neutralized as both texts turn to Japanese-Native intersections. Unlike the destructive economism associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents the romantic anticapitalist ideal of organic purity and concrete nature external to economic modernity. Thus Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts’ evoke how the brutality of relocation, internment, and labor exploitation function paradoxically to indigenize Japanese North Americans as surplus labor through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism. My reading focuses on how Kogawa and Tajiri evoke this transformation in the way they denaturalize the settler landscape in relation to labor. Japanese Internment as Irrationality and Postmemory In both Canada and the United States, the motivation and objective of expulsion have never been completely clear. Historians agree that Japanese expulsion from the West Coast was not, contrary to the rationale given in 1942, due to military necessity—or, by extension, Pearl Harbor. In Canada, Army and Navy leaders, in addition to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, opposed mass expulsion. 8 Although US Navy chiefs were hostile to Japanese Americans, the army’s General Staff opposed wholesale removal and argued that the chances of Japanese invasion were negligible. Moreover, the army’s intelligence unit and the FBI concurred that there had been no Japanese American sabotage during or after the Pearl Harbor attack. 9 The fact that most Japanese civilians in Hawaii were not interned speaks to the lack of credible threat posed by Japanese Americans. Ultimately, as Greg Robinson observes, “the ‘security’ sought by the West Coast could not be resolved by ordinary means because it did not depend on meeting and neutralizing actual threats.” 10 If not a military threat, whatever security these governments pursued meant that the label of “enemy alien” would be applied to small children, including those removed from orphanages, and, in the United States, individuals with one-sixteenth Japanese blood. What, then, was the threatening content of Japaneseness that would necessitate such an expansive and meticulous removal project? Beyond the Pearl Harbor thesis, Japanese internment has also been viewed as a continuation of exclusionary anti-Asian racism that began in the nineteenth century, first targeting Chinese migrants through immigration laws and then extended to other Asian ethnic groups. However, this explanation does not identify what elements of immigrant restriction functioned as antecedents to the qualitative specificity of dispossession, relocation, and confinement that are particular to the Japanese experience on the West Coast of North America. As a result, Colleen Lye points out, “the reliance on racism to explain a historical causation often leads to a dehistorization of racism.” 11 In other words, while we are aware of racial dynamics that are clearly in play, it is unclear how anti-Japaneseness extends or exceeds the logics of prior anti-Asian racism. Lye describes this as a failure to grasp “both the racial logic of internment and its historical specificity.” 12 It remains ambiguous what kind of racial animus was mobilized leading up to such catastrophic policy decisions of 1942, which have retrospectively been viewed as an aberration of western democratic principles. Economic theories of Japanese internment, in contrast, stress its rationality from the standpoint of white capitalists who stood to benefit from Japanese dispossession. Here Japanese internment is thought to have been engineered by influential economic stakeholders who stood to gain from the elimination of competition from Japanese labor and businesses. According to Gary Okihiro and David Drummond’s materialist theory of anti–Japanese American exploitation, immigration restriction was a precursor to Japanese internment. They argue that the anti-Asian racism from 1900 to the Immigration Act of 1924—which introduced a national origins quota system and effectively halted all Asian immigration—was based on the extraction of surplus-value from migrant labor exploitation. This was followed by a second period from 1924 to 1942, characterized by a model of internal colonialism in which value was extracted from racial rent premiums. 13 These premiums were tied to the passage of the Alien Land Law in California in 1913, which restricted property ownership and transfer to “citizens,” thus barring the Issei, who were “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” Okihiro and Drummond argue that “the alien land laws served to maintain Japanese tenancy and thus their economic dependence.” 14 They suggest that the crisis presented by Pearl Harbor enabled a “return to exclusionism and offered an opportunity for immediate profit and the expulsion of the Japanese from the level of farm operators.” 15 What remains unclear from Okihiro and Drummond’s periodization of anti-Asian racism is why one mode of economic exploitation was supplanted by the other. As Lye asks, “If mass removal and internal colonialism both share the principal aim of economic gain, what explains the priority of ‘quick profits’ over the long-term attractions of systemic dependency at one moment compared to another?” 16 Because the long-term profitability of rent premiums would greatly exceed the returns on mass removal, the economic motivation for Japanese internment becomes less clear. Further distorting the economic rationale of the Alien Land Laws, these laws led not to the contraction but to the expansion of Japanese farm acreage, which doubled between 1910 and 1920. 17 This blurs the precise objective of the Alien Land Laws, though the looming intersection of racialized dispossession and white property is undeniable. Revising Okihiro and Drummond’s theory, I argue that it is racism’s economic irrationality rather than rationality that forms the central medium of anti-Japanese feeling. This economic irrationality is crucially tied to the fundamental misreading of capitalism that I’ve been tracking in this book, one that nevertheless projects the economic benefit of racist policy without being actualized. From an expanded North American perspective, the economic irrationality of anti-Japanese sentiment was also visible in the 1920s in Canada, particularly in the fishing industry. 18 As Ken Adachi explains, in the 1920s the Department of Marine Fisheries attempted to take measures to eliminate Japanese Canadian competition in the British Columbia fishing industry, “gradually eliminat[ing] Orientals from the fishery” by reducing the number of licenses issued to them. 19 The denial of fishing licenses to Japanese Canadians was, analogous to US Alien Land Laws, not necessarily effective, and the negative effects stemming from the loss of Japanese canners and fishermen from the industry once again complicate a clear profit motivation. 20 As Masako Fukawa notes, “When rigidly enforced, the license reductions had a negative impact on the existing fishing industry” because there were not enough white fishermen to take the place of Japanese fishermen. 21 The reductions also created hardships for white fishermen who profited from Japanese launching and tugging services. Moreover, the Japanese who were pushed out of fishing were able to successfully adapt to other industries, such as small-scale berry farming and forestry. Thus, as an editor of the Vancouver Province noted of the Japanese in 1930, “We have hunted the Orientals out of the fishing industry and they have gone to the woods and they have gone to the farms. . . . We haven’t diminished their numbers; we have simply pushed them about.” 22 While the economic benefits for whites of Japanese exclusion from agriculture and fishing before Pearl Harbor were not always straightforward, the economic opportunities Japanese internment produced for whites in both farming and fishing industries was more transparent. When used to view the forced sale of Japanese Canadians private property, David Harvey’s translation of Marx’s concept of primitive accumulation as “accumulation by dispossession” seems particularly apt. Indeed, for sympathetic whites who protested the forced sales, such property dispossession recalled the Nazi’s confiscation of Jewish property under the Nuremberg Laws. 23 What this economic history shows, however, is how anti-Japanese agitation both subverted and supported white labor interests. Building on arguments in previous chapters, the mixed economic legacy of Japanese expulsion from the West Coast is shaped by the interplay of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism and the destructive abstraction embodied by Japanese labor. From the fundamental misperception at the heart of romantic anticapitalism, ridding the West of Japanese labor was necessary to prevent economic destruction rather than to profit from their disappearance. Within this book’s larger argument that the abstract forces within capitalism are biologized as Asian , this chapter probes how the destructively abstract content of Japaneseness mutates after the mass expulsion of Japanese civilians from the West Coast. Following the previous chapters’ focus on Asian labor as perverse and antinatural signifiers of abstract labor, I focus on the way Japanese labor transforms in this period from a dehumanizing symbol of modernization into an ideal surplus labor force. This mutation in the meaning of Japanese labor was shaped by the upheavals caused by technological modernization. From the Great Depression through the post–World War II era, modernization had profound effects on labor, urbanization, and domesticity. Since the 1920s, agriculture and fishing industries where Japanese labor was concentrated were transformed by new technologies, such as gas-powered plows and early sonar, 24 innovations that were accompanied by these industries’ steady consolidation into corporate monopolies. 25 Population booms in California and Vancouver led to rapid urbanization and suburbanization, giving the West Coast a distinctly “modern” identity. “Midcentury modernism” was the retrospective name given to the aesthetic, architectural, and cultural revolution that accompanied these rapid changes, reflecting a movement away from ornate traditional styles and toward the heightened rationalism of clean lines, functionality, and simplicity. As Andrew Shanken observes, technology was seen a “civilizing force” whereby “better living” became synonymous with modern homes equipped with lighting, electric appliances, and other efficiencies. 26 But the dark side of the fetishization of technological convenience, speed, and mobility was the reconstitution of labor power, environmental change, and a recalibration of the social order. And embedded in this culture of rapid modernization were deeply felt anxieties about social and economic displacement, a breeding ground for romantic anticapitalism. 27 In this state of anxiety and unpredictability comes renewed attention on the evils of abstraction and the glory of nature, purity, and the concrete. Counterintuitively, the machine—the key agent of modernization—was often anthropomorphized and fetishized as “anticapitalist.” As Postone explains, the “positive emphasis on ‘nature,’ on blood, the soil, concrete labor, and Gemeinschaft , can easily go hand in hand with a glorification of technology and industrial capital.” 28 Therefore, it was not simply the identification of Japanese labor with mechanization that becomes the target of romantic anticapitalism but, as I will develop later, an association of Japanese labor efficiency with the creation of unnatural value that is symptomatic of the destructive consequences of modernization. Evolving from a prior racialization as perverse and unnatural signs of abstract labor in the period leading up to mass removal, Japaneseness became the specter of dehumanization against a world of “better living.” However, in the war’s aftermath, Japanese labor was increasingly praised, helping to give rise to the model minority myth. This suggests a profound resignification of Asian labor during Japanese relocation and internment, from being associated with a dangerous efficiency before the war to a commendable productivity after it. As my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts demonstrates, this resignification turns on the symbolic alignment of Japaneseness with the destructive economism of Jewishness before the war, transforming into an association with a romanticized noneconomism of Indigeneity after relocation and internment. Unlike the negative economic abstraction associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents a sphere external to capitalism, symbolizing romantic anticapitalism’s ideal of concrete nature and purity. Within this complex imaginary of Japanese internment, through which Japaneseness undergoes a shift from a symbolic alignment with the Jew to the figure of the Native, I situate Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts in the frame of postmemory. 29 Marianne Hirsch describes postmemory as an affective connection to traumatic experiences that precedes a generation’s birth. For Hirsch it is a way of contextualizing the memories of the children of Holocaust survivors, whose experiences were nevertheless shaped by “cultural or collective traumatic events . . . distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection.” 30 She explains further that “postmemory is a powerful and very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 31 Rea Tajiri’s experimental film memoir, History and Memory , offers a powerful evocation of Hirsch’s description of postmemory in the personal narration she weaves through the film. In the melancholic tone of her voice-over she explains the quandary of having memories disconnected from experience. As a Sansei born over a decade after the release of Japanese American internees from camps, she is haunted by recurring memories—memories of events she never experienced directly—that confuse her sense of identity. Her film becomes an archive of her efforts to probe the emotional residue of Japanese internment that has been implanted into her own subjective experience: I began searching for a history, my own history. Because I had known all along the stories I’d heard were not true and parts had been left out. I remember having this feeling when I was growing up that I was haunted by something, that I was living within a family of ghosts. There was this place they knew about. I had never been there, yet I had a memory for it. Adding to the surreal nature of her connection to a foreign history is her mother’s inability to remember her own experience of wartime relocation to a camp in Poston, Arizona. In the film, her mother’s soft, barely audible voice is heard explaining, “There are so many things I’ve forgotten.” Accompanying her voice is scrolling text that reads: She tells the story of what she doesn’t remember But remembers one thing: Why she forgot to remember. Thus Tajiri’s film explores the paradoxical interplay of history and memory, capturing an irony that David Eng describes where “the mother has history but no memory, while the daughter has memory but no history. 32 This forms the central irony of postmemory, in which traumatic memories and feelings of loss are unconsciously passed from one generation to the next. Its haunting effects manifest in unrelieved sadness, akin to the experience that Grace Cho describes as transgenerational haunting, “a repetition of trauma that resists all attempts to erase it from personal and public memory.” 33 Eng situates Tajiri’s postmemory in the domain of melancholia, identifying how “the most difficult losses suffered in melancholia are unconscious ones, psychic forfeitures that cannot be properly grieved.” 34 Working through the melancholic layers of postmemory, the film gives visual representation to the negative space of Japanese internment. I expand on the “post-” of postmemory in my reading of Joy Kogawa’s Obasan , referring not only to the memory that exists “after,” as in the case of Tajiri’s film, but also “beyond.” Here I am referring to the unconscious, psychic world of attachments that both draw on and exceed memory. Because she is a reserved person, much of the protagonist Naomi Nakane’s emotional complexity is conveyed through her graphic, often violent nightmares and daydreams—the negative space of her conscious, rational mind. Her dreams often take place in a wilderness landscape, peopled by relatives, bayonet-wielding soldiers, prosthetic-limbed women, and deceptively “real”-looking robots. Like Asawa’s inverted tree, these gothic landscapes convey the unconscious attachments and fears tied to the crisis of relocation, which, in the case of Naomi, is coupled with the disappearance of her mother. In addition, another sense of how the post of postmemory goes “beyond” memory in the novel is in the expression of dialectical consciousness. Although Kogawa experienced Japanese internment in Canada as a child, her novel’s blend of autobiographical elements, government documents, and archival sources accentuates the contested nature of personal memory and official history. If the “truth” exists, it exists somewhere between and beyond the text’s multiple authorial voices. 35 Similar to Tajiri’s mother, as an adult Naomi has repressed her internment experience: of relocation to a ghost town in the interior of British Columbia and postwar dispersal to a beet farm in Granton, Alberta. The terrain of memory that Naomi uncovers is neither linear, individual, nor finite. Mona Oikawa describes Naomi’s complex reckoning with the past this way: “As [she] struggles to remember and to know, she confronts the complex ways in which memory is revelatory, both through remembering and forgetting.” 36 Thus the post of post-memory also refers to the memory of willful forgetting. The Jewish Question In Obasan and History and Memory , the economic modality of anti-Japanese sentiment is rendered through moments of cross-racial identification and, as I argue in the following section, through the postmemory of landscape. First, in indirect and overt examples, the persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime and the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples serve as analogical frames for each text’s reckoning with the meaning of Japanese internment. In Obasan , general observations of economic jealousy subtly refract the financial modality of anti-Semitism. As Naomi sorts through old letters in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, she comes across one of the many unopened letters her Aunt Emily wrote to her sister, Naomi’s mother, who was unable to return home from a visit to Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In the letter, written before the family’s expulsion from Vancouver, Aunt Emily reveals an awareness of economic resentment of Japanese Canadian prosperity, noting that “when gas rationing starts [Dad] won’t be able to use the car much. It’s so sleek it’s an affront to everyone he passes. I wish he’d bought something more modest, but you know Dad.” 37 Presumably the car is also an affront to less affluent Japanese Canadians, but its acquisition also symbolizes Japanese mobility and access to liberal individualism, a status historically aligned with and guarded by whites. Later in the letter, after enumerating the way Japanese Canadians have become the enemy, Aunt Emily makes a more pointed connection between the effects of war on Jews and Japanese Canadians: The things that go on in wartime! Think of Hitler shiploading people into Poland or Germany proper to work for nothing in fields and factories far from home and children—stealing food from conquered people—captive labor. . . . War breeds utter insanity. Here at home there’s mass hatred of us simply because we’re of Japanese origin. 38 In this passage, Aunt Emily’s observations of Nazi tactics serve as an eerie premonition of what will ensue for Japanese Canadians, as Naomi’s father will be sent to labor on a road camp, while the remaining family will be twice relocated before settling as exploited labor on a beet farm in Alberta. Decades after the war, Aunt Emily becomes more direct in her allusions to Nazism as a cultural force. In answer to her rhetorical question “Why in a time of war with Germany and Japan would our government seize the property and homes of Canadian-born Canadians but not the homes of German-born Germans?” she replies to herself, “Racism. . . . The Nazis are everywhere.” 39 Thus from prewar to postwar reflections on Japanese internment, anti-Japanese sentiment is expressed through the economic and racial prism of anti-Semitism. Rea Tajiri’s film-memoir also makes reference to the specter of anti-Semitism, but as a threatening identification that is actively suppressed. Without sound, she incorporates scrolling text to highlight the way Japanese internment continues to be sanitized of any connotations of Nazi Germany: NEW YORK TIMES AUGUST 28, 1990 ASSEMBLYMAN GIL FERGUSON, REPUBLICAN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIF., SEEKS TO HAVE CHILDREN TAUGHT THAT JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE NOT INTERNED IN “CONCENTRATION CAMPS,” BUT RATHER WERE HELD IN “RELOCATION CENTERS” JUSTIFIED BY MILITARY NECESSITY. Tajiri’s inclusion of this text indicates that in 1990, forty-five years after the end of World War II, two years after the successful redress campaign, and following exhaustive debunking of theories of “military necessity,” the primary meaning of Japanese internment remains subject to ongoing deferral. 40 In light of wartime atrocities committed by the Nazis, Roosevelt’s initial references to Japanese “concentration camps” were actively redacted. As a result, Japanese internment could only be described through euphemism and negation, as not a concentration camp. Obasan ’s Aunt Emily shares a similar reaction to the discursive construction of internment camps as “Interior Housing Projects.” She observes, “With language like that you can disguise any crime.” 41 Tajiri’s silent, scrolling text thus captures the discursive predicament that Japanese internment poses, while emphasizing the ongoing threat of identifying Japanese internment with the symbolism of the Nazi regime. If we pursue the vexed intersection of Japanese internment and anti-Semitism raised in these texts, we find similar deferrals of meaning that attend the Holocaust. Moishe Postone’s reflection on West Germany’s emotional response to the late 1970s American television miniseries Holocaust illuminates some of the interpretive impasse that, in analogous fashion, surrounds Japanese internment in North America. In pursuing this intersection, my intention is not to conflate the stark disparity of outcomes of “concentration camps” in Europe and North America; rather, it is to further uncover an intersecting economism of anti-Semitic and anti-Japanese racialization. Observing the tendency in postwar Germany of Germans to deny having knowledge of the wartime existence of extermination camps, Postone reflects on the underlying sentiment masked by appeals to ignorance: “‘We didn’t know’ should be understood as ‘we still don’t want to know.’” 42 What Holocaust ultimately exposed about the public horrors against Jews, Russians, and Poles that occurred outside the camps “undermined the fiction that Nazi genocide was the affair of a small handful of people operating within a context hermetically sealed off from most of the soldiers as well as the rest of the German population.” 43 Similar to the ostensibly arbitrary but coordinated will of multiple governments to expel, confine, and/or deport Japanese civilians in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the precise motivation within National Socialism for exterminating Jews continues to evolve in the postwar era. Postone troubles theories of fascism and racial prejudice because neither can sufficiently account for what he calls the “qualitative specificity” 44 of the extermination of European Jews. This specificity, he observes, will “remain inexplicable so long as anti-Semitism is treated as a specific example of prejudice, xenophobia and racism in general, as an example of a scapegoat strategy whose victims could very well have been members of any other group.” 45 Within this qualitative specificity, neither fascism nor racism in general can explain why, during the German army’s defeat by the Red Army, they allocated a significant number of vehicles to transport Jews to gas chambers rather than for military reinforcements. 46 This reveals a biopolitics in which the extermination of Jews served a greater purpose than the preservation of German soldiers’ lives. Rather than profiting from the elimination of Jews, their extermination was itself a mode of German self-preservation against the evils of capitalism that Jews represented. What Japanese internment and the Holocaust share is a romantic anticapitalist logic. The transnational frame magnifies how Japanese North Americans were not interned to protect the coast, to rob them of their property (although white citizens certainly profited from their dispossession), to protect them, or to test their loyalty. Neither was the Holocaust motivated by profit or wartime security interests: “They were not exterminated for military reasons, or in order to violently acquire land (as was the case with American Indians and the Tasmanians), or in order to wipe out those segments of the population around whom resistance could most easily crystallize.” 47 Rather, in the case of Jews, the qualitative specificity was due to the kind of secular power attributed to them. This power was defined not as the resistance of an oppressed underclass but, rather, as the potentially greater force of a super-race—an overclass—whose power was “mysteriously intangible, abstract and universal.” 48 Given that romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes and glorifies the concrete dimensions of capitalist social relations, the abstract dimension “must find a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression.” 49 This biological carrier came in the form of the Jew: Because this power is not bound concretely, is not “rooted,” it is of staggering immensity and is extremely difficult to check. It stands behind phenomena, but is not identical with them. Its source is therefore hidden—conspiratorial. The Jews represent an immensely powerful, intangible, international conspiracy. 50 Within this romantic anticapitalist system of representation, Jews represented an immensely powerful conspiratorial force that contributed to the decline of traditional social formations, values, and institutions. Thus the eradication of Jews under National Socialism was a mode of preservation from the abstract evils of capitalism. If mass removal and internment of Japanese civilians in Canada and the United States was a protective measure, it was for the similarly mysterious and immense power attributed to them. This power, like that represented by European Jews, was defined not by the resistant power of the racialized poor, like that of African American or First Nations communities, but as a destructive economic conspiracy. The dangerous content of the power attributed to Japanese communities along the West Coast was alien, intangible, conspiratorial, and international. In contrast to European Jews’ segregation in financial sectors of the labor market—an alignment that was strongly associated with the abstract dimension of capitalism within the binarized social universe of romantic anticapitalism—Japanese communities were associated with farming, fishing, and retail labor. How did their labor come to represent such a negative power? In order to appreciate how the Japanese became “a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression” for the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, we can track the continuity in the evolution of racialized characterizations of “cheap” Chinese labor to the “excessive efficiency” of Japanese labor. As we saw in chapter 1 , Chinese associations with the temporal domination of abstract time rendered them a perverse, abstract counterpart to white “concrete” labor. In the rapidly industrializing context of nineteenth-century railroad building and mining, the laboring Chinese body came to signify the consolidation of abstract, homogeneous time that threatened normative social reproduction. Within this regime of intensified labor time, therefore, the Chinese body stood for the devaluation of white labor. In chapter 2 I explored how, when Asian immigration came largely to a halt in the 1920s in the United States and Canada, a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism was expressed in the masculinist personification of nature. As an embodiment of the temporal domination of abstract labor, which is fundamental to the determination of the value of labor-power, Asian aliens represented an antinatural force of value formation—the abstract antithesis of a concrete, pure, and Indigenous natural world. During the global Great Depression and in its aftermath, liberal protections in Canada and the United States intervened in determining the value of labor power to stabilize capitalism, with strategies that included minimum wage standards in British Columbia and Roosevelt’s New Deal labor safeguards in the 1930s. These worker protections may have subdued the perception that Asian bodies represented an abstract, alien force that devalued concrete white labor power. 51 However, as Japanese labor and ownership of boats, land, and equipment expanded alongside developments in industrial modernization, the abstract power embodied by Asian labor no longer represented the devaluation of white labor; rather, it represented the creation of unnatural value . The excessive industry associated with Japanese labor was threatening precisely because it fed a perception that they had control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. The form of relative surplus-value associated with the excessive industry of Japanese labor is transient. In “The Concept of Relative Surplus Value” in Capital , Marx asks why individual capitalists are driven to innovate, especially because their innovations are beneficial to the entire capitalist class. Specifically, efficiency measures reduce the value of labor power, increase the rate of exploitation, and generate more surplus-value. 52 Are innovators selfless individuals motivated to bolster the capitalist class? Marx says no: individual capitalists are driven to innovate not out of class interests but out of individual interests. When a capitalist innovates to produce a commodity more efficiently, the value of his or her product temporarily falls below its social value, which means “they have cost less labour-time than the great bulk of the same article produced under the average social conditions.” 53 As discussed in previous chapters, the immaterial but objective source of value is socially necessary labor time: “The real value of a commodity is not its individual, but its social value; that is to say, its value is not measured by the labour-time that the article costs the producer in each individual case, but the labour-time socially required for its production.” 54 The crucial gap between the actual time it takes to produce a product after innovations have been introduced and the socially necessary labor time is what yields a surplus on surplus-value. This extra profit—the relative surplus-value —is precisely what motivates the individual capitalist to innovate. However, this extra profit is only temporary. Once other capitalists adopt the same labor-saving innovation, the socially necessary labor time will adjust accordingly. As Marx explains, “This extra surplus-value vanishes as soon as the new method of production is generalized, for then the difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value vanishes.” 55 Because of the coercive nature of competition, the capitalist interest to profit from the temporal gap between a product’s individual and social value—the gap that constitutes relative surplus-value—is implicit within capitalism. What this means is that technical innovation or technological modernization does not occur solely as a result of someone’s creative genius; rather, as Marx emphasizes, “capital . . . has an immanent drive, and a constant tendency, towards increasing the productivity of labour, in order to cheapen commodities and, by cheapening commodities, to cheapen the worker himself.” 56 Innovation is part of capitalism’s “immanent drive” to devalue labor. Within this book’s larger claim that the abstract forces within capitalism are personified as Asian, the harmful content of Japanese labor thus appears as a negative symptom of modernizing innovation, whose destructive power catalyzes the unnatural creation of relative surplus-value. Evolving from an unnatural sign of abstraction, the Asian becomes a specter of destructive innovation in a landscape of ceaseless modernization. Born-Again Native Paradoxically, the obverse of the destructive economism traditionally associated with Jews occurs in a second mode of cross-racial identification depicted in Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts: symbolic attachments to and reflections on Indigenous peoples. In this case, I suggest that Japanese identification with Native peoples both replicates and exceeds the settler colonial romantic attachment to the Native in ways that reveal a transformation in the way Asians constitute abstract labor. As I discuss below, their identification with Native peoples is further shaped by the settler colonial conflation of Japanese enemy aliens with Native peoples. Japanese relocation, dispossession, and confinement thus emerge within a dual identificatory framework of anti-Semitic and settler colonial regimes. In Obasan , Naomi repeatedly aligns herself and members of her Japanese Canadian family with First Nations’ identities. At the onset of the novel, she accompanies her uncle to the ravine and imagines him as an American Indian warrior hero: Uncle could be Chief Sitting Bull squatting here. He has the same prairie-baked skin, the deep brown furrows like dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks. All he needs is a feather headdress, and he would be perfect for a picture postcard—“Indian Chief from Canadian Prairie”—souvenir of Alberta, made in Japan. 57 Here the optics of Japanese Canadian racial form are staged in correspondence to Native identity. The narrator’s depiction functions as an attempt to indigenize Uncle on two levels: first, his Indigeneity stems from a phenotypical convergence with Chief Sitting Bull that results in their same “prairie-baked skin,” and second, Uncle’s Indigeneity is established through his figurative embodiment of landscape, with “dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks.” Although this portrayal clearly intends to naturalize Japanese Canadians to the landscape, it also acknowledges the iterative circuits of dispossession and commodification that make it possible for a Japanese import to offer a “picture postcard” vision of Indigeneity. Naomi projects a similar analogy between Obasan, her aunt, and an Indigenous fighter. Gauging her aunt’s inability to integrate into a community of elderly white Canadians, she concludes that Obasan would be as “welcome as a Zulu warrior.” 58 Later, describing her moribund life as a schoolteacher, Naomi once again pauses to reflect on a shared Japanese and Native disposition. 59 She observes that “some of the Native children I’ve had in my classes over the years could almost pass for Japanese, and vice versa. There’s something in the animal-like shyness I recognize in the dark eyes. A quickness to look away.” 60 The implications of these figurative projections of cross-racial identification are justifiably vexed. On one hand, as Marie Lo explains, these identifications “blur the boundaries of what is Native and what is Japanese,” placing Japanese Canadians on a broader colonial continuum that begins with dispossession of Indigenous people. 61 On the other, as Lo also points out, these modes of Native identification participate in a long-standing Canadian settler nationalism that has sought to “elaborate a national and autochthonous claim to the land” 62 through white identifications with the figure of the Native. That the novel similarly attempts to naturalize Japanese Canadians is reflected no less problematically in Aunt Emily’s continual refrain “This is my own, my native land.” 63 However, as I suggest below, the precondition for this problematic identification with the Native is the dehumanizing effects of their transformation into surplus labor. Relocated to work a beet farm under postwar dispersal orders, the combined sterility of the landscape and tropes of human degeneracy expose the eliminatory logic of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. Tajiri’s film contains more subtle reflections on Japanese and Native American crossings, less through the mode of identification than spatial intersection. After her family was removed to the Salinas Rodeo Grounds barracks, Tajiri explains how they were relocated again by train to Poston, Arizona, “to live in part of an Indian reservation converted into a concentration camp.” The camp was built on a section of the Colorado River Tribal Indian Reservation. Tajiri’s film delicately probes the intersection of Japanese internees and Native residents by foregrounding the ironies of colonial dispossession. When she travels to Poston, a resident explains how “the government came in and overnight took over a section of the reservation and started to build the camps.” Tajiri emphasizes the poor quality of the barracks, which were made “of this really cheap unseasoned pine and finished [off] with this tar paper.” Later, she explains, “they tried to offer the barracks back to the Native Americans as compensation for the use of the land.” From this vantage point, Poston becomes a space where the dispossessed and the recipients of government “welfare” confront each other as exchangeable figures of colonial management. A single group photograph of Native mothers and children, titled 1942, Native American Residents, Poston , further accentuates how the internment camp was a space that, as Jodi Byrd points out, spatializes a “recursive colonialism that, during World War II, served to enjamb Japanese American detainees within the histories of containment and expropriation that strip lands and nations from American Indians.” 64 The intersection of Indigenous colonization and Japanese internment in the historical record further exemplifies the conflating tendency of this “recursive colonialism.” In particular, the bureaucratic structure governing the incarceration of 113,000 Japanese Americans in ten remote concentration camps was modeled on existing colonial operations. From 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA ) was largely staffed by personnel from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA ). Exemplifying the BIA-WRA connection was Dillon Myers, a ten-year veteran of the Indian Service, who was made director of the WRA for four years at Gila, Arizona, before assuming leadership of the BIA in 1950. 65 The similarities between the way the US government handled American Indians and Japanese internees often stemmed from Myers’s conflation of Japanese and Indigenous bodies. A colleague once assessed Myers’s tendency to collapse the two racial groups, remarking, “Like all of those guys [in the Indian Service] he feels that there are only two kinds of Indians—gooduns and baduns—and feels that Japs are Indians.” 66 Behind the barbed wire, Japanese internees at Poston, Arizona, drew similar comparisons in their inquiries about whether “they would be ‘kept’ the rest of their lives on reservations like Indians.” 67 Indeed, one of Eleanor Roosevelt’s chief objections to Japanese internment camps was that it risked producing a culture of dependency: “If we don’t look out we will create another Indian problem.” 68 Once Japanese Americans were interned, the economic threat associated with them was resignified as the economic burden of social welfare. In Canada, the government’s instinct was similarly to conflate Japanese internees and First Nations peoples. When the federal government was devising plans for the expulsion of twenty-two thousand Japanese Canadians from the hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, officials explored the possibility of using First Nations residential schools as sites for their internment. Although this plan was never executed, bureaucratic discourse functioned to fuse Japanese Canadians and First Nations as similarly alien to a white Canada and to promote Indigenous colonization as a useful template for Japanese internment. Mona Oikawa explains that one officer reporting to the British Columbia Security Commission stated, “We are hoping that mutually satisfactory arrangements can be made with your Commission so that the present staff could look after the Japanese on the basis somewhat similar to that applying in the case of the Indians.” 69 Thus, in stark contrast to conspiratorial and destructive associations of economic power, Japanese internees are here aligned with colonial subjects, who, as the last chapter demonstrated, have been romanticized as existing outside of time and money. One reading suggested by these seemingly incompatible identifications, from the abstract economism of the Jewish analogy to the concrete noneconomism of the Native analogy, is that Japanese internment and dispersal renovated the connotation of Japanese labor from that of unnatural, excessive industry to some other, more benevolent expression of labor symbolically aligned with Native peoples. Jodi Kim refers to this transformation as a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation,” in which Japanese American and Japanese Canadian subjects are transformed into a “model minority.” 70 Building on this approach, I turn now to the way Kogawa and Tajiri unpack the question of labor resignification and consider its implications for our understanding of the relationship between settler colonialism and romantic anticapitalism. Going Native as Surplus Labor Drawing on the way settler nationalism informs the use of Native figures in contemporary Anglophone Canadian literature, Marie Lo argues that Obasan ’s representation of Native figures “can be seen as a variant on mainstream nationalism, whereby authors who are marginalized and prevented from identifying with dominant Anglo-Canadian culture can find in Native culture ‘a prior superior culture with which to identify.’” 71 My own analysis examines the material preconditions for the novel’s alignment with Native identities. This effort is intended to serve a broader objective: to mine the transnationality of Japanese internment in North America through the figurative and spatial alignment with Indigenous peoples that is present in both Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts. If the figure of the Native functions as a settler colonial trope intended to naturalize Japanese Canadians, my analysis excavates the conditions of possibility that make such a trope accessible and legible within the imaginary of Japanese internment. In the case of Obasan , it is largely in the aftermath of the family’s double removal that an identification with Native peoples is most explicit. Specifically, Naomi’s descriptions of Uncle as Sitting Bull and Obasan as a Zulu warrior occur after decades living in Granton, Alberta. I argue that two elements condition this identification: first, that the figurative identification with Native identities relies on the symbolic transformation of labor from excessive efficiency to commendable productivity; and second, that this transformation is expressed as a process of devitalization, of both the land and the laborers themselves. What the novel exposes, therefore, is that the dehumanization of surplus labor reflects the eliminatory core of settler colonialism’s romantic fantasy of the Native and reveals the necropolitical interplay of settler colonialism’s relation to land and labor. Although the subject of labor has not been a central literary concern in Obasan criticism, it is essential to the historical context that Kogawa’s novel excavates. 72 As part of the West Coast removal process, the government created road labor camps for all able-bodied Japanese Canadian men to make badly needed improvements on neglected roadways in the hinterlands of British Columbia. 73 Sugar beet farmers who were desperate for wartime labor also capitalized on the removal orders by petitioning the government for Japanese Canadian laborers. 74 At the war’s end, when Japanese Canadians were forced to choose between deportation or “Eastern Placement”—relocation east of the Rockies—the Labour Department was responsible for expanding its network of placement offices. Having enjoyed the economic boom that Japanese labor brought to the beet-farming industry in Alberta, industry leaders benefited further from the continued West Coast exclusion orders. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. 75 This labor history figures in the material and speculative worlds of the Obasan . These policies had a direct impact on the reconfiguration of Naomi’s family, given that her uncle and father are among the men dispatched to remote road labor camps. Like many married men, Uncle is eventually permitted to rejoin the family in Slocan, the ghost town where they are interned. For reasons never made clear, Naomi’s father Tadashi is not reunited with the family until the war’s end. The family’s existence becomes increasingly abject after the war, when they are relocated again as part of the dispersal policy. Perhaps due to his frailty, the Department of Labor deems Tadashi “unsuitable for Eastern Placement,” 76 which results in his continued separation from the family and eventual death. The family is relocated to Granton, Alberta, where they endure the misery of being labor hands on the Barker beet farm, their home a converted chicken coop. For Naomi, it is the beet farm that becomes a central source of her trauma, the living nightmare of double relocation: “I cannot bear the memory. There are some nightmares from which there is no waking, only deeper and deeper sleep.” 77 Transforming reality into the language of dreams, these years on the Barker farm are what she refers to as the “sleepwalk years.” 78 The novel’s retrospective view of Japanese Canadian relocation emphasizes the mechanical degeneration of organic purity, of life reduced to deathly abjection. In Naomi’s dream-memories, the Japanese are progressively deanimated in a lifeless landscape. After Uncle dies, Naomi is pulled back to her postwar home in Granton, Alberta, to come to the side of her aging Obasan, her aunt and primary caregiver through and after the war years. She returns to find the house and her aunt in a parallel state of somnambulance, the house a living appendage of Obasan’s frail body, “where memories and dreams seep and mingle through cracks, settling on furniture and into upholstery.” 79 In Naomi’s first dream in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, its nightmarish quality turns on mechanical deception in nature. In the dream Naomi descends into what seems a prelapsarian Eden, but a heavy mist coats the landscape and at turns, transforms its human subjects. As the dream progresses, what comes into foggy relief is how nature meets the mechanical in a field of labor. In Naomi’s dream, the degeneration of human labor is figured as a process of prostheticization that highlights the dissonant intersection of Indigenous nature and mechanized efficiency. Accompanied by a nameless man, Naomi’s dream avatar descends on a mountainside forest to encounter another man and woman. For a fleeting moment, she catches a glimpse of the woman’s beauty, appearing “as she once was, naked, youthful, voluptuous.” 80 In this instant, the woman is Eve—pure, fertile, and without shame. But the vision quickly changes to reveal the woman in her current, fallen state. The dream’s imagery underscores the mechanistic degeneration of the human body. Her seductive curves have been transformed into sharp angles: “Her face is now harsh again and angular as quartz. . . . Her body, a matching squareness, is dense as earth.” 81 The vitality of the woman Naomi first encounters morphs into harsh quartz angularity. Her squareness suggests a uniformity and steel symmetry; she has more in common with metal than with flesh. The reference to her square body, as “dense as earth,” lends an organicism to her embodiment, yet the heaviness of the simile evokes death and entombment. The glimmer of Indigenous, Eve-like purity—“naked, youthful, voluptuous”—is transformed into the organic burden of earth that pulls the body downward so she is capable only of movements that are “slow and heavy as sleep.” 82 Labor enters the dream as an allegory of Naomi’s work on the Barker farm. In her dream nature and animate bodies undergo discipline and are transformed into disembodied, devitalized androids. The square woman is engaged in repetitive labor, her back bent over as her “arms sway and swing, front to back, back to front” 83 wielding a sickle, “harvesting the forest’s debris, gathering the branches into piles.” 84 Alongside her is a man, “taller thinner and precise—a British martinet.” 85 Naomi observes that he is in command; equipped with “pruner’s shears, he is cutting the trees.” 86 With her companion, Naomi is silently entreated into joining the woman and man in labor, threatened by the martinet, whose glance is “a raised baton”: 87 We move without question or references in an interminable unknowing without rules, without direction. No incident alerts us to an awareness of time. But at some subtle hour, the white mist is known to be gray, and the endlessness of labor has entered our limbs. Weariness. 88 The man, a vision of patriarchal militaristic authority, enforces the monotonous repetition of their labor, while his pruner’s shears cut into and discipline the natural landscape. He is accompanied by a “huge gentle beast—a lion or a dog” whose “obedience is phenomenal.” 89 But the beast too, to Naomi’s shock, is plastic: “The animal is a robot!” 90 What alerts her is its frozen yawn “when the mechanism that hinges the jaws has proven faulty.” 91 By this point, she observes that the laboring woman’s arms are now connected by “four hooks locked to make a hinge . . . [which] dangles as she approaches.” 92 Therefore, in the process of disciplining the landscape, animate bodies undergo prosthetic degeneration, while deceptively real-looking robots take the place of animals. There is no place here even for language, which devolves in this landscape of mechanized beings. Naomi hears the woman speaking, “but the words are so old they cannot be understood. . . . The language has been forgotten.” 93 The destructive rationalism and robotification in the dream allegorize both the progressive dehumanization of labor and the settler colonial disciplining of nature. Moreover, the dream accentuates the dehumanizing condition of surplus labor and the eliminatory spirit of settler colonialism. The dream’s apocalyptic vision of mechanized dehumanization captures the profound abjection of her years working on the devitalized landscape of the Barkers’ beet farm. 94 Like the machine people in her dream, the farm landscape is barren and unnatural. As though the land had been subjected to the pruning shears of the British martinet of Naomi’s nightmare, “here and there are straight unnatural rows of fierce almost leafless trees pruned like the brooms of a chimney sweep.” 95 Even the air is unwelcoming and brutal: “Here, the air is a fist.” 96 In this landscape where “plant growth is deliberate and fierce,” 97 both nature and machines are associated with death and confinement. “Round skull-shaped weeds” grow along the miles of “barbed wire fences,” 98 while “skeletons of farm machinery” lie between the shed and the farmhouse “like the remains of dinosaurs in a prehistoric battleground.” 99 Naomi’s dream refracts the prehistory of this lifeless landscape of coerced, unnatural growth. Succumbing to its deadening effects, Naomi feels like a “scarecrow or a skeleton in the wind.” 100 Her brother Stephen, too, is later haunted by monstrous scenes of mechanized nature, once dreaming that “a metallic insect the size of a tractor [was] webbing a grid of iron bars over him.” 101 Technological rationalism has turned the natural world upside-down, evoking the nightmarish scenes of her dream’s landscape of human degeneration and artifice. The condition of possibility for the way the novel attempts to indigenize Japanese Canadians through analogies to Native peoples centers on the dehumanization of labor. In this unnatural world, Naomi herself embodies the degeneration of the prosthetic-limbed woman who appears in her dream. Reproducing the metamorphosis of the woman from “youthful” and “voluptuous” into a harsh, square body with a face “angular as quartz,” 102 Naomi, too, “mind[s] growing ugly” in this prisonlike atmosphere where hardships are “so pervasive, so inescapable, so thorough it’s a noose around my chest and I cannot move anymore.” 103 Like the “endlessness of labor” 104 in the dream, Naomi’s work on the beet farm is a nightmare of repetition where she “will never be done thinning and weeding and weeding and weeding,” to the point that her body begins to degenerate into an empty shell while her “tear glands burn out.” 105 Collectively the family is turned into automatons that switch on or off, “obedient as machines,” 106 through their days filled with the emptiness of labor, seemingly outside of time, space, and sound: “There are no other people in the entire world. We work together all day. At night we eat and sleep. We hardly talk anymore.” 107 There is nothing of the symbolic purification in working the land associated with a romantic settler colonial vision of landscape. In this inverted world, both landscape and labor are disciplined and denaturalized into mechanical abstraction, which, as I will discuss further below, exemplifies the racialized condition of surplus labor. Through this gothic transformation of landscape and labor—and continued exclusion from the West Coast—the dangerous economism of Japanese labor in the prewar period mutates to commendable productivity; the enemy alien morphs into the ideal surplus labor population. As Naomi sifts through Aunt Emily’s package of wartime letters and documents, she finds a newspaper clipping filed under “Facts about evacuees in Alberta.” 108 A caption that reads “‘Grinning and Happy’: Find Jap Evacuees Best Beet Workers” accompanies a photograph of a smiling Japanese Canadian family posing by a pile of beets. 109 The article praises the all-time record crop produced by Japanese “evacuee” labor, who worked 65 percent of Alberta’s sugar beet acreage: “Generally speaking, Japanese evacuees have developed into most efficient beet workers, many of them being better than the transient workers who cared for beets in southern Alberta before Pearl Harbor.” 110 This account of the bountiful yields attributed to Japanese labor is striking in its contrast to the dangerous efficiency of prewar Japanese Canadian fishing crews, which previously warranted restrictions on licenses and even the use of gas-powered boats. Thus the symbolic transformation in the postwar era, to be celebrated as commendable productivity, turns on the relocation and resignification of labor. What is especially telling about the article is how Japanese labor is no longer set in relation to white labor. Rather than competing with white labor on the West Coast, the newspaper clipping positions Japanese labor in relation to “transient workers.” In short, Japanese Canadian laborers are reconstituted as superior figures of transient labor, which is possible only after their relocation and confinement. Under these coercive and immobilizing conditions of labor, what enables the mutation of Japanese Canadian labor is their alignment with surplus laboring populations referred to as the “transient workers” in the article. Shedding racialized associations to abstract labor, which is perceived as having a destructive hold on the creation of unnatural, relative surplus-value, Japanese labor is reconstituted into what Marx terms an “industrial reserve army.” As a surplus labor population, they regulate—for the benefit of capitalists—the interplay of technological innovation and human labor productivity in the process of capital accumulation. Marx describes the indispensable role played by the surplus population as follows: But if a surplus population of workers is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, this surplus population also becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalist accumulation, indeed it becomes a condition of the existence of the capitalist mode of production. It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, which belongs to capital just as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates a mass of human material always ready for exploitation by capital in the interests of capital’s own changing valorization requirements. 111 Clarifying the expendability at the root of this mode of labor exploitation, Roderick Ferguson explains, “Both superfluous and indispensable, surplus populations fulfill and exceed the demands of capital.” 112 It is precisely the condition of being disposable that I suggest produces the structural alignment with Native peoples who, as primary subjects of colonial elimination, are also exploited and similarly transformed into latent and then stagnant members of the industrial reserve army. 113 They are wage laborers who are subject to capitalism’s need for labor power in uneven quantities and qualities over space and time. Describing the effect of capitalism’s ability to “pivot” labor power, Ruth Gilmore explains that as “systemic expansions and contractions produce and throw off workers, those idled must wait, migrate, or languish until—if ever—new opportunities to sell their labor power emerge.” 114 This also demonstrates how settler colonial logics of elimination (from land) and exclusion (as exploited alien labor) are not mutually exclusive but dialectically connected. Given that the Native reservation system and urban relocation programs in Canada and the United States functioned to entrench the disposability of Indigenous labor, 115 Native people were especially susceptible to irregular employment. As such, as Marx notes, this surplus labor group “offers capital an inexhaustible reservoir of disposable labour power.” 116 Therefore, despite Naomi’s anger at the characterization of Japanese beet farm laborers as “Grinning and Happy,” it is this, their resignification as surplus labor, that connects Japanese bodies not to racialized value production but to the racialization of surplus labor populations, chief among them First Nations labor. 117 The availability of cross-racial identification in the novel turns on the transformation of Japanese abstract labor into surplus labor, a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation” that renews a white settler colonial hierarchy. 118 In sum, Obasan ’s presentation of a landscape of devitalization, a place where “something dead is happening, like the weeds that are left to bleach,” 119 offers several remaining insights. First, in this inverted world, the rehumanization of Japanese Canadians as surplus laborers who are “Grinning and Happy” relies on their dehumanization and dispossession. In other words, this indigenization reveals the dehumanized content at the core of romantic idealization of Native peoples. Second, in Kogawa’s identification of Uncle with Chief Sitting Bull and Obasan with a Zulu warrior—non-Canadian Indigenous peoples from the United States and South Africa, respectively—they exemplify a dual condition of alien-ness and Indigeneity that highlights the dialectical interplay of land and labor under settler colonialism that expropriates Indigenous land and exploits racialized labor. That the postwar period saw the coerced recruitment of Native laborers to fill more labor shortages in the southern Alberta sugar beet industry until the 1980s further exemplifies the instrumentality of disposable labor populations, which embodied the condition of hyperexploitability: it was more profitable to consign these laborers to seasonal hand labor than to rely on costlier machines and chemicals. As the central pivot in facilitating the evolution to modern, better living in western Canada, racialized surplus labor bridges the necropolitical dimension of Native elimination to alien exclusion. In Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory , the mutation of Japanese labor is similarly expressed in the devitalization associated with the landscape on a Native reservation. Unlike the purely symbolic identification with Native identities in Obasan , in Tajiri’s film indigenization turns on the relocation and confinement of Japanese internees to the shared colonial site of the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Poston, Arizona. Her film offers an illuminating complement to Kogawa’s focus on the degenerative, mechanistic landscape of surplus labor on the beet farm by further probing the dark registers of Japanese internment that are refracted onto the reservation. Contrasting the way the colonial disciplining and rehabilitation of racialized labor are mirrored in the disciplined, unnatural landscape in Obasan , the landscape in History and Memory also serves as a witness to the modes of erasure enacted upon Japanese labor. Through a combination of reenacted memories, Hollywood movie reels, text, and voice-overs, Japanese internment is presented as a source of knowledge that can be accessed only indirectly, through these tangled strands of representation. These are the multimedia artifacts of postmemory—memories and visions that are transmitted into Tajiri’s consciousness from elsewhere. As David Eng observes of the documentary’s experimental aesthetic, “Tajiri presents us with a complex argument concerning the supplemental relationship between political and affective histories of Japanese American internment that cannot be easily reconciled with dominant US or Japanese American accounts of the event.” 120 In particular, recurring scenes of water—connected to land irrigation and a water tower—overturn water’s associations with vitality and purification. Instead, water imagery serves as a collective trace of devitalization and degeneration. The theme of water is first established through repeated dramatizations of a memory that haunts Tajiri because it is not her own. In the vision her mother crouches at an outdoor tap, filling a canteen. We can identify the vision as postmemory from Tajiri’s description: I don’t know where this came from but I just had this fragment, this picture that’s always been in my mind. My mother, she’s standing at a faucet and it’s really hot outside, and she’s filling this canteen. And the water’s really cold, and it feels really good. And outside the sun is just so hot, it’s just beating down. And there’s this dust that gets in everywhere. And they’re always sweeping the floors. The scene is played several times from alternating vantage points, focusing in on the rush of water from the tap, the overflowing canteen, the back of her mother’s crouching body, and her mother’s face as she splashes water onto it. This visual refrain operates as an abstract contrast to the realism of films that rationalize Japanese internment through numerous Hollywood reenactments of Pearl Harbor and government-sponsored announcements justifying its wartime actions toward Japanese civilians. In the documentary’s continual return to the dislocated postmemory of water, Tajiri suggests that the meaning of Japanese internment has been overdetermined by Hollywood’s heroic action films and melodrama. Challenging this representational realism, Tajiri deconstructs the meaning of Japanese internment by presenting indirect channels of meaning that form a nonlinear collage of knowledge that focuses on what water reveals through what it conceals. Alongside the continual return to the scene of her mother at the fountain, a single Hollywood film recurs through the documentary, standing as an exception to normative representations of Japanese internment: Bad Day at Black Rock , a 1955 film that, like Tajiri’s documentary, deals with Japanese internment indirectly through absence rather than presence. 121 The strength of Bad Day at Black Rock for Tajiri is that despite the fact that no Japanese American character ever appears in the film, this absence constitutes a meaningful form of erasure and emptiness, analogous to the visual tension produced by the negative space of Asawa’s sculptures. Specifically, it is the disappearance of a man named Komoko in the film that Tajiri uses as a conceptual frame for understanding the Japanese internment experience at Poston. She explains, “Komoko never appears, not even a picture or a photograph.” She relates his disappearance to her family’s: “Komoko’s disappearance from Black Rock was like ours from history. His absence is his presence.” Again, the weight of Komoko’s absence reinforces Asawa’s concept of negative space, as a force that reveals and energizes what exceeds the visual representation and historiography of Japanese internment. Although Tajiri incorporates only selected clips of Bad Day at Black Rock , the entire arc of the film reveals a racialized projection of Japanese labor’s excessive efficiency, which generated unnatural value. Part revisionist western, part film noir, the film is saturated with mystery. Spencer Tracy stars as John Macreedy, a one-armed stranger who arrives in Black Rock, a forgotten town where, prior to his arrival, the train had not stopped in four years. Macreedy reveals almost nothing of himself, except that he is a World War II veteran whose purpose is to find a man named Komoko. The lawless townspeople react to his inquiries with intimidation and violence. Although the town’s unofficial leader, a man named Smith, claims that Komoko was sent to a Japanese internment camp after Pearl Harbor, Macreedy remains skeptical after finding wildflowers growing outside Komoko’s home, a sign that “something’s buried up there.” He eventually discovers that Komoko has been murdered. A rare ally in the town explains the rationale for the mob killing of Komoko one day after Pearl Harbor, which is the result neither of redirected anger for Pearl Harbor nor of any conflation of Japanese Americans with Japanese wartime enemies. Instead, it is Komoko’s excessive efficiency that has fueled economic resentment and conspiracy. The townsperson tells Macreedy that when the land that Komoko leased—land previously perceived to be too dry and sterile to be productive—yielded growth, they all “figured he must be cheating him . . . [because] you can’t grow anything without water.” But Komoko does find water by digging a deep well, “climb[ing] down sixty feet,” Macreedly learns. This reinforces a larger point in this chapter: that leading up to Japanese internment, Japanese labor was associated with the production of unnatural value—an unnatural hold on relative surplus-value. From the perspective of the townspeople in Black Rock, Komoko frustrated natural laws by growing things where there “never was any water.” Therefore, through the film’s symbolic logic, the discovery of water signifies unnatural growth. Like the recurrence of water imagery, the symbolism of wildflowers marks decomposition rather than growth and connects Bad Day at Black Rock to Japanese internment. Under a scene captioned “Flowers for Komoko’s Grave” appears Tajiri’s mother’s flower garden. Rather than serving as sentimental natural imagery, the textual emphasis on Komoko’s grave draws out the significance of Macreedy’s observation that the wildflowers he identifies in the film are signifiers of death. Having been in Italy during the war, Macreedy has learned that bodies buried in the ground decompose into nutrients that produce wildflowers. Tajiri capitalizes on the dual edge of this natural imagery, as sign of both degeneration and regeneration. In place of her mother’s memory, moreover, the wildflowers give materiality to the absence that is also a presence. Here the wildflowers symbolize a landscape that has become witness to events that have been erased or willfully forgotten. The connection between water, landscape, and labor helps to contextualize the repeated scenes of Tajiri’s mother at the water faucet in the larger context of the Poston camp. Tying these scenes into Komoko’s ability to bring water to an arid landscape, she notes, “That was the thing about the Japanese. They took barren lands and brought water to it. . . . The irony is that they did it again in Poston: brought water to the land and made things grow.” The new context for their labor at Poston enables a transformative regeneration symbolized by Tajiri’s mother’s flowers, which are simultaneously signifiers of death. The still photographs of a single water tower, one taken in 1942 and another in 1988, seem to stand as the only evidence of Japanese irrigation labor at Poston, the largest internment camp built in the United States. 122 That Poston was the site of a Native reservation and Japanese internment camp sets in motion what Ruth Okimoto calls “an ironic twist of history,” in which “the Japanese detainees at Poston experienced what American Indians did in the nineteenth and early 20th centuries.” 123 And it is my argument that this “ironic twist” turns on the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor. It is this spatial context of Japanese confinement on a Native reservation that renovates the prior association of water with unnatural growth in Bad Day at Black Rock to sustainability and productivity. As an uncanny precursor to Japanese confinement, Native Americans were similarly relocated to this desolate landscape. As Okimoto explains in her report Sharing a Desert Home , “Citing national security and the need to protect white settlers, the US government had similarly herded American Indians onto this desolate, arid, and unproductive stretch of land.” 124 Linking the postmemory of water and agriculture woven into Tajiri’s film, what Poston exemplifies, therefore, is the spatial paradox of surplus labor. The water tower evokes the way water imagery remains a material trace of an unnatural landscape through the dehumanization of surplus labor. 125 For both the War Relocation Authority, responsible for housing Japanese detainees, and the Office of Indian Affairs, which would manage the subjugation and irrigation projects, the use of Japanese labor represented the high point of settler colonial logics in the managed interplay of land and labor, elimination and exclusion. Not surprisingly, the Colorado River Indian Tribal supported neither the internment camps nor the colonization program. 126 The outcome was clearly advantageous mostly to whites, who benefited from the access to irrigation systems in the desert, in addition to the dispossessed Japanese property on the West Coast. Thus, from the deep well on Komoko’s land to the water tower at Poston, water is the conduit for and witness to both unnatural growth and exploited, invisible labor. To reiterate an earlier point, the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor turned on their conflation with Native populations. Opposing the enthusiasm for efficient Japanese labor, WRA Director Dillon Myers (who became head of the BIA in 1950) became openly concerned that if kept too long in confinement, Japanese internees would become “dependent like Native Americans.” 127 In stark contrast to the labor efficiency attributed to Japaneseness, Poston was (like other camps) a space of idled labor, where boredom and inactivity coexisted with coerced labor. This dual condition of coerced and idled labor is the primary condition of a surplus population of reserve labor. Given what Michael McIntyre identifies as “race’s long-standing use as a mark of labor,” 128 the prior association of Japaneseness with unnatural “abstract labor” undergoes colonial rehabilitation to the historically racialized category of surplus labor, whose exploitation reinforces whiteness as the basis for property acquisition and expansion. This is the movement from an alien mode of threatening racialized labor to a domesticated form of surplus, racialized labor. A statement by one white farmer plainly reveals the true beneficiaries of using Japanese labor to subjugate Native land: “It will develop a lot of land, bring in irrigation, so white farmers can use it. . . . Couldn’t let good land like that go to waste.” 129 Tajiri’s visual emphasis on the water tower at Poston stands as a remaining artifact of this history, which, like Komoko’s body, has been disappeared from the landscape of labor. For Tajiri it is only a stagnant, unpromising landscape that remains as evidence of the Japanese American internees confined at Poston, whose rehabilitation as surplus labor functioned ironically to indigenize their previously abstract alien labor. The signs that designate Indigenous peoples as surplus populations are continually reinforced through the film’s stark panoramas of the overgrown and decrepit state of the Poston barracks. They were turned over to Native American “colonists” after Japanese Americans were released in 1945 and used as classrooms until 1980. With the exception of an alcohol recovery center, the buildings that remain have deteriorated out of neglect. This is the colonial wasteland of surplus, disposed-of populations. The water tower remains, symbolizing the irrigation of Poston land in the Parker Irrigation Project—rearticulated through recurring dramatizations of Tajiri’s mother at the desert water faucet—and there are two film stills of palm trees, which text identifies as “Date Palm Grove, Poston, 1988: Planted by internees, 1942.” In this landscape of neglect and ruin, the palm trees, like wildflowers, figure as an ambivalent symbol of transformation, of both death and regeneration. Tajiri concludes the film with similar ambivalence. Ultimately she finds affective reconciliation with her mother, realizing that the recurring image of her mother at the water faucet is rooted in a memory of a rare story her mother once told of her years in camp, and states: “Now I found I could connect the picture to the story. I could forgive my mother her loss of memory.” This sentiment is complicated by the final frame of the film, which pans out to a desolate road near the Poston desert, a refusal to find aesthetic resolution in natural vitality. The viewer is left only with a sweep of the empty highway, electrical wires in the distance, and the shrill cry of a hawk. David Eng calls it a “scene of unfolding, a scene of discursive emptiness.” 130 It is quite literally a scene of negative space that refuses to animate a central subject. This final vision of landscape is not a romantic symbol of belonging to landscape but, rather, of how the landscape itself is a witness to the necropolitical dimension of the drive to annihilate abstraction within an ideology of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. As symbols of death’s remainder, Komoko’s and Tajiri’s mother’s wildflowers represent the inverted growth of the underworld of Japanese internment, one for which Ruth Asawa’s upside-down tree similarly evokes “those things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” Conclusion This chapter explores how Japanese internment was less a final episode in a record of anti-Asian exclusion that began in the nineteenth century than a turning point that created conditions for the resignification of Japanese labor as efficient and tractable—the core tenets of the model minority myth—only after being reconstituted as a dependent, surplus labor population. As a result, our understanding of the outcome of Japanese internment in North America shifts the foundational distinction of land and labor that Patrick Wolfe identifies for delineating the interplay of elimination and exclusion that Indigenous peoples and African Americans have been subject to, respectively. In the case of Native North Americans, elimination was achieved through a spectrum of tactics that included genocidal campaigns and the move toward the “statistical elimination” of Indigenous peoples through the strategic dilution of blood-quantum. Exclusion, on the other hand, represents the undissolvable blackness as a transferable category of a racial underclass. Thus the example of Japanese land dispossession and coerced labor within the project of Japanese internment adds a new dimension to this theorization of settler colonialism. In particular, the relocation, dispossession, and dispersal of Japanese North Americans follow a trajectory of colonial elimination through assimilation. In the process, Japanese North Americans underwent resignification: they started out embodying the threat of yellow peril and emerged as a dependent surplus labor force who exemplified liberal individualism rather than a collective, unnatural menace. In Canada, the elimination of Japanese Canadians from the West Coast was achieved through the postwar dispersal program, which scattered Japanese Canadians across the prairies. In the United States, similarly, officials such as Dillon Myers at Poston worked to implement policies that would enable the disappearance of Japanese Americans. As Okimoto recounts, Myers’s belief was that Japanese Americans should “melt or boil away.” 131 In 1943, Myers’s relocation program—an assimilation program—was designed to relocate and disperse Japanese Americans east of the western states. On their release, only half of former West Coast residents returned; the rest relocated to Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Denver, and New York. 132 Turning the revolving door of colonial history, when Myers became commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (formerly the OIA ) in 1950, he reimplemented the relocation policy for Native nations. Okimoto explains that “under this policy, Indians were convinced to move out of reservations and into cities, where they were told jobs and a better life awaited them.” 133 Such relocation policies were instituted as pathways to “termination,” a policy exemplified in Canada’s failed 1969 White Paper, which sought to terminate First Nations special status, turning them into “equal” citizens with alienable property. Thus Japanese and Native bodies stood in as surplus populations against which conceptions of liberal individualism and property ownership were reconfigured and entrenched. Dispossession, relocation, and labor thus become the eliminatory conduits to “better, modern living.” The next chapter examines the brave new world of racial equivalents, where liberal individualism, corporate personhood, and market freedom reigns. In it I explore how the economic modality of Asian racialization becomes bifurcated and further entrenches the association of Asians with destructive abstraction. Specifically, I look at the significance of the post-1960s neoliberalization of immigration borders to reinforce the abstract racialization of Asians as both poor migrant labor and wealthy, flexible citizens.

Born into a poor Japanese farming family in Norwalk, California, in 1926, relocated in February 1942 to Santa Anita Racetrack and later interned at Rohwer Relocation Center, she was by 1946 an unlikely art student at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. When she emerged on the art scene in the mid-1950s, Asawa and her art were, perhaps inevitably, viewed through the prism of race and gender stereotypes. Critics were intent on either casting her sculptures as typically “Oriental” or dismissing them as decorative, feminine craft rather than modernist sculpture. 1 Because of their lack of grandiosity (in stark contrast to Gutzon Borglum’s colossal sculpture examined in the last chapter), Asawa’s sculptures were interpreted as insubstantial and thus feminine. Unlike the scale and orientation of Mount Rushmore, most of her sculptures are hanging or lie on the floor. In a telling review of her work in 1956, art critic Eleanor Munro contrasts her sculptures to the monumental and masculine qualities we could easily associate with Borglum: FIGURE 3.1 Ruth Asawa, Untitled , ca. 1960–1965. Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. © Ruth Asawa. These are “domestic” sculptures in a feminine, handiwork mode—small and light and unobtrusive for home decoration, not meant, as is much contemporary sculpture, to be hoisted by cranes, carted by vans and installed on mountainsides. 2 At a time when modernist aesthetics were defined through heroic, masculine traits, such as welding and cutting iron, 3 her innovative technique of weaving and tying industrial wire into shapes required viewers to engage with contradictory modalities of hardness and softness, heaviness and weightlessness, and movement and suspension. Asawa would eventually gain recognition for expanding the boundaries of sculpture by bringing visibility to the power of what she referred to as “negative space,” 4 the tension produced by the space inside and surrounding the materiality of the sculpture. In Asawa’s work, this negative space functions as an invisible force field that defines and directs the flow of energy. For the purposes of this chapter, Asawa’s work offers a visual metaphor for the negative space within and surrounding Japanese internment in North America. In particular, her tied-wire sculptures (figure 3.1 ) present a contextual frame for this chapter’s continuing focus on romantic anticapitalism. In her art practice Asawa was intent on exploring the limits of duality, making a “shape that was inside and outside at the same time . . . [something] that continually reverses itself.” 5 Her tied-wire sculptures’ continual inversions and reversals offer a visual motif of dialectical process—in stark contrast to romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical view of capitalist social relations as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions, between universalism and particularism. As I will develop in this chapter, this antinomical view led to an association of Japanese labor with the creation of unnatural value. Fusing the natural and the unnatural, Asawa’s sculptures hang from the ceiling as clusters of branches, bringing to mind a tree growing downward. As John Yau observes, “There is the forceful suggestion of an inverted world , reinforced by the downward pointing branching shadows cast on the wall.” 6 Reversing the properties of the trees depicted in the last chapter—the sturdy hang tree of Gonzales-Day’s photograph or anchoring trees of the Group of Seven’s paintings—this tree’s branches grow ever thinner and more delicate into fine needles. The fragility of the needles is paradoxically suggestive of both regeneration and evanescence. Yau points out the haunting effect of the shadows cast by the sculpture against the gallery wall: “The shadows branch down the nearby walls, conveying a ghostly domain in which everything is in reverse.” 7 Gravity, too, whose invisible, abstract force compels her forest of tied-wire trees upsidedown, captures the downward pull of mortality. The sculpture ultimately suspends the duality of the material and immaterial worlds, showcasing the interplay of wire, space, and shadow—whose impact is achieved by what is concretely visible and invisible, abstract. Encapsulating the human activity of tying wire with the abstract representation of natural forms, Asawa transcends personal biography while evoking those “things that your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” As such, her work offers an allegory of the dialectics of Japanese internment expressed in forms that are both figurative and nonfigurative. If Asawa’s inverted forest suggests an underworld where the immaterial but objective laws of gravity collapse into the concrete materiality of form, the works by Joy Kogawa and Rea Tajiri that I examine in this chapter extend this vision into both the concrete and affective dimensions of Japanese internment. Unlike the romantic landscapes of the last chapter, onto which a eugenic “natural” white settler identity could be projected, this chapter focuses on its unnatural, negatively abstract counterpart. In this sense, Asawa’s art’s abstract qualities also serve to capture aspects of Japanese internment in North America that defy concrete representational form, elements that contribute to the way Japanese internment can never be fully compartmentalized in the past. If Asawa’s upside-down tree serves as an unnatural marker of those “things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind,” its gravitational pull also suggests the weight of psychic excess. For Kogawa and Tajiri, the nightmares, visions, and complex identifications similarly constitute the haunting excess of Japanese internment, of a world mysteriously turned over. Attending to the competing theories that attribute Japanese internment to economic and/or racial causes, I probe the affective registers of Japanese internment—its negative space—whose insights exceed the empiricism of national historiography. In my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s shifting modes of cross-racial identification, first with Jewish and then Native intersections, I suggest that the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians to internment sites was motivated by a perception of the excessive industry of Japanese labor. This excessive efficiency was associated with having control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. Both texts offer a complementary view of this racialization expressed through modes of identification with Jewish peoples under Nazi persecution, animating a corresponding condition of destructive economic abstraction. After West Coast expulsion and relocation, however, Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value is neutralized as both texts turn to Japanese-Native intersections. Unlike the destructive economism associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents the romantic anticapitalist ideal of organic purity and concrete nature external to economic modernity. Thus Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts’ evoke how the brutality of relocation, internment, and labor exploitation function paradoxically to indigenize Japanese North Americans as surplus labor through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism. My reading focuses on how Kogawa and Tajiri evoke this transformation in the way they denaturalize the settler landscape in relation to labor. Japanese Internment as Irrationality and Postmemory In both Canada and the United States, the motivation and objective of expulsion have never been completely clear. Historians agree that Japanese expulsion from the West Coast was not, contrary to the rationale given in 1942, due to military necessity—or, by extension, Pearl Harbor. In Canada, Army and Navy leaders, in addition to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, opposed mass expulsion. 8 Although US Navy chiefs were hostile to Japanese Americans, the army’s General Staff opposed wholesale removal and argued that the chances of Japanese invasion were negligible. Moreover, the army’s intelligence unit and the FBI concurred that there had been no Japanese American sabotage during or after the Pearl Harbor attack. 9 The fact that most Japanese civilians in Hawaii were not interned speaks to the lack of credible threat posed by Japanese Americans. Ultimately, as Greg Robinson observes, “the ‘security’ sought by the West Coast could not be resolved by ordinary means because it did not depend on meeting and neutralizing actual threats.” 10 If not a military threat, whatever security these governments pursued meant that the label of “enemy alien” would be applied to small children, including those removed from orphanages, and, in the United States, individuals with one-sixteenth Japanese blood. What, then, was the threatening content of Japaneseness that would necessitate such an expansive and meticulous removal project? Beyond the Pearl Harbor thesis, Japanese internment has also been viewed as a continuation of exclusionary anti-Asian racism that began in the nineteenth century, first targeting Chinese migrants through immigration laws and then extended to other Asian ethnic groups. However, this explanation does not identify what elements of immigrant restriction functioned as antecedents to the qualitative specificity of dispossession, relocation, and confinement that are particular to the Japanese experience on the West Coast of North America. As a result, Colleen Lye points out, “the reliance on racism to explain a historical causation often leads to a dehistorization of racism.” 11 In other words, while we are aware of racial dynamics that are clearly in play, it is unclear how anti-Japaneseness extends or exceeds the logics of prior anti-Asian racism. Lye describes this as a failure to grasp “both the racial logic of internment and its historical specificity.” 12 It remains ambiguous what kind of racial animus was mobilized leading up to such catastrophic policy decisions of 1942, which have retrospectively been viewed as an aberration of western democratic principles. Economic theories of Japanese internment, in contrast, stress its rationality from the standpoint of white capitalists who stood to benefit from Japanese dispossession. Here Japanese internment is thought to have been engineered by influential economic stakeholders who stood to gain from the elimination of competition from Japanese labor and businesses. According to Gary Okihiro and David Drummond’s materialist theory of anti–Japanese American exploitation, immigration restriction was a precursor to Japanese internment. They argue that the anti-Asian racism from 1900 to the Immigration Act of 1924—which introduced a national origins quota system and effectively halted all Asian immigration—was based on the extraction of surplus-value from migrant labor exploitation. This was followed by a second period from 1924 to 1942, characterized by a model of internal colonialism in which value was extracted from racial rent premiums. 13 These premiums were tied to the passage of the Alien Land Law in California in 1913, which restricted property ownership and transfer to “citizens,” thus barring the Issei, who were “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” Okihiro and Drummond argue that “the alien land laws served to maintain Japanese tenancy and thus their economic dependence.” 14 They suggest that the crisis presented by Pearl Harbor enabled a “return to exclusionism and offered an opportunity for immediate profit and the expulsion of the Japanese from the level of farm operators.” 15 What remains unclear from Okihiro and Drummond’s periodization of anti-Asian racism is why one mode of economic exploitation was supplanted by the other. As Lye asks, “If mass removal and internal colonialism both share the principal aim of economic gain, what explains the priority of ‘quick profits’ over the long-term attractions of systemic dependency at one moment compared to another?” 16 Because the long-term profitability of rent premiums would greatly exceed the returns on mass removal, the economic motivation for Japanese internment becomes less clear. Further distorting the economic rationale of the Alien Land Laws, these laws led not to the contraction but to the expansion of Japanese farm acreage, which doubled between 1910 and 1920. 17 This blurs the precise objective of the Alien Land Laws, though the looming intersection of racialized dispossession and white property is undeniable. Revising Okihiro and Drummond’s theory, I argue that it is racism’s economic irrationality rather than rationality that forms the central medium of anti-Japanese feeling. This economic irrationality is crucially tied to the fundamental misreading of capitalism that I’ve been tracking in this book, one that nevertheless projects the economic benefit of racist policy without being actualized. From an expanded North American perspective, the economic irrationality of anti-Japanese sentiment was also visible in the 1920s in Canada, particularly in the fishing industry. 18 As Ken Adachi explains, in the 1920s the Department of Marine Fisheries attempted to take measures to eliminate Japanese Canadian competition in the British Columbia fishing industry, “gradually eliminat[ing] Orientals from the fishery” by reducing the number of licenses issued to them. 19 The denial of fishing licenses to Japanese Canadians was, analogous to US Alien Land Laws, not necessarily effective, and the negative effects stemming from the loss of Japanese canners and fishermen from the industry once again complicate a clear profit motivation. 20 As Masako Fukawa notes, “When rigidly enforced, the license reductions had a negative impact on the existing fishing industry” because there were not enough white fishermen to take the place of Japanese fishermen. 21 The reductions also created hardships for white fishermen who profited from Japanese launching and tugging services. Moreover, the Japanese who were pushed out of fishing were able to successfully adapt to other industries, such as small-scale berry farming and forestry. Thus, as an editor of the Vancouver Province noted of the Japanese in 1930, “We have hunted the Orientals out of the fishing industry and they have gone to the woods and they have gone to the farms. . . . We haven’t diminished their numbers; we have simply pushed them about.” 22 While the economic benefits for whites of Japanese exclusion from agriculture and fishing before Pearl Harbor were not always straightforward, the economic opportunities Japanese internment produced for whites in both farming and fishing industries was more transparent. When used to view the forced sale of Japanese Canadians private property, David Harvey’s translation of Marx’s concept of primitive accumulation as “accumulation by dispossession” seems particularly apt. Indeed, for sympathetic whites who protested the forced sales, such property dispossession recalled the Nazi’s confiscation of Jewish property under the Nuremberg Laws. 23 What this economic history shows, however, is how anti-Japanese agitation both subverted and supported white labor interests. Building on arguments in previous chapters, the mixed economic legacy of Japanese expulsion from the West Coast is shaped by the interplay of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism and the destructive abstraction embodied by Japanese labor. From the fundamental misperception at the heart of romantic anticapitalism, ridding the West of Japanese labor was necessary to prevent economic destruction rather than to profit from their disappearance. Within this book’s larger argument that the abstract forces within capitalism are biologized as Asian , this chapter probes how the destructively abstract content of Japaneseness mutates after the mass expulsion of Japanese civilians from the West Coast. Following the previous chapters’ focus on Asian labor as perverse and antinatural signifiers of abstract labor, I focus on the way Japanese labor transforms in this period from a dehumanizing symbol of modernization into an ideal surplus labor force. This mutation in the meaning of Japanese labor was shaped by the upheavals caused by technological modernization. From the Great Depression through the post–World War II era, modernization had profound effects on labor, urbanization, and domesticity. Since the 1920s, agriculture and fishing industries where Japanese labor was concentrated were transformed by new technologies, such as gas-powered plows and early sonar, 24 innovations that were accompanied by these industries’ steady consolidation into corporate monopolies. 25 Population booms in California and Vancouver led to rapid urbanization and suburbanization, giving the West Coast a distinctly “modern” identity. “Midcentury modernism” was the retrospective name given to the aesthetic, architectural, and cultural revolution that accompanied these rapid changes, reflecting a movement away from ornate traditional styles and toward the heightened rationalism of clean lines, functionality, and simplicity. As Andrew Shanken observes, technology was seen a “civilizing force” whereby “better living” became synonymous with modern homes equipped with lighting, electric appliances, and other efficiencies. 26 But the dark side of the fetishization of technological convenience, speed, and mobility was the reconstitution of labor power, environmental change, and a recalibration of the social order. And embedded in this culture of rapid modernization were deeply felt anxieties about social and economic displacement, a breeding ground for romantic anticapitalism. 27 In this state of anxiety and unpredictability comes renewed attention on the evils of abstraction and the glory of nature, purity, and the concrete. Counterintuitively, the machine—the key agent of modernization—was often anthropomorphized and fetishized as “anticapitalist.” As Postone explains, the “positive emphasis on ‘nature,’ on blood, the soil, concrete labor, and Gemeinschaft , can easily go hand in hand with a glorification of technology and industrial capital.” 28 Therefore, it was not simply the identification of Japanese labor with mechanization that becomes the target of romantic anticapitalism but, as I will develop later, an association of Japanese labor efficiency with the creation of unnatural value that is symptomatic of the destructive consequences of modernization. Evolving from a prior racialization as perverse and unnatural signs of abstract labor in the period leading up to mass removal, Japaneseness became the specter of dehumanization against a world of “better living.” However, in the war’s aftermath, Japanese labor was increasingly praised, helping to give rise to the model minority myth. This suggests a profound resignification of Asian labor during Japanese relocation and internment, from being associated with a dangerous efficiency before the war to a commendable productivity after it. As my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts demonstrates, this resignification turns on the symbolic alignment of Japaneseness with the destructive economism of Jewishness before the war, transforming into an association with a romanticized noneconomism of Indigeneity after relocation and internment. Unlike the negative economic abstraction associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents a sphere external to capitalism, symbolizing romantic anticapitalism’s ideal of concrete nature and purity. Within this complex imaginary of Japanese internment, through which Japaneseness undergoes a shift from a symbolic alignment with the Jew to the figure of the Native, I situate Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts in the frame of postmemory. 29 Marianne Hirsch describes postmemory as an affective connection to traumatic experiences that precedes a generation’s birth. For Hirsch it is a way of contextualizing the memories of the children of Holocaust survivors, whose experiences were nevertheless shaped by “cultural or collective traumatic events . . . distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection.” 30 She explains further that “postmemory is a powerful and very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 31 Rea Tajiri’s experimental film memoir, History and Memory , offers a powerful evocation of Hirsch’s description of postmemory in the personal narration she weaves through the film. In the melancholic tone of her voice-over she explains the quandary of having memories disconnected from experience. As a Sansei born over a decade after the release of Japanese American internees from camps, she is haunted by recurring memories—memories of events she never experienced directly—that confuse her sense of identity. Her film becomes an archive of her efforts to probe the emotional residue of Japanese internment that has been implanted into her own subjective experience: I began searching for a history, my own history. Because I had known all along the stories I’d heard were not true and parts had been left out. I remember having this feeling when I was growing up that I was haunted by something, that I was living within a family of ghosts. There was this place they knew about. I had never been there, yet I had a memory for it. Adding to the surreal nature of her connection to a foreign history is her mother’s inability to remember her own experience of wartime relocation to a camp in Poston, Arizona. In the film, her mother’s soft, barely audible voice is heard explaining, “There are so many things I’ve forgotten.” Accompanying her voice is scrolling text that reads: She tells the story of what she doesn’t remember But remembers one thing: Why she forgot to remember. Thus Tajiri’s film explores the paradoxical interplay of history and memory, capturing an irony that David Eng describes where “the mother has history but no memory, while the daughter has memory but no history. 32 This forms the central irony of postmemory, in which traumatic memories and feelings of loss are unconsciously passed from one generation to the next. Its haunting effects manifest in unrelieved sadness, akin to the experience that Grace Cho describes as transgenerational haunting, “a repetition of trauma that resists all attempts to erase it from personal and public memory.” 33 Eng situates Tajiri’s postmemory in the domain of melancholia, identifying how “the most difficult losses suffered in melancholia are unconscious ones, psychic forfeitures that cannot be properly grieved.” 34 Working through the melancholic layers of postmemory, the film gives visual representation to the negative space of Japanese internment. I expand on the “post-” of postmemory in my reading of Joy Kogawa’s Obasan , referring not only to the memory that exists “after,” as in the case of Tajiri’s film, but also “beyond.” Here I am referring to the unconscious, psychic world of attachments that both draw on and exceed memory. Because she is a reserved person, much of the protagonist Naomi Nakane’s emotional complexity is conveyed through her graphic, often violent nightmares and daydreams—the negative space of her conscious, rational mind. Her dreams often take place in a wilderness landscape, peopled by relatives, bayonet-wielding soldiers, prosthetic-limbed women, and deceptively “real”-looking robots. Like Asawa’s inverted tree, these gothic landscapes convey the unconscious attachments and fears tied to the crisis of relocation, which, in the case of Naomi, is coupled with the disappearance of her mother. In addition, another sense of how the post of postmemory goes “beyond” memory in the novel is in the expression of dialectical consciousness. Although Kogawa experienced Japanese internment in Canada as a child, her novel’s blend of autobiographical elements, government documents, and archival sources accentuates the contested nature of personal memory and official history. If the “truth” exists, it exists somewhere between and beyond the text’s multiple authorial voices. 35 Similar to Tajiri’s mother, as an adult Naomi has repressed her internment experience: of relocation to a ghost town in the interior of British Columbia and postwar dispersal to a beet farm in Granton, Alberta. The terrain of memory that Naomi uncovers is neither linear, individual, nor finite. Mona Oikawa describes Naomi’s complex reckoning with the past this way: “As [she] struggles to remember and to know, she confronts the complex ways in which memory is revelatory, both through remembering and forgetting.” 36 Thus the post of post-memory also refers to the memory of willful forgetting. The Jewish Question In Obasan and History and Memory , the economic modality of anti-Japanese sentiment is rendered through moments of cross-racial identification and, as I argue in the following section, through the postmemory of landscape. First, in indirect and overt examples, the persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime and the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples serve as analogical frames for each text’s reckoning with the meaning of Japanese internment. In Obasan , general observations of economic jealousy subtly refract the financial modality of anti-Semitism. As Naomi sorts through old letters in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, she comes across one of the many unopened letters her Aunt Emily wrote to her sister, Naomi’s mother, who was unable to return home from a visit to Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In the letter, written before the family’s expulsion from Vancouver, Aunt Emily reveals an awareness of economic resentment of Japanese Canadian prosperity, noting that “when gas rationing starts [Dad] won’t be able to use the car much. It’s so sleek it’s an affront to everyone he passes. I wish he’d bought something more modest, but you know Dad.” 37 Presumably the car is also an affront to less affluent Japanese Canadians, but its acquisition also symbolizes Japanese mobility and access to liberal individualism, a status historically aligned with and guarded by whites. Later in the letter, after enumerating the way Japanese Canadians have become the enemy, Aunt Emily makes a more pointed connection between the effects of war on Jews and Japanese Canadians: The things that go on in wartime! Think of Hitler shiploading people into Poland or Germany proper to work for nothing in fields and factories far from home and children—stealing food from conquered people—captive labor. . . . War breeds utter insanity. Here at home there’s mass hatred of us simply because we’re of Japanese origin. 38 In this passage, Aunt Emily’s observations of Nazi tactics serve as an eerie premonition of what will ensue for Japanese Canadians, as Naomi’s father will be sent to labor on a road camp, while the remaining family will be twice relocated before settling as exploited labor on a beet farm in Alberta. Decades after the war, Aunt Emily becomes more direct in her allusions to Nazism as a cultural force. In answer to her rhetorical question “Why in a time of war with Germany and Japan would our government seize the property and homes of Canadian-born Canadians but not the homes of German-born Germans?” she replies to herself, “Racism. . . . The Nazis are everywhere.” 39 Thus from prewar to postwar reflections on Japanese internment, anti-Japanese sentiment is expressed through the economic and racial prism of anti-Semitism. Rea Tajiri’s film-memoir also makes reference to the specter of anti-Semitism, but as a threatening identification that is actively suppressed. Without sound, she incorporates scrolling text to highlight the way Japanese internment continues to be sanitized of any connotations of Nazi Germany: NEW YORK TIMES AUGUST 28, 1990 ASSEMBLYMAN GIL FERGUSON, REPUBLICAN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIF., SEEKS TO HAVE CHILDREN TAUGHT THAT JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE NOT INTERNED IN “CONCENTRATION CAMPS,” BUT RATHER WERE HELD IN “RELOCATION CENTERS” JUSTIFIED BY MILITARY NECESSITY. Tajiri’s inclusion of this text indicates that in 1990, forty-five years after the end of World War II, two years after the successful redress campaign, and following exhaustive debunking of theories of “military necessity,” the primary meaning of Japanese internment remains subject to ongoing deferral. 40 In light of wartime atrocities committed by the Nazis, Roosevelt’s initial references to Japanese “concentration camps” were actively redacted. As a result, Japanese internment could only be described through euphemism and negation, as not a concentration camp. Obasan ’s Aunt Emily shares a similar reaction to the discursive construction of internment camps as “Interior Housing Projects.” She observes, “With language like that you can disguise any crime.” 41 Tajiri’s silent, scrolling text thus captures the discursive predicament that Japanese internment poses, while emphasizing the ongoing threat of identifying Japanese internment with the symbolism of the Nazi regime. If we pursue the vexed intersection of Japanese internment and anti-Semitism raised in these texts, we find similar deferrals of meaning that attend the Holocaust. Moishe Postone’s reflection on West Germany’s emotional response to the late 1970s American television miniseries Holocaust illuminates some of the interpretive impasse that, in analogous fashion, surrounds Japanese internment in North America. In pursuing this intersection, my intention is not to conflate the stark disparity of outcomes of “concentration camps” in Europe and North America; rather, it is to further uncover an intersecting economism of anti-Semitic and anti-Japanese racialization. Observing the tendency in postwar Germany of Germans to deny having knowledge of the wartime existence of extermination camps, Postone reflects on the underlying sentiment masked by appeals to ignorance: “‘We didn’t know’ should be understood as ‘we still don’t want to know.’” 42 What Holocaust ultimately exposed about the public horrors against Jews, Russians, and Poles that occurred outside the camps “undermined the fiction that Nazi genocide was the affair of a small handful of people operating within a context hermetically sealed off from most of the soldiers as well as the rest of the German population.” 43 Similar to the ostensibly arbitrary but coordinated will of multiple governments to expel, confine, and/or deport Japanese civilians in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the precise motivation within National Socialism for exterminating Jews continues to evolve in the postwar era. Postone troubles theories of fascism and racial prejudice because neither can sufficiently account for what he calls the “qualitative specificity” 44 of the extermination of European Jews. This specificity, he observes, will “remain inexplicable so long as anti-Semitism is treated as a specific example of prejudice, xenophobia and racism in general, as an example of a scapegoat strategy whose victims could very well have been members of any other group.” 45 Within this qualitative specificity, neither fascism nor racism in general can explain why, during the German army’s defeat by the Red Army, they allocated a significant number of vehicles to transport Jews to gas chambers rather than for military reinforcements. 46 This reveals a biopolitics in which the extermination of Jews served a greater purpose than the preservation of German soldiers’ lives. Rather than profiting from the elimination of Jews, their extermination was itself a mode of German self-preservation against the evils of capitalism that Jews represented. What Japanese internment and the Holocaust share is a romantic anticapitalist logic. The transnational frame magnifies how Japanese North Americans were not interned to protect the coast, to rob them of their property (although white citizens certainly profited from their dispossession), to protect them, or to test their loyalty. Neither was the Holocaust motivated by profit or wartime security interests: “They were not exterminated for military reasons, or in order to violently acquire land (as was the case with American Indians and the Tasmanians), or in order to wipe out those segments of the population around whom resistance could most easily crystallize.” 47 Rather, in the case of Jews, the qualitative specificity was due to the kind of secular power attributed to them. This power was defined not as the resistance of an oppressed underclass but, rather, as the potentially greater force of a super-race—an overclass—whose power was “mysteriously intangible, abstract and universal.” 48 Given that romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes and glorifies the concrete dimensions of capitalist social relations, the abstract dimension “must find a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression.” 49 This biological carrier came in the form of the Jew: Because this power is not bound concretely, is not “rooted,” it is of staggering immensity and is extremely difficult to check. It stands behind phenomena, but is not identical with them. Its source is therefore hidden—conspiratorial. The Jews represent an immensely powerful, intangible, international conspiracy. 50 Within this romantic anticapitalist system of representation, Jews represented an immensely powerful conspiratorial force that contributed to the decline of traditional social formations, values, and institutions. Thus the eradication of Jews under National Socialism was a mode of preservation from the abstract evils of capitalism. If mass removal and internment of Japanese civilians in Canada and the United States was a protective measure, it was for the similarly mysterious and immense power attributed to them. This power, like that represented by European Jews, was defined not by the resistant power of the racialized poor, like that of African American or First Nations communities, but as a destructive economic conspiracy. The dangerous content of the power attributed to Japanese communities along the West Coast was alien, intangible, conspiratorial, and international. In contrast to European Jews’ segregation in financial sectors of the labor market—an alignment that was strongly associated with the abstract dimension of capitalism within the binarized social universe of romantic anticapitalism—Japanese communities were associated with farming, fishing, and retail labor. How did their labor come to represent such a negative power? In order to appreciate how the Japanese became “a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression” for the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, we can track the continuity in the evolution of racialized characterizations of “cheap” Chinese labor to the “excessive efficiency” of Japanese labor. As we saw in chapter 1 , Chinese associations with the temporal domination of abstract time rendered them a perverse, abstract counterpart to white “concrete” labor. In the rapidly industrializing context of nineteenth-century railroad building and mining, the laboring Chinese body came to signify the consolidation of abstract, homogeneous time that threatened normative social reproduction. Within this regime of intensified labor time, therefore, the Chinese body stood for the devaluation of white labor. In chapter 2 I explored how, when Asian immigration came largely to a halt in the 1920s in the United States and Canada, a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism was expressed in the masculinist personification of nature. As an embodiment of the temporal domination of abstract labor, which is fundamental to the determination of the value of labor-power, Asian aliens represented an antinatural force of value formation—the abstract antithesis of a concrete, pure, and Indigenous natural world. During the global Great Depression and in its aftermath, liberal protections in Canada and the United States intervened in determining the value of labor power to stabilize capitalism, with strategies that included minimum wage standards in British Columbia and Roosevelt’s New Deal labor safeguards in the 1930s. These worker protections may have subdued the perception that Asian bodies represented an abstract, alien force that devalued concrete white labor power. 51 However, as Japanese labor and ownership of boats, land, and equipment expanded alongside developments in industrial modernization, the abstract power embodied by Asian labor no longer represented the devaluation of white labor; rather, it represented the creation of unnatural value . The excessive industry associated with Japanese labor was threatening precisely because it fed a perception that they had control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. The form of relative surplus-value associated with the excessive industry of Japanese labor is transient. In “The Concept of Relative Surplus Value” in Capital , Marx asks why individual capitalists are driven to innovate, especially because their innovations are beneficial to the entire capitalist class. Specifically, efficiency measures reduce the value of labor power, increase the rate of exploitation, and generate more surplus-value. 52 Are innovators selfless individuals motivated to bolster the capitalist class? Marx says no: individual capitalists are driven to innovate not out of class interests but out of individual interests. When a capitalist innovates to produce a commodity more efficiently, the value of his or her product temporarily falls below its social value, which means “they have cost less labour-time than the great bulk of the same article produced under the average social conditions.” 53 As discussed in previous chapters, the immaterial but objective source of value is socially necessary labor time: “The real value of a commodity is not its individual, but its social value; that is to say, its value is not measured by the labour-time that the article costs the producer in each individual case, but the labour-time socially required for its production.” 54 The crucial gap between the actual time it takes to produce a product after innovations have been introduced and the socially necessary labor time is what yields a surplus on surplus-value. This extra profit—the relative surplus-value —is precisely what motivates the individual capitalist to innovate. However, this extra profit is only temporary. Once other capitalists adopt the same labor-saving innovation, the socially necessary labor time will adjust accordingly. As Marx explains, “This extra surplus-value vanishes as soon as the new method of production is generalized, for then the difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value vanishes.” 55 Because of the coercive nature of competition, the capitalist interest to profit from the temporal gap between a product’s individual and social value—the gap that constitutes relative surplus-value—is implicit within capitalism. What this means is that technical innovation or technological modernization does not occur solely as a result of someone’s creative genius; rather, as Marx emphasizes, “capital . . . has an immanent drive, and a constant tendency, towards increasing the productivity of labour, in order to cheapen commodities and, by cheapening commodities, to cheapen the worker himself.” 56 Innovation is part of capitalism’s “immanent drive” to devalue labor. Within this book’s larger claim that the abstract forces within capitalism are personified as Asian, the harmful content of Japanese labor thus appears as a negative symptom of modernizing innovation, whose destructive power catalyzes the unnatural creation of relative surplus-value. Evolving from an unnatural sign of abstraction, the Asian becomes a specter of destructive innovation in a landscape of ceaseless modernization. Born-Again Native Paradoxically, the obverse of the destructive economism traditionally associated with Jews occurs in a second mode of cross-racial identification depicted in Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts: symbolic attachments to and reflections on Indigenous peoples. In this case, I suggest that Japanese identification with Native peoples both replicates and exceeds the settler colonial romantic attachment to the Native in ways that reveal a transformation in the way Asians constitute abstract labor. As I discuss below, their identification with Native peoples is further shaped by the settler colonial conflation of Japanese enemy aliens with Native peoples. Japanese relocation, dispossession, and confinement thus emerge within a dual identificatory framework of anti-Semitic and settler colonial regimes. In Obasan , Naomi repeatedly aligns herself and members of her Japanese Canadian family with First Nations’ identities. At the onset of the novel, she accompanies her uncle to the ravine and imagines him as an American Indian warrior hero: Uncle could be Chief Sitting Bull squatting here. He has the same prairie-baked skin, the deep brown furrows like dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks. All he needs is a feather headdress, and he would be perfect for a picture postcard—“Indian Chief from Canadian Prairie”—souvenir of Alberta, made in Japan. 57 Here the optics of Japanese Canadian racial form are staged in correspondence to Native identity. The narrator’s depiction functions as an attempt to indigenize Uncle on two levels: first, his Indigeneity stems from a phenotypical convergence with Chief Sitting Bull that results in their same “prairie-baked skin,” and second, Uncle’s Indigeneity is established through his figurative embodiment of landscape, with “dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks.” Although this portrayal clearly intends to naturalize Japanese Canadians to the landscape, it also acknowledges the iterative circuits of dispossession and commodification that make it possible for a Japanese import to offer a “picture postcard” vision of Indigeneity. Naomi projects a similar analogy between Obasan, her aunt, and an Indigenous fighter. Gauging her aunt’s inability to integrate into a community of elderly white Canadians, she concludes that Obasan would be as “welcome as a Zulu warrior.” 58 Later, describing her moribund life as a schoolteacher, Naomi once again pauses to reflect on a shared Japanese and Native disposition. 59 She observes that “some of the Native children I’ve had in my classes over the years could almost pass for Japanese, and vice versa. There’s something in the animal-like shyness I recognize in the dark eyes. A quickness to look away.” 60 The implications of these figurative projections of cross-racial identification are justifiably vexed. On one hand, as Marie Lo explains, these identifications “blur the boundaries of what is Native and what is Japanese,” placing Japanese Canadians on a broader colonial continuum that begins with dispossession of Indigenous people. 61 On the other, as Lo also points out, these modes of Native identification participate in a long-standing Canadian settler nationalism that has sought to “elaborate a national and autochthonous claim to the land” 62 through white identifications with the figure of the Native. That the novel similarly attempts to naturalize Japanese Canadians is reflected no less problematically in Aunt Emily’s continual refrain “This is my own, my native land.” 63 However, as I suggest below, the precondition for this problematic identification with the Native is the dehumanizing effects of their transformation into surplus labor. Relocated to work a beet farm under postwar dispersal orders, the combined sterility of the landscape and tropes of human degeneracy expose the eliminatory logic of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. Tajiri’s film contains more subtle reflections on Japanese and Native American crossings, less through the mode of identification than spatial intersection. After her family was removed to the Salinas Rodeo Grounds barracks, Tajiri explains how they were relocated again by train to Poston, Arizona, “to live in part of an Indian reservation converted into a concentration camp.” The camp was built on a section of the Colorado River Tribal Indian Reservation. Tajiri’s film delicately probes the intersection of Japanese internees and Native residents by foregrounding the ironies of colonial dispossession. When she travels to Poston, a resident explains how “the government came in and overnight took over a section of the reservation and started to build the camps.” Tajiri emphasizes the poor quality of the barracks, which were made “of this really cheap unseasoned pine and finished [off] with this tar paper.” Later, she explains, “they tried to offer the barracks back to the Native Americans as compensation for the use of the land.” From this vantage point, Poston becomes a space where the dispossessed and the recipients of government “welfare” confront each other as exchangeable figures of colonial management. A single group photograph of Native mothers and children, titled 1942, Native American Residents, Poston , further accentuates how the internment camp was a space that, as Jodi Byrd points out, spatializes a “recursive colonialism that, during World War II, served to enjamb Japanese American detainees within the histories of containment and expropriation that strip lands and nations from American Indians.” 64 The intersection of Indigenous colonization and Japanese internment in the historical record further exemplifies the conflating tendency of this “recursive colonialism.” In particular, the bureaucratic structure governing the incarceration of 113,000 Japanese Americans in ten remote concentration camps was modeled on existing colonial operations. From 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA ) was largely staffed by personnel from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA ). Exemplifying the BIA-WRA connection was Dillon Myers, a ten-year veteran of the Indian Service, who was made director of the WRA for four years at Gila, Arizona, before assuming leadership of the BIA in 1950. 65 The similarities between the way the US government handled American Indians and Japanese internees often stemmed from Myers’s conflation of Japanese and Indigenous bodies. A colleague once assessed Myers’s tendency to collapse the two racial groups, remarking, “Like all of those guys [in the Indian Service] he feels that there are only two kinds of Indians—gooduns and baduns—and feels that Japs are Indians.” 66 Behind the barbed wire, Japanese internees at Poston, Arizona, drew similar comparisons in their inquiries about whether “they would be ‘kept’ the rest of their lives on reservations like Indians.” 67 Indeed, one of Eleanor Roosevelt’s chief objections to Japanese internment camps was that it risked producing a culture of dependency: “If we don’t look out we will create another Indian problem.” 68 Once Japanese Americans were interned, the economic threat associated with them was resignified as the economic burden of social welfare. In Canada, the government’s instinct was similarly to conflate Japanese internees and First Nations peoples. When the federal government was devising plans for the expulsion of twenty-two thousand Japanese Canadians from the hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, officials explored the possibility of using First Nations residential schools as sites for their internment. Although this plan was never executed, bureaucratic discourse functioned to fuse Japanese Canadians and First Nations as similarly alien to a white Canada and to promote Indigenous colonization as a useful template for Japanese internment. Mona Oikawa explains that one officer reporting to the British Columbia Security Commission stated, “We are hoping that mutually satisfactory arrangements can be made with your Commission so that the present staff could look after the Japanese on the basis somewhat similar to that applying in the case of the Indians.” 69 Thus, in stark contrast to conspiratorial and destructive associations of economic power, Japanese internees are here aligned with colonial subjects, who, as the last chapter demonstrated, have been romanticized as existing outside of time and money. One reading suggested by these seemingly incompatible identifications, from the abstract economism of the Jewish analogy to the concrete noneconomism of the Native analogy, is that Japanese internment and dispersal renovated the connotation of Japanese labor from that of unnatural, excessive industry to some other, more benevolent expression of labor symbolically aligned with Native peoples. Jodi Kim refers to this transformation as a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation,” in which Japanese American and Japanese Canadian subjects are transformed into a “model minority.” 70 Building on this approach, I turn now to the way Kogawa and Tajiri unpack the question of labor resignification and consider its implications for our understanding of the relationship between settler colonialism and romantic anticapitalism. Going Native as Surplus Labor Drawing on the way settler nationalism informs the use of Native figures in contemporary Anglophone Canadian literature, Marie Lo argues that Obasan ’s representation of Native figures “can be seen as a variant on mainstream nationalism, whereby authors who are marginalized and prevented from identifying with dominant Anglo-Canadian culture can find in Native culture ‘a prior superior culture with which to identify.’” 71 My own analysis examines the material preconditions for the novel’s alignment with Native identities. This effort is intended to serve a broader objective: to mine the transnationality of Japanese internment in North America through the figurative and spatial alignment with Indigenous peoples that is present in both Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts. If the figure of the Native functions as a settler colonial trope intended to naturalize Japanese Canadians, my analysis excavates the conditions of possibility that make such a trope accessible and legible within the imaginary of Japanese internment. In the case of Obasan , it is largely in the aftermath of the family’s double removal that an identification with Native peoples is most explicit. Specifically, Naomi’s descriptions of Uncle as Sitting Bull and Obasan as a Zulu warrior occur after decades living in Granton, Alberta. I argue that two elements condition this identification: first, that the figurative identification with Native identities relies on the symbolic transformation of labor from excessive efficiency to commendable productivity; and second, that this transformation is expressed as a process of devitalization, of both the land and the laborers themselves. What the novel exposes, therefore, is that the dehumanization of surplus labor reflects the eliminatory core of settler colonialism’s romantic fantasy of the Native and reveals the necropolitical interplay of settler colonialism’s relation to land and labor. Although the subject of labor has not been a central literary concern in Obasan criticism, it is essential to the historical context that Kogawa’s novel excavates. 72 As part of the West Coast removal process, the government created road labor camps for all able-bodied Japanese Canadian men to make badly needed improvements on neglected roadways in the hinterlands of British Columbia. 73 Sugar beet farmers who were desperate for wartime labor also capitalized on the removal orders by petitioning the government for Japanese Canadian laborers. 74 At the war’s end, when Japanese Canadians were forced to choose between deportation or “Eastern Placement”—relocation east of the Rockies—the Labour Department was responsible for expanding its network of placement offices. Having enjoyed the economic boom that Japanese labor brought to the beet-farming industry in Alberta, industry leaders benefited further from the continued West Coast exclusion orders. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. 75 This labor history figures in the material and speculative worlds of the Obasan . These policies had a direct impact on the reconfiguration of Naomi’s family, given that her uncle and father are among the men dispatched to remote road labor camps. Like many married men, Uncle is eventually permitted to rejoin the family in Slocan, the ghost town where they are interned. For reasons never made clear, Naomi’s father Tadashi is not reunited with the family until the war’s end. The family’s existence becomes increasingly abject after the war, when they are relocated again as part of the dispersal policy. Perhaps due to his frailty, the Department of Labor deems Tadashi “unsuitable for Eastern Placement,” 76 which results in his continued separation from the family and eventual death. The family is relocated to Granton, Alberta, where they endure the misery of being labor hands on the Barker beet farm, their home a converted chicken coop. For Naomi, it is the beet farm that becomes a central source of her trauma, the living nightmare of double relocation: “I cannot bear the memory. There are some nightmares from which there is no waking, only deeper and deeper sleep.” 77 Transforming reality into the language of dreams, these years on the Barker farm are what she refers to as the “sleepwalk years.” 78 The novel’s retrospective view of Japanese Canadian relocation emphasizes the mechanical degeneration of organic purity, of life reduced to deathly abjection. In Naomi’s dream-memories, the Japanese are progressively deanimated in a lifeless landscape. After Uncle dies, Naomi is pulled back to her postwar home in Granton, Alberta, to come to the side of her aging Obasan, her aunt and primary caregiver through and after the war years. She returns to find the house and her aunt in a parallel state of somnambulance, the house a living appendage of Obasan’s frail body, “where memories and dreams seep and mingle through cracks, settling on furniture and into upholstery.” 79 In Naomi’s first dream in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, its nightmarish quality turns on mechanical deception in nature. In the dream Naomi descends into what seems a prelapsarian Eden, but a heavy mist coats the landscape and at turns, transforms its human subjects. As the dream progresses, what comes into foggy relief is how nature meets the mechanical in a field of labor. In Naomi’s dream, the degeneration of human labor is figured as a process of prostheticization that highlights the dissonant intersection of Indigenous nature and mechanized efficiency. Accompanied by a nameless man, Naomi’s dream avatar descends on a mountainside forest to encounter another man and woman. For a fleeting moment, she catches a glimpse of the woman’s beauty, appearing “as she once was, naked, youthful, voluptuous.” 80 In this instant, the woman is Eve—pure, fertile, and without shame. But the vision quickly changes to reveal the woman in her current, fallen state. The dream’s imagery underscores the mechanistic degeneration of the human body. Her seductive curves have been transformed into sharp angles: “Her face is now harsh again and angular as quartz. . . . Her body, a matching squareness, is dense as earth.” 81 The vitality of the woman Naomi first encounters morphs into harsh quartz angularity. Her squareness suggests a uniformity and steel symmetry; she has more in common with metal than with flesh. The reference to her square body, as “dense as earth,” lends an organicism to her embodiment, yet the heaviness of the simile evokes death and entombment. The glimmer of Indigenous, Eve-like purity—“naked, youthful, voluptuous”—is transformed into the organic burden of earth that pulls the body downward so she is capable only of movements that are “slow and heavy as sleep.” 82 Labor enters the dream as an allegory of Naomi’s work on the Barker farm. In her dream nature and animate bodies undergo discipline and are transformed into disembodied, devitalized androids. The square woman is engaged in repetitive labor, her back bent over as her “arms sway and swing, front to back, back to front” 83 wielding a sickle, “harvesting the forest’s debris, gathering the branches into piles.” 84 Alongside her is a man, “taller thinner and precise—a British martinet.” 85 Naomi observes that he is in command; equipped with “pruner’s shears, he is cutting the trees.” 86 With her companion, Naomi is silently entreated into joining the woman and man in labor, threatened by the martinet, whose glance is “a raised baton”: 87 We move without question or references in an interminable unknowing without rules, without direction. No incident alerts us to an awareness of time. But at some subtle hour, the white mist is known to be gray, and the endlessness of labor has entered our limbs. Weariness. 88 The man, a vision of patriarchal militaristic authority, enforces the monotonous repetition of their labor, while his pruner’s shears cut into and discipline the natural landscape. He is accompanied by a “huge gentle beast—a lion or a dog” whose “obedience is phenomenal.” 89 But the beast too, to Naomi’s shock, is plastic: “The animal is a robot!” 90 What alerts her is its frozen yawn “when the mechanism that hinges the jaws has proven faulty.” 91 By this point, she observes that the laboring woman’s arms are now connected by “four hooks locked to make a hinge . . . [which] dangles as she approaches.” 92 Therefore, in the process of disciplining the landscape, animate bodies undergo prosthetic degeneration, while deceptively real-looking robots take the place of animals. There is no place here even for language, which devolves in this landscape of mechanized beings. Naomi hears the woman speaking, “but the words are so old they cannot be understood. . . . The language has been forgotten.” 93 The destructive rationalism and robotification in the dream allegorize both the progressive dehumanization of labor and the settler colonial disciplining of nature. Moreover, the dream accentuates the dehumanizing condition of surplus labor and the eliminatory spirit of settler colonialism. The dream’s apocalyptic vision of mechanized dehumanization captures the profound abjection of her years working on the devitalized landscape of the Barkers’ beet farm. 94 Like the machine people in her dream, the farm landscape is barren and unnatural. As though the land had been subjected to the pruning shears of the British martinet of Naomi’s nightmare, “here and there are straight unnatural rows of fierce almost leafless trees pruned like the brooms of a chimney sweep.” 95 Even the air is unwelcoming and brutal: “Here, the air is a fist.” 96 In this landscape where “plant growth is deliberate and fierce,” 97 both nature and machines are associated with death and confinement. “Round skull-shaped weeds” grow along the miles of “barbed wire fences,” 98 while “skeletons of farm machinery” lie between the shed and the farmhouse “like the remains of dinosaurs in a prehistoric battleground.” 99 Naomi’s dream refracts the prehistory of this lifeless landscape of coerced, unnatural growth. Succumbing to its deadening effects, Naomi feels like a “scarecrow or a skeleton in the wind.” 100 Her brother Stephen, too, is later haunted by monstrous scenes of mechanized nature, once dreaming that “a metallic insect the size of a tractor [was] webbing a grid of iron bars over him.” 101 Technological rationalism has turned the natural world upside-down, evoking the nightmarish scenes of her dream’s landscape of human degeneration and artifice. The condition of possibility for the way the novel attempts to indigenize Japanese Canadians through analogies to Native peoples centers on the dehumanization of labor. In this unnatural world, Naomi herself embodies the degeneration of the prosthetic-limbed woman who appears in her dream. Reproducing the metamorphosis of the woman from “youthful” and “voluptuous” into a harsh, square body with a face “angular as quartz,” 102 Naomi, too, “mind[s] growing ugly” in this prisonlike atmosphere where hardships are “so pervasive, so inescapable, so thorough it’s a noose around my chest and I cannot move anymore.” 103 Like the “endlessness of labor” 104 in the dream, Naomi’s work on the beet farm is a nightmare of repetition where she “will never be done thinning and weeding and weeding and weeding,” to the point that her body begins to degenerate into an empty shell while her “tear glands burn out.” 105 Collectively the family is turned into automatons that switch on or off, “obedient as machines,” 106 through their days filled with the emptiness of labor, seemingly outside of time, space, and sound: “There are no other people in the entire world. We work together all day. At night we eat and sleep. We hardly talk anymore.” 107 There is nothing of the symbolic purification in working the land associated with a romantic settler colonial vision of landscape. In this inverted world, both landscape and labor are disciplined and denaturalized into mechanical abstraction, which, as I will discuss further below, exemplifies the racialized condition of surplus labor. Through this gothic transformation of landscape and labor—and continued exclusion from the West Coast—the dangerous economism of Japanese labor in the prewar period mutates to commendable productivity; the enemy alien morphs into the ideal surplus labor population. As Naomi sifts through Aunt Emily’s package of wartime letters and documents, she finds a newspaper clipping filed under “Facts about evacuees in Alberta.” 108 A caption that reads “‘Grinning and Happy’: Find Jap Evacuees Best Beet Workers” accompanies a photograph of a smiling Japanese Canadian family posing by a pile of beets. 109 The article praises the all-time record crop produced by Japanese “evacuee” labor, who worked 65 percent of Alberta’s sugar beet acreage: “Generally speaking, Japanese evacuees have developed into most efficient beet workers, many of them being better than the transient workers who cared for beets in southern Alberta before Pearl Harbor.” 110 This account of the bountiful yields attributed to Japanese labor is striking in its contrast to the dangerous efficiency of prewar Japanese Canadian fishing crews, which previously warranted restrictions on licenses and even the use of gas-powered boats. Thus the symbolic transformation in the postwar era, to be celebrated as commendable productivity, turns on the relocation and resignification of labor. What is especially telling about the article is how Japanese labor is no longer set in relation to white labor. Rather than competing with white labor on the West Coast, the newspaper clipping positions Japanese labor in relation to “transient workers.” In short, Japanese Canadian laborers are reconstituted as superior figures of transient labor, which is possible only after their relocation and confinement. Under these coercive and immobilizing conditions of labor, what enables the mutation of Japanese Canadian labor is their alignment with surplus laboring populations referred to as the “transient workers” in the article. Shedding racialized associations to abstract labor, which is perceived as having a destructive hold on the creation of unnatural, relative surplus-value, Japanese labor is reconstituted into what Marx terms an “industrial reserve army.” As a surplus labor population, they regulate—for the benefit of capitalists—the interplay of technological innovation and human labor productivity in the process of capital accumulation. Marx describes the indispensable role played by the surplus population as follows: But if a surplus population of workers is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, this surplus population also becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalist accumulation, indeed it becomes a condition of the existence of the capitalist mode of production. It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, which belongs to capital just as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates a mass of human material always ready for exploitation by capital in the interests of capital’s own changing valorization requirements. 111 Clarifying the expendability at the root of this mode of labor exploitation, Roderick Ferguson explains, “Both superfluous and indispensable, surplus populations fulfill and exceed the demands of capital.” 112 It is precisely the condition of being disposable that I suggest produces the structural alignment with Native peoples who, as primary subjects of colonial elimination, are also exploited and similarly transformed into latent and then stagnant members of the industrial reserve army. 113 They are wage laborers who are subject to capitalism’s need for labor power in uneven quantities and qualities over space and time. Describing the effect of capitalism’s ability to “pivot” labor power, Ruth Gilmore explains that as “systemic expansions and contractions produce and throw off workers, those idled must wait, migrate, or languish until—if ever—new opportunities to sell their labor power emerge.” 114 This also demonstrates how settler colonial logics of elimination (from land) and exclusion (as exploited alien labor) are not mutually exclusive but dialectically connected. Given that the Native reservation system and urban relocation programs in Canada and the United States functioned to entrench the disposability of Indigenous labor, 115 Native people were especially susceptible to irregular employment. As such, as Marx notes, this surplus labor group “offers capital an inexhaustible reservoir of disposable labour power.” 116 Therefore, despite Naomi’s anger at the characterization of Japanese beet farm laborers as “Grinning and Happy,” it is this, their resignification as surplus labor, that connects Japanese bodies not to racialized value production but to the racialization of surplus labor populations, chief among them First Nations labor. 117 The availability of cross-racial identification in the novel turns on the transformation of Japanese abstract labor into surplus labor, a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation” that renews a white settler colonial hierarchy. 118 In sum, Obasan ’s presentation of a landscape of devitalization, a place where “something dead is happening, like the weeds that are left to bleach,” 119 offers several remaining insights. First, in this inverted world, the rehumanization of Japanese Canadians as surplus laborers who are “Grinning and Happy” relies on their dehumanization and dispossession. In other words, this indigenization reveals the dehumanized content at the core of romantic idealization of Native peoples. Second, in Kogawa’s identification of Uncle with Chief Sitting Bull and Obasan with a Zulu warrior—non-Canadian Indigenous peoples from the United States and South Africa, respectively—they exemplify a dual condition of alien-ness and Indigeneity that highlights the dialectical interplay of land and labor under settler colonialism that expropriates Indigenous land and exploits racialized labor. That the postwar period saw the coerced recruitment of Native laborers to fill more labor shortages in the southern Alberta sugar beet industry until the 1980s further exemplifies the instrumentality of disposable labor populations, which embodied the condition of hyperexploitability: it was more profitable to consign these laborers to seasonal hand labor than to rely on costlier machines and chemicals. As the central pivot in facilitating the evolution to modern, better living in western Canada, racialized surplus labor bridges the necropolitical dimension of Native elimination to alien exclusion. In Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory , the mutation of Japanese labor is similarly expressed in the devitalization associated with the landscape on a Native reservation. Unlike the purely symbolic identification with Native identities in Obasan , in Tajiri’s film indigenization turns on the relocation and confinement of Japanese internees to the shared colonial site of the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Poston, Arizona. Her film offers an illuminating complement to Kogawa’s focus on the degenerative, mechanistic landscape of surplus labor on the beet farm by further probing the dark registers of Japanese internment that are refracted onto the reservation. Contrasting the way the colonial disciplining and rehabilitation of racialized labor are mirrored in the disciplined, unnatural landscape in Obasan , the landscape in History and Memory also serves as a witness to the modes of erasure enacted upon Japanese labor. Through a combination of reenacted memories, Hollywood movie reels, text, and voice-overs, Japanese internment is presented as a source of knowledge that can be accessed only indirectly, through these tangled strands of representation. These are the multimedia artifacts of postmemory—memories and visions that are transmitted into Tajiri’s consciousness from elsewhere. As David Eng observes of the documentary’s experimental aesthetic, “Tajiri presents us with a complex argument concerning the supplemental relationship between political and affective histories of Japanese American internment that cannot be easily reconciled with dominant US or Japanese American accounts of the event.” 120 In particular, recurring scenes of water—connected to land irrigation and a water tower—overturn water’s associations with vitality and purification. Instead, water imagery serves as a collective trace of devitalization and degeneration. The theme of water is first established through repeated dramatizations of a memory that haunts Tajiri because it is not her own. In the vision her mother crouches at an outdoor tap, filling a canteen. We can identify the vision as postmemory from Tajiri’s description: I don’t know where this came from but I just had this fragment, this picture that’s always been in my mind. My mother, she’s standing at a faucet and it’s really hot outside, and she’s filling this canteen. And the water’s really cold, and it feels really good. And outside the sun is just so hot, it’s just beating down. And there’s this dust that gets in everywhere. And they’re always sweeping the floors. The scene is played several times from alternating vantage points, focusing in on the rush of water from the tap, the overflowing canteen, the back of her mother’s crouching body, and her mother’s face as she splashes water onto it. This visual refrain operates as an abstract contrast to the realism of films that rationalize Japanese internment through numerous Hollywood reenactments of Pearl Harbor and government-sponsored announcements justifying its wartime actions toward Japanese civilians. In the documentary’s continual return to the dislocated postmemory of water, Tajiri suggests that the meaning of Japanese internment has been overdetermined by Hollywood’s heroic action films and melodrama. Challenging this representational realism, Tajiri deconstructs the meaning of Japanese internment by presenting indirect channels of meaning that form a nonlinear collage of knowledge that focuses on what water reveals through what it conceals. Alongside the continual return to the scene of her mother at the fountain, a single Hollywood film recurs through the documentary, standing as an exception to normative representations of Japanese internment: Bad Day at Black Rock , a 1955 film that, like Tajiri’s documentary, deals with Japanese internment indirectly through absence rather than presence. 121 The strength of Bad Day at Black Rock for Tajiri is that despite the fact that no Japanese American character ever appears in the film, this absence constitutes a meaningful form of erasure and emptiness, analogous to the visual tension produced by the negative space of Asawa’s sculptures. Specifically, it is the disappearance of a man named Komoko in the film that Tajiri uses as a conceptual frame for understanding the Japanese internment experience at Poston. She explains, “Komoko never appears, not even a picture or a photograph.” She relates his disappearance to her family’s: “Komoko’s disappearance from Black Rock was like ours from history. His absence is his presence.” Again, the weight of Komoko’s absence reinforces Asawa’s concept of negative space, as a force that reveals and energizes what exceeds the visual representation and historiography of Japanese internment. Although Tajiri incorporates only selected clips of Bad Day at Black Rock , the entire arc of the film reveals a racialized projection of Japanese labor’s excessive efficiency, which generated unnatural value. Part revisionist western, part film noir, the film is saturated with mystery. Spencer Tracy stars as John Macreedy, a one-armed stranger who arrives in Black Rock, a forgotten town where, prior to his arrival, the train had not stopped in four years. Macreedy reveals almost nothing of himself, except that he is a World War II veteran whose purpose is to find a man named Komoko. The lawless townspeople react to his inquiries with intimidation and violence. Although the town’s unofficial leader, a man named Smith, claims that Komoko was sent to a Japanese internment camp after Pearl Harbor, Macreedy remains skeptical after finding wildflowers growing outside Komoko’s home, a sign that “something’s buried up there.” He eventually discovers that Komoko has been murdered. A rare ally in the town explains the rationale for the mob killing of Komoko one day after Pearl Harbor, which is the result neither of redirected anger for Pearl Harbor nor of any conflation of Japanese Americans with Japanese wartime enemies. Instead, it is Komoko’s excessive efficiency that has fueled economic resentment and conspiracy. The townsperson tells Macreedy that when the land that Komoko leased—land previously perceived to be too dry and sterile to be productive—yielded growth, they all “figured he must be cheating him . . . [because] you can’t grow anything without water.” But Komoko does find water by digging a deep well, “climb[ing] down sixty feet,” Macreedly learns. This reinforces a larger point in this chapter: that leading up to Japanese internment, Japanese labor was associated with the production of unnatural value—an unnatural hold on relative surplus-value. From the perspective of the townspeople in Black Rock, Komoko frustrated natural laws by growing things where there “never was any water.” Therefore, through the film’s symbolic logic, the discovery of water signifies unnatural growth. Like the recurrence of water imagery, the symbolism of wildflowers marks decomposition rather than growth and connects Bad Day at Black Rock to Japanese internment. Under a scene captioned “Flowers for Komoko’s Grave” appears Tajiri’s mother’s flower garden. Rather than serving as sentimental natural imagery, the textual emphasis on Komoko’s grave draws out the significance of Macreedy’s observation that the wildflowers he identifies in the film are signifiers of death. Having been in Italy during the war, Macreedy has learned that bodies buried in the ground decompose into nutrients that produce wildflowers. Tajiri capitalizes on the dual edge of this natural imagery, as sign of both degeneration and regeneration. In place of her mother’s memory, moreover, the wildflowers give materiality to the absence that is also a presence. Here the wildflowers symbolize a landscape that has become witness to events that have been erased or willfully forgotten. The connection between water, landscape, and labor helps to contextualize the repeated scenes of Tajiri’s mother at the water faucet in the larger context of the Poston camp. Tying these scenes into Komoko’s ability to bring water to an arid landscape, she notes, “That was the thing about the Japanese. They took barren lands and brought water to it. . . . The irony is that they did it again in Poston: brought water to the land and made things grow.” The new context for their labor at Poston enables a transformative regeneration symbolized by Tajiri’s mother’s flowers, which are simultaneously signifiers of death. The still photographs of a single water tower, one taken in 1942 and another in 1988, seem to stand as the only evidence of Japanese irrigation labor at Poston, the largest internment camp built in the United States. 122 That Poston was the site of a Native reservation and Japanese internment camp sets in motion what Ruth Okimoto calls “an ironic twist of history,” in which “the Japanese detainees at Poston experienced what American Indians did in the nineteenth and early 20th centuries.” 123 And it is my argument that this “ironic twist” turns on the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor. It is this spatial context of Japanese confinement on a Native reservation that renovates the prior association of water with unnatural growth in Bad Day at Black Rock to sustainability and productivity. As an uncanny precursor to Japanese confinement, Native Americans were similarly relocated to this desolate landscape. As Okimoto explains in her report Sharing a Desert Home , “Citing national security and the need to protect white settlers, the US government had similarly herded American Indians onto this desolate, arid, and unproductive stretch of land.” 124 Linking the postmemory of water and agriculture woven into Tajiri’s film, what Poston exemplifies, therefore, is the spatial paradox of surplus labor. The water tower evokes the way water imagery remains a material trace of an unnatural landscape through the dehumanization of surplus labor. 125 For both the War Relocation Authority, responsible for housing Japanese detainees, and the Office of Indian Affairs, which would manage the subjugation and irrigation projects, the use of Japanese labor represented the high point of settler colonial logics in the managed interplay of land and labor, elimination and exclusion. Not surprisingly, the Colorado River Indian Tribal supported neither the internment camps nor the colonization program. 126 The outcome was clearly advantageous mostly to whites, who benefited from the access to irrigation systems in the desert, in addition to the dispossessed Japanese property on the West Coast. Thus, from the deep well on Komoko’s land to the water tower at Poston, water is the conduit for and witness to both unnatural growth and exploited, invisible labor. To reiterate an earlier point, the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor turned on their conflation with Native populations. Opposing the enthusiasm for efficient Japanese labor, WRA Director Dillon Myers (who became head of the BIA in 1950) became openly concerned that if kept too long in confinement, Japanese internees would become “dependent like Native Americans.” 127 In stark contrast to the labor efficiency attributed to Japaneseness, Poston was (like other camps) a space of idled labor, where boredom and inactivity coexisted with coerced labor. This dual condition of coerced and idled labor is the primary condition of a surplus population of reserve labor. Given what Michael McIntyre identifies as “race’s long-standing use as a mark of labor,” 128 the prior association of Japaneseness with unnatural “abstract labor” undergoes colonial rehabilitation to the historically racialized category of surplus labor, whose exploitation reinforces whiteness as the basis for property acquisition and expansion. This is the movement from an alien mode of threatening racialized labor to a domesticated form of surplus, racialized labor. A statement by one white farmer plainly reveals the true beneficiaries of using Japanese labor to subjugate Native land: “It will develop a lot of land, bring in irrigation, so white farmers can use it. . . . Couldn’t let good land like that go to waste.” 129 Tajiri’s visual emphasis on the water tower at Poston stands as a remaining artifact of this history, which, like Komoko’s body, has been disappeared from the landscape of labor. For Tajiri it is only a stagnant, unpromising landscape that remains as evidence of the Japanese American internees confined at Poston, whose rehabilitation as surplus labor functioned ironically to indigenize their previously abstract alien labor. The signs that designate Indigenous peoples as surplus populations are continually reinforced through the film’s stark panoramas of the overgrown and decrepit state of the Poston barracks. They were turned over to Native American “colonists” after Japanese Americans were released in 1945 and used as classrooms until 1980. With the exception of an alcohol recovery center, the buildings that remain have deteriorated out of neglect. This is the colonial wasteland of surplus, disposed-of populations. The water tower remains, symbolizing the irrigation of Poston land in the Parker Irrigation Project—rearticulated through recurring dramatizations of Tajiri’s mother at the desert water faucet—and there are two film stills of palm trees, which text identifies as “Date Palm Grove, Poston, 1988: Planted by internees, 1942.” In this landscape of neglect and ruin, the palm trees, like wildflowers, figure as an ambivalent symbol of transformation, of both death and regeneration. Tajiri concludes the film with similar ambivalence. Ultimately she finds affective reconciliation with her mother, realizing that the recurring image of her mother at the water faucet is rooted in a memory of a rare story her mother once told of her years in camp, and states: “Now I found I could connect the picture to the story. I could forgive my mother her loss of memory.” This sentiment is complicated by the final frame of the film, which pans out to a desolate road near the Poston desert, a refusal to find aesthetic resolution in natural vitality. The viewer is left only with a sweep of the empty highway, electrical wires in the distance, and the shrill cry of a hawk. David Eng calls it a “scene of unfolding, a scene of discursive emptiness.” 130 It is quite literally a scene of negative space that refuses to animate a central subject. This final vision of landscape is not a romantic symbol of belonging to landscape but, rather, of how the landscape itself is a witness to the necropolitical dimension of the drive to annihilate abstraction within an ideology of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. As symbols of death’s remainder, Komoko’s and Tajiri’s mother’s wildflowers represent the inverted growth of the underworld of Japanese internment, one for which Ruth Asawa’s upside-down tree similarly evokes “those things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” Conclusion This chapter explores how Japanese internment was less a final episode in a record of anti-Asian exclusion that began in the nineteenth century than a turning point that created conditions for the resignification of Japanese labor as efficient and tractable—the core tenets of the model minority myth—only after being reconstituted as a dependent, surplus labor population. As a result, our understanding of the outcome of Japanese internment in North America shifts the foundational distinction of land and labor that Patrick Wolfe identifies for delineating the interplay of elimination and exclusion that Indigenous peoples and African Americans have been subject to, respectively. In the case of Native North Americans, elimination was achieved through a spectrum of tactics that included genocidal campaigns and the move toward the “statistical elimination” of Indigenous peoples through the strategic dilution of blood-quantum. Exclusion, on the other hand, represents the undissolvable blackness as a transferable category of a racial underclass. Thus the example of Japanese land dispossession and coerced labor within the project of Japanese internment adds a new dimension to this theorization of settler colonialism. In particular, the relocation, dispossession, and dispersal of Japanese North Americans follow a trajectory of colonial elimination through assimilation. In the process, Japanese North Americans underwent resignification: they started out embodying the threat of yellow peril and emerged as a dependent surplus labor force who exemplified liberal individualism rather than a collective, unnatural menace. In Canada, the elimination of Japanese Canadians from the West Coast was achieved through the postwar dispersal program, which scattered Japanese Canadians across the prairies. In the United States, similarly, officials such as Dillon Myers at Poston worked to implement policies that would enable the disappearance of Japanese Americans. As Okimoto recounts, Myers’s belief was that Japanese Americans should “melt or boil away.” 131 In 1943, Myers’s relocation program—an assimilation program—was designed to relocate and disperse Japanese Americans east of the western states. On their release, only half of former West Coast residents returned; the rest relocated to Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Denver, and New York. 132 Turning the revolving door of colonial history, when Myers became commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (formerly the OIA ) in 1950, he reimplemented the relocation policy for Native nations. Okimoto explains that “under this policy, Indians were convinced to move out of reservations and into cities, where they were told jobs and a better life awaited them.” 133 Such relocation policies were instituted as pathways to “termination,” a policy exemplified in Canada’s failed 1969 White Paper, which sought to terminate First Nations special status, turning them into “equal” citizens with alienable property. Thus Japanese and Native bodies stood in as surplus populations against which conceptions of liberal individualism and property ownership were reconfigured and entrenched. Dispossession, relocation, and labor thus become the eliminatory conduits to “better, modern living.” The next chapter examines the brave new world of racial equivalents, where liberal individualism, corporate personhood, and market freedom reigns. In it I explore how the economic modality of Asian racialization becomes bifurcated and further entrenches the association of Asians with destructive abstraction. Specifically, I look at the significance of the post-1960s neoliberalization of immigration borders to reinforce the abstract racialization of Asians as both poor migrant labor and wealthy, flexible citizens.

      "content": "CHAPTER 3 JAPANESE INTERNMENT AND THE MUTATION OF LABOR The only tree here is dead. —Joy Kogawa, Obasan Underworlds Paradox defined the late Ruth Asawa in life and art. Born into a poor Japanese farming family in Norwalk, California, in 1926, relocated in February 1942 to Santa Anita Racetrack and later interned at Rohwer Relocation Center, she was by 1946 an unlikely art student at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. When she emerged on the art scene in the mid-1950s, Asawa and her art were, perhaps inevitably, viewed through the prism of race and gender stereotypes. Critics were intent on either casting her sculptures as typically “Oriental” or dismissing them as decorative, feminine craft rather than modernist sculpture. 1 Because of their lack of grandiosity (in stark contrast to Gutzon Borglum’s colossal sculpture examined in the last chapter), Asawa’s sculptures were interpreted as insubstantial and thus feminine. Unlike the scale and orientation of Mount Rushmore, most of her sculptures are hanging or lie on the floor. In a telling review of her work in 1956, art critic Eleanor Munro contrasts her sculptures to the monumental and masculine qualities we could easily associate with Borglum: FIGURE 3.1 Ruth Asawa, Untitled , ca. 1960–1965. Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. © Ruth Asawa. These are “domestic” sculptures in a feminine, handiwork mode—small and light and unobtrusive for home decoration, not meant, as is much contemporary sculpture, to be hoisted by cranes, carted by vans and installed on mountainsides. 2 At a time when modernist aesthetics were defined through heroic, masculine traits, such as welding and cutting iron, 3 her innovative technique of weaving and tying industrial wire into shapes required viewers to engage with contradictory modalities of hardness and softness, heaviness and weightlessness, and movement and suspension. Asawa would eventually gain recognition for expanding the boundaries of sculpture by bringing visibility to the power of what she referred to as “negative space,” 4 the tension produced by the space inside and surrounding the materiality of the sculpture. In Asawa’s work, this negative space functions as an invisible force field that defines and directs the flow of energy. For the purposes of this chapter, Asawa’s work offers a visual metaphor for the negative space within and surrounding Japanese internment in North America. In particular, her tied-wire sculptures (figure 3.1 ) present a contextual frame for this chapter’s continuing focus on romantic anticapitalism. In her art practice Asawa was intent on exploring the limits of duality, making a “shape that was inside and outside at the same time . . . [something] that continually reverses itself.” 5 Her tied-wire sculptures’ continual inversions and reversals offer a visual motif of dialectical process—in stark contrast to romantic anticapitalism’s antinomical view of capitalist social relations as an opposition between concrete and abstract dimensions, between universalism and particularism. As I will develop in this chapter, this antinomical view led to an association of Japanese labor with the creation of unnatural value. Fusing the natural and the unnatural, Asawa’s sculptures hang from the ceiling as clusters of branches, bringing to mind a tree growing downward. As John Yau observes, “There is the forceful suggestion of an inverted world , reinforced by the downward pointing branching shadows cast on the wall.” 6 Reversing the properties of the trees depicted in the last chapter—the sturdy hang tree of Gonzales-Day’s photograph or anchoring trees of the Group of Seven’s paintings—this tree’s branches grow ever thinner and more delicate into fine needles. The fragility of the needles is paradoxically suggestive of both regeneration and evanescence. Yau points out the haunting effect of the shadows cast by the sculpture against the gallery wall: “The shadows branch down the nearby walls, conveying a ghostly domain in which everything is in reverse.” 7 Gravity, too, whose invisible, abstract force compels her forest of tied-wire trees upsidedown, captures the downward pull of mortality. The sculpture ultimately suspends the duality of the material and immaterial worlds, showcasing the interplay of wire, space, and shadow—whose impact is achieved by what is concretely visible and invisible, abstract. Encapsulating the human activity of tying wire with the abstract representation of natural forms, Asawa transcends personal biography while evoking those “things that your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” As such, her work offers an allegory of the dialectics of Japanese internment expressed in forms that are both figurative and nonfigurative. If Asawa’s inverted forest suggests an underworld where the immaterial but objective laws of gravity collapse into the concrete materiality of form, the works by Joy Kogawa and Rea Tajiri that I examine in this chapter extend this vision into both the concrete and affective dimensions of Japanese internment. Unlike the romantic landscapes of the last chapter, onto which a eugenic “natural” white settler identity could be projected, this chapter focuses on its unnatural, negatively abstract counterpart. In this sense, Asawa’s art’s abstract qualities also serve to capture aspects of Japanese internment in North America that defy concrete representational form, elements that contribute to the way Japanese internment can never be fully compartmentalized in the past. If Asawa’s upside-down tree serves as an unnatural marker of those “things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind,” its gravitational pull also suggests the weight of psychic excess. For Kogawa and Tajiri, the nightmares, visions, and complex identifications similarly constitute the haunting excess of Japanese internment, of a world mysteriously turned over. Attending to the competing theories that attribute Japanese internment to economic and/or racial causes, I probe the affective registers of Japanese internment—its negative space—whose insights exceed the empiricism of national historiography. In my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s shifting modes of cross-racial identification, first with Jewish and then Native intersections, I suggest that the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians to internment sites was motivated by a perception of the excessive industry of Japanese labor. This excessive efficiency was associated with having control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. Both texts offer a complementary view of this racialization expressed through modes of identification with Jewish peoples under Nazi persecution, animating a corresponding condition of destructive economic abstraction. After West Coast expulsion and relocation, however, Japanese labor’s association with the production of unnatural value is neutralized as both texts turn to Japanese-Native intersections. Unlike the destructive economism associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents the romantic anticapitalist ideal of organic purity and concrete nature external to economic modernity. Thus Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts’ evoke how the brutality of relocation, internment, and labor exploitation function paradoxically to indigenize Japanese North Americans as surplus labor through an ideology of romantic anticapitalism. My reading focuses on how Kogawa and Tajiri evoke this transformation in the way they denaturalize the settler landscape in relation to labor. Japanese Internment as Irrationality and Postmemory In both Canada and the United States, the motivation and objective of expulsion have never been completely clear. Historians agree that Japanese expulsion from the West Coast was not, contrary to the rationale given in 1942, due to military necessity—or, by extension, Pearl Harbor. In Canada, Army and Navy leaders, in addition to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, opposed mass expulsion. 8 Although US Navy chiefs were hostile to Japanese Americans, the army’s General Staff opposed wholesale removal and argued that the chances of Japanese invasion were negligible. Moreover, the army’s intelligence unit and the FBI concurred that there had been no Japanese American sabotage during or after the Pearl Harbor attack. 9 The fact that most Japanese civilians in Hawaii were not interned speaks to the lack of credible threat posed by Japanese Americans. Ultimately, as Greg Robinson observes, “the ‘security’ sought by the West Coast could not be resolved by ordinary means because it did not depend on meeting and neutralizing actual threats.” 10 If not a military threat, whatever security these governments pursued meant that the label of “enemy alien” would be applied to small children, including those removed from orphanages, and, in the United States, individuals with one-sixteenth Japanese blood. What, then, was the threatening content of Japaneseness that would necessitate such an expansive and meticulous removal project? Beyond the Pearl Harbor thesis, Japanese internment has also been viewed as a continuation of exclusionary anti-Asian racism that began in the nineteenth century, first targeting Chinese migrants through immigration laws and then extended to other Asian ethnic groups. However, this explanation does not identify what elements of immigrant restriction functioned as antecedents to the qualitative specificity of dispossession, relocation, and confinement that are particular to the Japanese experience on the West Coast of North America. As a result, Colleen Lye points out, “the reliance on racism to explain a historical causation often leads to a dehistorization of racism.” 11 In other words, while we are aware of racial dynamics that are clearly in play, it is unclear how anti-Japaneseness extends or exceeds the logics of prior anti-Asian racism. Lye describes this as a failure to grasp “both the racial logic of internment and its historical specificity.” 12 It remains ambiguous what kind of racial animus was mobilized leading up to such catastrophic policy decisions of 1942, which have retrospectively been viewed as an aberration of western democratic principles. Economic theories of Japanese internment, in contrast, stress its rationality from the standpoint of white capitalists who stood to benefit from Japanese dispossession. Here Japanese internment is thought to have been engineered by influential economic stakeholders who stood to gain from the elimination of competition from Japanese labor and businesses. According to Gary Okihiro and David Drummond’s materialist theory of anti–Japanese American exploitation, immigration restriction was a precursor to Japanese internment. They argue that the anti-Asian racism from 1900 to the Immigration Act of 1924—which introduced a national origins quota system and effectively halted all Asian immigration—was based on the extraction of surplus-value from migrant labor exploitation. This was followed by a second period from 1924 to 1942, characterized by a model of internal colonialism in which value was extracted from racial rent premiums. 13 These premiums were tied to the passage of the Alien Land Law in California in 1913, which restricted property ownership and transfer to “citizens,” thus barring the Issei, who were “aliens ineligible for citizenship.” Okihiro and Drummond argue that “the alien land laws served to maintain Japanese tenancy and thus their economic dependence.” 14 They suggest that the crisis presented by Pearl Harbor enabled a “return to exclusionism and offered an opportunity for immediate profit and the expulsion of the Japanese from the level of farm operators.” 15 What remains unclear from Okihiro and Drummond’s periodization of anti-Asian racism is why one mode of economic exploitation was supplanted by the other. As Lye asks, “If mass removal and internal colonialism both share the principal aim of economic gain, what explains the priority of ‘quick profits’ over the long-term attractions of systemic dependency at one moment compared to another?” 16 Because the long-term profitability of rent premiums would greatly exceed the returns on mass removal, the economic motivation for Japanese internment becomes less clear. Further distorting the economic rationale of the Alien Land Laws, these laws led not to the contraction but to the expansion of Japanese farm acreage, which doubled between 1910 and 1920. 17 This blurs the precise objective of the Alien Land Laws, though the looming intersection of racialized dispossession and white property is undeniable. Revising Okihiro and Drummond’s theory, I argue that it is racism’s economic irrationality rather than rationality that forms the central medium of anti-Japanese feeling. This economic irrationality is crucially tied to the fundamental misreading of capitalism that I’ve been tracking in this book, one that nevertheless projects the economic benefit of racist policy without being actualized. From an expanded North American perspective, the economic irrationality of anti-Japanese sentiment was also visible in the 1920s in Canada, particularly in the fishing industry. 18 As Ken Adachi explains, in the 1920s the Department of Marine Fisheries attempted to take measures to eliminate Japanese Canadian competition in the British Columbia fishing industry, “gradually eliminat[ing] Orientals from the fishery” by reducing the number of licenses issued to them. 19 The denial of fishing licenses to Japanese Canadians was, analogous to US Alien Land Laws, not necessarily effective, and the negative effects stemming from the loss of Japanese canners and fishermen from the industry once again complicate a clear profit motivation. 20 As Masako Fukawa notes, “When rigidly enforced, the license reductions had a negative impact on the existing fishing industry” because there were not enough white fishermen to take the place of Japanese fishermen. 21 The reductions also created hardships for white fishermen who profited from Japanese launching and tugging services. Moreover, the Japanese who were pushed out of fishing were able to successfully adapt to other industries, such as small-scale berry farming and forestry. Thus, as an editor of the Vancouver Province noted of the Japanese in 1930, “We have hunted the Orientals out of the fishing industry and they have gone to the woods and they have gone to the farms. . . . We haven’t diminished their numbers; we have simply pushed them about.” 22 While the economic benefits for whites of Japanese exclusion from agriculture and fishing before Pearl Harbor were not always straightforward, the economic opportunities Japanese internment produced for whites in both farming and fishing industries was more transparent. When used to view the forced sale of Japanese Canadians private property, David Harvey’s translation of Marx’s concept of primitive accumulation as “accumulation by dispossession” seems particularly apt. Indeed, for sympathetic whites who protested the forced sales, such property dispossession recalled the Nazi’s confiscation of Jewish property under the Nuremberg Laws. 23 What this economic history shows, however, is how anti-Japanese agitation both subverted and supported white labor interests. Building on arguments in previous chapters, the mixed economic legacy of Japanese expulsion from the West Coast is shaped by the interplay of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism and the destructive abstraction embodied by Japanese labor. From the fundamental misperception at the heart of romantic anticapitalism, ridding the West of Japanese labor was necessary to prevent economic destruction rather than to profit from their disappearance. Within this book’s larger argument that the abstract forces within capitalism are biologized as Asian , this chapter probes how the destructively abstract content of Japaneseness mutates after the mass expulsion of Japanese civilians from the West Coast. Following the previous chapters’ focus on Asian labor as perverse and antinatural signifiers of abstract labor, I focus on the way Japanese labor transforms in this period from a dehumanizing symbol of modernization into an ideal surplus labor force. This mutation in the meaning of Japanese labor was shaped by the upheavals caused by technological modernization. From the Great Depression through the post–World War II era, modernization had profound effects on labor, urbanization, and domesticity. Since the 1920s, agriculture and fishing industries where Japanese labor was concentrated were transformed by new technologies, such as gas-powered plows and early sonar, 24 innovations that were accompanied by these industries’ steady consolidation into corporate monopolies. 25 Population booms in California and Vancouver led to rapid urbanization and suburbanization, giving the West Coast a distinctly “modern” identity. “Midcentury modernism” was the retrospective name given to the aesthetic, architectural, and cultural revolution that accompanied these rapid changes, reflecting a movement away from ornate traditional styles and toward the heightened rationalism of clean lines, functionality, and simplicity. As Andrew Shanken observes, technology was seen a “civilizing force” whereby “better living” became synonymous with modern homes equipped with lighting, electric appliances, and other efficiencies. 26 But the dark side of the fetishization of technological convenience, speed, and mobility was the reconstitution of labor power, environmental change, and a recalibration of the social order. And embedded in this culture of rapid modernization were deeply felt anxieties about social and economic displacement, a breeding ground for romantic anticapitalism. 27 In this state of anxiety and unpredictability comes renewed attention on the evils of abstraction and the glory of nature, purity, and the concrete. Counterintuitively, the machine—the key agent of modernization—was often anthropomorphized and fetishized as “anticapitalist.” As Postone explains, the “positive emphasis on ‘nature,’ on blood, the soil, concrete labor, and Gemeinschaft , can easily go hand in hand with a glorification of technology and industrial capital.” 28 Therefore, it was not simply the identification of Japanese labor with mechanization that becomes the target of romantic anticapitalism but, as I will develop later, an association of Japanese labor efficiency with the creation of unnatural value that is symptomatic of the destructive consequences of modernization. Evolving from a prior racialization as perverse and unnatural signs of abstract labor in the period leading up to mass removal, Japaneseness became the specter of dehumanization against a world of “better living.” However, in the war’s aftermath, Japanese labor was increasingly praised, helping to give rise to the model minority myth. This suggests a profound resignification of Asian labor during Japanese relocation and internment, from being associated with a dangerous efficiency before the war to a commendable productivity after it. As my reading of Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts demonstrates, this resignification turns on the symbolic alignment of Japaneseness with the destructive economism of Jewishness before the war, transforming into an association with a romanticized noneconomism of Indigeneity after relocation and internment. Unlike the negative economic abstraction associated with Jewishness, Indigeneity represents a sphere external to capitalism, symbolizing romantic anticapitalism’s ideal of concrete nature and purity. Within this complex imaginary of Japanese internment, through which Japaneseness undergoes a shift from a symbolic alignment with the Jew to the figure of the Native, I situate Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts in the frame of postmemory. 29 Marianne Hirsch describes postmemory as an affective connection to traumatic experiences that precedes a generation’s birth. For Hirsch it is a way of contextualizing the memories of the children of Holocaust survivors, whose experiences were nevertheless shaped by “cultural or collective traumatic events . . . distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection.” 30 She explains further that “postmemory is a powerful and very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.” 31 Rea Tajiri’s experimental film memoir, History and Memory , offers a powerful evocation of Hirsch’s description of postmemory in the personal narration she weaves through the film. In the melancholic tone of her voice-over she explains the quandary of having memories disconnected from experience. As a Sansei born over a decade after the release of Japanese American internees from camps, she is haunted by recurring memories—memories of events she never experienced directly—that confuse her sense of identity. Her film becomes an archive of her efforts to probe the emotional residue of Japanese internment that has been implanted into her own subjective experience: I began searching for a history, my own history. Because I had known all along the stories I’d heard were not true and parts had been left out. I remember having this feeling when I was growing up that I was haunted by something, that I was living within a family of ghosts. There was this place they knew about. I had never been there, yet I had a memory for it. Adding to the surreal nature of her connection to a foreign history is her mother’s inability to remember her own experience of wartime relocation to a camp in Poston, Arizona. In the film, her mother’s soft, barely audible voice is heard explaining, “There are so many things I’ve forgotten.” Accompanying her voice is scrolling text that reads: She tells the story of what she doesn’t remember But remembers one thing: Why she forgot to remember. Thus Tajiri’s film explores the paradoxical interplay of history and memory, capturing an irony that David Eng describes where “the mother has history but no memory, while the daughter has memory but no history. 32 This forms the central irony of postmemory, in which traumatic memories and feelings of loss are unconsciously passed from one generation to the next. Its haunting effects manifest in unrelieved sadness, akin to the experience that Grace Cho describes as transgenerational haunting, “a repetition of trauma that resists all attempts to erase it from personal and public memory.” 33 Eng situates Tajiri’s postmemory in the domain of melancholia, identifying how “the most difficult losses suffered in melancholia are unconscious ones, psychic forfeitures that cannot be properly grieved.” 34 Working through the melancholic layers of postmemory, the film gives visual representation to the negative space of Japanese internment. I expand on the “post-” of postmemory in my reading of Joy Kogawa’s Obasan , referring not only to the memory that exists “after,” as in the case of Tajiri’s film, but also “beyond.” Here I am referring to the unconscious, psychic world of attachments that both draw on and exceed memory. Because she is a reserved person, much of the protagonist Naomi Nakane’s emotional complexity is conveyed through her graphic, often violent nightmares and daydreams—the negative space of her conscious, rational mind. Her dreams often take place in a wilderness landscape, peopled by relatives, bayonet-wielding soldiers, prosthetic-limbed women, and deceptively “real”-looking robots. Like Asawa’s inverted tree, these gothic landscapes convey the unconscious attachments and fears tied to the crisis of relocation, which, in the case of Naomi, is coupled with the disappearance of her mother. In addition, another sense of how the post of postmemory goes “beyond” memory in the novel is in the expression of dialectical consciousness. Although Kogawa experienced Japanese internment in Canada as a child, her novel’s blend of autobiographical elements, government documents, and archival sources accentuates the contested nature of personal memory and official history. If the “truth” exists, it exists somewhere between and beyond the text’s multiple authorial voices. 35 Similar to Tajiri’s mother, as an adult Naomi has repressed her internment experience: of relocation to a ghost town in the interior of British Columbia and postwar dispersal to a beet farm in Granton, Alberta. The terrain of memory that Naomi uncovers is neither linear, individual, nor finite. Mona Oikawa describes Naomi’s complex reckoning with the past this way: “As [she] struggles to remember and to know, she confronts the complex ways in which memory is revelatory, both through remembering and forgetting.” 36 Thus the post of post-memory also refers to the memory of willful forgetting. The Jewish Question In Obasan and History and Memory , the economic modality of anti-Japanese sentiment is rendered through moments of cross-racial identification and, as I argue in the following section, through the postmemory of landscape. First, in indirect and overt examples, the persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime and the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples serve as analogical frames for each text’s reckoning with the meaning of Japanese internment. In Obasan , general observations of economic jealousy subtly refract the financial modality of anti-Semitism. As Naomi sorts through old letters in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, she comes across one of the many unopened letters her Aunt Emily wrote to her sister, Naomi’s mother, who was unable to return home from a visit to Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In the letter, written before the family’s expulsion from Vancouver, Aunt Emily reveals an awareness of economic resentment of Japanese Canadian prosperity, noting that “when gas rationing starts [Dad] won’t be able to use the car much. It’s so sleek it’s an affront to everyone he passes. I wish he’d bought something more modest, but you know Dad.” 37 Presumably the car is also an affront to less affluent Japanese Canadians, but its acquisition also symbolizes Japanese mobility and access to liberal individualism, a status historically aligned with and guarded by whites. Later in the letter, after enumerating the way Japanese Canadians have become the enemy, Aunt Emily makes a more pointed connection between the effects of war on Jews and Japanese Canadians: The things that go on in wartime! Think of Hitler shiploading people into Poland or Germany proper to work for nothing in fields and factories far from home and children—stealing food from conquered people—captive labor. . . . War breeds utter insanity. Here at home there’s mass hatred of us simply because we’re of Japanese origin. 38 In this passage, Aunt Emily’s observations of Nazi tactics serve as an eerie premonition of what will ensue for Japanese Canadians, as Naomi’s father will be sent to labor on a road camp, while the remaining family will be twice relocated before settling as exploited labor on a beet farm in Alberta. Decades after the war, Aunt Emily becomes more direct in her allusions to Nazism as a cultural force. In answer to her rhetorical question “Why in a time of war with Germany and Japan would our government seize the property and homes of Canadian-born Canadians but not the homes of German-born Germans?” she replies to herself, “Racism. . . . The Nazis are everywhere.” 39 Thus from prewar to postwar reflections on Japanese internment, anti-Japanese sentiment is expressed through the economic and racial prism of anti-Semitism. Rea Tajiri’s film-memoir also makes reference to the specter of anti-Semitism, but as a threatening identification that is actively suppressed. Without sound, she incorporates scrolling text to highlight the way Japanese internment continues to be sanitized of any connotations of Nazi Germany: NEW YORK TIMES AUGUST 28, 1990 ASSEMBLYMAN GIL FERGUSON, REPUBLICAN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIF., SEEKS TO HAVE CHILDREN TAUGHT THAT JAPANESE AMERICANS WERE NOT INTERNED IN “CONCENTRATION CAMPS,” BUT RATHER WERE HELD IN “RELOCATION CENTERS” JUSTIFIED BY MILITARY NECESSITY. Tajiri’s inclusion of this text indicates that in 1990, forty-five years after the end of World War II, two years after the successful redress campaign, and following exhaustive debunking of theories of “military necessity,” the primary meaning of Japanese internment remains subject to ongoing deferral. 40 In light of wartime atrocities committed by the Nazis, Roosevelt’s initial references to Japanese “concentration camps” were actively redacted. As a result, Japanese internment could only be described through euphemism and negation, as not a concentration camp. Obasan ’s Aunt Emily shares a similar reaction to the discursive construction of internment camps as “Interior Housing Projects.” She observes, “With language like that you can disguise any crime.” 41 Tajiri’s silent, scrolling text thus captures the discursive predicament that Japanese internment poses, while emphasizing the ongoing threat of identifying Japanese internment with the symbolism of the Nazi regime. If we pursue the vexed intersection of Japanese internment and anti-Semitism raised in these texts, we find similar deferrals of meaning that attend the Holocaust. Moishe Postone’s reflection on West Germany’s emotional response to the late 1970s American television miniseries Holocaust illuminates some of the interpretive impasse that, in analogous fashion, surrounds Japanese internment in North America. In pursuing this intersection, my intention is not to conflate the stark disparity of outcomes of “concentration camps” in Europe and North America; rather, it is to further uncover an intersecting economism of anti-Semitic and anti-Japanese racialization. Observing the tendency in postwar Germany of Germans to deny having knowledge of the wartime existence of extermination camps, Postone reflects on the underlying sentiment masked by appeals to ignorance: “‘We didn’t know’ should be understood as ‘we still don’t want to know.’” 42 What Holocaust ultimately exposed about the public horrors against Jews, Russians, and Poles that occurred outside the camps “undermined the fiction that Nazi genocide was the affair of a small handful of people operating within a context hermetically sealed off from most of the soldiers as well as the rest of the German population.” 43 Similar to the ostensibly arbitrary but coordinated will of multiple governments to expel, confine, and/or deport Japanese civilians in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the precise motivation within National Socialism for exterminating Jews continues to evolve in the postwar era. Postone troubles theories of fascism and racial prejudice because neither can sufficiently account for what he calls the “qualitative specificity” 44 of the extermination of European Jews. This specificity, he observes, will “remain inexplicable so long as anti-Semitism is treated as a specific example of prejudice, xenophobia and racism in general, as an example of a scapegoat strategy whose victims could very well have been members of any other group.” 45 Within this qualitative specificity, neither fascism nor racism in general can explain why, during the German army’s defeat by the Red Army, they allocated a significant number of vehicles to transport Jews to gas chambers rather than for military reinforcements. 46 This reveals a biopolitics in which the extermination of Jews served a greater purpose than the preservation of German soldiers’ lives. Rather than profiting from the elimination of Jews, their extermination was itself a mode of German self-preservation against the evils of capitalism that Jews represented. What Japanese internment and the Holocaust share is a romantic anticapitalist logic. The transnational frame magnifies how Japanese North Americans were not interned to protect the coast, to rob them of their property (although white citizens certainly profited from their dispossession), to protect them, or to test their loyalty. Neither was the Holocaust motivated by profit or wartime security interests: “They were not exterminated for military reasons, or in order to violently acquire land (as was the case with American Indians and the Tasmanians), or in order to wipe out those segments of the population around whom resistance could most easily crystallize.” 47 Rather, in the case of Jews, the qualitative specificity was due to the kind of secular power attributed to them. This power was defined not as the resistance of an oppressed underclass but, rather, as the potentially greater force of a super-race—an overclass—whose power was “mysteriously intangible, abstract and universal.” 48 Given that romantic anticapitalism hypostatizes and glorifies the concrete dimensions of capitalist social relations, the abstract dimension “must find a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression.” 49 This biological carrier came in the form of the Jew: Because this power is not bound concretely, is not “rooted,” it is of staggering immensity and is extremely difficult to check. It stands behind phenomena, but is not identical with them. Its source is therefore hidden—conspiratorial. The Jews represent an immensely powerful, intangible, international conspiracy. 50 Within this romantic anticapitalist system of representation, Jews represented an immensely powerful conspiratorial force that contributed to the decline of traditional social formations, values, and institutions. Thus the eradication of Jews under National Socialism was a mode of preservation from the abstract evils of capitalism. If mass removal and internment of Japanese civilians in Canada and the United States was a protective measure, it was for the similarly mysterious and immense power attributed to them. This power, like that represented by European Jews, was defined not by the resistant power of the racialized poor, like that of African American or First Nations communities, but as a destructive economic conspiracy. The dangerous content of the power attributed to Japanese communities along the West Coast was alien, intangible, conspiratorial, and international. In contrast to European Jews’ segregation in financial sectors of the labor market—an alignment that was strongly associated with the abstract dimension of capitalism within the binarized social universe of romantic anticapitalism—Japanese communities were associated with farming, fishing, and retail labor. How did their labor come to represent such a negative power? In order to appreciate how the Japanese became “a concrete vessel, a carrier, a mode of expression” for the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations, we can track the continuity in the evolution of racialized characterizations of “cheap” Chinese labor to the “excessive efficiency” of Japanese labor. As we saw in chapter 1 , Chinese associations with the temporal domination of abstract time rendered them a perverse, abstract counterpart to white “concrete” labor. In the rapidly industrializing context of nineteenth-century railroad building and mining, the laboring Chinese body came to signify the consolidation of abstract, homogeneous time that threatened normative social reproduction. Within this regime of intensified labor time, therefore, the Chinese body stood for the devaluation of white labor. In chapter 2 I explored how, when Asian immigration came largely to a halt in the 1920s in the United States and Canada, a settler colonial ideology of romantic anticapitalism was expressed in the masculinist personification of nature. As an embodiment of the temporal domination of abstract labor, which is fundamental to the determination of the value of labor-power, Asian aliens represented an antinatural force of value formation—the abstract antithesis of a concrete, pure, and Indigenous natural world. During the global Great Depression and in its aftermath, liberal protections in Canada and the United States intervened in determining the value of labor power to stabilize capitalism, with strategies that included minimum wage standards in British Columbia and Roosevelt’s New Deal labor safeguards in the 1930s. These worker protections may have subdued the perception that Asian bodies represented an abstract, alien force that devalued concrete white labor power. 51 However, as Japanese labor and ownership of boats, land, and equipment expanded alongside developments in industrial modernization, the abstract power embodied by Asian labor no longer represented the devaluation of white labor; rather, it represented the creation of unnatural value . The excessive industry associated with Japanese labor was threatening precisely because it fed a perception that they had control over relative surplus-value , the value produced above and beyond surplus-value. The form of relative surplus-value associated with the excessive industry of Japanese labor is transient. In “The Concept of Relative Surplus Value” in Capital , Marx asks why individual capitalists are driven to innovate, especially because their innovations are beneficial to the entire capitalist class. Specifically, efficiency measures reduce the value of labor power, increase the rate of exploitation, and generate more surplus-value. 52 Are innovators selfless individuals motivated to bolster the capitalist class? Marx says no: individual capitalists are driven to innovate not out of class interests but out of individual interests. When a capitalist innovates to produce a commodity more efficiently, the value of his or her product temporarily falls below its social value, which means “they have cost less labour-time than the great bulk of the same article produced under the average social conditions.” 53 As discussed in previous chapters, the immaterial but objective source of value is socially necessary labor time: “The real value of a commodity is not its individual, but its social value; that is to say, its value is not measured by the labour-time that the article costs the producer in each individual case, but the labour-time socially required for its production.” 54 The crucial gap between the actual time it takes to produce a product after innovations have been introduced and the socially necessary labor time is what yields a surplus on surplus-value. This extra profit—the relative surplus-value —is precisely what motivates the individual capitalist to innovate. However, this extra profit is only temporary. Once other capitalists adopt the same labor-saving innovation, the socially necessary labor time will adjust accordingly. As Marx explains, “This extra surplus-value vanishes as soon as the new method of production is generalized, for then the difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value vanishes.” 55 Because of the coercive nature of competition, the capitalist interest to profit from the temporal gap between a product’s individual and social value—the gap that constitutes relative surplus-value—is implicit within capitalism. What this means is that technical innovation or technological modernization does not occur solely as a result of someone’s creative genius; rather, as Marx emphasizes, “capital . . . has an immanent drive, and a constant tendency, towards increasing the productivity of labour, in order to cheapen commodities and, by cheapening commodities, to cheapen the worker himself.” 56 Innovation is part of capitalism’s “immanent drive” to devalue labor. Within this book’s larger claim that the abstract forces within capitalism are personified as Asian, the harmful content of Japanese labor thus appears as a negative symptom of modernizing innovation, whose destructive power catalyzes the unnatural creation of relative surplus-value. Evolving from an unnatural sign of abstraction, the Asian becomes a specter of destructive innovation in a landscape of ceaseless modernization. Born-Again Native Paradoxically, the obverse of the destructive economism traditionally associated with Jews occurs in a second mode of cross-racial identification depicted in Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts: symbolic attachments to and reflections on Indigenous peoples. In this case, I suggest that Japanese identification with Native peoples both replicates and exceeds the settler colonial romantic attachment to the Native in ways that reveal a transformation in the way Asians constitute abstract labor. As I discuss below, their identification with Native peoples is further shaped by the settler colonial conflation of Japanese enemy aliens with Native peoples. Japanese relocation, dispossession, and confinement thus emerge within a dual identificatory framework of anti-Semitic and settler colonial regimes. In Obasan , Naomi repeatedly aligns herself and members of her Japanese Canadian family with First Nations’ identities. At the onset of the novel, she accompanies her uncle to the ravine and imagines him as an American Indian warrior hero: Uncle could be Chief Sitting Bull squatting here. He has the same prairie-baked skin, the deep brown furrows like dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks. All he needs is a feather headdress, and he would be perfect for a picture postcard—“Indian Chief from Canadian Prairie”—souvenir of Alberta, made in Japan. 57 Here the optics of Japanese Canadian racial form are staged in correspondence to Native identity. The narrator’s depiction functions as an attempt to indigenize Uncle on two levels: first, his Indigeneity stems from a phenotypical convergence with Chief Sitting Bull that results in their same “prairie-baked skin,” and second, Uncle’s Indigeneity is established through his figurative embodiment of landscape, with “dry riverbeds creasing his cheeks.” Although this portrayal clearly intends to naturalize Japanese Canadians to the landscape, it also acknowledges the iterative circuits of dispossession and commodification that make it possible for a Japanese import to offer a “picture postcard” vision of Indigeneity. Naomi projects a similar analogy between Obasan, her aunt, and an Indigenous fighter. Gauging her aunt’s inability to integrate into a community of elderly white Canadians, she concludes that Obasan would be as “welcome as a Zulu warrior.” 58 Later, describing her moribund life as a schoolteacher, Naomi once again pauses to reflect on a shared Japanese and Native disposition. 59 She observes that “some of the Native children I’ve had in my classes over the years could almost pass for Japanese, and vice versa. There’s something in the animal-like shyness I recognize in the dark eyes. A quickness to look away.” 60 The implications of these figurative projections of cross-racial identification are justifiably vexed. On one hand, as Marie Lo explains, these identifications “blur the boundaries of what is Native and what is Japanese,” placing Japanese Canadians on a broader colonial continuum that begins with dispossession of Indigenous people. 61 On the other, as Lo also points out, these modes of Native identification participate in a long-standing Canadian settler nationalism that has sought to “elaborate a national and autochthonous claim to the land” 62 through white identifications with the figure of the Native. That the novel similarly attempts to naturalize Japanese Canadians is reflected no less problematically in Aunt Emily’s continual refrain “This is my own, my native land.” 63 However, as I suggest below, the precondition for this problematic identification with the Native is the dehumanizing effects of their transformation into surplus labor. Relocated to work a beet farm under postwar dispersal orders, the combined sterility of the landscape and tropes of human degeneracy expose the eliminatory logic of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. Tajiri’s film contains more subtle reflections on Japanese and Native American crossings, less through the mode of identification than spatial intersection. After her family was removed to the Salinas Rodeo Grounds barracks, Tajiri explains how they were relocated again by train to Poston, Arizona, “to live in part of an Indian reservation converted into a concentration camp.” The camp was built on a section of the Colorado River Tribal Indian Reservation. Tajiri’s film delicately probes the intersection of Japanese internees and Native residents by foregrounding the ironies of colonial dispossession. When she travels to Poston, a resident explains how “the government came in and overnight took over a section of the reservation and started to build the camps.” Tajiri emphasizes the poor quality of the barracks, which were made “of this really cheap unseasoned pine and finished [off] with this tar paper.” Later, she explains, “they tried to offer the barracks back to the Native Americans as compensation for the use of the land.” From this vantage point, Poston becomes a space where the dispossessed and the recipients of government “welfare” confront each other as exchangeable figures of colonial management. A single group photograph of Native mothers and children, titled 1942, Native American Residents, Poston , further accentuates how the internment camp was a space that, as Jodi Byrd points out, spatializes a “recursive colonialism that, during World War II, served to enjamb Japanese American detainees within the histories of containment and expropriation that strip lands and nations from American Indians.” 64 The intersection of Indigenous colonization and Japanese internment in the historical record further exemplifies the conflating tendency of this “recursive colonialism.” In particular, the bureaucratic structure governing the incarceration of 113,000 Japanese Americans in ten remote concentration camps was modeled on existing colonial operations. From 1942 to 1946, the US War Relocation Authority (WRA ) was largely staffed by personnel from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA ). Exemplifying the BIA-WRA connection was Dillon Myers, a ten-year veteran of the Indian Service, who was made director of the WRA for four years at Gila, Arizona, before assuming leadership of the BIA in 1950. 65 The similarities between the way the US government handled American Indians and Japanese internees often stemmed from Myers’s conflation of Japanese and Indigenous bodies. A colleague once assessed Myers’s tendency to collapse the two racial groups, remarking, “Like all of those guys [in the Indian Service] he feels that there are only two kinds of Indians—gooduns and baduns—and feels that Japs are Indians.” 66 Behind the barbed wire, Japanese internees at Poston, Arizona, drew similar comparisons in their inquiries about whether “they would be ‘kept’ the rest of their lives on reservations like Indians.” 67 Indeed, one of Eleanor Roosevelt’s chief objections to Japanese internment camps was that it risked producing a culture of dependency: “If we don’t look out we will create another Indian problem.” 68 Once Japanese Americans were interned, the economic threat associated with them was resignified as the economic burden of social welfare. In Canada, the government’s instinct was similarly to conflate Japanese internees and First Nations peoples. When the federal government was devising plans for the expulsion of twenty-two thousand Japanese Canadians from the hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, officials explored the possibility of using First Nations residential schools as sites for their internment. Although this plan was never executed, bureaucratic discourse functioned to fuse Japanese Canadians and First Nations as similarly alien to a white Canada and to promote Indigenous colonization as a useful template for Japanese internment. Mona Oikawa explains that one officer reporting to the British Columbia Security Commission stated, “We are hoping that mutually satisfactory arrangements can be made with your Commission so that the present staff could look after the Japanese on the basis somewhat similar to that applying in the case of the Indians.” 69 Thus, in stark contrast to conspiratorial and destructive associations of economic power, Japanese internees are here aligned with colonial subjects, who, as the last chapter demonstrated, have been romanticized as existing outside of time and money. One reading suggested by these seemingly incompatible identifications, from the abstract economism of the Jewish analogy to the concrete noneconomism of the Native analogy, is that Japanese internment and dispersal renovated the connotation of Japanese labor from that of unnatural, excessive industry to some other, more benevolent expression of labor symbolically aligned with Native peoples. Jodi Kim refers to this transformation as a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation,” in which Japanese American and Japanese Canadian subjects are transformed into a “model minority.” 70 Building on this approach, I turn now to the way Kogawa and Tajiri unpack the question of labor resignification and consider its implications for our understanding of the relationship between settler colonialism and romantic anticapitalism. Going Native as Surplus Labor Drawing on the way settler nationalism informs the use of Native figures in contemporary Anglophone Canadian literature, Marie Lo argues that Obasan ’s representation of Native figures “can be seen as a variant on mainstream nationalism, whereby authors who are marginalized and prevented from identifying with dominant Anglo-Canadian culture can find in Native culture ‘a prior superior culture with which to identify.’” 71 My own analysis examines the material preconditions for the novel’s alignment with Native identities. This effort is intended to serve a broader objective: to mine the transnationality of Japanese internment in North America through the figurative and spatial alignment with Indigenous peoples that is present in both Kogawa’s and Tajiri’s texts. If the figure of the Native functions as a settler colonial trope intended to naturalize Japanese Canadians, my analysis excavates the conditions of possibility that make such a trope accessible and legible within the imaginary of Japanese internment. In the case of Obasan , it is largely in the aftermath of the family’s double removal that an identification with Native peoples is most explicit. Specifically, Naomi’s descriptions of Uncle as Sitting Bull and Obasan as a Zulu warrior occur after decades living in Granton, Alberta. I argue that two elements condition this identification: first, that the figurative identification with Native identities relies on the symbolic transformation of labor from excessive efficiency to commendable productivity; and second, that this transformation is expressed as a process of devitalization, of both the land and the laborers themselves. What the novel exposes, therefore, is that the dehumanization of surplus labor reflects the eliminatory core of settler colonialism’s romantic fantasy of the Native and reveals the necropolitical interplay of settler colonialism’s relation to land and labor. Although the subject of labor has not been a central literary concern in Obasan criticism, it is essential to the historical context that Kogawa’s novel excavates. 72 As part of the West Coast removal process, the government created road labor camps for all able-bodied Japanese Canadian men to make badly needed improvements on neglected roadways in the hinterlands of British Columbia. 73 Sugar beet farmers who were desperate for wartime labor also capitalized on the removal orders by petitioning the government for Japanese Canadian laborers. 74 At the war’s end, when Japanese Canadians were forced to choose between deportation or “Eastern Placement”—relocation east of the Rockies—the Labour Department was responsible for expanding its network of placement offices. Having enjoyed the economic boom that Japanese labor brought to the beet-farming industry in Alberta, industry leaders benefited further from the continued West Coast exclusion orders. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. 75 This labor history figures in the material and speculative worlds of the Obasan . These policies had a direct impact on the reconfiguration of Naomi’s family, given that her uncle and father are among the men dispatched to remote road labor camps. Like many married men, Uncle is eventually permitted to rejoin the family in Slocan, the ghost town where they are interned. For reasons never made clear, Naomi’s father Tadashi is not reunited with the family until the war’s end. The family’s existence becomes increasingly abject after the war, when they are relocated again as part of the dispersal policy. Perhaps due to his frailty, the Department of Labor deems Tadashi “unsuitable for Eastern Placement,” 76 which results in his continued separation from the family and eventual death. The family is relocated to Granton, Alberta, where they endure the misery of being labor hands on the Barker beet farm, their home a converted chicken coop. For Naomi, it is the beet farm that becomes a central source of her trauma, the living nightmare of double relocation: “I cannot bear the memory. There are some nightmares from which there is no waking, only deeper and deeper sleep.” 77 Transforming reality into the language of dreams, these years on the Barker farm are what she refers to as the “sleepwalk years.” 78 The novel’s retrospective view of Japanese Canadian relocation emphasizes the mechanical degeneration of organic purity, of life reduced to deathly abjection. In Naomi’s dream-memories, the Japanese are progressively deanimated in a lifeless landscape. After Uncle dies, Naomi is pulled back to her postwar home in Granton, Alberta, to come to the side of her aging Obasan, her aunt and primary caregiver through and after the war years. She returns to find the house and her aunt in a parallel state of somnambulance, the house a living appendage of Obasan’s frail body, “where memories and dreams seep and mingle through cracks, settling on furniture and into upholstery.” 79 In Naomi’s first dream in the aftermath of her uncle’s death, its nightmarish quality turns on mechanical deception in nature. In the dream Naomi descends into what seems a prelapsarian Eden, but a heavy mist coats the landscape and at turns, transforms its human subjects. As the dream progresses, what comes into foggy relief is how nature meets the mechanical in a field of labor. In Naomi’s dream, the degeneration of human labor is figured as a process of prostheticization that highlights the dissonant intersection of Indigenous nature and mechanized efficiency. Accompanied by a nameless man, Naomi’s dream avatar descends on a mountainside forest to encounter another man and woman. For a fleeting moment, she catches a glimpse of the woman’s beauty, appearing “as she once was, naked, youthful, voluptuous.” 80 In this instant, the woman is Eve—pure, fertile, and without shame. But the vision quickly changes to reveal the woman in her current, fallen state. The dream’s imagery underscores the mechanistic degeneration of the human body. Her seductive curves have been transformed into sharp angles: “Her face is now harsh again and angular as quartz. . . . Her body, a matching squareness, is dense as earth.” 81 The vitality of the woman Naomi first encounters morphs into harsh quartz angularity. Her squareness suggests a uniformity and steel symmetry; she has more in common with metal than with flesh. The reference to her square body, as “dense as earth,” lends an organicism to her embodiment, yet the heaviness of the simile evokes death and entombment. The glimmer of Indigenous, Eve-like purity—“naked, youthful, voluptuous”—is transformed into the organic burden of earth that pulls the body downward so she is capable only of movements that are “slow and heavy as sleep.” 82 Labor enters the dream as an allegory of Naomi’s work on the Barker farm. In her dream nature and animate bodies undergo discipline and are transformed into disembodied, devitalized androids. The square woman is engaged in repetitive labor, her back bent over as her “arms sway and swing, front to back, back to front” 83 wielding a sickle, “harvesting the forest’s debris, gathering the branches into piles.” 84 Alongside her is a man, “taller thinner and precise—a British martinet.” 85 Naomi observes that he is in command; equipped with “pruner’s shears, he is cutting the trees.” 86 With her companion, Naomi is silently entreated into joining the woman and man in labor, threatened by the martinet, whose glance is “a raised baton”: 87 We move without question or references in an interminable unknowing without rules, without direction. No incident alerts us to an awareness of time. But at some subtle hour, the white mist is known to be gray, and the endlessness of labor has entered our limbs. Weariness. 88 The man, a vision of patriarchal militaristic authority, enforces the monotonous repetition of their labor, while his pruner’s shears cut into and discipline the natural landscape. He is accompanied by a “huge gentle beast—a lion or a dog” whose “obedience is phenomenal.” 89 But the beast too, to Naomi’s shock, is plastic: “The animal is a robot!” 90 What alerts her is its frozen yawn “when the mechanism that hinges the jaws has proven faulty.” 91 By this point, she observes that the laboring woman’s arms are now connected by “four hooks locked to make a hinge . . . [which] dangles as she approaches.” 92 Therefore, in the process of disciplining the landscape, animate bodies undergo prosthetic degeneration, while deceptively real-looking robots take the place of animals. There is no place here even for language, which devolves in this landscape of mechanized beings. Naomi hears the woman speaking, “but the words are so old they cannot be understood. . . . The language has been forgotten.” 93 The destructive rationalism and robotification in the dream allegorize both the progressive dehumanization of labor and the settler colonial disciplining of nature. Moreover, the dream accentuates the dehumanizing condition of surplus labor and the eliminatory spirit of settler colonialism. The dream’s apocalyptic vision of mechanized dehumanization captures the profound abjection of her years working on the devitalized landscape of the Barkers’ beet farm. 94 Like the machine people in her dream, the farm landscape is barren and unnatural. As though the land had been subjected to the pruning shears of the British martinet of Naomi’s nightmare, “here and there are straight unnatural rows of fierce almost leafless trees pruned like the brooms of a chimney sweep.” 95 Even the air is unwelcoming and brutal: “Here, the air is a fist.” 96 In this landscape where “plant growth is deliberate and fierce,” 97 both nature and machines are associated with death and confinement. “Round skull-shaped weeds” grow along the miles of “barbed wire fences,” 98 while “skeletons of farm machinery” lie between the shed and the farmhouse “like the remains of dinosaurs in a prehistoric battleground.” 99 Naomi’s dream refracts the prehistory of this lifeless landscape of coerced, unnatural growth. Succumbing to its deadening effects, Naomi feels like a “scarecrow or a skeleton in the wind.” 100 Her brother Stephen, too, is later haunted by monstrous scenes of mechanized nature, once dreaming that “a metallic insect the size of a tractor [was] webbing a grid of iron bars over him.” 101 Technological rationalism has turned the natural world upside-down, evoking the nightmarish scenes of her dream’s landscape of human degeneration and artifice. The condition of possibility for the way the novel attempts to indigenize Japanese Canadians through analogies to Native peoples centers on the dehumanization of labor. In this unnatural world, Naomi herself embodies the degeneration of the prosthetic-limbed woman who appears in her dream. Reproducing the metamorphosis of the woman from “youthful” and “voluptuous” into a harsh, square body with a face “angular as quartz,” 102 Naomi, too, “mind[s] growing ugly” in this prisonlike atmosphere where hardships are “so pervasive, so inescapable, so thorough it’s a noose around my chest and I cannot move anymore.” 103 Like the “endlessness of labor” 104 in the dream, Naomi’s work on the beet farm is a nightmare of repetition where she “will never be done thinning and weeding and weeding and weeding,” to the point that her body begins to degenerate into an empty shell while her “tear glands burn out.” 105 Collectively the family is turned into automatons that switch on or off, “obedient as machines,” 106 through their days filled with the emptiness of labor, seemingly outside of time, space, and sound: “There are no other people in the entire world. We work together all day. At night we eat and sleep. We hardly talk anymore.” 107 There is nothing of the symbolic purification in working the land associated with a romantic settler colonial vision of landscape. In this inverted world, both landscape and labor are disciplined and denaturalized into mechanical abstraction, which, as I will discuss further below, exemplifies the racialized condition of surplus labor. Through this gothic transformation of landscape and labor—and continued exclusion from the West Coast—the dangerous economism of Japanese labor in the prewar period mutates to commendable productivity; the enemy alien morphs into the ideal surplus labor population. As Naomi sifts through Aunt Emily’s package of wartime letters and documents, she finds a newspaper clipping filed under “Facts about evacuees in Alberta.” 108 A caption that reads “‘Grinning and Happy’: Find Jap Evacuees Best Beet Workers” accompanies a photograph of a smiling Japanese Canadian family posing by a pile of beets. 109 The article praises the all-time record crop produced by Japanese “evacuee” labor, who worked 65 percent of Alberta’s sugar beet acreage: “Generally speaking, Japanese evacuees have developed into most efficient beet workers, many of them being better than the transient workers who cared for beets in southern Alberta before Pearl Harbor.” 110 This account of the bountiful yields attributed to Japanese labor is striking in its contrast to the dangerous efficiency of prewar Japanese Canadian fishing crews, which previously warranted restrictions on licenses and even the use of gas-powered boats. Thus the symbolic transformation in the postwar era, to be celebrated as commendable productivity, turns on the relocation and resignification of labor. What is especially telling about the article is how Japanese labor is no longer set in relation to white labor. Rather than competing with white labor on the West Coast, the newspaper clipping positions Japanese labor in relation to “transient workers.” In short, Japanese Canadian laborers are reconstituted as superior figures of transient labor, which is possible only after their relocation and confinement. Under these coercive and immobilizing conditions of labor, what enables the mutation of Japanese Canadian labor is their alignment with surplus laboring populations referred to as the “transient workers” in the article. Shedding racialized associations to abstract labor, which is perceived as having a destructive hold on the creation of unnatural, relative surplus-value, Japanese labor is reconstituted into what Marx terms an “industrial reserve army.” As a surplus labor population, they regulate—for the benefit of capitalists—the interplay of technological innovation and human labor productivity in the process of capital accumulation. Marx describes the indispensable role played by the surplus population as follows: But if a surplus population of workers is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, this surplus population also becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalist accumulation, indeed it becomes a condition of the existence of the capitalist mode of production. It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, which belongs to capital just as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates a mass of human material always ready for exploitation by capital in the interests of capital’s own changing valorization requirements. 111 Clarifying the expendability at the root of this mode of labor exploitation, Roderick Ferguson explains, “Both superfluous and indispensable, surplus populations fulfill and exceed the demands of capital.” 112 It is precisely the condition of being disposable that I suggest produces the structural alignment with Native peoples who, as primary subjects of colonial elimination, are also exploited and similarly transformed into latent and then stagnant members of the industrial reserve army. 113 They are wage laborers who are subject to capitalism’s need for labor power in uneven quantities and qualities over space and time. Describing the effect of capitalism’s ability to “pivot” labor power, Ruth Gilmore explains that as “systemic expansions and contractions produce and throw off workers, those idled must wait, migrate, or languish until—if ever—new opportunities to sell their labor power emerge.” 114 This also demonstrates how settler colonial logics of elimination (from land) and exclusion (as exploited alien labor) are not mutually exclusive but dialectically connected. Given that the Native reservation system and urban relocation programs in Canada and the United States functioned to entrench the disposability of Indigenous labor, 115 Native people were especially susceptible to irregular employment. As such, as Marx notes, this surplus labor group “offers capital an inexhaustible reservoir of disposable labour power.” 116 Therefore, despite Naomi’s anger at the characterization of Japanese beet farm laborers as “Grinning and Happy,” it is this, their resignification as surplus labor, that connects Japanese bodies not to racialized value production but to the racialization of surplus labor populations, chief among them First Nations labor. 117 The availability of cross-racial identification in the novel turns on the transformation of Japanese abstract labor into surplus labor, a process of “gendered racial rehabilitation” that renews a white settler colonial hierarchy. 118 In sum, Obasan ’s presentation of a landscape of devitalization, a place where “something dead is happening, like the weeds that are left to bleach,” 119 offers several remaining insights. First, in this inverted world, the rehumanization of Japanese Canadians as surplus laborers who are “Grinning and Happy” relies on their dehumanization and dispossession. In other words, this indigenization reveals the dehumanized content at the core of romantic idealization of Native peoples. Second, in Kogawa’s identification of Uncle with Chief Sitting Bull and Obasan with a Zulu warrior—non-Canadian Indigenous peoples from the United States and South Africa, respectively—they exemplify a dual condition of alien-ness and Indigeneity that highlights the dialectical interplay of land and labor under settler colonialism that expropriates Indigenous land and exploits racialized labor. That the postwar period saw the coerced recruitment of Native laborers to fill more labor shortages in the southern Alberta sugar beet industry until the 1980s further exemplifies the instrumentality of disposable labor populations, which embodied the condition of hyperexploitability: it was more profitable to consign these laborers to seasonal hand labor than to rely on costlier machines and chemicals. As the central pivot in facilitating the evolution to modern, better living in western Canada, racialized surplus labor bridges the necropolitical dimension of Native elimination to alien exclusion. In Rea Tajiri’s History and Memory , the mutation of Japanese labor is similarly expressed in the devitalization associated with the landscape on a Native reservation. Unlike the purely symbolic identification with Native identities in Obasan , in Tajiri’s film indigenization turns on the relocation and confinement of Japanese internees to the shared colonial site of the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Poston, Arizona. Her film offers an illuminating complement to Kogawa’s focus on the degenerative, mechanistic landscape of surplus labor on the beet farm by further probing the dark registers of Japanese internment that are refracted onto the reservation. Contrasting the way the colonial disciplining and rehabilitation of racialized labor are mirrored in the disciplined, unnatural landscape in Obasan , the landscape in History and Memory also serves as a witness to the modes of erasure enacted upon Japanese labor. Through a combination of reenacted memories, Hollywood movie reels, text, and voice-overs, Japanese internment is presented as a source of knowledge that can be accessed only indirectly, through these tangled strands of representation. These are the multimedia artifacts of postmemory—memories and visions that are transmitted into Tajiri’s consciousness from elsewhere. As David Eng observes of the documentary’s experimental aesthetic, “Tajiri presents us with a complex argument concerning the supplemental relationship between political and affective histories of Japanese American internment that cannot be easily reconciled with dominant US or Japanese American accounts of the event.” 120 In particular, recurring scenes of water—connected to land irrigation and a water tower—overturn water’s associations with vitality and purification. Instead, water imagery serves as a collective trace of devitalization and degeneration. The theme of water is first established through repeated dramatizations of a memory that haunts Tajiri because it is not her own. In the vision her mother crouches at an outdoor tap, filling a canteen. We can identify the vision as postmemory from Tajiri’s description: I don’t know where this came from but I just had this fragment, this picture that’s always been in my mind. My mother, she’s standing at a faucet and it’s really hot outside, and she’s filling this canteen. And the water’s really cold, and it feels really good. And outside the sun is just so hot, it’s just beating down. And there’s this dust that gets in everywhere. And they’re always sweeping the floors. The scene is played several times from alternating vantage points, focusing in on the rush of water from the tap, the overflowing canteen, the back of her mother’s crouching body, and her mother’s face as she splashes water onto it. This visual refrain operates as an abstract contrast to the realism of films that rationalize Japanese internment through numerous Hollywood reenactments of Pearl Harbor and government-sponsored announcements justifying its wartime actions toward Japanese civilians. In the documentary’s continual return to the dislocated postmemory of water, Tajiri suggests that the meaning of Japanese internment has been overdetermined by Hollywood’s heroic action films and melodrama. Challenging this representational realism, Tajiri deconstructs the meaning of Japanese internment by presenting indirect channels of meaning that form a nonlinear collage of knowledge that focuses on what water reveals through what it conceals. Alongside the continual return to the scene of her mother at the fountain, a single Hollywood film recurs through the documentary, standing as an exception to normative representations of Japanese internment: Bad Day at Black Rock , a 1955 film that, like Tajiri’s documentary, deals with Japanese internment indirectly through absence rather than presence. 121 The strength of Bad Day at Black Rock for Tajiri is that despite the fact that no Japanese American character ever appears in the film, this absence constitutes a meaningful form of erasure and emptiness, analogous to the visual tension produced by the negative space of Asawa’s sculptures. Specifically, it is the disappearance of a man named Komoko in the film that Tajiri uses as a conceptual frame for understanding the Japanese internment experience at Poston. She explains, “Komoko never appears, not even a picture or a photograph.” She relates his disappearance to her family’s: “Komoko’s disappearance from Black Rock was like ours from history. His absence is his presence.” Again, the weight of Komoko’s absence reinforces Asawa’s concept of negative space, as a force that reveals and energizes what exceeds the visual representation and historiography of Japanese internment. Although Tajiri incorporates only selected clips of Bad Day at Black Rock , the entire arc of the film reveals a racialized projection of Japanese labor’s excessive efficiency, which generated unnatural value. Part revisionist western, part film noir, the film is saturated with mystery. Spencer Tracy stars as John Macreedy, a one-armed stranger who arrives in Black Rock, a forgotten town where, prior to his arrival, the train had not stopped in four years. Macreedy reveals almost nothing of himself, except that he is a World War II veteran whose purpose is to find a man named Komoko. The lawless townspeople react to his inquiries with intimidation and violence. Although the town’s unofficial leader, a man named Smith, claims that Komoko was sent to a Japanese internment camp after Pearl Harbor, Macreedy remains skeptical after finding wildflowers growing outside Komoko’s home, a sign that “something’s buried up there.” He eventually discovers that Komoko has been murdered. A rare ally in the town explains the rationale for the mob killing of Komoko one day after Pearl Harbor, which is the result neither of redirected anger for Pearl Harbor nor of any conflation of Japanese Americans with Japanese wartime enemies. Instead, it is Komoko’s excessive efficiency that has fueled economic resentment and conspiracy. The townsperson tells Macreedy that when the land that Komoko leased—land previously perceived to be too dry and sterile to be productive—yielded growth, they all “figured he must be cheating him . . . [because] you can’t grow anything without water.” But Komoko does find water by digging a deep well, “climb[ing] down sixty feet,” Macreedly learns. This reinforces a larger point in this chapter: that leading up to Japanese internment, Japanese labor was associated with the production of unnatural value—an unnatural hold on relative surplus-value. From the perspective of the townspeople in Black Rock, Komoko frustrated natural laws by growing things where there “never was any water.” Therefore, through the film’s symbolic logic, the discovery of water signifies unnatural growth. Like the recurrence of water imagery, the symbolism of wildflowers marks decomposition rather than growth and connects Bad Day at Black Rock to Japanese internment. Under a scene captioned “Flowers for Komoko’s Grave” appears Tajiri’s mother’s flower garden. Rather than serving as sentimental natural imagery, the textual emphasis on Komoko’s grave draws out the significance of Macreedy’s observation that the wildflowers he identifies in the film are signifiers of death. Having been in Italy during the war, Macreedy has learned that bodies buried in the ground decompose into nutrients that produce wildflowers. Tajiri capitalizes on the dual edge of this natural imagery, as sign of both degeneration and regeneration. In place of her mother’s memory, moreover, the wildflowers give materiality to the absence that is also a presence. Here the wildflowers symbolize a landscape that has become witness to events that have been erased or willfully forgotten. The connection between water, landscape, and labor helps to contextualize the repeated scenes of Tajiri’s mother at the water faucet in the larger context of the Poston camp. Tying these scenes into Komoko’s ability to bring water to an arid landscape, she notes, “That was the thing about the Japanese. They took barren lands and brought water to it. . . . The irony is that they did it again in Poston: brought water to the land and made things grow.” The new context for their labor at Poston enables a transformative regeneration symbolized by Tajiri’s mother’s flowers, which are simultaneously signifiers of death. The still photographs of a single water tower, one taken in 1942 and another in 1988, seem to stand as the only evidence of Japanese irrigation labor at Poston, the largest internment camp built in the United States. 122 That Poston was the site of a Native reservation and Japanese internment camp sets in motion what Ruth Okimoto calls “an ironic twist of history,” in which “the Japanese detainees at Poston experienced what American Indians did in the nineteenth and early 20th centuries.” 123 And it is my argument that this “ironic twist” turns on the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor. It is this spatial context of Japanese confinement on a Native reservation that renovates the prior association of water with unnatural growth in Bad Day at Black Rock to sustainability and productivity. As an uncanny precursor to Japanese confinement, Native Americans were similarly relocated to this desolate landscape. As Okimoto explains in her report Sharing a Desert Home , “Citing national security and the need to protect white settlers, the US government had similarly herded American Indians onto this desolate, arid, and unproductive stretch of land.” 124 Linking the postmemory of water and agriculture woven into Tajiri’s film, what Poston exemplifies, therefore, is the spatial paradox of surplus labor. The water tower evokes the way water imagery remains a material trace of an unnatural landscape through the dehumanization of surplus labor. 125 For both the War Relocation Authority, responsible for housing Japanese detainees, and the Office of Indian Affairs, which would manage the subjugation and irrigation projects, the use of Japanese labor represented the high point of settler colonial logics in the managed interplay of land and labor, elimination and exclusion. Not surprisingly, the Colorado River Indian Tribal supported neither the internment camps nor the colonization program. 126 The outcome was clearly advantageous mostly to whites, who benefited from the access to irrigation systems in the desert, in addition to the dispossessed Japanese property on the West Coast. Thus, from the deep well on Komoko’s land to the water tower at Poston, water is the conduit for and witness to both unnatural growth and exploited, invisible labor. To reiterate an earlier point, the mutation of Japanese labor from abstract to surplus labor turned on their conflation with Native populations. Opposing the enthusiasm for efficient Japanese labor, WRA Director Dillon Myers (who became head of the BIA in 1950) became openly concerned that if kept too long in confinement, Japanese internees would become “dependent like Native Americans.” 127 In stark contrast to the labor efficiency attributed to Japaneseness, Poston was (like other camps) a space of idled labor, where boredom and inactivity coexisted with coerced labor. This dual condition of coerced and idled labor is the primary condition of a surplus population of reserve labor. Given what Michael McIntyre identifies as “race’s long-standing use as a mark of labor,” 128 the prior association of Japaneseness with unnatural “abstract labor” undergoes colonial rehabilitation to the historically racialized category of surplus labor, whose exploitation reinforces whiteness as the basis for property acquisition and expansion. This is the movement from an alien mode of threatening racialized labor to a domesticated form of surplus, racialized labor. A statement by one white farmer plainly reveals the true beneficiaries of using Japanese labor to subjugate Native land: “It will develop a lot of land, bring in irrigation, so white farmers can use it. . . . Couldn’t let good land like that go to waste.” 129 Tajiri’s visual emphasis on the water tower at Poston stands as a remaining artifact of this history, which, like Komoko’s body, has been disappeared from the landscape of labor. For Tajiri it is only a stagnant, unpromising landscape that remains as evidence of the Japanese American internees confined at Poston, whose rehabilitation as surplus labor functioned ironically to indigenize their previously abstract alien labor. The signs that designate Indigenous peoples as surplus populations are continually reinforced through the film’s stark panoramas of the overgrown and decrepit state of the Poston barracks. They were turned over to Native American “colonists” after Japanese Americans were released in 1945 and used as classrooms until 1980. With the exception of an alcohol recovery center, the buildings that remain have deteriorated out of neglect. This is the colonial wasteland of surplus, disposed-of populations. The water tower remains, symbolizing the irrigation of Poston land in the Parker Irrigation Project—rearticulated through recurring dramatizations of Tajiri’s mother at the desert water faucet—and there are two film stills of palm trees, which text identifies as “Date Palm Grove, Poston, 1988: Planted by internees, 1942.” In this landscape of neglect and ruin, the palm trees, like wildflowers, figure as an ambivalent symbol of transformation, of both death and regeneration. Tajiri concludes the film with similar ambivalence. Ultimately she finds affective reconciliation with her mother, realizing that the recurring image of her mother at the water faucet is rooted in a memory of a rare story her mother once told of her years in camp, and states: “Now I found I could connect the picture to the story. I could forgive my mother her loss of memory.” This sentiment is complicated by the final frame of the film, which pans out to a desolate road near the Poston desert, a refusal to find aesthetic resolution in natural vitality. The viewer is left only with a sweep of the empty highway, electrical wires in the distance, and the shrill cry of a hawk. David Eng calls it a “scene of unfolding, a scene of discursive emptiness.” 130 It is quite literally a scene of negative space that refuses to animate a central subject. This final vision of landscape is not a romantic symbol of belonging to landscape but, rather, of how the landscape itself is a witness to the necropolitical dimension of the drive to annihilate abstraction within an ideology of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism. As symbols of death’s remainder, Komoko’s and Tajiri’s mother’s wildflowers represent the inverted growth of the underworld of Japanese internment, one for which Ruth Asawa’s upside-down tree similarly evokes “those things your body doesn’t allow you to leave behind.” Conclusion This chapter explores how Japanese internment was less a final episode in a record of anti-Asian exclusion that began in the nineteenth century than a turning point that created conditions for the resignification of Japanese labor as efficient and tractable—the core tenets of the model minority myth—only after being reconstituted as a dependent, surplus labor population. As a result, our understanding of the outcome of Japanese internment in North America shifts the foundational distinction of land and labor that Patrick Wolfe identifies for delineating the interplay of elimination and exclusion that Indigenous peoples and African Americans have been subject to, respectively. In the case of Native North Americans, elimination was achieved through a spectrum of tactics that included genocidal campaigns and the move toward the “statistical elimination” of Indigenous peoples through the strategic dilution of blood-quantum. Exclusion, on the other hand, represents the undissolvable blackness as a transferable category of a racial underclass. Thus the example of Japanese land dispossession and coerced labor within the project of Japanese internment adds a new dimension to this theorization of settler colonialism. In particular, the relocation, dispossession, and dispersal of Japanese North Americans follow a trajectory of colonial elimination through assimilation. In the process, Japanese North Americans underwent resignification: they started out embodying the threat of yellow peril and emerged as a dependent surplus labor force who exemplified liberal individualism rather than a collective, unnatural menace. In Canada, the elimination of Japanese Canadians from the West Coast was achieved through the postwar dispersal program, which scattered Japanese Canadians across the prairies. In the United States, similarly, officials such as Dillon Myers at Poston worked to implement policies that would enable the disappearance of Japanese Americans. As Okimoto recounts, Myers’s belief was that Japanese Americans should “melt or boil away.” 131 In 1943, Myers’s relocation program—an assimilation program—was designed to relocate and disperse Japanese Americans east of the western states. On their release, only half of former West Coast residents returned; the rest relocated to Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, Denver, and New York. 132 Turning the revolving door of colonial history, when Myers became commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (formerly the OIA ) in 1950, he reimplemented the relocation policy for Native nations. Okimoto explains that “under this policy, Indians were convinced to move out of reservations and into cities, where they were told jobs and a better life awaited them.” 133 Such relocation policies were instituted as pathways to “termination,” a policy exemplified in Canada’s failed 1969 White Paper, which sought to terminate First Nations special status, turning them into “equal” citizens with alienable property. Thus Japanese and Native bodies stood in as surplus populations against which conceptions of liberal individualism and property ownership were reconfigured and entrenched. Dispossession, relocation, and labor thus become the eliminatory conduits to “better, modern living.” The next chapter examines the brave new world of racial equivalents, where liberal individualism, corporate personhood, and market freedom reigns. In it I explore how the economic modality of Asian racialization becomes bifurcated and further entrenches the association of Asians with destructive abstraction. Specifically, I look at the significance of the post-1960s neoliberalization of immigration borders to reinforce the abstract racialization of Asians as both poor migrant labor and wealthy, flexible citizens.

      "content": "CHAPTER 4 THE NEW NINETEENTH CENTURY Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism Art Imitates Art Between 6 and 8 A.M . on four consecutive mornings in July 1978, multimedia artist Ken Lum stood on the east bank of the 152nd Street overpass leading rush-hour commuters into Vancouver from Surrey. Entertainment for Surrey , the grainy black-and-white video-recording of this performance, depicts Lum in jeans and a sweatshirt facing oncoming traffic, standing on a strip of grass on the side of the highway (figure 4.1 ). Recounting his experience, Lum observed, “The first day there was some reaction, the second day there was much more, but on the third day people ignored me.” 1 On the fourth day, many commuters had grown accustomed to him, honking and waving as their cars disappeared under the overpass. On the fifth and final morning of the performance, Lum replaced his body with a large white cardboard cutout of himself, a representation of the “living statue” he had become. 2 Lum explained that “people quickly came to expect me on the same spot. I became a sign.” 3 The humor in Lum’s comment is its double edge: he literally turned his body into a cardboard sign while, at the level of postmodern signification, his body became a referential sign. Turning the highway overpass into a performance art space and the Asian male body into a sign of repetition, Entertainment for Surrey collapses the boundary between literal and figurative representation. Even more dramatically, his performance probes the spatial absurdity of the individual—of individualism itself—in an urban environment designed to facilitate the movement of labor, goods, and capital. As Jeff Derksen observes, “The tension between mobility and fixity is often heightened by [Lum’s] grinding of the scales between the urban and the global and between capitalism and the subject.” 4 Only by recognizing his apparent lack of function or purpose could otherwise baffled commuters have been alerted to the artistic registers of his performance. For the purposes of this chapter, the way Lum stages a visual interruption in the flow of capitalist circulation offers new avenues for mining the abstractions signaled by the Asian body after the neoliberal turn. In the parallel urban literary world of Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange , another artist ascends the freeway overpass to deliver daily performances. Enter Manzanar Murasaki, the homeless Sansei who stands atop the Los Angeles Harbor Freeway at the downtown interchange to conduct an orchestra that he alone hears. For this grizzled, white-haired artist, it is “the complexity of human adventure over lines of transit” that fascinate him, and he is grateful for the opportunity to use his silver baton to direct the sounds of traffic, which amount to “nothing less than the greatest orchestra on Earth.” 5 Is he crazy? We learn that Manzanar was not always a conductor. He was once a skilled surgeon who abruptly left his profession, family, and friends to become a “missing person.” 6 He decided one day to exit the world he knew, “followed an ancient tortoise out into a deep place in his brain and stayed there year after year.” 7 Using the alias “Manzanar,” he references his birthplace at Manzanar Concentration Camp in the Owens Valley, where he was the first Sansei born into captivity during World War II. We learn that he could easily have applied his artistic talents to becoming “a sculptor in clay, wood, or even marble—any sort of inanimate substance”; however, “strangely, it was the abstraction of music that engulfed his being.” 8 Los Angeles commuters rarely take notice of him, though, thinking themselves “disconnected from a sooty homeless man on an overpass.” 9 Nevertheless, he had become a “fixture on the freeway overpass much like a mural or a traffic information sign or a tagger’s mark.” 10 Like Ken Lum in Entertainment for Surrey , Manzanar became a sign. Both Lum and Manzanar bear an uncanny resemblance to David Caspar Friedrich’s Wanderer above the Sea of Fog discussed in chapter 2 , the iconic embodiment of the Byronic hero surveying the vast, mountainous landscape before him. Even Buzzworm, the African American street philanthropist of Tropic of Orange , calls Manzanar the “ultimate romantic.” 11 However, while Lum and Manzanar evoke the individualism of the romantic figure, they do not adopt Albert Boime’s notion of a “magisterial gaze,” 12 given the total absence of control they exert over the oncoming traffic. Observing the way Manzanar responds to the dizzying urban flows of capitalist production with a “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting,” Mark Chiang highlights the irony that Manzanar “does not control anything. . . . His conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 13 Thus it is a kind of purposeful purposelessness that binds Lum and Manzanar, two Asian North Americans who abandoned their real and fictional lives as model minorities—Lum’s as a scientist and Manzanar’s as a surgeon—to yield to an artistic vision that would compel them to their respective freeway overpasses. Against the rational landscape of the freeway and the temporal organization of the workweek, both artists suspend and denaturalize the relation between the body and sign, embodying a postromantic subjectivity whose exaggerated nonproductivity constitutes a strange other of capitalism. Evoking forms of undisciplined labor power, Lum and Manzanar index a sphere of disability , a nonrehabilitative population that remains distinct from the exploitable population of racialized and gendered surplus labor. David T. Mitchell and Sharon Snyder designate nonproductive bodies as those “inhabitants of the planet who, largely by virtue of biological (in)capacity, aesthetic non-conformity, and/or non-normative labor patterns . . . [are] not merely excluded from—but also resistant to standardized labor demands of human value.” 14 They point to Antonio Negri’s term “living labor” to “suggest forms of creativity that cannot be reduced to an economic value.” 15 In this sense, both Lum and Manzanar stage a confrontation of capitalism’s naturalized modes of consumption, circulation, and social organization—using and misusing the freeway as motif of urban modernity. Most important for this chapter is how their bodies-as-sign animate new relations between labor and the Asian body against the flows of global capital. A utopian ideal of functional disruption captured by Lum’s and Manzanar’s performances guides this chapter’s focus on the ongoing racial abstractions assigned to the Asian body in an apocalyptic phase of contemporary capitalism. Describing the “catastrophic character of the current phase shift that global capital is undergoing,” Chris Nealon labels it a “late late capitalism.” 16 The previous chapters in this book have examined capitalism as a representational regime whose fetishism mystifies the social relations embedded in commodity production. Within its social distortion, I explored how alien Asian labor has since the nineteenth century functioned as biological signifier of the destructively abstract dimension of an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Moishe Postone ties the origins of this antinomy to the commodity form itself, wherein each commodity’s expression of use-value and exchange value is misperceived as an antinomical (rather than dialectical) relation of concrete and abstract dimensions. From this view, which I’ve described as a form of romantic anticapitalism, use-value appears concrete, “as objective in the sense of being objectlike, ‘material’ or ‘thingly,’” while exchange-value appears abstract,” as “general, homogenous, and abstracted from all particularity.” 17 In other words, even though a commodity such as a chair contains both use-value as something to sit on and exchange-value as a quantitative dimension that enables the chair to be bought and sold, romantic anticapitalism perceives these two characteristics as so completely disconnected they are oppositional—antinomical—rather than dialectically related. As a key ideological anchor of white settler colonialism, romantic anticapitalism always favors the qualitative over the quantitative. It prefers the concrete dimension for being natural, material, tactile, and thus closer to earthly origins in an increasingly artificial world. For the romantic anticapitalist, capitalism is identified solely with the abstract exchange dimension of the antinomy, while the concrete dimension is perceived as essentially noncapitalist. This book interprets anti-Asian racism as a fetishized, one-sided form of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism, an ideology that anthropomorphizes capitalism’s abstract dimension as alien Asian labor. As such, my first two chapters explored how Asian North American literature and visual culture exposes and disidentifies with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century association of Asian labor with an abstractly perverse, unnatural, and destructive economism that threatened the normative social reproduction of white concrete labor. In the third chapter, on postmemory narratives of Japanese internment in North America, I probed the extent of the destructiveness associated with Japanese labor, whose excessive efficiency and perceived control over the creation of relative surplus-value were key elements in the decision to relocate and confine Japanese civilians. Then, by connecting the relocation of Japanese North American labor to the settler colonial precedent of Native North American relocation evoked by these narratives, I argued that the exploitation of relocated Japanese labor contributed to the resignification of Japanese bodies as an ideal “surplus” labor force, dispossessed of any control over the creation of relative surplus-value. This facilitated a symbolic process that Jodi Kim calls “gendered racial rehabilitation,” 18 which enabled Japanese civilians to be aligned with the ameliorated status of model minority in the midst of civil rights activism in the United States during the Cold War. However, as this chapter will explore further, the neoliberal reconstitution of immigration laws in Canada and the United States in the latter twentieth century has reinforced the destructive abstraction associated with Asian alien surplus labor, an abstraction that comes into heightened relief in Vancouver and Los Angeles, two cities that refract urbanism, immigration, and trans-Pacific economic flows of labor, goods, and capital. Examining Karen Tei Yamashita’s Los Angeles as imagined in her 1997 novel Tropic of Orange alongside Ken Lum’s Vancouver through his multimedia works—concluding with a reading of his sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (1999)—my central argument in this chapter is that these artists bring into focus the border as a key apparatus of neoliberal multiculturalism that facilitates the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. I demonstrate how the neoliberalization of the border substitutes economic class for race, resulting in a bifurcated economism of Asian racialization. As John Park outlines, the unprecedented rise of skilled and affluent migrants from Asia has been coupled with the similar explosion in undocumented aliens; Park observes that in the United States “up to one million undocumented aliens are now from Asian countries. . . . Their numbers multiplied four or five times over the past 25 years.” 19 Immigration policy increasingly privileges flexible Asian citizens with foreign capital, expanding and entrenching the alignment of Asians with an abstract dimension of destructively alien capital. Vancouver’s identity as an Asian metropolis and “Pacific gateway” has coincided with widespread resentment of wealthy Chinese investor-migrants, who are blamed for the city’s skyrocketing property prices. 20 At the same time, poor Asian migrants situated at the margins of legality represent a perennial threat to the social order and remain indebted to the precarious structure of settler colonial hospitality. In this neoliberal scenario, settler colonial romantic anticapitalism targets both the population of highly skilled, capitalized migrants that L. Ling-chi Wang calls “high-tech coolies” 21 and the population of poor migrants—we might call them “retro” coolies—who have always been the subject of labor exploitation guaranteed by class-based structures of immigrant exclusion that have been in place in North America since the nineteenth century. We should recall that the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States specifically barred laborers and exempted merchant classes, while Canada’s 1885 Chinese Head Tax (and later 1923 Chinese Immigration Act) similarly aimed to deter poor Chinese migrants through financial hardship. In a contemporary climate that looks like a neoliberal nineteenth century, therefore, the economic logic of the border reinforces the alignment of Asians with the abstract threat of foreign investment, whose incursion into North America represent an oppressive “takeover” of traditional values and social order. At the same time, the population of undesirables (and provisional desirables, in the case of certain refugees) remains an alien labor threat to the security of citizen wages and normative social reproduction. While Ken Lum’s multimedia works evoke the superficiality of neoliberal multiculturalist aesthetics, Yamashita’s novel provides a complementary view of alien labor subjectivity conditioned by globalization. I conclude with a reading of the inverted ecology of the border represented in Yamashita’s novel and Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , which sits on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery. At stake in Yamashita’s and Lum’s aesthetic reconfigurations of the border is the value of human labor in late late capitalism. Lum’s Multicultural Discontents In order to contextualize my reading of Lum’s Four Boats Stranded , one of his most direct responses to the issue of immigration in Canada, this section establishes his conceptual ties to pop art and minimalism and the way his art probes themes of social exclusion, multiculturalism, and labor. His work powerfully reconsiders the interplay of multicultural citizenship, labor alienation, and stranger hospitality that shapes the landscape of urban racialization. Since the late 1970s, Lum’s work has achieved international renown and acclaim. Through the decades his work has consistently examined the tense boundary between mobility and stasis (as in Entertainment for Surrey ), public and private space, access and exclusion, image and text, reflection and projection. The spatial boundaries Lum erects are often uncomfortably fraught with race, gender, and class implications. Beginning in the 1980s, he gained visibility for his furniture sculptures, such as Sculpture for Dream Home (1980), Red Circle (1986), and Corner Bed (1990). Each of these sculptures engages the spatial politics of domesticity and hospitality, whose symbolism encompasses the personal as much as the national. For example, in Sculpture for Dream Home (figure 4.2 ), four identical contemporary sofas with side tables and lamps are wedged together into a perfect square. At first glance, the uniformity of the arrangement recalls the impersonal but functional aesthetic of a hotel lobby. But the viewer quickly realizes that the sofas are so tightly interlocked there’s no way to actually sit down on any of them. The functionality of the sofas is entirely displaced, and the viewer is literally marginalized by the sculpture, blocked from accessing its interior, core space. They evoke Derrida’s notion that the “law of hospitality . . . appears as a paradoxical law, pervertible or perverting”: 22 FIGURE 4.2 Ken Lum, Sculpture for Dream Home , 1980. This right to hospitality offered to a foreigner “as a family,” represented and protected by his name or her family name, is at once what makes hospitality possible, or the hospitable relationship to the foreigner possible, but by the same token what limits and prohibits it. Because hospitality, in this situation, is not offered to an anonymous new arrival and someone who has neither name, nor patronym, nor family, nor social status, and who is therefore treated not as a foreigner but as another barbarian. 23 FIGURE 4.3 Ken Lum, Red Circle , 1986.

In other words, Sculpture for Dream Home captures the contradictions of hospitality that must distinguish between the foreigner and absolute other, whose provisional guarantee of welcome simultaneously expresses its opposite: rejection. The sculpture thus resignifies the stage of mundane domesticity into one of inhospitality, a hostile expression of isolation that calls into question the spatial boundaries that configure social belonging and exclusion. Continuing these themes more dramatically is Red Circle (1986), which consists of a plump fire-engine-red sofa in the shape of a circle (figure 4.3 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home , the sofa violates its own function. Despite its inviting, cushiony enclosure, there is no way to actually sit on this sofa. Its sexually inviting minimalist aesthetic, conveyed through its seductive color and symmetrical vertical lines, adds to the sense of calculated exclusion and thwarted intimacy. A modernist ethos of form over function seems responsible for accentuating the viewer’s dislocation and nonbelonging. Observing the manner through which these sculptures harness the viewer’s sense of exclusion, Okwui Enwezor identifies Lum’s furniture works as “social sculptures” in the sense that they invite a social reading of minimalism: “Where minimalism abjured the presence of the subject in order to prioritize the presence of the object, social and relational sculpture reasserted the primacy of the subject.” 24 In this view, these sculptures register a critique of minimalism’s abstractions and evacuation of historical and social context. Connecting minimalism’s focus on pure form and capitalism, Scott Watson calls attention to the way minimalist works such as Donald Judd’s boxes or Carl Andre’s bricks seem to replicate disturbing transformations in the built urban landscape: “Regularity, logic and order in the art work were suddenly implicated in the conformist tendencies of society; the abstractions of pure form became ciphers from the abstractions of capital itself.” 25 That is, the desire for disinterested, abstract, pure form was a reflection of the conformist, homogenizing spirit of capitalism. Moreover, Lum’s reconfiguration of the use-value of the sofas as art seems to satirize the modernist ideal of “better living” achieved through the fusion of art and design. Here that view is collapsed into a scene of insecure, empty living. Among the last of these furniture works, Corner Bed (1990) adds a further layer of dysfunction to the social space of the domestic “living” room. The sculpture consists of two unfolded sofa beds that face a corner (figure 4.4 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home and Red Circle , the sofa beds cannot be accessed; the viewer can neither sit nor lie on either sofa bed. What’s distinct about Corner Bed is how it registers the theme of inhospitality more intensely by evoking an excluded visitor. As sofa beds are mostly used for temporary guests rather than permanent residents, Corner Bed suggests an aggressive exclusion of visitors and strangers. Putting the sculpture into the sustained geographical emphasis on the city of Vancouver in Lum’s work, the piece also alludes to the city’s historical hostility toward Asian migrants who have sought and continue to seek entry to Canada via Vancouver. As Enwezor reflects, the work “propos[es] an analysis of spatial politics that is all too familiar within regimes of border control.” 26 Here we see the suggestive refraction of private living space into the social domain of national exclusion. But what complicates a straightforward reading of racial exclusion is the pathetic, half-hearted display of hospitality (the sofa beds are unfolded, for instance) that Lum cuts into these furniture sculptures. The ambivalent message of the furniture’s arrangement reinforces the paradox of Derrida’s elaboration of hospitality while evoking both an invitation and an expectation of strangers.

The dark humor of Lum’s sculptures also marks his photographic works, which probe the unvarnished materiality of urban life in Vancouver. In his portrait-text works, Lum opts for scenes that do not recycle mythologized panoramas of the Lion’s Gate Bridge or the sunset over English Bay that project the city’s beauty and cosmopolitanism. Rather, Lum’s Vancouver often reflects his own background in the working-class and often invisible east side of Vancouver. His grandfather arrived as an immigrant before the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1923 and found work on the Canada Pacific Railway. When Lum was growing up, his mother worked in sweatshops and his father held menial jobs. As a result, the Vancouver Lum projects highlights the decidedly unglamorous side of urban existence: the minimalls, parking lots, and sidewalks populated by immigrants, workers, and people who often seem down and out. These are the characters and locales Lum connects to his own childhood in East Vancouver: There were all those families whose fathers worked as dishwashers with the mothers sewing in sweatshops; that’s basically my family roots. Then there are the very desperate, itinerant families at the bottom. East Vancouver is also an area with many immigrants, so there is always a kind of confusion in reference to how people relate to one another. 27 But as his furniture works suggest, Lum is far from sentimental in his approach to East Vancouver and its inhabitants. Rather, Lum’s firsthand experience compels him to weave a dark humor into his portrayal of Vancouver, with an eye to how the global economy shapes urban existence as well as our perception of it. The neoliberal turn in economic commonsense has resulted in increasing production and movement of goods and people, widening the gap between rich and poor, expanding the gendered and racialized global wage-labor force, and swelling the proportions of that global population who live in the city. As Derksen observes, these are dynamics of the global-urban nexus, in which “the city—under its many designations of ‘megacity,’ ‘world city,’ ‘cosmopolis,’ or ‘metapolis’—has become a condenser of global forces and an amplifier of global effects.” 28 Engaging with capitalism and its racialized tropes, Lum’s photographic works explore the dissonance of race, class, and gender between image and text. It is here that the Asian subject of work—of labor—comes to the fore, presenting with barbed humor the relationship between Asians and work, capital, and value production. Among his large-scale photographic series titled Portrait Attributes , Lum pairs a subject’s portrait alongside text that we would normally associate with billboard advertising. The portraits are unusual for the way they capture ordinary people in what Kitty Scott describes as the “micro-moments of life.” 29 In these works Lum makes central the complex, affective dimension of those often racialized and gendered subjects who are rarely the focus of pictorial representation. In Melly Shum Hates Her Job (1989) (figure 4.5 ), 30 Lum intensifies the boundary between racial theater and social documentary. In this portrait-text work, the subject Melly Shum is sitting at her desk in the midst of accounting work. Her surroundings are lackluster, suggestive of a governmental branch office. The fact that she is crunching numbers on a clunky industrial adding machine suggests her low-level position; she is not a CEO overseeing million-dollar transactions on a computer screen. It appears she is pausing briefly to smile at the camera before returning to her accounting task. Accompanying her portrait is a panel of large, capitalized text that reads, from top to bottom: “MELLY SHUM HATES HER JOB .” The vertical orientation of the text accentuates the work’s use of billboard conventions and heightens the emotional impact of the words. The word “HATES ” is enlarged and in vivid color, distinguishing it from the more neutral blue font of the other words. The rippled contours of red, yellow, and black typeface make the word “HATES ” look sizzling or electrified. This loud advertising typography is totally contradicted by Melly Shum’s smiling face. Although there is humorous relief in Melly’s sentiments about work in general, that humor has a dark side. In particular, what is disturbing about the relationship between text and image is the way it violates the privacy of the photographic subject. Like many of Lum’s subjects, Melly Shum is not a glamorous or heroic worker; rather, she appears as a beleaguered civil servant who, in spite of her gloom, is compelled to smile for the camera. More intrusively, her private thoughts have been broadcast in corporatist type by an omniscient narrator—the artist—onto a public billboard. In a form of ethnographic violence, an exclusive form of dialogue is enabled between the artist and the viewer that excludes Melly Shum altogether. As Kitty Scott remarks, this “doubling of voice and intimate knowledge about a stranger induces a sense of dis-ease in the viewer.” 31 What Lum achieves in this photograph is a refusal of what Roland Barthes calls the “good” picture, one in which the “object speaks [and] induces us, vaguely, to think.” 32 Instead, Melly Shum “‘sp[eaks] too much’ . . . suggest[ing] a meaning—a different meaning from the literal one” 33 and thus dislocating the photograph’s intention. FIGURE 4.5 Ken Lum, Melly Shum Hates Her Job , 1989. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. In the sense that misery becomes an object of artistic consumption—a kind of working-class spectacle—Lum’s photographic works approach the threshold of cynicism. Scott Watson observes a long tradition of artistic depictions of the working poor that Lum taps into, particularly eighteenth-century genre paintings of the poor, which were consumed by the aristocratic classes: At that time, and throughout the following century, paintings of the poor, especially those who worked the land, identified the poor with all those stable values—family, faith and soil—that capital was eroding. The bourgeoisie took comfort in this illusion because it so blithely ignored class antagonisms. 34 Later, in the 1930s, we could turn to Dorothea Lange’s photographs for the Farm Security Administration, which increased the pathos surrounding the working, rural poor. Absent of illusions of family stability in poverty, Lange’s photographs are intended to draw sympathy from the viewer over the plight of displaced laborers. For example, in Dust Bowl Texas, American Exodus, A.C. Woman (1938) (figure 4.6 ), we see the figure of a woman whose world-weariness is captured in the way her hands are clasped onto her forehead and neck. While her ragged shift dress and sun-scorched face testify to her hardship, Lange’s effort to dignify her portrait verges on heroism. The fact that the woman stands against an expansive sky, whose low horizon dips below the woman’s waist, has the effect of making her appear monumental. The aestheticism of the photograph ultimately carries a romantic undercurrent that attributes a morality to her endurance. By contrast, in Lum’s image-text works, the viewer cannot take comfort in such a sentimental illusion about the poor or working class. Melly Shum evokes neither stable, “natural” values of “family, faith, and soil” nor the pathos of heroic endurance suggested by Lange’s work. Rather, there is a sense of irreconcilability evoked by the public nature of her image and sentiments. The unsentimental and unnatural elements of the scene ultimately seem conditioned by social relations that exist outside the work, highlighting a banality of social responses to visions of alienated labor.

Tying this photo-work to the larger questions about Asian racialization as biological signifier of capitalism, Melly Shum Hates Her Job presents a stunning antithesis to the model minority scientist who was erased from the redesigned Canadian hundred-dollar bill, a subject I began this book with. In the case of the Asian woman scientist, her erasure signaled the status of Asians as a biological signifier of bad capital. She became a metaphor for a destructive logic of equivalence that reduces individual attributes into commensurable, exchangeable forms that Helen Jun calls “human capital.” From the view of romantic anticapitalism, the Asian signals the overthrow of traditional, pure, concrete conceptions of labor for an era that reduces human individuality to an abstract form of repetition and equivalence. Melly Shum, however, does not offer us a vision of such racialized abstraction or a picture of sentimentalized, concrete labor. It is unclear how or whether we viewers are to identify with her. It is this sense of nonequivalence that creates what Watson calls a “discomfort zone.” Melly Shum refuses to accommodate either an idealized vision of labor or an aestheticized image of multicultural diversity that resolves the material and geographical contradictions of the global economy. FIGURE 4.7 Ken Lum, Phew, I’m Tired , 1994. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Acquisition Fund. Further reinforcing this sense of discomfort around race and labor is Lum’s Phew, I’m Tired (1994) (figure 4.7 ). The portrait features a South Asian man at work in a metal-galvanizing factory. Unlike Melly Shum, the unnamed subject of the photograph is not smiling; rather, he appears to be in distress. On the right half of the work, against a bright orange background, appears light-blue text that reads: “. . . phew . . . / . . . I’m tired . . . /. .Oh, man . . . / . . . man . . . / . . . phew . . . / . . . tired.” The words and phrases surrounded by ellipses cascade down the panel in a zigzag formation, an arrangement suggesting a downward spiral that accentuates the weariness of the worker in the photograph. At the same time, the words themselves seem unable to capture the man’s pained expression. There is an unsettling tension between the jaunty quality of the corporate typeface and the anguish evoked by the man’s face. At the level of linguistic representation, the repetition of the words accentuates the limits language reaches in narrating the conditions of labor. Not only do the repeated words, such as “phew” and “man,” seem to comically undermine his situation, but the sounds associated with them also have a comic book quality. Further displacing the social documentary signifiers of the work, these comic strip elements reference pop art such as Roy Lichtenstein’s large reproductions of advertising and comic strip images in a piece such as Drowning Girl (figure 4.8 ). Just as pop artists’ use of popular culture and commercial iconography intensified the artwork’s artifice to challenge the spiritual ambitions and moral seriousness of art conventions (particularly of abstract expressionism), Phew, I’m Tired seems to reject the moralism inspired by Dorothea Lange’s photographic subjects. Ultimately, as Derksen points out, “the didacticism of the image-text format is made unstable by the oscillation between the representational photos and the ambivalent relationship of text to image.” 35 Unlike Lange’s documentary camera, Lum’s choreographed images intensify their own artifice and theatricality, projecting a sense of indifference that distances the viewer. In its refusal to supply the viewer with a moral standpoint from which to engage with the work, to reconcile image and text, or to join form and content, Lum’s work evokes the purposeful purposelessness of nonequivalence. By displacing the photographic subject’s racial heroism or pathos through manufactured indifference, the work interrupts a neoliberal logic of racial equivalence that folds race into culture and antiracism into multiculturalism. Instead, the viewer is left only with the irreducibility of form to affect, a state of nonequivalence that interrupts the belief in the equality of persons that is presupposed by free-market exchange and the drive to make unequal forms of human activity commensurable and exchangeable into values. 36 In his representation of racial nonequivalence, Lum therefore interrupts the logic of value production premised on the commensurating function of abstract labor.

Lum extends this state of nonequivalence to challenge what Jodi Melamed calls neoliberal multiculturalism, capitalism’s new logic of inclusion. Replacing the ideological primacy of white supremacy and colonial capitalism, she explains that multiculturalism “portrays neoliberal policy as the key to a postracist world of freedom and opportunity.” 37 In other words, multiculturalism operates as an economic and racial logic that responds to economic imperatives by celebrating cultural diversity and border-crossing to facilitate foreign investment and trade. This signals not the end of race but, rather, its rebranding. Melamed observes, “As historical articulations of race and capitalism have shifted—with white supremacy and colonial capitalism giving way to racial liberalism and transnational capitalism and, eventually, to neoliberal multiculturalism and globalization—race remains a procedure that justifies the nongeneralizability of capitalist wealth.” 38 This absorption of antiracism into an ideology of multiculturalism has been especially pervasive in Canada, which in 1988 became the first nation to enact multiculturalism as law. 39 As global capitalism’s “silent partner,” 40 former prime minister Brian Mulroney could not have made their connection more plain in a speech he delivered at a conference titled “Multiculturalism Means Business,” 41 where he invoked the marketing advantages of multiculturalism: “To cement our prosperity with trade and investment links the world over and with a renewed entrepreneurial spirit at home. . . . Our multicultural nature gives us an edge in selling to that [competitive] world.” 42 Adding to the “mixed legacy” that Cheryl Harris attributes to the overturning of legalized segregation in the United States, which defined racial oppression solely through the terms of racial separation rather than the domination associated with institutionalized white wealth and power, 43 Canadian multiculturalism sidetracks race and class for a celebration of cultural difference. The result in Canada, as Smaro Kamboureli observes, is a “sedative politics” that manages racial and ethnic difference by making it a universal condition of Canadian culture, repackaging systemic racism as merely a flawed attitude that can be corrected through cultural appreciation. 44 Lum’s engagement with images of cultural diversity seems to mock the simplification of such racial and ethnic codes. In Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate (1990) (figure 4.9 ), Lum offers an alternative view of Asian racialization against a more familiar scene of Vancouver’s cosmopolitanism. The high-rise apartments that populate the photograph’s backdrop are a signifier of the city’s alias as “Hongcouver.” This name—used in both pejorative and celebratory contexts—stems from the significant Chinese population in Vancouver, as well as the city’s purported architectural, cultural, and economic resemblance to Hong Kong. Redirecting a pop emphasis on exaggerated artifice, in Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , Lum’s advertising motif actually verges on verisimilitude. The top half of the image-text presents a portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau. They are standing on the balcony of a high-rise apartment, similar to those that appear in the background. Below their portrait in the bottom half of the piece appear their names; their last names, Nishi and Chau, are enlarged and capitalized. Removed from an art gallery context, the only element of the piece that alerts us to its status as art is the cartoonish 3-D font of the words “REAL ESTATE ,” which imitates stone carving. In what Derksen identifies as their “Flintstones quality,” 45 the unrealistic veneer of the lettering humorously undermines the realness of “real” estate. In addition, in the contrasting relation between image and text—between the concrete buildings in the background in the photograph and the abstract, textual representation of buildings as real estate commodities—we can make out a subtle reference to the antinomy of concrete and abstract dimensions that Moishe Postone associates with capitalism’s social universe. As Derksen observes of the transformation of the concrete into the abstract, “urban materiality is turned into immaterial commodity speculation.” 46 Here the abstract representation of “concrete” real estate is reduced to a comically inadequate imitation of actual concrete buildings. FIGURE 4.9 Ken Lum, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , 1990. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. Yet at another level, the portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau adds to the more racially ominous registers of the friction between image and text. Their relation to the Flintstones “real estate” logo adds an air of illegitimacy and artifice to the earnest expressions they bring to their professional endeavor. On one hand, this sense of illegitimacy broadcasts their artificial relation to property; their belonging is rendered a mere abstract signifier against a more concrete sense of citizenship. On the other hand, the artificial concreteness of their profession as realtors also allegorizes an anti-Asian animosity stemming from the perception that Vancouver has been overrun by Hong Kong real estate investors. For example, Katharyne Mitchell notes that in Vancouver, Hong Kong Chinese “are perceived as responsible for house price escalation as a result of using homes for profit through the practice of speculation, rather than as places to live.” 47 Much of this anti–Hong Kong Chinese sentiment came to the surface in 1988, when 216 luxury condominiums in the False Creek area were sold exclusively to Hong Kong buyers. 48 The sales took all of three hours and circumvented the Canadian market, leading to charges that Hong Kong investors were taking over the city. Although the roots of the city’s demographic shifts and spatial reconfigurations are the result of state-led efforts to expedite Vancouver’s integration into the global economy, the racial outcome of these processes has effectively reinforced the perception that Asians represent pure market rationality—their desires represent the psychology of capitalist expansion. Asian investors and business immigrants have only economic rather than “human” motivations. By contrast, for white Vancouver residents, as Mitchell points out, purchasing homes “secures profit yet does not have to be pursued as profit .” 49 Only white residents have the concrete, “natural” humanity that allows them to “profess ignorance and innocence of any cynical or mercenary motives such as profit, yet establishes their fundamental connection to the underlying systems that generate it.” 50 The biologization of capitalism thus renders Asians less human, removed from the concrete associations that align whiteness with property and belonging. As such, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate evoke the form of racial anxiety associated with Asians that we saw in the hundred-dollar-bill controversy: they register a kind of bad capital associated with the abstract sphere of foreign investment and real estate speculation. Despite the postinternment rehabilitation of Japanese as indigenized surplus labor and the effects of transnational capital, free trade, and the neoliberalization of the immigrant border, Asian North America’s association with a destructive capitalism has become even further entrenched. In his discussion of Mimic (1982), a photograph by Lum’s mentor Jeff Wall, Walter Benn Michaels too probes the signifiers of globalization that attend Wall’s presentation of anti-Asian racism in Vancouver in the 1980s: Following in the footsteps of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the new Canadian policy substituted economic desirability for racial desirability . And this neoliberalization of immigration policy has the same effect in Canada that it did in the United States: a rapid increase in Asian immigration. 51 In this light, the celebratory discourse of legislated multiculturalism functions as a screen hiding the fact that the infusion of Asian foreign investment and rise of Asian migration into North America project a heightened expression of abstract economic rationality that is mapped onto the Asian body. In what Michaels describes as the substitution of “economic desirability for racial desirability” in immigration reform, we can see how the Asian embodiment of economic abstraction once again threatens the concrete human values invested in traditional rather than flexible citizenship. In response, Lum’s work exposes the contradictions of multicultural belonging by disidentifying with the visual tropes of multicultural inclusion and, through his image-text works, the sense of nonequivalence evoked by depictions of Asian working-class and professional labor. Postmodern Coolies and the Political Unconscious in Tropic of Orange Bringing together the aesthetic structure of stranger inhospitality, the tragicomedy of working-class Asian labor, and bad Asian capital explored in Lum’s work as conceptual anchors for my focus on Yamashita’s novel, my overarching argument is that neoliberal multiculturalism reinforces the abstraction of both wealthy and poor Asian North Americans. In the aftermath of immigration reforms that increasingly privilege wealthy Asian migrants and exclude poor Asian migrants, 52 romantic anticapitalism rejects the former for being agents of an economic takeover and the latter for draining economic resources and “stealing jobs,” once again bearing out the contradictory promise of settler colonial hospitality. Thoroughly denaturalizing the role of the border as barrier and conduit for flows of labor and capital, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works highlight the devaluation of human labor as the racial and economic fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism. What Tropic of Orange brings to this argument is a view into the dehumanization and subjective experience of both retro and high-tech coolies. Complementing each other’s vision of the intersection of race and urban labor, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works together refract the effects of the neoliberalization of immigration policy and its perversion of race discourse through multicultural rhetoric. Representing an expansion rather than a break from a prior abstract racialization, in the contemporary context of global capitalism, migration, and neoliberal ideology, Asians are both the primary racial subject of neoliberal multiculturalism and the ongoing racial target of romantic anticapitalism. As the brief glimpse of freeway conductor Manzanar Murakami that opened this chapter intimates, Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange is a novel that, like Lum’s sculptures and photographs, reworks the Real into a narrative whose fantastical elements are not pure fantasy; neither is its blunt realism an earnest display of social documentary. The novel, whose many moving parts make it difficult to summarize, might best be described as a postmodern bible of neoliberal capitalism: it is temporally organized over seven days that build toward apocalyptic catastrophe. As such it is both a quintessentially LA disaster novel 53 and an allegory of capitalist ruin, combining all the elements of what Žižek describes as “an apocalyptic end point: ecological breakdown, the biogenic reduction of humans to manipulable machines, and total digital control over our lives.” 54 The narrative consists of three seemingly disparate plotlines that eventually converge to connect the novel’s seven principal characters. The intersection of these characters from varying racial, economic, and citizenship classes—in addition to the merging of social, spatial, and technological geographies—reveals capitalism as a dynamic ecology. Each strand of connection between these human, technological, and spatial dimensions of the text amplifies the social, mental, and environmental relations that capitalism produces. Marx too refers to capitalism as a quasi-Darwinian organism, not reducible to or fully determined by any one relation (against the claim of economic determinism). Marx asks: “Does not the history of the productive organs of man in society, of organs that are the material basis of every particular organization of society, deserve equal attention [as Darwin pays to the formation of organs of plants and animals]?” 55 His own response might serve as the materialist provocation for the literal and metaphoric strands that Yamashita weaves through her novel: Technology reveals the active relation of man to nature, the direct process of the production of his life, and thereby it also lays bare the process of the production of the social relations of his life, and of the mental conceptions that flow from those relations. 56 Connecting technology, social relations, and mental conceptions, this network of relations is literally and symbolically mobilized in Tropic of Orange by a hemispheric thread being dragged from Mexico to Los Angeles by a mysterious, rogue orange. The Southern Hemisphere is pulled into the North, bringing with it histories of colonialism, labor exploitation, trade imbalances, monetary devaluation, and the cross-border “movement of free capital—45 billion—carried by hidden and cheap labor.” 57 Accompanying this thread is Arcangel, a poet and performance artist whose mission exhumes Benjamin’s “Angel of History,” 58 to give voice to five hundred years of history and resistance in the Americas and to perform the role of El Gran Mojado (The Great Wetback) in an epic wrestling match against the formidable opponent SUPERNAFTA . The second overlapping plotline concerns a massive traffic accident on LA’S Harbor Freeway, which causes explosions and forces drivers to flee while the homeless set up camp in the deserted vehicles. The unyielding traffic jam that ensues over multiple days is, as Jinqi Ling observes, “tantamount to a collapse of capitalist operation in the city of Los Angeles.” 59 Finally, in a third interwoven plotline, we meet Bobby Ngu, who is “Chinese from Singapore with a Vietnam name speaking like a Mexican living in Koreatown.” 60 A hardworking self-employed night janitor, he works during the day in the mailroom of the Los Angeles Times . Abandoned by his Mexican immigrant wife and labor activist, Rafaela, with their young son Sol, he is called by smugglers to pay for safe passage and release of a Chinese cousin in Tijuana. Thrown into these plotlines are lethal oranges, transnational infant organ trafficking, and a lot of television. Building on the significant body of insightful scholarship on the novel’s critique of free trade, its figurative representation of globalization, its hemispheric and transnational geographic scope, and its parody of multicultural universalism, 61 my reading of Tropic of Orange focuses primarily on its three main Asian characters: Bobby, Emi, and Manzanar. This focus aims to illuminate the interplay of labor, immigration status, and capitalism in the neoliberal racialization of Asians that I’ve tracked throughout this book. In particular, I explore the bifurcation of Asian racialization into the “retro” and the “high-tech” classes of what I’m calling postmodern coolie labor. As a hardworking immigrant janitor, Bobby fulfills the “retro coolie” end of the spectrum, while Emi, an Internet addict and the Japanese American television producer for NewsNow , indexes the latter, “high-tech coolie.” In my reading of Manzanar, the homeless Japanese American freeway conductor who exemplifies Marx’s idea of human freedom, I argue that he stands as a figurative embodiment of the text’s political unconscious. Drawing on Fredric Jameson’s hermeneutic approach to excavating literature’s political unconscious, we can see that within the struggle to “wrest a realm of Freedom from a realm of Necessity,” 62 Manzanar restores “to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history [of class struggle].” In many ways he is the essential hermeneutic reader of capitalism, whose primary task, as Chiang notes, “is sheer comprehension, and his conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 63 Throughout the novel, Bobby’s and Emi’s struggle to come to terms and act with political agency is symbolically fulfilled by Manzanar. Although the two characters never come into contact in the novel, Manzanar’s and Bobby’s connection rests in their unusual relation to what Mimi Nguyen calls “the refugee condition.” 64 As a refugee of Japanese American internment, Manzanar is a bodily sign of its unresolved historical excess. Gayle K. Sato observes that Manzanar “embodies and acts out the psychic reality of the inadequacy of the 1988 Civil Liberties Act in itself to enable a Japanese American to be at home in the United States.” 65 On the other hand, Bobby, whose US citizenship is the result of his entry as a refugee, is not strictly speaking a refugee at all. From a family rendered destitute after a multinational American bicycle company drove his father’s bicycle store out of business in Singapore, Bobby and his younger brother infiltrate a Vietnamese refugee camp and are eventually “Saved by the Americans” 66 and transported to the United States. Passing as so-called legitimate refugees, their claims to refugee status could also be based on how transnational American capital destroyed their chances of economic survival. In spite of Bobby’s success, an overwhelming sense of literal and symbolic homelessness haunts him and disconnects him from others. His wife Rafaela sees Bobby’s homelessness through his pervasive insecurity: “This fear of losing what you love, of not feeling trust, this fear of being someplace unsafe but pretending for the sake of others that everything was okay.” 67 Manzanar has managed, however, to convert his postinternment homelessness into an entirely different plane of consciousness about labor. And while Bobby justifies his nonstop work through profligate, empty spending, Manzanar has interrupted the cycle of labor and consumption by relinquishing material comforts to become homeless, with few possessions. Therefore, as two characters who are subject to US hospitality through redress and refugee protections, they magnify the interplay of alien labor productivity, the ethics of consumption, and the contradictions of legal citizenship. Manzanar also animates the active repression of his granddaughter Emi’s historical and political unconscious. On the surface, his homeless asceticism and “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting” 68 dramatically contrasts with his granddaughter’s postmodern exuberance for digital media and technological gadgetry. As a TV producer for NewsNow and avid consumer of the Internet, Emi’s personal disposition reflects the speed-up and commodification of time, where seconds are packaged and sold to commercial sponsors. Despite these differences, Emi’s political unconscious is made visible through this very vexed affiliation to Manzanar. While Manzanar’s homelessness expresses a selective repression of his former identity and history, Emi’s recognition of him exposes her own cultural amnesia and historical dislocation. Notwithstanding the confidence exhibited by her “padded shoulders” 69 and uninhibited personality, “it was questionable if she even had an identity.” 70 Responding to her mother’s accusation that her attitude and behavior are un-Japanese, she retorts: “Maybe I’m not Japanese American. Maybe I got switched in the hospital.” 71 Furthermore, her sense of racial and corporeal displacement is revealed when she confesses to her boyfriend Gabriel, the Chicano reporter, that she had sex with someone else “over the net” 72 but is not sure whether it “counts” as sex. In sum, as the other Japanese American in the novel, Manzanar throws into relief the multicultural aphasia and apathy that thwart Emi’s semi-conscious political will. Bringing the context of migration more explicitly into conversation with the theme of settler colonial inhospitality evoked by Lum’s furniture sculptures, Bobby Ngu’s character exemplifies the sense of homelessness that results from his indebtedness to the promise of the American Dream. He is described as “always working. Hustling. Moving.” 73 Although he owns his home and business, it isn’t enough: “Can’t explain. Happier he is, harder he works. Can’t stop. Gotta make money. Provide for his family. Gotta buy his wife nice clothes. Gotta buy his kid the best. Bobby’s kid’s gonna know the good life. That’s how Bobby sees it.” His blind faith in the American Dream is the reason he doesn’t understand his wife Rafaela’s labor activism. He cannot understand why she joined Justice for Janitors or why she’s complaining. His attitude illustrates the paradox of Mimi Nguyen’s description of the “refugee condition,” as a figure who is both “a target and also an instrument for the gift of freedom” 74 and embodies an “existential condition of suspension or surrender.” 75 He suspends thinking and surrenders to work: Always working. Washing dishes. Chopping vegetables. Cleaning floors. Cooking hamburgers. Painting walls. Laying brick. Cutting hedges. Mowing lawn. Digging ditches. Sweeping trash. Fixing pipes. Pumping toilets. Scrubbing urinals. Washing clothes. Pressing clothes. Sewing clothes. Planting trees. Changing tires. Changing oil and filters. Stocking shelves. Lifting sacks. Loading trucks. Smashing trash. Recycling plastic. Recycling aluminum. Recycling cans and glass. Drilling asphalt. Pouring cement. Building up. Tearing down. Fixing up. Cleaning up. Keeping up. 76 But as Nguyen powerfully exposes, the “gift of freedom” is itself bound up in power through the ways “liberal empire marshals its forces for and against others and elsewhere.” 77 In Bobby’s case, it is a looming sense of unrepayable debt that defines American citizenship and freedom: “Gotta be happy he’s alive in America. Saved by the Americans. New country. New life. Working hard to make it. American through and through. . . . Doing America a favor. Doing his duty.” 78 Demonstrating the inseparability of debt from the gift of freedom that Bobby expresses through his endless workdays, Nguyen writes, “The gift of freedom emerges as a site at which modern governmentality and its politics of life (and death) unfolds as a universal history of the human, and the figuration of debt surfaces as those imperial remains that preclude the subject of freedom from being able to escape a colonial order of things.” 79 It is out of racial debt that he cannot stop consuming, stop working, stop moving. His debt-bound life takes its toll on his closest relationships. His wife, Rafaela, whom he helped smuggle across the border from Mexico, shares no such sense of indebtedness that Bobby does. Getting her degree at Los Angeles Community College, she becomes a labor activist to unionize janitorial workers. As a sign of her rejection of his consumer lifestyle, when she leaves him she takes none of the material goods from their house, which is secured by double locks and a security door: She left the cherry-red Camaro Z28 with the car seat and The Club. She left the house and the 32” Sony KV32V25 stereo TV with picture-inpicture and the Panasonic PUS4670 Super-VHS VCR , the Sony Super-ESP CD player, the AT&T 9011 cordless phone, the furniture, the clothing, the two-door Frigidaire with the icemaker, the Maytag super-capacity washer and gas dryer, the Sharp Carousel R1471 microwave, everything. . . . Didn’t even lock the security door. 80 The nonsensical series of numbers and letters that accompany each commodity satirizes the meaningless abstractions of commodity culture and the value Bobby sees reflected in them. But the many locks, the security door, and the Club Bobby installs to defend his home and car emphasize the intrinsic insecurity and fear that are the basis of his homelessness. His relationship to his younger brother also suffers. Although he sends money, pays college tuition, and pays for books, “when they get together, there’s nothing to say. Bobby’s too busy working.” 81 He realizes after Rafaela leaves him that she and his younger brother “wanted something more.” 82 After he is called by a snakehead to pay for the release of a Chinese cousin being held in Mexico, Bobby begins to see new relations between debt, consumption, and retro coolie labor that he and his wife perform. His first step is to extricate himself from the spiral of work and consumption: like his smoking habit, it’s an addiction that is difficult to quit but will eventually kill him if he doesn’t. Rafaela left because “[she] didn’t want to watch him die.” 83 He begins to reflect on what he had previously refused to hear from Rafaela about their existence as cheap labor, that “we’re not wanted here. Nobody respects our work. Say we cost money. Live on welfare.” 84 He begins to see that by immersing himself in work he has failed to recognize how devalued his life and work are in the United States. His second step is to take a crash course in global capitalism by reading Rafaela’s papers about NAFTA : Titles like Maquiladoras & Migrants. Undocumented, Illegal & Alien: Immigrants vs. Immigration . Talks about globalization of capital. Capitalization of poverty. Internationalization of the labor force. Exploitation and political expediency. Devaluation of currency and foreign economic policy. Economic intervention . 85 Reading them he realizes, “Maybe he’s been too busy. Maybe. But it’s not like he don’t understand.” 86 He begins to see how the circuit of migrant debt and provisional freedom is orchestrated by settler colonial capitalism. The way Rafaela’s papers conceptualize the exploitation of free trade resonates powerfully with the novel’s poet-prophet, Arcangel, who also understands the flows of migrant labor back and forth across the “New World Border”: the deportation of 400,000 Mexican citizens in 1923 coaxing back of 2.2 million braceros in 1942 only to exile the same 2.2 million wetbacks in 1953 . 87 Here the border extends an invitation or expedites removal, exemplifying the contradictions of hospitality evoked earlier in Lum’s furniture sculptures. Alien laborers like him, Bobby realizes, are among the many “gifts from NAFTA ,” the “oranges, bananas, corn, lettuce, guarachis, women’s apparel, tennis shoes, radios, electrodomestics, live-in domestics, living domestics, gardeners, dishwashers, waiters, masons, ditch diggers, migrants, pickers, packers, braceros, refugees, centroamericanos, wetbacks, wops, undocumenteds, illegals, aliens.” 88 Here gifts and debt are one and the same: the gift of migrant labor is multiplied in their ongoing debt to settler colonial capitalism. Bobby’s growing awareness of the exigencies of migration born out of the “capitalization of poverty ” and “globalization of capital ” is enhanced by the situation of his teenage cousin Xiayue, who is being held by smugglers in Tijuana. Although he is skeptical of their relation, he is compelled to help her when he hears she is from Fujian, the same village his mother came from. 89 Fujian, in particular, has a long history of out-migration, more recently due to economic pressures resulting from the Chinese government’s market reforms catering to North American consumer markets. These areas are often classified as Special Economic Zones, which have few labor laws, prohibit trade unions, and slash import and export taxes in order to increase trade. In China, as Peter Kwong remarks, market reforms “have practically eliminated all labor laws, labor benefits and protections. In the ‘free enterprise zones’ workers live virtually on the factory floor, laboring fourteen hours a day for a mere two dollars—that is, about 20 cents an hour.” 90 In the novel, because both of her parents are dead, Xiayue and her older brother knew that they “would have to come [to the United States] sooner or later.” 91 His own mother dead too, Bobby identifies with the girl, thinking, “It’s like it’s maybe twenty years ago. Like it’s him and his kid brother,” 92 except her situation is far more dire. Her arrival has none of the protections of being a refugee. Bobby contemplates the fate of her brother, who, if he’s alive, will enter an America that hasn’t changed since the nineteenth century: “The brother’s gonna work. Work like all the celestials before him. Put down rail ties. Pick oranges. Wash shirts. Sew garments. Stir-fry chop suey.” 93 The sister’s fate is less clear. Passing her off as his daughter, just as he himself passed as a refugee, Bobby gets Xiayue across the border as effortlessly as swiping his credit card: “Drag themselves through the slit jus’ like any Americanos. Just like Visa cards.” 94 The “collapsing of visas and Visa cards,” as Molly Wallace observes, depicts the United States as a “landscape thoroughly mortgaged to global capital. . . . Consumerism, in Tropic of Orange , replaces nationalism.” 95 But within the Visa’s symbolism of debt accumulation, in this case it is poor Third World migrants who must assume that debt. By accompanying Xiayue across the US-Mexico border, Bobby witnesses the transparent economic logic of immigration policy. Just as business immigrants can pay their way into North American citizenship, the poor can purchase entrance, yet the poor must pay off this lifelong debt with insecure citizenship. 96 Through her depiction of US-Mexico border crossing, Yamashita eviscerates the moral standing of the refugee (as the target for the “gift of freedom”) and the immoral standing of the undocumented Asian migrant (as unworthy subject of hospitality) to emphasize the shared conditions of economic exploitation that align poor migrants across free trade zones. Their insecurity is captured when Bobby has no response for Xiayue’s repeated question “What is social security?” 97 In the way that Lum’s photo-text works Melly Shum Hates Her Job and Phew, I’m Tired present a visual challenge to the aesthetics of neoliberal multiculturalism by depicting racial and gendered labor ironically, as a kind of sentimental pop art, Emi’s character in Tropic of Orange also frustrates its homogenizing logics. Unlike Melly Shum’s, however, her private thoughts are not betrayed by the artist but, rather, willingly expressed by her character. Despite Emi’s clear disconnect from her Japanese American cultural heritage and racial politics—her idea of real “struggle” is when her parents force her to make “payments on [her] Civic” 98 —her insights about the contradictory interplay of Asian racialization and neoliberal multiculturalism reveal a surfacing political consciousness. With blithe unsentimentality, Emi recognizes the dehumanized mechanical abstraction that the Asian body signifies. Ridiculing the romantic anticapitalist sentiments of her boyfriend Gabriel’s desire to reject “all this [materialism]” and commune with nature by “mak[ing] something I can actually touch and eat,” she tells him, “I read somewhere that these days, if you are making a product you can actually touch and . . . [are] making a comfortable living at it, you are either an Asian or a machine.” 99 Her point is that Gabriel’s valorization of productive over financial labor, signaled by “planting a tree,” is a false one—that there is no nature external to capitalism. Moreover, with deindustrialization and US outsourcing of manufacturing labor, the level of exploitation experienced by Third World Asian laborers reduces them to dehumanized machines. Such a vexed conflation of Asians and machines—as high-tech coolies—is also one of the reasons she admits that “there are producers who would kill me if they knew who I was.” 100 However, Emi’s own obsession with technological gadgetry and immersion into the ephemeral world of cyber-sex suggest her own resigned participation in the increasing digital abstraction of social lives, as she remarks, “Who needs a reality check?” 101 Despite Emi’s cynical disdain for politics, she is able to see past the multiculturalist veneer of capitalist determinism. At a sushi restaurant she informs Gabriel that money drives everything, that social change has nothing to do with justice or humanity: It’s just about money. It’s not about good honest people like you or about whether us Chicanos or Asians get a bum rap or whether third world countries deserve dictators or whether we should make the world safe for democracy. It’s about selling things: Reebok, Pepsi, Chevrolet, All-State, Pampers, Pollo Loco, Levis, Fritos, Larry Parker Esq., Tide, Raid, the Pillsbury Doughboy, and Famous Amos. Them that’s smart took away the pretense and do the home shopping thing, twenty-four hours. Hey, we’re all on board to buy. 102 In Emi’s economic determinist rendition, social justice is just a “pretense”—a fetish of capitalist ideology. But in her view one may as well embrace this reality because there is no ethical outside: “We’re all on board to buy.” Her pragmatism leads her to take on a particular disdain for the pretext of multicultural ethics, to the extent that she enjoys being as “antimulticultural” 103 as possible. As a favorite pastime, she and Gabriel devise fictional stories about the “multicultural mosaic” 104 of characters while they are eating lunch in the sushi restaurant, including the “Caucasian Japanophiles who talk real Japanese with the sushi man.” 105 Predictably, an eavesdropping white woman takes offense to Emi’s pronouncements that “cultural diversity is bullshit. . . . It’s a white guy wearing a Nirvana T-shirt and dreds. That’s cultural diversity.” 106 In defense of multiculturalism and cultural diversity, the woman—wearing two “ornately-lacquered chopsticks” in her hair—retorts, “I love living in L.A. because I can find anything in the world to eat, right here. . . . A true celebration of the international world. It just makes me sick to hear people speak so cynically about something so positive and to make assumptions about people based on their color.” 107 The woman’s morally superior rationale highlights the evacuated antiracist politics that Žižek ascribes to “multiculturalism, or the cultural logic of multinational capitalism,” in which “liberal ‘tolerance’ condones the folklorist Other deprived of its substance—like the multitude of ‘ethnic cuisines’ in a contemporary megalopolis.” 108 In short, the woman’s expression of neoliberal moralism converts racial politics into a celebratory form of white cultural consumption, flattening racial difference into a commodified feature of the global city. For this reason we hear an echo of Melly Shum Hates Her Job in Emi’s retort: “I hate being multicultural.” 109 Both Melly Shum and Emi recognize that for the racialized worker operating within a capitalist logic of multicultural equivalence, “you’re invisible, I’m invisible. We’re all invisible. It’s just tea, ginger, raw fish, and a credit card.” 110 At another level, Emi’s exchange with the white woman recalls the post-modern racism evoked by Lum’s photograph Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate : Nancy and Joe can be viewed as the inviolable poster children of multiculturalism, a shield of cultural diversity to deflect criticism of the dramatic escalation of real estate values in Vancouver that is often blamed on wealthy Asian investors. In Tropic of Orange , the woman’s implication that Emi is being racist by “mak[ing] assumptions about people based on their color” parallels the way that, in the similar urban context of Vancouver, where neoliberalism has reformed immigration policy and expanded the flow of capital across international borders, it has become racist to call into question the logic of capitalism. In a perversion of racial politics, open challenges such as Emi’s to the multicultural logic of capitalism have been conflated with racist and anti-immigrant voices. As Jodi Melamed points out, neoliberal multiculturalism “disconnects antiracism and economic justice, denying race as a structure of capitalist organization” that would reveal “continuities between prewar colonial capitalism and postwar US global ascendancy and expanding transnational capitalism.” 111 Moreover, when the white woman accuses Emi of racial intolerance, we see how her neoliberal expression of cultural appreciation obfuscates the profound continuity between racial divisions produced historically—through structures of colonialism and slavery—and the contemporary expropriation of surplus-value from racialized and gendered Third World labor working in free-trade zones. Such an ideology simultaneously naturalizes economic disparity by deflecting criticism through moralizing slogans of cultural diversity and racial equivalence. Ultimately, Emi prevails in revealing the superficiality of the woman’s moral high ground when she ridicules her self-serving multiculturalist aestheticism, asking her whether she would “consider using these [two forks] in your hair? Or would you consider that . . . unsanitary?” 112 The woman’s expression is appropriately “blanched” in response. After Los Angeles authorities wage a full-scale military assault on the homeless occupants of abandoned cars on the jammed freeway while Emi is tanning on top of the NewsNow van, her death by the first bullet evokes the doubleness signaled by the Asian body’s economism, an inherently racial ambiguity that positions her both as retro coolie underclass and high-tech coolie/robot overclass. Her last words, “Abort. Retry. Ignore. Fail,” 113 seem to recall the death of a replicant in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner and is similarly mired in racial signifiers of mechanical and technological domination. Following David Palumbo-Liu’s reading of the film’s representation of the human/nonhuman divide as a racialized phenomenon that “serves to maintain the essential inhuman character of the replicant against that of the human,” 114 the replicants too evoke a doubleness in the sense that they are simultaneously the slaves and potential oppressors of white humans. Blurring the line between human victim and cyborg oppressor, Emi offers a renewed representation of Lye’s observation of the conspiratorial economism invested in the Asian figure: “When we are looking at Japanese, we can never be sure whether we are seeing businessmen or coolies.” 115 As a conflation of both, she epitomizes a Homo sacer , she who “may be killed and yet not sacrificed ” 116 in the free-fire zone of the homeless-occupied freeway. Within the logic of Yamashita’s narrative, Emi’s doubleness is also linked to her political and cultural alienation in the face of her estranged grandfather, Manzanar. The paralysis she experiences is symbolic of her inability to engage with her family history and Japanese American history more broadly. After initially recognizing her grandfather on the overpass and “star[ing] at him in disbelief,” 117 she can only watch him from afar cursing to herself—“Damn that old deadbeat on the overpass” 118 —and never finds “the courage to march up there to meet the man.” 119 After Buzzworm repeatedly urges her to meet him, she shrugs him off, asking, “What’s the point?” 120 Her death soon after this exchange suggests that it is this sense of apathy that is partially responsible for her untimely death. Even though she begins to absorb Manzanar’s consciousness through the music he conducts—“a melody she could not place but knew. Electronic tones representing numerical information, i.e., music” 121 —she shuns her genetic connection to the old man: “Wasn’t everything from Alzheimer’s to schizophrenia genetic? Damn.” 122 After she is shot, Emi dreams that she will be buried in the La Brea Tar Pits and later become “La Brea Woman . . . bones and a holographic image of me.” 123 Her identification with the ancient Indigenous woman buried in the tar pits suggests, perhaps, her own regret that she too will become some mysterious, decomposed hieroglyph of history. Even though her death might stem from political paralysis, her slaying catapults her to the status of Christ-like martyrdom whose endlessly repeated televised death signals the onset of urban war, particularly for Manzanar. The moment she is shot, he can no longer go on conducting the swelling sounds of revolution below him as he awakens to his own anger and pain: “The sound of the shot penetrated Manzanar’s very being with a vengeance he did not understand. The moment repeated itself again and again; he clothed it in desperation each time with pain and more pain.” 124 Coming back to the surface, his memories return in a flood, triggered by the sight of an infant’s heart that has been harvested and trafficked from south of US-Mexico border. In this moment, instead of joining sounds of the freeway into “an entire civilization of sound,” 125 he connects his own history: his wartime confinement in a Japanese American internment camp, his surgical practice of “careful incisions . . . inserting implants, facilitating transplants,” 126 and his life on the societal margins as a homeless freeway conductor. Although he is no longer a surgeon, which, as Ling observes, registers “his refusal to participate in the perpetuation of human tragedy in the name of human need” by “using organs obtained from questionable sources,” 127 the visions of premature death reanimate his connection to the world he left behind. In the profound sensory universe from which Manzanar hails, his “surfacing” is enacted through visual rather than aural stimuli: the sight of the infant heart and of his fatally wounded granddaughter. But his reconnection to the surface world of sight and sound ultimately overloads him: “He had seen enough. And he had heard everything.” 128 Our last glimpse of Manzanar is on a gurney hanging from a helicopter holding his granddaughter’s hand, witnessing from above a vision of atomic annihilation stopped short: Peering cautiously from his higher perch, saw bird’s-eye the inflation of thousands upon thousands of automotive airbags, bursting simultaneously everywhere from their pouches in steering wheels and glove compartments like white poppies in sudden bloom. All the airbags in L.A. ruptured forth, unfurled their white powdered wings against the barrage of bullets, and stunned the war to a dead stop. But Manzanar heard nothing . 129 Here the simultaneous bursting of thousands of airbags, like “white poppies in sudden bloom,” eerily evoke the mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But in this case it is the supernatural force of the airbags’ automatic deployment that stops the war. Regardless, Manzanar hears nothing. Manzanar’s deafness at this apocalyptic scene exceeds what Ling identifies as the “cognitive plenitude” 130 he performs as a freeway conductor, where his brain is comfortably submerged under an ocean of “foam and floating kelp.” 131 Without the orchestral language of his political consciousness, in his confrontation with the sensory overload of capitalist urbanity he “dissolves,” as Ling contends, “into the novel’s imagined urban tide of carnival revolts.” 132 Manzanar’s sensory collapse suggests the difficult unity of political consciousness and the materiality of racialized vulnerability to death. Although the novel ends without a clear sense of Manzanar’s fate, his ascent from the overpass onto a gurney flying across LA while “the entire city [had] sprouted grassroots conductors of every sort” 133 presents a tilted ecology of capitalist relations where Manzanar’s urban literacy has been disseminated to a next generation of conductors. Like Manzanar, whose romantic detachment as freeway conductor dissolves the moment Emi is shot, Emi and Bobby also undergo metamorphosis. Emi’s cultural alienation and immersion into digital technology ultimately leads to high-tech failure as she dies. Bobby, whose working life has turned him into a labor automaton, stops working. Reversing the inhuman tropes of Asians as “killer robots” or “Asian ‘dragon’ gangs” depicted in narratives that participate in what Mike Davis calls the “literary destruction of LA ,” 134 Yamashita’s Asian characters collectively register sensory disability (Manzanar), nonproductivity (Bobby), and technological failure (Emi). This generalized sphere of nonproductivity gestures toward what Mitchell and Snyder recognize as “forms of incapacity as the new galvanizing agent of post-modern resistance.” 135 But we are left with a far-from-sanguine vision of LA : homeless junkies feasting on trafficked infant organs “toasted like marshmallows” 136 and the mutual destruction of SUPERNAFTA and Arcangel in the wrestling match “sponsored by a generous grant from the Ministry of Multicultures [and hosted by] the CIA , the PRI , the DEA , and the INS ”; 137 “profits from the ticket sales were being divided” 138 after the match. It is a world in suspension, “unplugged and timeless,” 139 on the verge of collapse. To amplify the political stakes of narrative suspension that concludes Yamashita’s novel, I want to bring this chapter to a close by returning to Ken Lum’s artwork to tie the themes of labor and neoliberal immigration together with the strands of Asian racialization and romantic anticapitalism I have explored through this book. In particular, like the tilted capitalist ecology presented in Yamashita’s novel, Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (figure 4.10 ) offers a similarly “unnatural” presentation of global movement shaped by settler colonial capitalism. The sculpture is the result of a commission Lum won in 1999 that was part of Vancouver’s Millennial Public Art Project, “On Location.” The work, located on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery, cannot be viewed in its entirety from any one side of the building. It consists of four boats, each placed on a corner of the gallery roof that faces east, west, north, or south. FIGURE 4.10 Ken Lum, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , 2000.

Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. The different primary colors chosen for each boat suggest racial typologies: yellow for Chinese, red for First Nations, white for Europeans, and black for Indians. The design of each boat also evokes more concrete historical periods and episodes. For instance, the red boat is a representation of a First Nations longboat used by Coast Salish communities located along the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. The white boat depicts the HMS Discovery , the Royal Navy ship that led George Vancouver’s exploration of the West Coast of North America between 1791 and 1795. The black boat in Lum’s sculpture is a replica of the Komagata Maru , a Japanese boat chartered by an Indian businessman in the early twentieth century. In 1914, 376 British Indian residents of Hong Kong, China, and Japan who were onboard the Komagata Maru were detained for two months in Vancouver Harbor before being turned away. Even though the boat had fulfilled the requirements of a “continuous journey” law, specifically designed to bar entry of Indian immigrants unless they arrived “by a continuous journey on through tickets purchased before leaving the country,” 140 their legal exclusion was ultimately based on their presumed unassimilability in a white Canada. The fourth, yellow boat in Lum’s sculpture is a representation of one of the four Fujianese migrant ships that, reprising the Komagata Maru incident eighty-five years later, were detained off the coast of Vancouver in 1999 for nearly two months. On board were 599 undocumented migrants from the Fujian province of China, who—unlike Bobby’s niece Xiayue—were detained and eventually deported. The title of Lum’s sculpture, Four Boats Stranded , is a specific reference to the media’s characterization of the four Fujianese boats. For the most part, the media coverage exploited their criminality through images of barbed wire, shackles, guard dogs, orange prison uniforms, and guards. As Anna Pratt remarks, this event demonstrated the “slippage between categories of refugees, frauds, and criminals . . . [and] spectacle in the application of sovereign power.” 141 Lum’s sculpture’s subtitle, Red and Yellow, Black and White , evokes an American abolitionist context. According to Carla Benzan, the phrase refers to a Civil War–era Sunday school song whose verse goes: “Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world; red and yellow, black and white.” 142 By drawing on dissonant tropes of settler colonialism, Asian exclusion, and racial equivalence, the sculpture’s response to the migrant crisis is largely an invocation of immigration history: a history of boat people. If we consider this sculpture against the aesthetic disorientations of Lum’s furniture sculptures and image-text works discussed earlier, Four Boats Stranded ’s invocation of immigration history is similarly irreverent. For one, despite being a public art commission, the sculpture is located on the roof of the downtown gallery and thus is largely inaccessible to the public audience. Here the work ironically inverts the duality of disinterested high art and low “popular” art in its placement above the gallery, so that it is literally “high” art. In keeping with pop art’s challenge of the exclusivity and cultural orthodoxy of the art gallery space, Lum’s bright, toylike depiction of the boats similarly evokes the staged pathos of narratives that erase Native peoples to remind us that we are “a nation of immigrants.” Given the themes of commodified repetition in pop art such as Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroes, this pop-art rendering of the boats also suggests a banality and reproducibility as subjects of mass consumption. As such, they subvert the association of art as the original product of artistic invention and leave the viewer without a straightforward idea of the sculpture’s relation toward the historical and political content it clearly alludes to. By taking boats out of water and putting them into the air, I suggest, Lum aims here, as in his other works, to offer a decontextualized aesthetics of the border and thereby denaturalize its racial logics. From this view, the placement of the sculpture on the gallery roof connects to Yamashita’s novel in terms of the inverted, suspended ecology it similarly evokes. While the landscape of Tropic of Orange is transformed by a thread pulling the Southern Hemisphere into the North, Lum’s sculpture reconfigures the spatial properties of land, water, and air with boats that apparently fly. The very inaccessibility of these boats also highlights the work of a metaphoric and invisible border that has “stranded” these four boats high in the air. Decontextualizing the North–South border as a thread and the East–West border as air, Yamashita’s and Lum’s works suggest connection and absence, respectively. For Yamashita, that connection is first rendered ambiguous as Bobby, in the novel’s final scene, grasps the thread, asking himself, “What are these goddamn lines anyway? What do they connect? What do they divide?” 143 His decision to let go and rejoin his family suggests that the thread is no longer a border to cross; it is now a line to release. In Lum’s sculpture, the apparatus of the border is reconfigured as an art domain, a space of figuration that deconstructs a pop veneer of multicultural equivalence contained in the rhetoric of a “nation of immigrants.” Reframing the nation as a field of racial incommensurability, Lum’s boats stage a narrative of white settler colonial invasion: the conversion of Indigenous land into sovereign property with the power to exclude based on race, in the case of the Komagata Maru , followed by the neoliberal power to include on the basis of economic class, in the case of the exclusion of poor Fujianese migrants. Adopting a pop aesthetic, Lum’s sculpture undermines the rhetoric of the border as a moralizing tool of neoliberal multiculturalism whose hospitality is reserved for flexible citizens and high-tech coolies while exploiting the vulnerability of Fujianese retro coolies and other undocumented arrivals. From a more dystopic perspective, moreover, the suspended boats parody the dream of totally boundless free trade and mobility, what Postone describes as “a fantasy of freedom as the complete liberation from matter, from nature . . . a ‘dream of capital’ [that] is becoming the nightmare of that from which it strives to free itself—the planet and its inhabitants.” 144 Denaturalizing nature itself, Lum and Yamashita redirect the target of romantic anticapitalism toward the field of representation that obfuscates the dehumanizing dialectic of capitalist value. By animating the border against its North–South and East–West hemispheric histories, Yamashita and Lum accentuate its prominence in the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. According to Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler, “the settler mode of production” relies on a developed capitalist world market and exploitation of the migrant labor system, a system that has advantages over slave holding because it helps to paralyze the resistance potential of domestic labor. They explain that “from purely economic considerations, migrant labour seems more efficient in terms of absolute surplus-value formation and the minimization of the social costs of reproduction.” 145 Contrary to the notion that migrant labor is an economic burden, migrant labor often assumes the total costs of its social reproduction. Moreover, the United States’ long-standing interventionist mode has transformed economies and governments south of the border and across the Pacific and has contributed to the internationalization and expansion of the surplus labor force from which North America can draw. Settler colonial capitalism continually reinvents the levels of unfreedom through the creation of the debt-bound migrant. As Bierrman and Kössler explain, “Settler capitalism differs from slave-holding in the important respect that here the class of migrant workers as a whole is, in true capitalist fashion, dependent on the class of settler capitalists as a whole. Although the migrant workers are not personally free, their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 146 In Yamashita’s and Lum’s respective evocations of the suspended function that interrupts the productive flow of migrant labor and capital, they emphasize the destructive interplay of human labor and value production that is objectified at the border.

      "content": "CHAPTER 4 THE NEW NINETEENTH CENTURY Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism Art Imitates Art Between 6 and 8 A.M . on four consecutive mornings in July 1978, multimedia artist Ken Lum stood on the east bank of the 152nd Street overpass leading rush-hour commuters into Vancouver from Surrey. Entertainment for Surrey , the grainy black-and-white video-recording of this performance, depicts Lum in jeans and a sweatshirt facing oncoming traffic, standing on a strip of grass on the side of the highway (figure 4.1 ). Recounting his experience, Lum observed, “The first day there was some reaction, the second day there was much more, but on the third day people ignored me.” 1 On the fourth day, many commuters had grown accustomed to him, honking and waving as their cars disappeared under the overpass. On the fifth and final morning of the performance, Lum replaced his body with a large white cardboard cutout of himself, a representation of the “living statue” he had become. 2 Lum explained that “people quickly came to expect me on the same spot. I became a sign.” 3 The humor in Lum’s comment is its double edge: he literally turned his body into a cardboard sign while, at the level of postmodern signification, his body became a referential sign. Turning the highway overpass into a performance art space and the Asian male body into a sign of repetition, Entertainment for Surrey collapses the boundary between literal and figurative representation. Even more dramatically, his performance probes the spatial absurdity of the individual—of individualism itself—in an urban environment designed to facilitate the movement of labor, goods, and capital. As Jeff Derksen observes, “The tension between mobility and fixity is often heightened by [Lum’s] grinding of the scales between the urban and the global and between capitalism and the subject.” 4 Only by recognizing his apparent lack of function or purpose could otherwise baffled commuters have been alerted to the artistic registers of his performance. For the purposes of this chapter, the way Lum stages a visual interruption in the flow of capitalist circulation offers new avenues for mining the abstractions signaled by the Asian body after the neoliberal turn. In the parallel urban literary world of Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange , another artist ascends the freeway overpass to deliver daily performances. Enter Manzanar Murasaki, the homeless Sansei who stands atop the Los Angeles Harbor Freeway at the downtown interchange to conduct an orchestra that he alone hears. For this grizzled, white-haired artist, it is “the complexity of human adventure over lines of transit” that fascinate him, and he is grateful for the opportunity to use his silver baton to direct the sounds of traffic, which amount to “nothing less than the greatest orchestra on Earth.” 5 Is he crazy? We learn that Manzanar was not always a conductor. He was once a skilled surgeon who abruptly left his profession, family, and friends to become a “missing person.” 6 He decided one day to exit the world he knew, “followed an ancient tortoise out into a deep place in his brain and stayed there year after year.” 7 Using the alias “Manzanar,” he references his birthplace at Manzanar Concentration Camp in the Owens Valley, where he was the first Sansei born into captivity during World War II. We learn that he could easily have applied his artistic talents to becoming “a sculptor in clay, wood, or even marble—any sort of inanimate substance”; however, “strangely, it was the abstraction of music that engulfed his being.” 8 Los Angeles commuters rarely take notice of him, though, thinking themselves “disconnected from a sooty homeless man on an overpass.” 9 Nevertheless, he had become a “fixture on the freeway overpass much like a mural or a traffic information sign or a tagger’s mark.” 10 Like Ken Lum in Entertainment for Surrey , Manzanar became a sign. Both Lum and Manzanar bear an uncanny resemblance to David Caspar Friedrich’s Wanderer above the Sea of Fog discussed in chapter 2 , the iconic embodiment of the Byronic hero surveying the vast, mountainous landscape before him. Even Buzzworm, the African American street philanthropist of Tropic of Orange , calls Manzanar the “ultimate romantic.” 11 However, while Lum and Manzanar evoke the individualism of the romantic figure, they do not adopt Albert Boime’s notion of a “magisterial gaze,” 12 given the total absence of control they exert over the oncoming traffic. Observing the way Manzanar responds to the dizzying urban flows of capitalist production with a “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting,” Mark Chiang highlights the irony that Manzanar “does not control anything. . . . His conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 13 Thus it is a kind of purposeful purposelessness that binds Lum and Manzanar, two Asian North Americans who abandoned their real and fictional lives as model minorities—Lum’s as a scientist and Manzanar’s as a surgeon—to yield to an artistic vision that would compel them to their respective freeway overpasses. Against the rational landscape of the freeway and the temporal organization of the workweek, both artists suspend and denaturalize the relation between the body and sign, embodying a postromantic subjectivity whose exaggerated nonproductivity constitutes a strange other of capitalism. Evoking forms of undisciplined labor power, Lum and Manzanar index a sphere of disability , a nonrehabilitative population that remains distinct from the exploitable population of racialized and gendered surplus labor. David T. Mitchell and Sharon Snyder designate nonproductive bodies as those “inhabitants of the planet who, largely by virtue of biological (in)capacity, aesthetic non-conformity, and/or non-normative labor patterns . . . [are] not merely excluded from—but also resistant to standardized labor demands of human value.” 14 They point to Antonio Negri’s term “living labor” to “suggest forms of creativity that cannot be reduced to an economic value.” 15 In this sense, both Lum and Manzanar stage a confrontation of capitalism’s naturalized modes of consumption, circulation, and social organization—using and misusing the freeway as motif of urban modernity. Most important for this chapter is how their bodies-as-sign animate new relations between labor and the Asian body against the flows of global capital. A utopian ideal of functional disruption captured by Lum’s and Manzanar’s performances guides this chapter’s focus on the ongoing racial abstractions assigned to the Asian body in an apocalyptic phase of contemporary capitalism. Describing the “catastrophic character of the current phase shift that global capital is undergoing,” Chris Nealon labels it a “late late capitalism.” 16 The previous chapters in this book have examined capitalism as a representational regime whose fetishism mystifies the social relations embedded in commodity production. Within its social distortion, I explored how alien Asian labor has since the nineteenth century functioned as biological signifier of the destructively abstract dimension of an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Moishe Postone ties the origins of this antinomy to the commodity form itself, wherein each commodity’s expression of use-value and exchange value is misperceived as an antinomical (rather than dialectical) relation of concrete and abstract dimensions. From this view, which I’ve described as a form of romantic anticapitalism, use-value appears concrete, “as objective in the sense of being objectlike, ‘material’ or ‘thingly,’” while exchange-value appears abstract,” as “general, homogenous, and abstracted from all particularity.” 17 In other words, even though a commodity such as a chair contains both use-value as something to sit on and exchange-value as a quantitative dimension that enables the chair to be bought and sold, romantic anticapitalism perceives these two characteristics as so completely disconnected they are oppositional—antinomical—rather than dialectically related. As a key ideological anchor of white settler colonialism, romantic anticapitalism always favors the qualitative over the quantitative. It prefers the concrete dimension for being natural, material, tactile, and thus closer to earthly origins in an increasingly artificial world. For the romantic anticapitalist, capitalism is identified solely with the abstract exchange dimension of the antinomy, while the concrete dimension is perceived as essentially noncapitalist. This book interprets anti-Asian racism as a fetishized, one-sided form of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism, an ideology that anthropomorphizes capitalism’s abstract dimension as alien Asian labor. As such, my first two chapters explored how Asian North American literature and visual culture exposes and disidentifies with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century association of Asian labor with an abstractly perverse, unnatural, and destructive economism that threatened the normative social reproduction of white concrete labor. In the third chapter, on postmemory narratives of Japanese internment in North America, I probed the extent of the destructiveness associated with Japanese labor, whose excessive efficiency and perceived control over the creation of relative surplus-value were key elements in the decision to relocate and confine Japanese civilians. Then, by connecting the relocation of Japanese North American labor to the settler colonial precedent of Native North American relocation evoked by these narratives, I argued that the exploitation of relocated Japanese labor contributed to the resignification of Japanese bodies as an ideal “surplus” labor force, dispossessed of any control over the creation of relative surplus-value. This facilitated a symbolic process that Jodi Kim calls “gendered racial rehabilitation,” 18 which enabled Japanese civilians to be aligned with the ameliorated status of model minority in the midst of civil rights activism in the United States during the Cold War. However, as this chapter will explore further, the neoliberal reconstitution of immigration laws in Canada and the United States in the latter twentieth century has reinforced the destructive abstraction associated with Asian alien surplus labor, an abstraction that comes into heightened relief in Vancouver and Los Angeles, two cities that refract urbanism, immigration, and trans-Pacific economic flows of labor, goods, and capital. Examining Karen Tei Yamashita’s Los Angeles as imagined in her 1997 novel Tropic of Orange alongside Ken Lum’s Vancouver through his multimedia works—concluding with a reading of his sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (1999)—my central argument in this chapter is that these artists bring into focus the border as a key apparatus of neoliberal multiculturalism that facilitates the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. I demonstrate how the neoliberalization of the border substitutes economic class for race, resulting in a bifurcated economism of Asian racialization. As John Park outlines, the unprecedented rise of skilled and affluent migrants from Asia has been coupled with the similar explosion in undocumented aliens; Park observes that in the United States “up to one million undocumented aliens are now from Asian countries. . . . Their numbers multiplied four or five times over the past 25 years.” 19 Immigration policy increasingly privileges flexible Asian citizens with foreign capital, expanding and entrenching the alignment of Asians with an abstract dimension of destructively alien capital. Vancouver’s identity as an Asian metropolis and “Pacific gateway” has coincided with widespread resentment of wealthy Chinese investor-migrants, who are blamed for the city’s skyrocketing property prices. 20 At the same time, poor Asian migrants situated at the margins of legality represent a perennial threat to the social order and remain indebted to the precarious structure of settler colonial hospitality. In this neoliberal scenario, settler colonial romantic anticapitalism targets both the population of highly skilled, capitalized migrants that L. Ling-chi Wang calls “high-tech coolies” 21 and the population of poor migrants—we might call them “retro” coolies—who have always been the subject of labor exploitation guaranteed by class-based structures of immigrant exclusion that have been in place in North America since the nineteenth century. We should recall that the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States specifically barred laborers and exempted merchant classes, while Canada’s 1885 Chinese Head Tax (and later 1923 Chinese Immigration Act) similarly aimed to deter poor Chinese migrants through financial hardship. In a contemporary climate that looks like a neoliberal nineteenth century, therefore, the economic logic of the border reinforces the alignment of Asians with the abstract threat of foreign investment, whose incursion into North America represent an oppressive “takeover” of traditional values and social order. At the same time, the population of undesirables (and provisional desirables, in the case of certain refugees) remains an alien labor threat to the security of citizen wages and normative social reproduction. While Ken Lum’s multimedia works evoke the superficiality of neoliberal multiculturalist aesthetics, Yamashita’s novel provides a complementary view of alien labor subjectivity conditioned by globalization. I conclude with a reading of the inverted ecology of the border represented in Yamashita’s novel and Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , which sits on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery. At stake in Yamashita’s and Lum’s aesthetic reconfigurations of the border is the value of human labor in late late capitalism. Lum’s Multicultural Discontents In order to contextualize my reading of Lum’s Four Boats Stranded , one of his most direct responses to the issue of immigration in Canada, this section establishes his conceptual ties to pop art and minimalism and the way his art probes themes of social exclusion, multiculturalism, and labor. His work powerfully reconsiders the interplay of multicultural citizenship, labor alienation, and stranger hospitality that shapes the landscape of urban racialization. Since the late 1970s, Lum’s work has achieved international renown and acclaim. Through the decades his work has consistently examined the tense boundary between mobility and stasis (as in Entertainment for Surrey ), public and private space, access and exclusion, image and text, reflection and projection. The spatial boundaries Lum erects are often uncomfortably fraught with race, gender, and class implications. Beginning in the 1980s, he gained visibility for his furniture sculptures, such as Sculpture for Dream Home (1980), Red Circle (1986), and Corner Bed (1990). Each of these sculptures engages the spatial politics of domesticity and hospitality, whose symbolism encompasses the personal as much as the national. For example, in Sculpture for Dream Home (figure 4.2 ), four identical contemporary sofas with side tables and lamps are wedged together into a perfect square. At first glance, the uniformity of the arrangement recalls the impersonal but functional aesthetic of a hotel lobby. But the viewer quickly realizes that the sofas are so tightly interlocked there’s no way to actually sit down on any of them. The functionality of the sofas is entirely displaced, and the viewer is literally marginalized by the sculpture, blocked from accessing its interior, core space. They evoke Derrida’s notion that the “law of hospitality . . . appears as a paradoxical law, pervertible or perverting”: 22 FIGURE 4.2 Ken Lum, Sculpture for Dream Home , 1980. This right to hospitality offered to a foreigner “as a family,” represented and protected by his name or her family name, is at once what makes hospitality possible, or the hospitable relationship to the foreigner possible, but by the same token what limits and prohibits it. Because hospitality, in this situation, is not offered to an anonymous new arrival and someone who has neither name, nor patronym, nor family, nor social status, and who is therefore treated not as a foreigner but as another barbarian. 23 FIGURE 4.3 Ken Lum, Red Circle , 1986. Fabric, wood, 300 cm diameter. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Acquisition Fund. Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. In other words, Sculpture for Dream Home captures the contradictions of hospitality that must distinguish between the foreigner and absolute other, whose provisional guarantee of welcome simultaneously expresses its opposite: rejection. The sculpture thus resignifies the stage of mundane domesticity into one of inhospitality, a hostile expression of isolation that calls into question the spatial boundaries that configure social belonging and exclusion. Continuing these themes more dramatically is Red Circle (1986), which consists of a plump fire-engine-red sofa in the shape of a circle (figure 4.3 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home , the sofa violates its own function. Despite its inviting, cushiony enclosure, there is no way to actually sit on this sofa. Its sexually inviting minimalist aesthetic, conveyed through its seductive color and symmetrical vertical lines, adds to the sense of calculated exclusion and thwarted intimacy. A modernist ethos of form over function seems responsible for accentuating the viewer’s dislocation and nonbelonging. Observing the manner through which these sculptures harness the viewer’s sense of exclusion, Okwui Enwezor identifies Lum’s furniture works as “social sculptures” in the sense that they invite a social reading of minimalism: “Where minimalism abjured the presence of the subject in order to prioritize the presence of the object, social and relational sculpture reasserted the primacy of the subject.” 24 In this view, these sculptures register a critique of minimalism’s abstractions and evacuation of historical and social context. Connecting minimalism’s focus on pure form and capitalism, Scott Watson calls attention to the way minimalist works such as Donald Judd’s boxes or Carl Andre’s bricks seem to replicate disturbing transformations in the built urban landscape: “Regularity, logic and order in the art work were suddenly implicated in the conformist tendencies of society; the abstractions of pure form became ciphers from the abstractions of capital itself.” 25 That is, the desire for disinterested, abstract, pure form was a reflection of the conformist, homogenizing spirit of capitalism. Moreover, Lum’s reconfiguration of the use-value of the sofas as art seems to satirize the modernist ideal of “better living” achieved through the fusion of art and design. Here that view is collapsed into a scene of insecure, empty living. Among the last of these furniture works, Corner Bed (1990) adds a further layer of dysfunction to the social space of the domestic “living” room. The sculpture consists of two unfolded sofa beds that face a corner (figure 4.4 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home and Red Circle , the sofa beds cannot be accessed; the viewer can neither sit nor lie on either sofa bed. What’s distinct about Corner Bed is how it registers the theme of inhospitality more intensely by evoking an excluded visitor. As sofa beds are mostly used for temporary guests rather than permanent residents, Corner Bed suggests an aggressive exclusion of visitors and strangers. Putting the sculpture into the sustained geographical emphasis on the city of Vancouver in Lum’s work, the piece also alludes to the city’s historical hostility toward Asian migrants who have sought and continue to seek entry to Canada via Vancouver. As Enwezor reflects, the work “propos[es] an analysis of spatial politics that is all too familiar within regimes of border control.” 26 Here we see the suggestive refraction of private living space into the social domain of national exclusion. But what complicates a straightforward reading of racial exclusion is the pathetic, half-hearted display of hospitality (the sofa beds are unfolded, for instance) that Lum cuts into these furniture sculptures. The ambivalent message of the furniture’s arrangement reinforces the paradox of Derrida’s elaboration of hospitality while evoking both an invitation and an expectation of strangers.

The dark humor of Lum’s sculptures also marks his photographic works, which probe the unvarnished materiality of urban life in Vancouver. In his portrait-text works, Lum opts for scenes that do not recycle mythologized panoramas of the Lion’s Gate Bridge or the sunset over English Bay that project the city’s beauty and cosmopolitanism. Rather, Lum’s Vancouver often reflects his own background in the working-class and often invisible east side of Vancouver. His grandfather arrived as an immigrant before the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1923 and found work on the Canada Pacific Railway. When Lum was growing up, his mother worked in sweatshops and his father held menial jobs. As a result, the Vancouver Lum projects highlights the decidedly unglamorous side of urban existence: the minimalls, parking lots, and sidewalks populated by immigrants, workers, and people who often seem down and out. These are the characters and locales Lum connects to his own childhood in East Vancouver: There were all those families whose fathers worked as dishwashers with the mothers sewing in sweatshops; that’s basically my family roots. Then there are the very desperate, itinerant families at the bottom. East Vancouver is also an area with many immigrants, so there is always a kind of confusion in reference to how people relate to one another. 27 But as his furniture works suggest, Lum is far from sentimental in his approach to East Vancouver and its inhabitants. Rather, Lum’s firsthand experience compels him to weave a dark humor into his portrayal of Vancouver, with an eye to how the global economy shapes urban existence as well as our perception of it. The neoliberal turn in economic commonsense has resulted in increasing production and movement of goods and people, widening the gap between rich and poor, expanding the gendered and racialized global wage-labor force, and swelling the proportions of that global population who live in the city. As Derksen observes, these are dynamics of the global-urban nexus, in which “the city—under its many designations of ‘megacity,’ ‘world city,’ ‘cosmopolis,’ or ‘metapolis’—has become a condenser of global forces and an amplifier of global effects.” 28 Engaging with capitalism and its racialized tropes, Lum’s photographic works explore the dissonance of race, class, and gender between image and text. It is here that the Asian subject of work—of labor—comes to the fore, presenting with barbed humor the relationship between Asians and work, capital, and value production. Among his large-scale photographic series titled Portrait Attributes , Lum pairs a subject’s portrait alongside text that we would normally associate with billboard advertising. The portraits are unusual for the way they capture ordinary people in what Kitty Scott describes as the “micro-moments of life.” 29 In these works Lum makes central the complex, affective dimension of those often racialized and gendered subjects who are rarely the focus of pictorial representation. In Melly Shum Hates Her Job (1989) (figure 4.5 ), 30 Lum intensifies the boundary between racial theater and social documentary. In this portrait-text work, the subject Melly Shum is sitting at her desk in the midst of accounting work. Her surroundings are lackluster, suggestive of a governmental branch office. The fact that she is crunching numbers on a clunky industrial adding machine suggests her low-level position; she is not a CEO overseeing million-dollar transactions on a computer screen. It appears she is pausing briefly to smile at the camera before returning to her accounting task. Accompanying her portrait is a panel of large, capitalized text that reads, from top to bottom: “MELLY SHUM HATES HER JOB .” The vertical orientation of the text accentuates the work’s use of billboard conventions and heightens the emotional impact of the words. The word “HATES ” is enlarged and in vivid color, distinguishing it from the more neutral blue font of the other words. The rippled contours of red, yellow, and black typeface make the word “HATES ” look sizzling or electrified. This loud advertising typography is totally contradicted by Melly Shum’s smiling face. Although there is humorous relief in Melly’s sentiments about work in general, that humor has a dark side. In particular, what is disturbing about the relationship between text and image is the way it violates the privacy of the photographic subject. Like many of Lum’s subjects, Melly Shum is not a glamorous or heroic worker; rather, she appears as a beleaguered civil servant who, in spite of her gloom, is compelled to smile for the camera. More intrusively, her private thoughts have been broadcast in corporatist type by an omniscient narrator—the artist—onto a public billboard. In a form of ethnographic violence, an exclusive form of dialogue is enabled between the artist and the viewer that excludes Melly Shum altogether. As Kitty Scott remarks, this “doubling of voice and intimate knowledge about a stranger induces a sense of dis-ease in the viewer.” 31 What Lum achieves in this photograph is a refusal of what Roland Barthes calls the “good” picture, one in which the “object speaks [and] induces us, vaguely, to think.” 32 Instead, Melly Shum “‘sp[eaks] too much’ . . . suggest[ing] a meaning—a different meaning from the literal one” 33 and thus dislocating the photograph’s intention. FIGURE 4.5 Ken Lum, Melly Shum Hates Her Job , 1989. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. In the sense that misery becomes an object of artistic consumption—a kind of working-class spectacle—Lum’s photographic works approach the threshold of cynicism. Scott Watson observes a long tradition of artistic depictions of the working poor that Lum taps into, particularly eighteenth-century genre paintings of the poor, which were consumed by the aristocratic classes: At that time, and throughout the following century, paintings of the poor, especially those who worked the land, identified the poor with all those stable values—family, faith and soil—that capital was eroding. The bourgeoisie took comfort in this illusion because it so blithely ignored class antagonisms. 34 Later, in the 1930s, we could turn to Dorothea Lange’s photographs for the Farm Security Administration, which increased the pathos surrounding the working, rural poor. Absent of illusions of family stability in poverty, Lange’s photographs are intended to draw sympathy from the viewer over the plight of displaced laborers. For example, in Dust Bowl Texas, American Exodus, A.C. Woman (1938) (figure 4.6 ), we see the figure of a woman whose world-weariness is captured in the way her hands are clasped onto her forehead and neck. While her ragged shift dress and sun-scorched face testify to her hardship, Lange’s effort to dignify her portrait verges on heroism. The fact that the woman stands against an expansive sky, whose low horizon dips below the woman’s waist, has the effect of making her appear monumental. The aestheticism of the photograph ultimately carries a romantic undercurrent that attributes a morality to her endurance. By contrast, in Lum’s image-text works, the viewer cannot take comfort in such a sentimental illusion about the poor or working class. Melly Shum evokes neither stable, “natural” values of “family, faith, and soil” nor the pathos of heroic endurance suggested by Lange’s work. Rather, there is a sense of irreconcilability evoked by the public nature of her image and sentiments. The unsentimental and unnatural elements of the scene ultimately seem conditioned by social relations that exist outside the work, highlighting a banality of social responses to visions of alienated labor.

Tying this photo-work to the larger questions about Asian racialization as biological signifier of capitalism, Melly Shum Hates Her Job presents a stunning antithesis to the model minority scientist who was erased from the redesigned Canadian hundred-dollar bill, a subject I began this book with. In the case of the Asian woman scientist, her erasure signaled the status of Asians as a biological signifier of bad capital. She became a metaphor for a destructive logic of equivalence that reduces individual attributes into commensurable, exchangeable forms that Helen Jun calls “human capital.” From the view of romantic anticapitalism, the Asian signals the overthrow of traditional, pure, concrete conceptions of labor for an era that reduces human individuality to an abstract form of repetition and equivalence. Melly Shum, however, does not offer us a vision of such racialized abstraction or a picture of sentimentalized, concrete labor. It is unclear how or whether we viewers are to identify with her. It is this sense of nonequivalence that creates what Watson calls a “discomfort zone.” Melly Shum refuses to accommodate either an idealized vision of labor or an aestheticized image of multicultural diversity that resolves the material and geographical contradictions of the global economy. FIGURE 4.7 Ken Lum, Phew, I’m Tired , 1994. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Acquisition Fund. Further reinforcing this sense of discomfort around race and labor is Lum’s Phew, I’m Tired (1994) (figure 4.7 ). The portrait features a South Asian man at work in a metal-galvanizing factory. Unlike Melly Shum, the unnamed subject of the photograph is not smiling; rather, he appears to be in distress. On the right half of the work, against a bright orange background, appears light-blue text that reads: “. . . phew . . . / . . . I’m tired . . . /. .Oh, man . . . / . . . man . . . / . . . phew . . . / . . . tired.” The words and phrases surrounded by ellipses cascade down the panel in a zigzag formation, an arrangement suggesting a downward spiral that accentuates the weariness of the worker in the photograph. At the same time, the words themselves seem unable to capture the man’s pained expression. There is an unsettling tension between the jaunty quality of the corporate typeface and the anguish evoked by the man’s face. At the level of linguistic representation, the repetition of the words accentuates the limits language reaches in narrating the conditions of labor. Not only do the repeated words, such as “phew” and “man,” seem to comically undermine his situation, but the sounds associated with them also have a comic book quality. Further displacing the social documentary signifiers of the work, these comic strip elements reference pop art such as Roy Lichtenstein’s large reproductions of advertising and comic strip images in a piece such as Drowning Girl (figure 4.8 ). Just as pop artists’ use of popular culture and commercial iconography intensified the artwork’s artifice to challenge the spiritual ambitions and moral seriousness of art conventions (particularly of abstract expressionism), Phew, I’m Tired seems to reject the moralism inspired by Dorothea Lange’s photographic subjects. Ultimately, as Derksen points out, “the didacticism of the image-text format is made unstable by the oscillation between the representational photos and the ambivalent relationship of text to image.” 35 Unlike Lange’s documentary camera, Lum’s choreographed images intensify their own artifice and theatricality, projecting a sense of indifference that distances the viewer. In its refusal to supply the viewer with a moral standpoint from which to engage with the work, to reconcile image and text, or to join form and content, Lum’s work evokes the purposeful purposelessness of nonequivalence. By displacing the photographic subject’s racial heroism or pathos through manufactured indifference, the work interrupts a neoliberal logic of racial equivalence that folds race into culture and antiracism into multiculturalism. Instead, the viewer is left only with the irreducibility of form to affect, a state of nonequivalence that interrupts the belief in the equality of persons that is presupposed by free-market exchange and the drive to make unequal forms of human activity commensurable and exchangeable into values. 36 In his representation of racial nonequivalence, Lum therefore interrupts the logic of value production premised on the commensurating function of abstract labor.

Lum extends this state of nonequivalence to challenge what Jodi Melamed calls neoliberal multiculturalism, capitalism’s new logic of inclusion. Replacing the ideological primacy of white supremacy and colonial capitalism, she explains that multiculturalism “portrays neoliberal policy as the key to a postracist world of freedom and opportunity.” 37 In other words, multiculturalism operates as an economic and racial logic that responds to economic imperatives by celebrating cultural diversity and border-crossing to facilitate foreign investment and trade. This signals not the end of race but, rather, its rebranding. Melamed observes, “As historical articulations of race and capitalism have shifted—with white supremacy and colonial capitalism giving way to racial liberalism and transnational capitalism and, eventually, to neoliberal multiculturalism and globalization—race remains a procedure that justifies the nongeneralizability of capitalist wealth.” 38 This absorption of antiracism into an ideology of multiculturalism has been especially pervasive in Canada, which in 1988 became the first nation to enact multiculturalism as law. 39 As global capitalism’s “silent partner,” 40 former prime minister Brian Mulroney could not have made their connection more plain in a speech he delivered at a conference titled “Multiculturalism Means Business,” 41 where he invoked the marketing advantages of multiculturalism: “To cement our prosperity with trade and investment links the world over and with a renewed entrepreneurial spirit at home. . . . Our multicultural nature gives us an edge in selling to that [competitive] world.” 42 Adding to the “mixed legacy” that Cheryl Harris attributes to the overturning of legalized segregation in the United States, which defined racial oppression solely through the terms of racial separation rather than the domination associated with institutionalized white wealth and power, 43 Canadian multiculturalism sidetracks race and class for a celebration of cultural difference. The result in Canada, as Smaro Kamboureli observes, is a “sedative politics” that manages racial and ethnic difference by making it a universal condition of Canadian culture, repackaging systemic racism as merely a flawed attitude that can be corrected through cultural appreciation. 44 Lum’s engagement with images of cultural diversity seems to mock the simplification of such racial and ethnic codes. In Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate (1990) (figure 4.9 ), Lum offers an alternative view of Asian racialization against a more familiar scene of Vancouver’s cosmopolitanism. The high-rise apartments that populate the photograph’s backdrop are a signifier of the city’s alias as “Hongcouver.” This name—used in both pejorative and celebratory contexts—stems from the significant Chinese population in Vancouver, as well as the city’s purported architectural, cultural, and economic resemblance to Hong Kong. Redirecting a pop emphasis on exaggerated artifice, in Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , Lum’s advertising motif actually verges on verisimilitude. The top half of the image-text presents a portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau. They are standing on the balcony of a high-rise apartment, similar to those that appear in the background. Below their portrait in the bottom half of the piece appear their names; their last names, Nishi and Chau, are enlarged and capitalized. Removed from an art gallery context, the only element of the piece that alerts us to its status as art is the cartoonish 3-D font of the words “REAL ESTATE ,” which imitates stone carving. In what Derksen identifies as their “Flintstones quality,” 45 the unrealistic veneer of the lettering humorously undermines the realness of “real” estate. In addition, in the contrasting relation between image and text—between the concrete buildings in the background in the photograph and the abstract, textual representation of buildings as real estate commodities—we can make out a subtle reference to the antinomy of concrete and abstract dimensions that Moishe Postone associates with capitalism’s social universe. As Derksen observes of the transformation of the concrete into the abstract, “urban materiality is turned into immaterial commodity speculation.” 46 Here the abstract representation of “concrete” real estate is reduced to a comically inadequate imitation of actual concrete buildings. FIGURE 4.9 Ken Lum, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , 1990. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. Yet at another level, the portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau adds to the more racially ominous registers of the friction between image and text. Their relation to the Flintstones “real estate” logo adds an air of illegitimacy and artifice to the earnest expressions they bring to their professional endeavor. On one hand, this sense of illegitimacy broadcasts their artificial relation to property; their belonging is rendered a mere abstract signifier against a more concrete sense of citizenship. On the other hand, the artificial concreteness of their profession as realtors also allegorizes an anti-Asian animosity stemming from the perception that Vancouver has been overrun by Hong Kong real estate investors. For example, Katharyne Mitchell notes that in Vancouver, Hong Kong Chinese “are perceived as responsible for house price escalation as a result of using homes for profit through the practice of speculation, rather than as places to live.” 47 Much of this anti–Hong Kong Chinese sentiment came to the surface in 1988, when 216 luxury condominiums in the False Creek area were sold exclusively to Hong Kong buyers. 48 The sales took all of three hours and circumvented the Canadian market, leading to charges that Hong Kong investors were taking over the city. Although the roots of the city’s demographic shifts and spatial reconfigurations are the result of state-led efforts to expedite Vancouver’s integration into the global economy, the racial outcome of these processes has effectively reinforced the perception that Asians represent pure market rationality—their desires represent the psychology of capitalist expansion. Asian investors and business immigrants have only economic rather than “human” motivations. By contrast, for white Vancouver residents, as Mitchell points out, purchasing homes “secures profit yet does not have to be pursued as profit .” 49 Only white residents have the concrete, “natural” humanity that allows them to “profess ignorance and innocence of any cynical or mercenary motives such as profit, yet establishes their fundamental connection to the underlying systems that generate it.” 50 The biologization of capitalism thus renders Asians less human, removed from the concrete associations that align whiteness with property and belonging. As such, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate evoke the form of racial anxiety associated with Asians that we saw in the hundred-dollar-bill controversy: they register a kind of bad capital associated with the abstract sphere of foreign investment and real estate speculation. Despite the postinternment rehabilitation of Japanese as indigenized surplus labor and the effects of transnational capital, free trade, and the neoliberalization of the immigrant border, Asian North America’s association with a destructive capitalism has become even further entrenched. In his discussion of Mimic (1982), a photograph by Lum’s mentor Jeff Wall, Walter Benn Michaels too probes the signifiers of globalization that attend Wall’s presentation of anti-Asian racism in Vancouver in the 1980s: Following in the footsteps of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the new Canadian policy substituted economic desirability for racial desirability . And this neoliberalization of immigration policy has the same effect in Canada that it did in the United States: a rapid increase in Asian immigration. 51 In this light, the celebratory discourse of legislated multiculturalism functions as a screen hiding the fact that the infusion of Asian foreign investment and rise of Asian migration into North America project a heightened expression of abstract economic rationality that is mapped onto the Asian body. In what Michaels describes as the substitution of “economic desirability for racial desirability” in immigration reform, we can see how the Asian embodiment of economic abstraction once again threatens the concrete human values invested in traditional rather than flexible citizenship. In response, Lum’s work exposes the contradictions of multicultural belonging by disidentifying with the visual tropes of multicultural inclusion and, through his image-text works, the sense of nonequivalence evoked by depictions of Asian working-class and professional labor. Postmodern Coolies and the Political Unconscious in Tropic of Orange Bringing together the aesthetic structure of stranger inhospitality, the tragicomedy of working-class Asian labor, and bad Asian capital explored in Lum’s work as conceptual anchors for my focus on Yamashita’s novel, my overarching argument is that neoliberal multiculturalism reinforces the abstraction of both wealthy and poor Asian North Americans. In the aftermath of immigration reforms that increasingly privilege wealthy Asian migrants and exclude poor Asian migrants, 52 romantic anticapitalism rejects the former for being agents of an economic takeover and the latter for draining economic resources and “stealing jobs,” once again bearing out the contradictory promise of settler colonial hospitality. Thoroughly denaturalizing the role of the border as barrier and conduit for flows of labor and capital, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works highlight the devaluation of human labor as the racial and economic fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism. What Tropic of Orange brings to this argument is a view into the dehumanization and subjective experience of both retro and high-tech coolies. Complementing each other’s vision of the intersection of race and urban labor, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works together refract the effects of the neoliberalization of immigration policy and its perversion of race discourse through multicultural rhetoric. Representing an expansion rather than a break from a prior abstract racialization, in the contemporary context of global capitalism, migration, and neoliberal ideology, Asians are both the primary racial subject of neoliberal multiculturalism and the ongoing racial target of romantic anticapitalism. As the brief glimpse of freeway conductor Manzanar Murakami that opened this chapter intimates, Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange is a novel that, like Lum’s sculptures and photographs, reworks the Real into a narrative whose fantastical elements are not pure fantasy; neither is its blunt realism an earnest display of social documentary. The novel, whose many moving parts make it difficult to summarize, might best be described as a postmodern bible of neoliberal capitalism: it is temporally organized over seven days that build toward apocalyptic catastrophe. As such it is both a quintessentially LA disaster novel 53 and an allegory of capitalist ruin, combining all the elements of what Žižek describes as “an apocalyptic end point: ecological breakdown, the biogenic reduction of humans to manipulable machines, and total digital control over our lives.” 54 The narrative consists of three seemingly disparate plotlines that eventually converge to connect the novel’s seven principal characters. The intersection of these characters from varying racial, economic, and citizenship classes—in addition to the merging of social, spatial, and technological geographies—reveals capitalism as a dynamic ecology. Each strand of connection between these human, technological, and spatial dimensions of the text amplifies the social, mental, and environmental relations that capitalism produces. Marx too refers to capitalism as a quasi-Darwinian organism, not reducible to or fully determined by any one relation (against the claim of economic determinism). Marx asks: “Does not the history of the productive organs of man in society, of organs that are the material basis of every particular organization of society, deserve equal attention [as Darwin pays to the formation of organs of plants and animals]?” 55 His own response might serve as the materialist provocation for the literal and metaphoric strands that Yamashita weaves through her novel: Technology reveals the active relation of man to nature, the direct process of the production of his life, and thereby it also lays bare the process of the production of the social relations of his life, and of the mental conceptions that flow from those relations. 56 Connecting technology, social relations, and mental conceptions, this network of relations is literally and symbolically mobilized in Tropic of Orange by a hemispheric thread being dragged from Mexico to Los Angeles by a mysterious, rogue orange. The Southern Hemisphere is pulled into the North, bringing with it histories of colonialism, labor exploitation, trade imbalances, monetary devaluation, and the cross-border “movement of free capital—45 billion—carried by hidden and cheap labor.” 57 Accompanying this thread is Arcangel, a poet and performance artist whose mission exhumes Benjamin’s “Angel of History,” 58 to give voice to five hundred years of history and resistance in the Americas and to perform the role of El Gran Mojado (The Great Wetback) in an epic wrestling match against the formidable opponent SUPERNAFTA . The second overlapping plotline concerns a massive traffic accident on LA’S Harbor Freeway, which causes explosions and forces drivers to flee while the homeless set up camp in the deserted vehicles. The unyielding traffic jam that ensues over multiple days is, as Jinqi Ling observes, “tantamount to a collapse of capitalist operation in the city of Los Angeles.” 59 Finally, in a third interwoven plotline, we meet Bobby Ngu, who is “Chinese from Singapore with a Vietnam name speaking like a Mexican living in Koreatown.” 60 A hardworking self-employed night janitor, he works during the day in the mailroom of the Los Angeles Times . Abandoned by his Mexican immigrant wife and labor activist, Rafaela, with their young son Sol, he is called by smugglers to pay for safe passage and release of a Chinese cousin in Tijuana. Thrown into these plotlines are lethal oranges, transnational infant organ trafficking, and a lot of television. Building on the significant body of insightful scholarship on the novel’s critique of free trade, its figurative representation of globalization, its hemispheric and transnational geographic scope, and its parody of multicultural universalism, 61 my reading of Tropic of Orange focuses primarily on its three main Asian characters: Bobby, Emi, and Manzanar. This focus aims to illuminate the interplay of labor, immigration status, and capitalism in the neoliberal racialization of Asians that I’ve tracked throughout this book. In particular, I explore the bifurcation of Asian racialization into the “retro” and the “high-tech” classes of what I’m calling postmodern coolie labor. As a hardworking immigrant janitor, Bobby fulfills the “retro coolie” end of the spectrum, while Emi, an Internet addict and the Japanese American television producer for NewsNow , indexes the latter, “high-tech coolie.” In my reading of Manzanar, the homeless Japanese American freeway conductor who exemplifies Marx’s idea of human freedom, I argue that he stands as a figurative embodiment of the text’s political unconscious. Drawing on Fredric Jameson’s hermeneutic approach to excavating literature’s political unconscious, we can see that within the struggle to “wrest a realm of Freedom from a realm of Necessity,” 62 Manzanar restores “to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history [of class struggle].” In many ways he is the essential hermeneutic reader of capitalism, whose primary task, as Chiang notes, “is sheer comprehension, and his conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 63 Throughout the novel, Bobby’s and Emi’s struggle to come to terms and act with political agency is symbolically fulfilled by Manzanar. Although the two characters never come into contact in the novel, Manzanar’s and Bobby’s connection rests in their unusual relation to what Mimi Nguyen calls “the refugee condition.” 64 As a refugee of Japanese American internment, Manzanar is a bodily sign of its unresolved historical excess. Gayle K. Sato observes that Manzanar “embodies and acts out the psychic reality of the inadequacy of the 1988 Civil Liberties Act in itself to enable a Japanese American to be at home in the United States.” 65 On the other hand, Bobby, whose US citizenship is the result of his entry as a refugee, is not strictly speaking a refugee at all. From a family rendered destitute after a multinational American bicycle company drove his father’s bicycle store out of business in Singapore, Bobby and his younger brother infiltrate a Vietnamese refugee camp and are eventually “Saved by the Americans” 66 and transported to the United States. Passing as so-called legitimate refugees, their claims to refugee status could also be based on how transnational American capital destroyed their chances of economic survival. In spite of Bobby’s success, an overwhelming sense of literal and symbolic homelessness haunts him and disconnects him from others. His wife Rafaela sees Bobby’s homelessness through his pervasive insecurity: “This fear of losing what you love, of not feeling trust, this fear of being someplace unsafe but pretending for the sake of others that everything was okay.” 67 Manzanar has managed, however, to convert his postinternment homelessness into an entirely different plane of consciousness about labor. And while Bobby justifies his nonstop work through profligate, empty spending, Manzanar has interrupted the cycle of labor and consumption by relinquishing material comforts to become homeless, with few possessions. Therefore, as two characters who are subject to US hospitality through redress and refugee protections, they magnify the interplay of alien labor productivity, the ethics of consumption, and the contradictions of legal citizenship. Manzanar also animates the active repression of his granddaughter Emi’s historical and political unconscious. On the surface, his homeless asceticism and “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting” 68 dramatically contrasts with his granddaughter’s postmodern exuberance for digital media and technological gadgetry. As a TV producer for NewsNow and avid consumer of the Internet, Emi’s personal disposition reflects the speed-up and commodification of time, where seconds are packaged and sold to commercial sponsors. Despite these differences, Emi’s political unconscious is made visible through this very vexed affiliation to Manzanar. While Manzanar’s homelessness expresses a selective repression of his former identity and history, Emi’s recognition of him exposes her own cultural amnesia and historical dislocation. Notwithstanding the confidence exhibited by her “padded shoulders” 69 and uninhibited personality, “it was questionable if she even had an identity.” 70 Responding to her mother’s accusation that her attitude and behavior are un-Japanese, she retorts: “Maybe I’m not Japanese American. Maybe I got switched in the hospital.” 71 Furthermore, her sense of racial and corporeal displacement is revealed when she confesses to her boyfriend Gabriel, the Chicano reporter, that she had sex with someone else “over the net” 72 but is not sure whether it “counts” as sex. In sum, as the other Japanese American in the novel, Manzanar throws into relief the multicultural aphasia and apathy that thwart Emi’s semi-conscious political will. Bringing the context of migration more explicitly into conversation with the theme of settler colonial inhospitality evoked by Lum’s furniture sculptures, Bobby Ngu’s character exemplifies the sense of homelessness that results from his indebtedness to the promise of the American Dream. He is described as “always working. Hustling. Moving.” 73 Although he owns his home and business, it isn’t enough: “Can’t explain. Happier he is, harder he works. Can’t stop. Gotta make money. Provide for his family. Gotta buy his wife nice clothes. Gotta buy his kid the best. Bobby’s kid’s gonna know the good life. That’s how Bobby sees it.” His blind faith in the American Dream is the reason he doesn’t understand his wife Rafaela’s labor activism. He cannot understand why she joined Justice for Janitors or why she’s complaining. His attitude illustrates the paradox of Mimi Nguyen’s description of the “refugee condition,” as a figure who is both “a target and also an instrument for the gift of freedom” 74 and embodies an “existential condition of suspension or surrender.” 75 He suspends thinking and surrenders to work: Always working. Washing dishes. Chopping vegetables. Cleaning floors. Cooking hamburgers. Painting walls. Laying brick. Cutting hedges. Mowing lawn. Digging ditches. Sweeping trash. Fixing pipes. Pumping toilets. Scrubbing urinals. Washing clothes. Pressing clothes. Sewing clothes. Planting trees. Changing tires. Changing oil and filters. Stocking shelves. Lifting sacks. Loading trucks. Smashing trash. Recycling plastic. Recycling aluminum. Recycling cans and glass. Drilling asphalt. Pouring cement. Building up. Tearing down. Fixing up. Cleaning up. Keeping up. 76 But as Nguyen powerfully exposes, the “gift of freedom” is itself bound up in power through the ways “liberal empire marshals its forces for and against others and elsewhere.” 77 In Bobby’s case, it is a looming sense of unrepayable debt that defines American citizenship and freedom: “Gotta be happy he’s alive in America. Saved by the Americans. New country. New life. Working hard to make it. American through and through. . . . Doing America a favor. Doing his duty.” 78 Demonstrating the inseparability of debt from the gift of freedom that Bobby expresses through his endless workdays, Nguyen writes, “The gift of freedom emerges as a site at which modern governmentality and its politics of life (and death) unfolds as a universal history of the human, and the figuration of debt surfaces as those imperial remains that preclude the subject of freedom from being able to escape a colonial order of things.” 79 It is out of racial debt that he cannot stop consuming, stop working, stop moving. His debt-bound life takes its toll on his closest relationships. His wife, Rafaela, whom he helped smuggle across the border from Mexico, shares no such sense of indebtedness that Bobby does. Getting her degree at Los Angeles Community College, she becomes a labor activist to unionize janitorial workers. As a sign of her rejection of his consumer lifestyle, when she leaves him she takes none of the material goods from their house, which is secured by double locks and a security door: She left the cherry-red Camaro Z28 with the car seat and The Club. She left the house and the 32” Sony KV32V25 stereo TV with picture-inpicture and the Panasonic PUS4670 Super-VHS VCR , the Sony Super-ESP CD player, the AT&T 9011 cordless phone, the furniture, the clothing, the two-door Frigidaire with the icemaker, the Maytag super-capacity washer and gas dryer, the Sharp Carousel R1471 microwave, everything. . . . Didn’t even lock the security door. 80 The nonsensical series of numbers and letters that accompany each commodity satirizes the meaningless abstractions of commodity culture and the value Bobby sees reflected in them. But the many locks, the security door, and the Club Bobby installs to defend his home and car emphasize the intrinsic insecurity and fear that are the basis of his homelessness. His relationship to his younger brother also suffers. Although he sends money, pays college tuition, and pays for books, “when they get together, there’s nothing to say. Bobby’s too busy working.” 81 He realizes after Rafaela leaves him that she and his younger brother “wanted something more.” 82 After he is called by a snakehead to pay for the release of a Chinese cousin being held in Mexico, Bobby begins to see new relations between debt, consumption, and retro coolie labor that he and his wife perform. His first step is to extricate himself from the spiral of work and consumption: like his smoking habit, it’s an addiction that is difficult to quit but will eventually kill him if he doesn’t. Rafaela left because “[she] didn’t want to watch him die.” 83 He begins to reflect on what he had previously refused to hear from Rafaela about their existence as cheap labor, that “we’re not wanted here. Nobody respects our work. Say we cost money. Live on welfare.” 84 He begins to see that by immersing himself in work he has failed to recognize how devalued his life and work are in the United States. His second step is to take a crash course in global capitalism by reading Rafaela’s papers about NAFTA : Titles like Maquiladoras & Migrants. Undocumented, Illegal & Alien: Immigrants vs. Immigration . Talks about globalization of capital. Capitalization of poverty. Internationalization of the labor force. Exploitation and political expediency. Devaluation of currency and foreign economic policy. Economic intervention . 85 Reading them he realizes, “Maybe he’s been too busy. Maybe. But it’s not like he don’t understand.” 86 He begins to see how the circuit of migrant debt and provisional freedom is orchestrated by settler colonial capitalism. The way Rafaela’s papers conceptualize the exploitation of free trade resonates powerfully with the novel’s poet-prophet, Arcangel, who also understands the flows of migrant labor back and forth across the “New World Border”: the deportation of 400,000 Mexican citizens in 1923 coaxing back of 2.2 million braceros in 1942 only to exile the same 2.2 million wetbacks in 1953 . 87 Here the border extends an invitation or expedites removal, exemplifying the contradictions of hospitality evoked earlier in Lum’s furniture sculptures. Alien laborers like him, Bobby realizes, are among the many “gifts from NAFTA ,” the “oranges, bananas, corn, lettuce, guarachis, women’s apparel, tennis shoes, radios, electrodomestics, live-in domestics, living domestics, gardeners, dishwashers, waiters, masons, ditch diggers, migrants, pickers, packers, braceros, refugees, centroamericanos, wetbacks, wops, undocumenteds, illegals, aliens.” 88 Here gifts and debt are one and the same: the gift of migrant labor is multiplied in their ongoing debt to settler colonial capitalism. Bobby’s growing awareness of the exigencies of migration born out of the “capitalization of poverty ” and “globalization of capital ” is enhanced by the situation of his teenage cousin Xiayue, who is being held by smugglers in Tijuana. Although he is skeptical of their relation, he is compelled to help her when he hears she is from Fujian, the same village his mother came from. 89 Fujian, in particular, has a long history of out-migration, more recently due to economic pressures resulting from the Chinese government’s market reforms catering to North American consumer markets. These areas are often classified as Special Economic Zones, which have few labor laws, prohibit trade unions, and slash import and export taxes in order to increase trade. In China, as Peter Kwong remarks, market reforms “have practically eliminated all labor laws, labor benefits and protections. In the ‘free enterprise zones’ workers live virtually on the factory floor, laboring fourteen hours a day for a mere two dollars—that is, about 20 cents an hour.” 90 In the novel, because both of her parents are dead, Xiayue and her older brother knew that they “would have to come [to the United States] sooner or later.” 91 His own mother dead too, Bobby identifies with the girl, thinking, “It’s like it’s maybe twenty years ago. Like it’s him and his kid brother,” 92 except her situation is far more dire. Her arrival has none of the protections of being a refugee. Bobby contemplates the fate of her brother, who, if he’s alive, will enter an America that hasn’t changed since the nineteenth century: “The brother’s gonna work. Work like all the celestials before him. Put down rail ties. Pick oranges. Wash shirts. Sew garments. Stir-fry chop suey.” 93 The sister’s fate is less clear. Passing her off as his daughter, just as he himself passed as a refugee, Bobby gets Xiayue across the border as effortlessly as swiping his credit card: “Drag themselves through the slit jus’ like any Americanos. Just like Visa cards.” 94 The “collapsing of visas and Visa cards,” as Molly Wallace observes, depicts the United States as a “landscape thoroughly mortgaged to global capital. . . . Consumerism, in Tropic of Orange , replaces nationalism.” 95 But within the Visa’s symbolism of debt accumulation, in this case it is poor Third World migrants who must assume that debt. By accompanying Xiayue across the US-Mexico border, Bobby witnesses the transparent economic logic of immigration policy. Just as business immigrants can pay their way into North American citizenship, the poor can purchase entrance, yet the poor must pay off this lifelong debt with insecure citizenship. 96 Through her depiction of US-Mexico border crossing, Yamashita eviscerates the moral standing of the refugee (as the target for the “gift of freedom”) and the immoral standing of the undocumented Asian migrant (as unworthy subject of hospitality) to emphasize the shared conditions of economic exploitation that align poor migrants across free trade zones. Their insecurity is captured when Bobby has no response for Xiayue’s repeated question “What is social security?” 97 In the way that Lum’s photo-text works Melly Shum Hates Her Job and Phew, I’m Tired present a visual challenge to the aesthetics of neoliberal multiculturalism by depicting racial and gendered labor ironically, as a kind of sentimental pop art, Emi’s character in Tropic of Orange also frustrates its homogenizing logics. Unlike Melly Shum’s, however, her private thoughts are not betrayed by the artist but, rather, willingly expressed by her character. Despite Emi’s clear disconnect from her Japanese American cultural heritage and racial politics—her idea of real “struggle” is when her parents force her to make “payments on [her] Civic” 98 —her insights about the contradictory interplay of Asian racialization and neoliberal multiculturalism reveal a surfacing political consciousness. With blithe unsentimentality, Emi recognizes the dehumanized mechanical abstraction that the Asian body signifies. Ridiculing the romantic anticapitalist sentiments of her boyfriend Gabriel’s desire to reject “all this [materialism]” and commune with nature by “mak[ing] something I can actually touch and eat,” she tells him, “I read somewhere that these days, if you are making a product you can actually touch and . . . [are] making a comfortable living at it, you are either an Asian or a machine.” 99 Her point is that Gabriel’s valorization of productive over financial labor, signaled by “planting a tree,” is a false one—that there is no nature external to capitalism. Moreover, with deindustrialization and US outsourcing of manufacturing labor, the level of exploitation experienced by Third World Asian laborers reduces them to dehumanized machines. Such a vexed conflation of Asians and machines—as high-tech coolies—is also one of the reasons she admits that “there are producers who would kill me if they knew who I was.” 100 However, Emi’s own obsession with technological gadgetry and immersion into the ephemeral world of cyber-sex suggest her own resigned participation in the increasing digital abstraction of social lives, as she remarks, “Who needs a reality check?” 101 Despite Emi’s cynical disdain for politics, she is able to see past the multiculturalist veneer of capitalist determinism. At a sushi restaurant she informs Gabriel that money drives everything, that social change has nothing to do with justice or humanity: It’s just about money. It’s not about good honest people like you or about whether us Chicanos or Asians get a bum rap or whether third world countries deserve dictators or whether we should make the world safe for democracy. It’s about selling things: Reebok, Pepsi, Chevrolet, All-State, Pampers, Pollo Loco, Levis, Fritos, Larry Parker Esq., Tide, Raid, the Pillsbury Doughboy, and Famous Amos. Them that’s smart took away the pretense and do the home shopping thing, twenty-four hours. Hey, we’re all on board to buy. 102 In Emi’s economic determinist rendition, social justice is just a “pretense”—a fetish of capitalist ideology. But in her view one may as well embrace this reality because there is no ethical outside: “We’re all on board to buy.” Her pragmatism leads her to take on a particular disdain for the pretext of multicultural ethics, to the extent that she enjoys being as “antimulticultural” 103 as possible. As a favorite pastime, she and Gabriel devise fictional stories about the “multicultural mosaic” 104 of characters while they are eating lunch in the sushi restaurant, including the “Caucasian Japanophiles who talk real Japanese with the sushi man.” 105 Predictably, an eavesdropping white woman takes offense to Emi’s pronouncements that “cultural diversity is bullshit. . . . It’s a white guy wearing a Nirvana T-shirt and dreds. That’s cultural diversity.” 106 In defense of multiculturalism and cultural diversity, the woman—wearing two “ornately-lacquered chopsticks” in her hair—retorts, “I love living in L.A. because I can find anything in the world to eat, right here. . . . A true celebration of the international world. It just makes me sick to hear people speak so cynically about something so positive and to make assumptions about people based on their color.” 107 The woman’s morally superior rationale highlights the evacuated antiracist politics that Žižek ascribes to “multiculturalism, or the cultural logic of multinational capitalism,” in which “liberal ‘tolerance’ condones the folklorist Other deprived of its substance—like the multitude of ‘ethnic cuisines’ in a contemporary megalopolis.” 108 In short, the woman’s expression of neoliberal moralism converts racial politics into a celebratory form of white cultural consumption, flattening racial difference into a commodified feature of the global city. For this reason we hear an echo of Melly Shum Hates Her Job in Emi’s retort: “I hate being multicultural.” 109 Both Melly Shum and Emi recognize that for the racialized worker operating within a capitalist logic of multicultural equivalence, “you’re invisible, I’m invisible. We’re all invisible. It’s just tea, ginger, raw fish, and a credit card.” 110 At another level, Emi’s exchange with the white woman recalls the post-modern racism evoked by Lum’s photograph Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate : Nancy and Joe can be viewed as the inviolable poster children of multiculturalism, a shield of cultural diversity to deflect criticism of the dramatic escalation of real estate values in Vancouver that is often blamed on wealthy Asian investors. In Tropic of Orange , the woman’s implication that Emi is being racist by “mak[ing] assumptions about people based on their color” parallels the way that, in the similar urban context of Vancouver, where neoliberalism has reformed immigration policy and expanded the flow of capital across international borders, it has become racist to call into question the logic of capitalism. In a perversion of racial politics, open challenges such as Emi’s to the multicultural logic of capitalism have been conflated with racist and anti-immigrant voices. As Jodi Melamed points out, neoliberal multiculturalism “disconnects antiracism and economic justice, denying race as a structure of capitalist organization” that would reveal “continuities between prewar colonial capitalism and postwar US global ascendancy and expanding transnational capitalism.” 111 Moreover, when the white woman accuses Emi of racial intolerance, we see how her neoliberal expression of cultural appreciation obfuscates the profound continuity between racial divisions produced historically—through structures of colonialism and slavery—and the contemporary expropriation of surplus-value from racialized and gendered Third World labor working in free-trade zones. Such an ideology simultaneously naturalizes economic disparity by deflecting criticism through moralizing slogans of cultural diversity and racial equivalence. Ultimately, Emi prevails in revealing the superficiality of the woman’s moral high ground when she ridicules her self-serving multiculturalist aestheticism, asking her whether she would “consider using these [two forks] in your hair? Or would you consider that . . . unsanitary?” 112 The woman’s expression is appropriately “blanched” in response. After Los Angeles authorities wage a full-scale military assault on the homeless occupants of abandoned cars on the jammed freeway while Emi is tanning on top of the NewsNow van, her death by the first bullet evokes the doubleness signaled by the Asian body’s economism, an inherently racial ambiguity that positions her both as retro coolie underclass and high-tech coolie/robot overclass. Her last words, “Abort. Retry. Ignore. Fail,” 113 seem to recall the death of a replicant in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner and is similarly mired in racial signifiers of mechanical and technological domination. Following David Palumbo-Liu’s reading of the film’s representation of the human/nonhuman divide as a racialized phenomenon that “serves to maintain the essential inhuman character of the replicant against that of the human,” 114 the replicants too evoke a doubleness in the sense that they are simultaneously the slaves and potential oppressors of white humans. Blurring the line between human victim and cyborg oppressor, Emi offers a renewed representation of Lye’s observation of the conspiratorial economism invested in the Asian figure: “When we are looking at Japanese, we can never be sure whether we are seeing businessmen or coolies.” 115 As a conflation of both, she epitomizes a Homo sacer , she who “may be killed and yet not sacrificed ” 116 in the free-fire zone of the homeless-occupied freeway. Within the logic of Yamashita’s narrative, Emi’s doubleness is also linked to her political and cultural alienation in the face of her estranged grandfather, Manzanar. The paralysis she experiences is symbolic of her inability to engage with her family history and Japanese American history more broadly. After initially recognizing her grandfather on the overpass and “star[ing] at him in disbelief,” 117 she can only watch him from afar cursing to herself—“Damn that old deadbeat on the overpass” 118 —and never finds “the courage to march up there to meet the man.” 119 After Buzzworm repeatedly urges her to meet him, she shrugs him off, asking, “What’s the point?” 120 Her death soon after this exchange suggests that it is this sense of apathy that is partially responsible for her untimely death. Even though she begins to absorb Manzanar’s consciousness through the music he conducts—“a melody she could not place but knew. Electronic tones representing numerical information, i.e., music” 121 —she shuns her genetic connection to the old man: “Wasn’t everything from Alzheimer’s to schizophrenia genetic? Damn.” 122 After she is shot, Emi dreams that she will be buried in the La Brea Tar Pits and later become “La Brea Woman . . . bones and a holographic image of me.” 123 Her identification with the ancient Indigenous woman buried in the tar pits suggests, perhaps, her own regret that she too will become some mysterious, decomposed hieroglyph of history. Even though her death might stem from political paralysis, her slaying catapults her to the status of Christ-like martyrdom whose endlessly repeated televised death signals the onset of urban war, particularly for Manzanar. The moment she is shot, he can no longer go on conducting the swelling sounds of revolution below him as he awakens to his own anger and pain: “The sound of the shot penetrated Manzanar’s very being with a vengeance he did not understand. The moment repeated itself again and again; he clothed it in desperation each time with pain and more pain.” 124 Coming back to the surface, his memories return in a flood, triggered by the sight of an infant’s heart that has been harvested and trafficked from south of US-Mexico border. In this moment, instead of joining sounds of the freeway into “an entire civilization of sound,” 125 he connects his own history: his wartime confinement in a Japanese American internment camp, his surgical practice of “careful incisions . . . inserting implants, facilitating transplants,” 126 and his life on the societal margins as a homeless freeway conductor. Although he is no longer a surgeon, which, as Ling observes, registers “his refusal to participate in the perpetuation of human tragedy in the name of human need” by “using organs obtained from questionable sources,” 127 the visions of premature death reanimate his connection to the world he left behind. In the profound sensory universe from which Manzanar hails, his “surfacing” is enacted through visual rather than aural stimuli: the sight of the infant heart and of his fatally wounded granddaughter. But his reconnection to the surface world of sight and sound ultimately overloads him: “He had seen enough. And he had heard everything.” 128 Our last glimpse of Manzanar is on a gurney hanging from a helicopter holding his granddaughter’s hand, witnessing from above a vision of atomic annihilation stopped short: Peering cautiously from his higher perch, saw bird’s-eye the inflation of thousands upon thousands of automotive airbags, bursting simultaneously everywhere from their pouches in steering wheels and glove compartments like white poppies in sudden bloom. All the airbags in L.A. ruptured forth, unfurled their white powdered wings against the barrage of bullets, and stunned the war to a dead stop. But Manzanar heard nothing . 129 Here the simultaneous bursting of thousands of airbags, like “white poppies in sudden bloom,” eerily evoke the mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But in this case it is the supernatural force of the airbags’ automatic deployment that stops the war. Regardless, Manzanar hears nothing. Manzanar’s deafness at this apocalyptic scene exceeds what Ling identifies as the “cognitive plenitude” 130 he performs as a freeway conductor, where his brain is comfortably submerged under an ocean of “foam and floating kelp.” 131 Without the orchestral language of his political consciousness, in his confrontation with the sensory overload of capitalist urbanity he “dissolves,” as Ling contends, “into the novel’s imagined urban tide of carnival revolts.” 132 Manzanar’s sensory collapse suggests the difficult unity of political consciousness and the materiality of racialized vulnerability to death. Although the novel ends without a clear sense of Manzanar’s fate, his ascent from the overpass onto a gurney flying across LA while “the entire city [had] sprouted grassroots conductors of every sort” 133 presents a tilted ecology of capitalist relations where Manzanar’s urban literacy has been disseminated to a next generation of conductors. Like Manzanar, whose romantic detachment as freeway conductor dissolves the moment Emi is shot, Emi and Bobby also undergo metamorphosis. Emi’s cultural alienation and immersion into digital technology ultimately leads to high-tech failure as she dies. Bobby, whose working life has turned him into a labor automaton, stops working. Reversing the inhuman tropes of Asians as “killer robots” or “Asian ‘dragon’ gangs” depicted in narratives that participate in what Mike Davis calls the “literary destruction of LA ,” 134 Yamashita’s Asian characters collectively register sensory disability (Manzanar), nonproductivity (Bobby), and technological failure (Emi). This generalized sphere of nonproductivity gestures toward what Mitchell and Snyder recognize as “forms of incapacity as the new galvanizing agent of post-modern resistance.” 135 But we are left with a far-from-sanguine vision of LA : homeless junkies feasting on trafficked infant organs “toasted like marshmallows” 136 and the mutual destruction of SUPERNAFTA and Arcangel in the wrestling match “sponsored by a generous grant from the Ministry of Multicultures [and hosted by] the CIA , the PRI , the DEA , and the INS ”; 137 “profits from the ticket sales were being divided” 138 after the match. It is a world in suspension, “unplugged and timeless,” 139 on the verge of collapse. To amplify the political stakes of narrative suspension that concludes Yamashita’s novel, I want to bring this chapter to a close by returning to Ken Lum’s artwork to tie the themes of labor and neoliberal immigration together with the strands of Asian racialization and romantic anticapitalism I have explored through this book. In particular, like the tilted capitalist ecology presented in Yamashita’s novel, Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (figure 4.10 ) offers a similarly “unnatural” presentation of global movement shaped by settler colonial capitalism. The sculpture is the result of a commission Lum won in 1999 that was part of Vancouver’s Millennial Public Art Project, “On Location.” The work, located on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery, cannot be viewed in its entirety from any one side of the building. It consists of four boats, each placed on a corner of the gallery roof that faces east, west, north, or south. FIGURE 4.10 Ken Lum, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , 2000.

The different primary colors chosen for each boat suggest racial typologies: yellow for Chinese, red for First Nations, white for Europeans, and black for Indians. The design of each boat also evokes more concrete historical periods and episodes. For instance, the red boat is a representation of a First Nations longboat used by Coast Salish communities located along the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. The white boat depicts the HMS Discovery , the Royal Navy ship that led George Vancouver’s exploration of the West Coast of North America between 1791 and 1795. The black boat in Lum’s sculpture is a replica of the Komagata Maru , a Japanese boat chartered by an Indian businessman in the early twentieth century. In 1914, 376 British Indian residents of Hong Kong, China, and Japan who were onboard the Komagata Maru were detained for two months in Vancouver Harbor before being turned away. Even though the boat had fulfilled the requirements of a “continuous journey” law, specifically designed to bar entry of Indian immigrants unless they arrived “by a continuous journey on through tickets purchased before leaving the country,” 140 their legal exclusion was ultimately based on their presumed unassimilability in a white Canada. The fourth, yellow boat in Lum’s sculpture is a representation of one of the four Fujianese migrant ships that, reprising the Komagata Maru incident eighty-five years later, were detained off the coast of Vancouver in 1999 for nearly two months. On board were 599 undocumented migrants from the Fujian province of China, who—unlike Bobby’s niece Xiayue—were detained and eventually deported. The title of Lum’s sculpture, Four Boats Stranded , is a specific reference to the media’s characterization of the four Fujianese boats. For the most part, the media coverage exploited their criminality through images of barbed wire, shackles, guard dogs, orange prison uniforms, and guards. As Anna Pratt remarks, this event demonstrated the “slippage between categories of refugees, frauds, and criminals . . . [and] spectacle in the application of sovereign power.” 141 Lum’s sculpture’s subtitle, Red and Yellow, Black and White , evokes an American abolitionist context. According to Carla Benzan, the phrase refers to a Civil War–era Sunday school song whose verse goes: “Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world; red and yellow, black and white.” 142 By drawing on dissonant tropes of settler colonialism, Asian exclusion, and racial equivalence, the sculpture’s response to the migrant crisis is largely an invocation of immigration history: a history of boat people. If we consider this sculpture against the aesthetic disorientations of Lum’s furniture sculptures and image-text works discussed earlier, Four Boats Stranded ’s invocation of immigration history is similarly irreverent. For one, despite being a public art commission, the sculpture is located on the roof of the downtown gallery and thus is largely inaccessible to the public audience. Here the work ironically inverts the duality of disinterested high art and low “popular” art in its placement above the gallery, so that it is literally “high” art. In keeping with pop art’s challenge of the exclusivity and cultural orthodoxy of the art gallery space, Lum’s bright, toylike depiction of the boats similarly evokes the staged pathos of narratives that erase Native peoples to remind us that we are “a nation of immigrants.” Given the themes of commodified repetition in pop art such as Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroes, this pop-art rendering of the boats also suggests a banality and reproducibility as subjects of mass consumption. As such, they subvert the association of art as the original product of artistic invention and leave the viewer without a straightforward idea of the sculpture’s relation toward the historical and political content it clearly alludes to. By taking boats out of water and putting them into the air, I suggest, Lum aims here, as in his other works, to offer a decontextualized aesthetics of the border and thereby denaturalize its racial logics. From this view, the placement of the sculpture on the gallery roof connects to Yamashita’s novel in terms of the inverted, suspended ecology it similarly evokes. While the landscape of Tropic of Orange is transformed by a thread pulling the Southern Hemisphere into the North, Lum’s sculpture reconfigures the spatial properties of land, water, and air with boats that apparently fly. The very inaccessibility of these boats also highlights the work of a metaphoric and invisible border that has “stranded” these four boats high in the air. Decontextualizing the North–South border as a thread and the East–West border as air, Yamashita’s and Lum’s works suggest connection and absence, respectively. For Yamashita, that connection is first rendered ambiguous as Bobby, in the novel’s final scene, grasps the thread, asking himself, “What are these goddamn lines anyway? What do they connect? What do they divide?” 143 His decision to let go and rejoin his family suggests that the thread is no longer a border to cross; it is now a line to release. In Lum’s sculpture, the apparatus of the border is reconfigured as an art domain, a space of figuration that deconstructs a pop veneer of multicultural equivalence contained in the rhetoric of a “nation of immigrants.” Reframing the nation as a field of racial incommensurability, Lum’s boats stage a narrative of white settler colonial invasion: the conversion of Indigenous land into sovereign property with the power to exclude based on race, in the case of the Komagata Maru , followed by the neoliberal power to include on the basis of economic class, in the case of the exclusion of poor Fujianese migrants. Adopting a pop aesthetic, Lum’s sculpture undermines the rhetoric of the border as a moralizing tool of neoliberal multiculturalism whose hospitality is reserved for flexible citizens and high-tech coolies while exploiting the vulnerability of Fujianese retro coolies and other undocumented arrivals. From a more dystopic perspective, moreover, the suspended boats parody the dream of totally boundless free trade and mobility, what Postone describes as “a fantasy of freedom as the complete liberation from matter, from nature . . . a ‘dream of capital’ [that] is becoming the nightmare of that from which it strives to free itself—the planet and its inhabitants.” 144 Denaturalizing nature itself, Lum and Yamashita redirect the target of romantic anticapitalism toward the field of representation that obfuscates the dehumanizing dialectic of capitalist value. By animating the border against its North–South and East–West hemispheric histories, Yamashita and Lum accentuate its prominence in the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. According to Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler, “the settler mode of production” relies on a developed capitalist world market and exploitation of the migrant labor system, a system that has advantages over slave holding because it helps to paralyze the resistance potential of domestic labor. They explain that “from purely economic considerations, migrant labour seems more efficient in terms of absolute surplus-value formation and the minimization of the social costs of reproduction.” 145 Contrary to the notion that migrant labor is an economic burden, migrant labor often assumes the total costs of its social reproduction. Moreover, the United States’ long-standing interventionist mode has transformed economies and governments south of the border and across the Pacific and has contributed to the internationalization and expansion of the surplus labor force from which North America can draw. Settler colonial capitalism continually reinvents the levels of unfreedom through the creation of the debt-bound migrant. As Bierrman and Kössler explain, “Settler capitalism differs from slave-holding in the important respect that here the class of migrant workers as a whole is, in true capitalist fashion, dependent on the class of settler capitalists as a whole. Although the migrant workers are not personally free, their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 146 In Yamashita’s and Lum’s respective evocations of the suspended function that interrupts the productive flow of migrant labor and capital, they emphasize the destructive interplay of human labor and value production that is objectified at the border.

      "content": "CHAPTER 4 THE NEW NINETEENTH CENTURY Neoliberal Borders, the City, and the Logic of Settler Colonial Capitalism Art Imitates Art Between 6 and 8 A.M . on four consecutive mornings in July 1978, multimedia artist Ken Lum stood on the east bank of the 152nd Street overpass leading rush-hour commuters into Vancouver from Surrey. Entertainment for Surrey , the grainy black-and-white video-recording of this performance, depicts Lum in jeans and a sweatshirt facing oncoming traffic, standing on a strip of grass on the side of the highway (figure 4.1 ). Recounting his experience, Lum observed, “The first day there was some reaction, the second day there was much more, but on the third day people ignored me.” 1 On the fourth day, many commuters had grown accustomed to him, honking and waving as their cars disappeared under the overpass. On the fifth and final morning of the performance, Lum replaced his body with a large white cardboard cutout of himself, a representation of the “living statue” he had become. 2 Lum explained that “people quickly came to expect me on the same spot. I became a sign.” 3 The humor in Lum’s comment is its double edge: he literally turned his body into a cardboard sign while, at the level of postmodern signification, his body became a referential sign. Turning the highway overpass into a performance art space and the Asian male body into a sign of repetition, Entertainment for Surrey collapses the boundary between literal and figurative representation. Even more dramatically, his performance probes the spatial absurdity of the individual—of individualism itself—in an urban environment designed to facilitate the movement of labor, goods, and capital. As Jeff Derksen observes, “The tension between mobility and fixity is often heightened by [Lum’s] grinding of the scales between the urban and the global and between capitalism and the subject.” 4 Only by recognizing his apparent lack of function or purpose could otherwise baffled commuters have been alerted to the artistic registers of his performance. For the purposes of this chapter, the way Lum stages a visual interruption in the flow of capitalist circulation offers new avenues for mining the abstractions signaled by the Asian body after the neoliberal turn. In the parallel urban literary world of Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange , another artist ascends the freeway overpass to deliver daily performances. Enter Manzanar Murasaki, the homeless Sansei who stands atop the Los Angeles Harbor Freeway at the downtown interchange to conduct an orchestra that he alone hears. For this grizzled, white-haired artist, it is “the complexity of human adventure over lines of transit” that fascinate him, and he is grateful for the opportunity to use his silver baton to direct the sounds of traffic, which amount to “nothing less than the greatest orchestra on Earth.” 5 Is he crazy? We learn that Manzanar was not always a conductor. He was once a skilled surgeon who abruptly left his profession, family, and friends to become a “missing person.” 6 He decided one day to exit the world he knew, “followed an ancient tortoise out into a deep place in his brain and stayed there year after year.” 7 Using the alias “Manzanar,” he references his birthplace at Manzanar Concentration Camp in the Owens Valley, where he was the first Sansei born into captivity during World War II. We learn that he could easily have applied his artistic talents to becoming “a sculptor in clay, wood, or even marble—any sort of inanimate substance”; however, “strangely, it was the abstraction of music that engulfed his being.” 8 Los Angeles commuters rarely take notice of him, though, thinking themselves “disconnected from a sooty homeless man on an overpass.” 9 Nevertheless, he had become a “fixture on the freeway overpass much like a mural or a traffic information sign or a tagger’s mark.” 10 Like Ken Lum in Entertainment for Surrey , Manzanar became a sign. Both Lum and Manzanar bear an uncanny resemblance to David Caspar Friedrich’s Wanderer above the Sea of Fog discussed in chapter 2 , the iconic embodiment of the Byronic hero surveying the vast, mountainous landscape before him. Even Buzzworm, the African American street philanthropist of Tropic of Orange , calls Manzanar the “ultimate romantic.” 11 However, while Lum and Manzanar evoke the individualism of the romantic figure, they do not adopt Albert Boime’s notion of a “magisterial gaze,” 12 given the total absence of control they exert over the oncoming traffic. Observing the way Manzanar responds to the dizzying urban flows of capitalist production with a “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting,” Mark Chiang highlights the irony that Manzanar “does not control anything. . . . His conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 13 Thus it is a kind of purposeful purposelessness that binds Lum and Manzanar, two Asian North Americans who abandoned their real and fictional lives as model minorities—Lum’s as a scientist and Manzanar’s as a surgeon—to yield to an artistic vision that would compel them to their respective freeway overpasses. Against the rational landscape of the freeway and the temporal organization of the workweek, both artists suspend and denaturalize the relation between the body and sign, embodying a postromantic subjectivity whose exaggerated nonproductivity constitutes a strange other of capitalism. Evoking forms of undisciplined labor power, Lum and Manzanar index a sphere of disability , a nonrehabilitative population that remains distinct from the exploitable population of racialized and gendered surplus labor. David T. Mitchell and Sharon Snyder designate nonproductive bodies as those “inhabitants of the planet who, largely by virtue of biological (in)capacity, aesthetic non-conformity, and/or non-normative labor patterns . . . [are] not merely excluded from—but also resistant to standardized labor demands of human value.” 14 They point to Antonio Negri’s term “living labor” to “suggest forms of creativity that cannot be reduced to an economic value.” 15 In this sense, both Lum and Manzanar stage a confrontation of capitalism’s naturalized modes of consumption, circulation, and social organization—using and misusing the freeway as motif of urban modernity. Most important for this chapter is how their bodies-as-sign animate new relations between labor and the Asian body against the flows of global capital. A utopian ideal of functional disruption captured by Lum’s and Manzanar’s performances guides this chapter’s focus on the ongoing racial abstractions assigned to the Asian body in an apocalyptic phase of contemporary capitalism. Describing the “catastrophic character of the current phase shift that global capital is undergoing,” Chris Nealon labels it a “late late capitalism.” 16 The previous chapters in this book have examined capitalism as a representational regime whose fetishism mystifies the social relations embedded in commodity production. Within its social distortion, I explored how alien Asian labor has since the nineteenth century functioned as biological signifier of the destructively abstract dimension of an antinomical view of capitalist relations. Moishe Postone ties the origins of this antinomy to the commodity form itself, wherein each commodity’s expression of use-value and exchange value is misperceived as an antinomical (rather than dialectical) relation of concrete and abstract dimensions. From this view, which I’ve described as a form of romantic anticapitalism, use-value appears concrete, “as objective in the sense of being objectlike, ‘material’ or ‘thingly,’” while exchange-value appears abstract,” as “general, homogenous, and abstracted from all particularity.” 17 In other words, even though a commodity such as a chair contains both use-value as something to sit on and exchange-value as a quantitative dimension that enables the chair to be bought and sold, romantic anticapitalism perceives these two characteristics as so completely disconnected they are oppositional—antinomical—rather than dialectically related. As a key ideological anchor of white settler colonialism, romantic anticapitalism always favors the qualitative over the quantitative. It prefers the concrete dimension for being natural, material, tactile, and thus closer to earthly origins in an increasingly artificial world. For the romantic anticapitalist, capitalism is identified solely with the abstract exchange dimension of the antinomy, while the concrete dimension is perceived as essentially noncapitalist. This book interprets anti-Asian racism as a fetishized, one-sided form of settler colonial romantic anticapitalism, an ideology that anthropomorphizes capitalism’s abstract dimension as alien Asian labor. As such, my first two chapters explored how Asian North American literature and visual culture exposes and disidentifies with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century association of Asian labor with an abstractly perverse, unnatural, and destructive economism that threatened the normative social reproduction of white concrete labor. In the third chapter, on postmemory narratives of Japanese internment in North America, I probed the extent of the destructiveness associated with Japanese labor, whose excessive efficiency and perceived control over the creation of relative surplus-value were key elements in the decision to relocate and confine Japanese civilians. Then, by connecting the relocation of Japanese North American labor to the settler colonial precedent of Native North American relocation evoked by these narratives, I argued that the exploitation of relocated Japanese labor contributed to the resignification of Japanese bodies as an ideal “surplus” labor force, dispossessed of any control over the creation of relative surplus-value. This facilitated a symbolic process that Jodi Kim calls “gendered racial rehabilitation,” 18 which enabled Japanese civilians to be aligned with the ameliorated status of model minority in the midst of civil rights activism in the United States during the Cold War. However, as this chapter will explore further, the neoliberal reconstitution of immigration laws in Canada and the United States in the latter twentieth century has reinforced the destructive abstraction associated with Asian alien surplus labor, an abstraction that comes into heightened relief in Vancouver and Los Angeles, two cities that refract urbanism, immigration, and trans-Pacific economic flows of labor, goods, and capital. Examining Karen Tei Yamashita’s Los Angeles as imagined in her 1997 novel Tropic of Orange alongside Ken Lum’s Vancouver through his multimedia works—concluding with a reading of his sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (1999)—my central argument in this chapter is that these artists bring into focus the border as a key apparatus of neoliberal multiculturalism that facilitates the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. I demonstrate how the neoliberalization of the border substitutes economic class for race, resulting in a bifurcated economism of Asian racialization. As John Park outlines, the unprecedented rise of skilled and affluent migrants from Asia has been coupled with the similar explosion in undocumented aliens; Park observes that in the United States “up to one million undocumented aliens are now from Asian countries. . . . Their numbers multiplied four or five times over the past 25 years.” 19 Immigration policy increasingly privileges flexible Asian citizens with foreign capital, expanding and entrenching the alignment of Asians with an abstract dimension of destructively alien capital. Vancouver’s identity as an Asian metropolis and “Pacific gateway” has coincided with widespread resentment of wealthy Chinese investor-migrants, who are blamed for the city’s skyrocketing property prices. 20 At the same time, poor Asian migrants situated at the margins of legality represent a perennial threat to the social order and remain indebted to the precarious structure of settler colonial hospitality. In this neoliberal scenario, settler colonial romantic anticapitalism targets both the population of highly skilled, capitalized migrants that L. Ling-chi Wang calls “high-tech coolies” 21 and the population of poor migrants—we might call them “retro” coolies—who have always been the subject of labor exploitation guaranteed by class-based structures of immigrant exclusion that have been in place in North America since the nineteenth century. We should recall that the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States specifically barred laborers and exempted merchant classes, while Canada’s 1885 Chinese Head Tax (and later 1923 Chinese Immigration Act) similarly aimed to deter poor Chinese migrants through financial hardship. In a contemporary climate that looks like a neoliberal nineteenth century, therefore, the economic logic of the border reinforces the alignment of Asians with the abstract threat of foreign investment, whose incursion into North America represent an oppressive “takeover” of traditional values and social order. At the same time, the population of undesirables (and provisional desirables, in the case of certain refugees) remains an alien labor threat to the security of citizen wages and normative social reproduction. While Ken Lum’s multimedia works evoke the superficiality of neoliberal multiculturalist aesthetics, Yamashita’s novel provides a complementary view of alien labor subjectivity conditioned by globalization. I conclude with a reading of the inverted ecology of the border represented in Yamashita’s novel and Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , which sits on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery. At stake in Yamashita’s and Lum’s aesthetic reconfigurations of the border is the value of human labor in late late capitalism. Lum’s Multicultural Discontents In order to contextualize my reading of Lum’s Four Boats Stranded , one of his most direct responses to the issue of immigration in Canada, this section establishes his conceptual ties to pop art and minimalism and the way his art probes themes of social exclusion, multiculturalism, and labor. His work powerfully reconsiders the interplay of multicultural citizenship, labor alienation, and stranger hospitality that shapes the landscape of urban racialization. Since the late 1970s, Lum’s work has achieved international renown and acclaim. Through the decades his work has consistently examined the tense boundary between mobility and stasis (as in Entertainment for Surrey ), public and private space, access and exclusion, image and text, reflection and projection. The spatial boundaries Lum erects are often uncomfortably fraught with race, gender, and class implications. Beginning in the 1980s, he gained visibility for his furniture sculptures, such as Sculpture for Dream Home (1980), Red Circle (1986), and Corner Bed (1990). Each of these sculptures engages the spatial politics of domesticity and hospitality, whose symbolism encompasses the personal as much as the national. For example, in Sculpture for Dream Home (figure 4.2 ), four identical contemporary sofas with side tables and lamps are wedged together into a perfect square. At first glance, the uniformity of the arrangement recalls the impersonal but functional aesthetic of a hotel lobby. But the viewer quickly realizes that the sofas are so tightly interlocked there’s no way to actually sit down on any of them. The functionality of the sofas is entirely displaced, and the viewer is literally marginalized by the sculpture, blocked from accessing its interior, core space. They evoke Derrida’s notion that the “law of hospitality . . . appears as a paradoxical law, pervertible or perverting”: 22 FIGURE 4.2 Ken Lum, Sculpture for Dream Home , 1980. This right to hospitality offered to a foreigner “as a family,” represented and protected by his name or her family name, is at once what makes hospitality possible, or the hospitable relationship to the foreigner possible, but by the same token what limits and prohibits it. Because hospitality, in this situation, is not offered to an anonymous new arrival and someone who has neither name, nor patronym, nor family, nor social status, and who is therefore treated not as a foreigner but as another barbarian. 23 FIGURE 4.3 Ken Lum, Red Circle , 1986. Fabric, wood, 300 cm diameter. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Acquisition Fund. Photo: Trevor Mills, Vancouver Art Gallery. In other words, Sculpture for Dream Home captures the contradictions of hospitality that must distinguish between the foreigner and absolute other, whose provisional guarantee of welcome simultaneously expresses its opposite: rejection. The sculpture thus resignifies the stage of mundane domesticity into one of inhospitality, a hostile expression of isolation that calls into question the spatial boundaries that configure social belonging and exclusion. Continuing these themes more dramatically is Red Circle (1986), which consists of a plump fire-engine-red sofa in the shape of a circle (figure 4.3 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home , the sofa violates its own function. Despite its inviting, cushiony enclosure, there is no way to actually sit on this sofa. Its sexually inviting minimalist aesthetic, conveyed through its seductive color and symmetrical vertical lines, adds to the sense of calculated exclusion and thwarted intimacy. A modernist ethos of form over function seems responsible for accentuating the viewer’s dislocation and nonbelonging. Observing the manner through which these sculptures harness the viewer’s sense of exclusion, Okwui Enwezor identifies Lum’s furniture works as “social sculptures” in the sense that they invite a social reading of minimalism: “Where minimalism abjured the presence of the subject in order to prioritize the presence of the object, social and relational sculpture reasserted the primacy of the subject.” 24 In this view, these sculptures register a critique of minimalism’s abstractions and evacuation of historical and social context. Connecting minimalism’s focus on pure form and capitalism, Scott Watson calls attention to the way minimalist works such as Donald Judd’s boxes or Carl Andre’s bricks seem to replicate disturbing transformations in the built urban landscape: “Regularity, logic and order in the art work were suddenly implicated in the conformist tendencies of society; the abstractions of pure form became ciphers from the abstractions of capital itself.” 25 That is, the desire for disinterested, abstract, pure form was a reflection of the conformist, homogenizing spirit of capitalism. Moreover, Lum’s reconfiguration of the use-value of the sofas as art seems to satirize the modernist ideal of “better living” achieved through the fusion of art and design. Here that view is collapsed into a scene of insecure, empty living. Among the last of these furniture works, Corner Bed (1990) adds a further layer of dysfunction to the social space of the domestic “living” room. The sculpture consists of two unfolded sofa beds that face a corner (figure 4.4 ). Like Sculpture for Dream Home and Red Circle , the sofa beds cannot be accessed; the viewer can neither sit nor lie on either sofa bed. What’s distinct about Corner Bed is how it registers the theme of inhospitality more intensely by evoking an excluded visitor. As sofa beds are mostly used for temporary guests rather than permanent residents, Corner Bed suggests an aggressive exclusion of visitors and strangers. Putting the sculpture into the sustained geographical emphasis on the city of Vancouver in Lum’s work, the piece also alludes to the city’s historical hostility toward Asian migrants who have sought and continue to seek entry to Canada via Vancouver. As Enwezor reflects, the work “propos[es] an analysis of spatial politics that is all too familiar within regimes of border control.” 26 Here we see the suggestive refraction of private living space into the social domain of national exclusion. But what complicates a straightforward reading of racial exclusion is the pathetic, half-hearted display of hospitality (the sofa beds are unfolded, for instance) that Lum cuts into these furniture sculptures. The ambivalent message of the furniture’s arrangement reinforces the paradox of Derrida’s elaboration of hospitality while evoking both an invitation and an expectation of strangers.

The dark humor of Lum’s sculptures also marks his photographic works, which probe the unvarnished materiality of urban life in Vancouver. In his portrait-text works, Lum opts for scenes that do not recycle mythologized panoramas of the Lion’s Gate Bridge or the sunset over English Bay that project the city’s beauty and cosmopolitanism. Rather, Lum’s Vancouver often reflects his own background in the working-class and often invisible east side of Vancouver. His grandfather arrived as an immigrant before the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1923 and found work on the Canada Pacific Railway. When Lum was growing up, his mother worked in sweatshops and his father held menial jobs. As a result, the Vancouver Lum projects highlights the decidedly unglamorous side of urban existence: the minimalls, parking lots, and sidewalks populated by immigrants, workers, and people who often seem down and out. These are the characters and locales Lum connects to his own childhood in East Vancouver: There were all those families whose fathers worked as dishwashers with the mothers sewing in sweatshops; that’s basically my family roots. Then there are the very desperate, itinerant families at the bottom. East Vancouver is also an area with many immigrants, so there is always a kind of confusion in reference to how people relate to one another. 27 But as his furniture works suggest, Lum is far from sentimental in his approach to East Vancouver and its inhabitants. Rather, Lum’s firsthand experience compels him to weave a dark humor into his portrayal of Vancouver, with an eye to how the global economy shapes urban existence as well as our perception of it. The neoliberal turn in economic commonsense has resulted in increasing production and movement of goods and people, widening the gap between rich and poor, expanding the gendered and racialized global wage-labor force, and swelling the proportions of that global population who live in the city. As Derksen observes, these are dynamics of the global-urban nexus, in which “the city—under its many designations of ‘megacity,’ ‘world city,’ ‘cosmopolis,’ or ‘metapolis’—has become a condenser of global forces and an amplifier of global effects.” 28 Engaging with capitalism and its racialized tropes, Lum’s photographic works explore the dissonance of race, class, and gender between image and text. It is here that the Asian subject of work—of labor—comes to the fore, presenting with barbed humor the relationship between Asians and work, capital, and value production. Among his large-scale photographic series titled Portrait Attributes , Lum pairs a subject’s portrait alongside text that we would normally associate with billboard advertising. The portraits are unusual for the way they capture ordinary people in what Kitty Scott describes as the “micro-moments of life.” 29 In these works Lum makes central the complex, affective dimension of those often racialized and gendered subjects who are rarely the focus of pictorial representation. In Melly Shum Hates Her Job (1989) (figure 4.5 ), 30 Lum intensifies the boundary between racial theater and social documentary. In this portrait-text work, the subject Melly Shum is sitting at her desk in the midst of accounting work. Her surroundings are lackluster, suggestive of a governmental branch office. The fact that she is crunching numbers on a clunky industrial adding machine suggests her low-level position; she is not a CEO overseeing million-dollar transactions on a computer screen. It appears she is pausing briefly to smile at the camera before returning to her accounting task. Accompanying her portrait is a panel of large, capitalized text that reads, from top to bottom: “MELLY SHUM HATES HER JOB .” The vertical orientation of the text accentuates the work’s use of billboard conventions and heightens the emotional impact of the words. The word “HATES ” is enlarged and in vivid color, distinguishing it from the more neutral blue font of the other words. The rippled contours of red, yellow, and black typeface make the word “HATES ” look sizzling or electrified. This loud advertising typography is totally contradicted by Melly Shum’s smiling face. Although there is humorous relief in Melly’s sentiments about work in general, that humor has a dark side. In particular, what is disturbing about the relationship between text and image is the way it violates the privacy of the photographic subject. Like many of Lum’s subjects, Melly Shum is not a glamorous or heroic worker; rather, she appears as a beleaguered civil servant who, in spite of her gloom, is compelled to smile for the camera. More intrusively, her private thoughts have been broadcast in corporatist type by an omniscient narrator—the artist—onto a public billboard. In a form of ethnographic violence, an exclusive form of dialogue is enabled between the artist and the viewer that excludes Melly Shum altogether. As Kitty Scott remarks, this “doubling of voice and intimate knowledge about a stranger induces a sense of dis-ease in the viewer.” 31 What Lum achieves in this photograph is a refusal of what Roland Barthes calls the “good” picture, one in which the “object speaks [and] induces us, vaguely, to think.” 32 Instead, Melly Shum “‘sp[eaks] too much’ . . . suggest[ing] a meaning—a different meaning from the literal one” 33 and thus dislocating the photograph’s intention. FIGURE 4.5 Ken Lum, Melly Shum Hates Her Job , 1989. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. In the sense that misery becomes an object of artistic consumption—a kind of working-class spectacle—Lum’s photographic works approach the threshold of cynicism. Scott Watson observes a long tradition of artistic depictions of the working poor that Lum taps into, particularly eighteenth-century genre paintings of the poor, which were consumed by the aristocratic classes: At that time, and throughout the following century, paintings of the poor, especially those who worked the land, identified the poor with all those stable values—family, faith and soil—that capital was eroding. The bourgeoisie took comfort in this illusion because it so blithely ignored class antagonisms. 34 Later, in the 1930s, we could turn to Dorothea Lange’s photographs for the Farm Security Administration, which increased the pathos surrounding the working, rural poor. Absent of illusions of family stability in poverty, Lange’s photographs are intended to draw sympathy from the viewer over the plight of displaced laborers. For example, in Dust Bowl Texas, American Exodus, A.C. Woman (1938) (figure 4.6 ), we see the figure of a woman whose world-weariness is captured in the way her hands are clasped onto her forehead and neck. While her ragged shift dress and sun-scorched face testify to her hardship, Lange’s effort to dignify her portrait verges on heroism. The fact that the woman stands against an expansive sky, whose low horizon dips below the woman’s waist, has the effect of making her appear monumental. The aestheticism of the photograph ultimately carries a romantic undercurrent that attributes a morality to her endurance. By contrast, in Lum’s image-text works, the viewer cannot take comfort in such a sentimental illusion about the poor or working class. Melly Shum evokes neither stable, “natural” values of “family, faith, and soil” nor the pathos of heroic endurance suggested by Lange’s work. Rather, there is a sense of irreconcilability evoked by the public nature of her image and sentiments. The unsentimental and unnatural elements of the scene ultimately seem conditioned by social relations that exist outside the work, highlighting a banality of social responses to visions of alienated labor.

Tying this photo-work to the larger questions about Asian racialization as biological signifier of capitalism, Melly Shum Hates Her Job presents a stunning antithesis to the model minority scientist who was erased from the redesigned Canadian hundred-dollar bill, a subject I began this book with. In the case of the Asian woman scientist, her erasure signaled the status of Asians as a biological signifier of bad capital. She became a metaphor for a destructive logic of equivalence that reduces individual attributes into commensurable, exchangeable forms that Helen Jun calls “human capital.” From the view of romantic anticapitalism, the Asian signals the overthrow of traditional, pure, concrete conceptions of labor for an era that reduces human individuality to an abstract form of repetition and equivalence. Melly Shum, however, does not offer us a vision of such racialized abstraction or a picture of sentimentalized, concrete labor. It is unclear how or whether we viewers are to identify with her. It is this sense of nonequivalence that creates what Watson calls a “discomfort zone.” Melly Shum refuses to accommodate either an idealized vision of labor or an aestheticized image of multicultural diversity that resolves the material and geographical contradictions of the global economy. FIGURE 4.7 Ken Lum, Phew, I’m Tired , 1994. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Collection of the Vancouver Art Gallery, Acquisition Fund. Further reinforcing this sense of discomfort around race and labor is Lum’s Phew, I’m Tired (1994) (figure 4.7 ). The portrait features a South Asian man at work in a metal-galvanizing factory. Unlike Melly Shum, the unnamed subject of the photograph is not smiling; rather, he appears to be in distress. On the right half of the work, against a bright orange background, appears light-blue text that reads: “. . . phew . . . / . . . I’m tired . . . /. .Oh, man . . . / . . . man . . . / . . . phew . . . / . . . tired.” The words and phrases surrounded by ellipses cascade down the panel in a zigzag formation, an arrangement suggesting a downward spiral that accentuates the weariness of the worker in the photograph. At the same time, the words themselves seem unable to capture the man’s pained expression. There is an unsettling tension between the jaunty quality of the corporate typeface and the anguish evoked by the man’s face. At the level of linguistic representation, the repetition of the words accentuates the limits language reaches in narrating the conditions of labor. Not only do the repeated words, such as “phew” and “man,” seem to comically undermine his situation, but the sounds associated with them also have a comic book quality. Further displacing the social documentary signifiers of the work, these comic strip elements reference pop art such as Roy Lichtenstein’s large reproductions of advertising and comic strip images in a piece such as Drowning Girl (figure 4.8 ). Just as pop artists’ use of popular culture and commercial iconography intensified the artwork’s artifice to challenge the spiritual ambitions and moral seriousness of art conventions (particularly of abstract expressionism), Phew, I’m Tired seems to reject the moralism inspired by Dorothea Lange’s photographic subjects. Ultimately, as Derksen points out, “the didacticism of the image-text format is made unstable by the oscillation between the representational photos and the ambivalent relationship of text to image.” 35 Unlike Lange’s documentary camera, Lum’s choreographed images intensify their own artifice and theatricality, projecting a sense of indifference that distances the viewer. In its refusal to supply the viewer with a moral standpoint from which to engage with the work, to reconcile image and text, or to join form and content, Lum’s work evokes the purposeful purposelessness of nonequivalence. By displacing the photographic subject’s racial heroism or pathos through manufactured indifference, the work interrupts a neoliberal logic of racial equivalence that folds race into culture and antiracism into multiculturalism. Instead, the viewer is left only with the irreducibility of form to affect, a state of nonequivalence that interrupts the belief in the equality of persons that is presupposed by free-market exchange and the drive to make unequal forms of human activity commensurable and exchangeable into values. 36 In his representation of racial nonequivalence, Lum therefore interrupts the logic of value production premised on the commensurating function of abstract labor.

Lum extends this state of nonequivalence to challenge what Jodi Melamed calls neoliberal multiculturalism, capitalism’s new logic of inclusion. Replacing the ideological primacy of white supremacy and colonial capitalism, she explains that multiculturalism “portrays neoliberal policy as the key to a postracist world of freedom and opportunity.” 37 In other words, multiculturalism operates as an economic and racial logic that responds to economic imperatives by celebrating cultural diversity and border-crossing to facilitate foreign investment and trade. This signals not the end of race but, rather, its rebranding. Melamed observes, “As historical articulations of race and capitalism have shifted—with white supremacy and colonial capitalism giving way to racial liberalism and transnational capitalism and, eventually, to neoliberal multiculturalism and globalization—race remains a procedure that justifies the nongeneralizability of capitalist wealth.” 38 This absorption of antiracism into an ideology of multiculturalism has been especially pervasive in Canada, which in 1988 became the first nation to enact multiculturalism as law. 39 As global capitalism’s “silent partner,” 40 former prime minister Brian Mulroney could not have made their connection more plain in a speech he delivered at a conference titled “Multiculturalism Means Business,” 41 where he invoked the marketing advantages of multiculturalism: “To cement our prosperity with trade and investment links the world over and with a renewed entrepreneurial spirit at home. . . . Our multicultural nature gives us an edge in selling to that [competitive] world.” 42 Adding to the “mixed legacy” that Cheryl Harris attributes to the overturning of legalized segregation in the United States, which defined racial oppression solely through the terms of racial separation rather than the domination associated with institutionalized white wealth and power, 43 Canadian multiculturalism sidetracks race and class for a celebration of cultural difference. The result in Canada, as Smaro Kamboureli observes, is a “sedative politics” that manages racial and ethnic difference by making it a universal condition of Canadian culture, repackaging systemic racism as merely a flawed attitude that can be corrected through cultural appreciation. 44 Lum’s engagement with images of cultural diversity seems to mock the simplification of such racial and ethnic codes. In Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate (1990) (figure 4.9 ), Lum offers an alternative view of Asian racialization against a more familiar scene of Vancouver’s cosmopolitanism. The high-rise apartments that populate the photograph’s backdrop are a signifier of the city’s alias as “Hongcouver.” This name—used in both pejorative and celebratory contexts—stems from the significant Chinese population in Vancouver, as well as the city’s purported architectural, cultural, and economic resemblance to Hong Kong. Redirecting a pop emphasis on exaggerated artifice, in Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , Lum’s advertising motif actually verges on verisimilitude. The top half of the image-text presents a portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau. They are standing on the balcony of a high-rise apartment, similar to those that appear in the background. Below their portrait in the bottom half of the piece appear their names; their last names, Nishi and Chau, are enlarged and capitalized. Removed from an art gallery context, the only element of the piece that alerts us to its status as art is the cartoonish 3-D font of the words “REAL ESTATE ,” which imitates stone carving. In what Derksen identifies as their “Flintstones quality,” 45 the unrealistic veneer of the lettering humorously undermines the realness of “real” estate. In addition, in the contrasting relation between image and text—between the concrete buildings in the background in the photograph and the abstract, textual representation of buildings as real estate commodities—we can make out a subtle reference to the antinomy of concrete and abstract dimensions that Moishe Postone associates with capitalism’s social universe. As Derksen observes of the transformation of the concrete into the abstract, “urban materiality is turned into immaterial commodity speculation.” 46 Here the abstract representation of “concrete” real estate is reduced to a comically inadequate imitation of actual concrete buildings. FIGURE 4.9 Ken Lum, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate , 1990. Chromogenic print, lacquer, enamel on aluminum, Sintra, 182 × 243.8 cm. Courtesy of the artist. Yet at another level, the portrait of Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau adds to the more racially ominous registers of the friction between image and text. Their relation to the Flintstones “real estate” logo adds an air of illegitimacy and artifice to the earnest expressions they bring to their professional endeavor. On one hand, this sense of illegitimacy broadcasts their artificial relation to property; their belonging is rendered a mere abstract signifier against a more concrete sense of citizenship. On the other hand, the artificial concreteness of their profession as realtors also allegorizes an anti-Asian animosity stemming from the perception that Vancouver has been overrun by Hong Kong real estate investors. For example, Katharyne Mitchell notes that in Vancouver, Hong Kong Chinese “are perceived as responsible for house price escalation as a result of using homes for profit through the practice of speculation, rather than as places to live.” 47 Much of this anti–Hong Kong Chinese sentiment came to the surface in 1988, when 216 luxury condominiums in the False Creek area were sold exclusively to Hong Kong buyers. 48 The sales took all of three hours and circumvented the Canadian market, leading to charges that Hong Kong investors were taking over the city. Although the roots of the city’s demographic shifts and spatial reconfigurations are the result of state-led efforts to expedite Vancouver’s integration into the global economy, the racial outcome of these processes has effectively reinforced the perception that Asians represent pure market rationality—their desires represent the psychology of capitalist expansion. Asian investors and business immigrants have only economic rather than “human” motivations. By contrast, for white Vancouver residents, as Mitchell points out, purchasing homes “secures profit yet does not have to be pursued as profit .” 49 Only white residents have the concrete, “natural” humanity that allows them to “profess ignorance and innocence of any cynical or mercenary motives such as profit, yet establishes their fundamental connection to the underlying systems that generate it.” 50 The biologization of capitalism thus renders Asians less human, removed from the concrete associations that align whiteness with property and belonging. As such, Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate evoke the form of racial anxiety associated with Asians that we saw in the hundred-dollar-bill controversy: they register a kind of bad capital associated with the abstract sphere of foreign investment and real estate speculation. Despite the postinternment rehabilitation of Japanese as indigenized surplus labor and the effects of transnational capital, free trade, and the neoliberalization of the immigrant border, Asian North America’s association with a destructive capitalism has become even further entrenched. In his discussion of Mimic (1982), a photograph by Lum’s mentor Jeff Wall, Walter Benn Michaels too probes the signifiers of globalization that attend Wall’s presentation of anti-Asian racism in Vancouver in the 1980s: Following in the footsteps of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the new Canadian policy substituted economic desirability for racial desirability . And this neoliberalization of immigration policy has the same effect in Canada that it did in the United States: a rapid increase in Asian immigration. 51 In this light, the celebratory discourse of legislated multiculturalism functions as a screen hiding the fact that the infusion of Asian foreign investment and rise of Asian migration into North America project a heightened expression of abstract economic rationality that is mapped onto the Asian body. In what Michaels describes as the substitution of “economic desirability for racial desirability” in immigration reform, we can see how the Asian embodiment of economic abstraction once again threatens the concrete human values invested in traditional rather than flexible citizenship. In response, Lum’s work exposes the contradictions of multicultural belonging by disidentifying with the visual tropes of multicultural inclusion and, through his image-text works, the sense of nonequivalence evoked by depictions of Asian working-class and professional labor. Postmodern Coolies and the Political Unconscious in Tropic of Orange Bringing together the aesthetic structure of stranger inhospitality, the tragicomedy of working-class Asian labor, and bad Asian capital explored in Lum’s work as conceptual anchors for my focus on Yamashita’s novel, my overarching argument is that neoliberal multiculturalism reinforces the abstraction of both wealthy and poor Asian North Americans. In the aftermath of immigration reforms that increasingly privilege wealthy Asian migrants and exclude poor Asian migrants, 52 romantic anticapitalism rejects the former for being agents of an economic takeover and the latter for draining economic resources and “stealing jobs,” once again bearing out the contradictory promise of settler colonial hospitality. Thoroughly denaturalizing the role of the border as barrier and conduit for flows of labor and capital, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works highlight the devaluation of human labor as the racial and economic fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism. What Tropic of Orange brings to this argument is a view into the dehumanization and subjective experience of both retro and high-tech coolies. Complementing each other’s vision of the intersection of race and urban labor, Lum’s and Yamashita’s works together refract the effects of the neoliberalization of immigration policy and its perversion of race discourse through multicultural rhetoric. Representing an expansion rather than a break from a prior abstract racialization, in the contemporary context of global capitalism, migration, and neoliberal ideology, Asians are both the primary racial subject of neoliberal multiculturalism and the ongoing racial target of romantic anticapitalism. As the brief glimpse of freeway conductor Manzanar Murakami that opened this chapter intimates, Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange is a novel that, like Lum’s sculptures and photographs, reworks the Real into a narrative whose fantastical elements are not pure fantasy; neither is its blunt realism an earnest display of social documentary. The novel, whose many moving parts make it difficult to summarize, might best be described as a postmodern bible of neoliberal capitalism: it is temporally organized over seven days that build toward apocalyptic catastrophe. As such it is both a quintessentially LA disaster novel 53 and an allegory of capitalist ruin, combining all the elements of what Žižek describes as “an apocalyptic end point: ecological breakdown, the biogenic reduction of humans to manipulable machines, and total digital control over our lives.” 54 The narrative consists of three seemingly disparate plotlines that eventually converge to connect the novel’s seven principal characters. The intersection of these characters from varying racial, economic, and citizenship classes—in addition to the merging of social, spatial, and technological geographies—reveals capitalism as a dynamic ecology. Each strand of connection between these human, technological, and spatial dimensions of the text amplifies the social, mental, and environmental relations that capitalism produces. Marx too refers to capitalism as a quasi-Darwinian organism, not reducible to or fully determined by any one relation (against the claim of economic determinism). Marx asks: “Does not the history of the productive organs of man in society, of organs that are the material basis of every particular organization of society, deserve equal attention [as Darwin pays to the formation of organs of plants and animals]?” 55 His own response might serve as the materialist provocation for the literal and metaphoric strands that Yamashita weaves through her novel: Technology reveals the active relation of man to nature, the direct process of the production of his life, and thereby it also lays bare the process of the production of the social relations of his life, and of the mental conceptions that flow from those relations. 56 Connecting technology, social relations, and mental conceptions, this network of relations is literally and symbolically mobilized in Tropic of Orange by a hemispheric thread being dragged from Mexico to Los Angeles by a mysterious, rogue orange. The Southern Hemisphere is pulled into the North, bringing with it histories of colonialism, labor exploitation, trade imbalances, monetary devaluation, and the cross-border “movement of free capital—45 billion—carried by hidden and cheap labor.” 57 Accompanying this thread is Arcangel, a poet and performance artist whose mission exhumes Benjamin’s “Angel of History,” 58 to give voice to five hundred years of history and resistance in the Americas and to perform the role of El Gran Mojado (The Great Wetback) in an epic wrestling match against the formidable opponent SUPERNAFTA . The second overlapping plotline concerns a massive traffic accident on LA’S Harbor Freeway, which causes explosions and forces drivers to flee while the homeless set up camp in the deserted vehicles. The unyielding traffic jam that ensues over multiple days is, as Jinqi Ling observes, “tantamount to a collapse of capitalist operation in the city of Los Angeles.” 59 Finally, in a third interwoven plotline, we meet Bobby Ngu, who is “Chinese from Singapore with a Vietnam name speaking like a Mexican living in Koreatown.” 60 A hardworking self-employed night janitor, he works during the day in the mailroom of the Los Angeles Times . Abandoned by his Mexican immigrant wife and labor activist, Rafaela, with their young son Sol, he is called by smugglers to pay for safe passage and release of a Chinese cousin in Tijuana. Thrown into these plotlines are lethal oranges, transnational infant organ trafficking, and a lot of television. Building on the significant body of insightful scholarship on the novel’s critique of free trade, its figurative representation of globalization, its hemispheric and transnational geographic scope, and its parody of multicultural universalism, 61 my reading of Tropic of Orange focuses primarily on its three main Asian characters: Bobby, Emi, and Manzanar. This focus aims to illuminate the interplay of labor, immigration status, and capitalism in the neoliberal racialization of Asians that I’ve tracked throughout this book. In particular, I explore the bifurcation of Asian racialization into the “retro” and the “high-tech” classes of what I’m calling postmodern coolie labor. As a hardworking immigrant janitor, Bobby fulfills the “retro coolie” end of the spectrum, while Emi, an Internet addict and the Japanese American television producer for NewsNow , indexes the latter, “high-tech coolie.” In my reading of Manzanar, the homeless Japanese American freeway conductor who exemplifies Marx’s idea of human freedom, I argue that he stands as a figurative embodiment of the text’s political unconscious. Drawing on Fredric Jameson’s hermeneutic approach to excavating literature’s political unconscious, we can see that within the struggle to “wrest a realm of Freedom from a realm of Necessity,” 62 Manzanar restores “to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history [of class struggle].” In many ways he is the essential hermeneutic reader of capitalism, whose primary task, as Chiang notes, “is sheer comprehension, and his conducting is an effort to grasp the conceptual order underlying the seemingly chaotic processes of the global system.” 63 Throughout the novel, Bobby’s and Emi’s struggle to come to terms and act with political agency is symbolically fulfilled by Manzanar. Although the two characters never come into contact in the novel, Manzanar’s and Bobby’s connection rests in their unusual relation to what Mimi Nguyen calls “the refugee condition.” 64 As a refugee of Japanese American internment, Manzanar is a bodily sign of its unresolved historical excess. Gayle K. Sato observes that Manzanar “embodies and acts out the psychic reality of the inadequacy of the 1988 Civil Liberties Act in itself to enable a Japanese American to be at home in the United States.” 65 On the other hand, Bobby, whose US citizenship is the result of his entry as a refugee, is not strictly speaking a refugee at all. From a family rendered destitute after a multinational American bicycle company drove his father’s bicycle store out of business in Singapore, Bobby and his younger brother infiltrate a Vietnamese refugee camp and are eventually “Saved by the Americans” 66 and transported to the United States. Passing as so-called legitimate refugees, their claims to refugee status could also be based on how transnational American capital destroyed their chances of economic survival. In spite of Bobby’s success, an overwhelming sense of literal and symbolic homelessness haunts him and disconnects him from others. His wife Rafaela sees Bobby’s homelessness through his pervasive insecurity: “This fear of losing what you love, of not feeling trust, this fear of being someplace unsafe but pretending for the sake of others that everything was okay.” 67 Manzanar has managed, however, to convert his postinternment homelessness into an entirely different plane of consciousness about labor. And while Bobby justifies his nonstop work through profligate, empty spending, Manzanar has interrupted the cycle of labor and consumption by relinquishing material comforts to become homeless, with few possessions. Therefore, as two characters who are subject to US hospitality through redress and refugee protections, they magnify the interplay of alien labor productivity, the ethics of consumption, and the contradictions of legal citizenship. Manzanar also animates the active repression of his granddaughter Emi’s historical and political unconscious. On the surface, his homeless asceticism and “quintessentially nineteenth-century aesthetic practice [of] conducting” 68 dramatically contrasts with his granddaughter’s postmodern exuberance for digital media and technological gadgetry. As a TV producer for NewsNow and avid consumer of the Internet, Emi’s personal disposition reflects the speed-up and commodification of time, where seconds are packaged and sold to commercial sponsors. Despite these differences, Emi’s political unconscious is made visible through this very vexed affiliation to Manzanar. While Manzanar’s homelessness expresses a selective repression of his former identity and history, Emi’s recognition of him exposes her own cultural amnesia and historical dislocation. Notwithstanding the confidence exhibited by her “padded shoulders” 69 and uninhibited personality, “it was questionable if she even had an identity.” 70 Responding to her mother’s accusation that her attitude and behavior are un-Japanese, she retorts: “Maybe I’m not Japanese American. Maybe I got switched in the hospital.” 71 Furthermore, her sense of racial and corporeal displacement is revealed when she confesses to her boyfriend Gabriel, the Chicano reporter, that she had sex with someone else “over the net” 72 but is not sure whether it “counts” as sex. In sum, as the other Japanese American in the novel, Manzanar throws into relief the multicultural aphasia and apathy that thwart Emi’s semi-conscious political will. Bringing the context of migration more explicitly into conversation with the theme of settler colonial inhospitality evoked by Lum’s furniture sculptures, Bobby Ngu’s character exemplifies the sense of homelessness that results from his indebtedness to the promise of the American Dream. He is described as “always working. Hustling. Moving.” 73 Although he owns his home and business, it isn’t enough: “Can’t explain. Happier he is, harder he works. Can’t stop. Gotta make money. Provide for his family. Gotta buy his wife nice clothes. Gotta buy his kid the best. Bobby’s kid’s gonna know the good life. That’s how Bobby sees it.” His blind faith in the American Dream is the reason he doesn’t understand his wife Rafaela’s labor activism. He cannot understand why she joined Justice for Janitors or why she’s complaining. His attitude illustrates the paradox of Mimi Nguyen’s description of the “refugee condition,” as a figure who is both “a target and also an instrument for the gift of freedom” 74 and embodies an “existential condition of suspension or surrender.” 75 He suspends thinking and surrenders to work: Always working. Washing dishes. Chopping vegetables. Cleaning floors. Cooking hamburgers. Painting walls. Laying brick. Cutting hedges. Mowing lawn. Digging ditches. Sweeping trash. Fixing pipes. Pumping toilets. Scrubbing urinals. Washing clothes. Pressing clothes. Sewing clothes. Planting trees. Changing tires. Changing oil and filters. Stocking shelves. Lifting sacks. Loading trucks. Smashing trash. Recycling plastic. Recycling aluminum. Recycling cans and glass. Drilling asphalt. Pouring cement. Building up. Tearing down. Fixing up. Cleaning up. Keeping up. 76 But as Nguyen powerfully exposes, the “gift of freedom” is itself bound up in power through the ways “liberal empire marshals its forces for and against others and elsewhere.” 77 In Bobby’s case, it is a looming sense of unrepayable debt that defines American citizenship and freedom: “Gotta be happy he’s alive in America. Saved by the Americans. New country. New life. Working hard to make it. American through and through. . . . Doing America a favor. Doing his duty.” 78 Demonstrating the inseparability of debt from the gift of freedom that Bobby expresses through his endless workdays, Nguyen writes, “The gift of freedom emerges as a site at which modern governmentality and its politics of life (and death) unfolds as a universal history of the human, and the figuration of debt surfaces as those imperial remains that preclude the subject of freedom from being able to escape a colonial order of things.” 79 It is out of racial debt that he cannot stop consuming, stop working, stop moving. His debt-bound life takes its toll on his closest relationships. His wife, Rafaela, whom he helped smuggle across the border from Mexico, shares no such sense of indebtedness that Bobby does. Getting her degree at Los Angeles Community College, she becomes a labor activist to unionize janitorial workers. As a sign of her rejection of his consumer lifestyle, when she leaves him she takes none of the material goods from their house, which is secured by double locks and a security door: She left the cherry-red Camaro Z28 with the car seat and The Club. She left the house and the 32” Sony KV32V25 stereo TV with picture-inpicture and the Panasonic PUS4670 Super-VHS VCR , the Sony Super-ESP CD player, the AT&T 9011 cordless phone, the furniture, the clothing, the two-door Frigidaire with the icemaker, the Maytag super-capacity washer and gas dryer, the Sharp Carousel R1471 microwave, everything. . . . Didn’t even lock the security door. 80 The nonsensical series of numbers and letters that accompany each commodity satirizes the meaningless abstractions of commodity culture and the value Bobby sees reflected in them. But the many locks, the security door, and the Club Bobby installs to defend his home and car emphasize the intrinsic insecurity and fear that are the basis of his homelessness. His relationship to his younger brother also suffers. Although he sends money, pays college tuition, and pays for books, “when they get together, there’s nothing to say. Bobby’s too busy working.” 81 He realizes after Rafaela leaves him that she and his younger brother “wanted something more.” 82 After he is called by a snakehead to pay for the release of a Chinese cousin being held in Mexico, Bobby begins to see new relations between debt, consumption, and retro coolie labor that he and his wife perform. His first step is to extricate himself from the spiral of work and consumption: like his smoking habit, it’s an addiction that is difficult to quit but will eventually kill him if he doesn’t. Rafaela left because “[she] didn’t want to watch him die.” 83 He begins to reflect on what he had previously refused to hear from Rafaela about their existence as cheap labor, that “we’re not wanted here. Nobody respects our work. Say we cost money. Live on welfare.” 84 He begins to see that by immersing himself in work he has failed to recognize how devalued his life and work are in the United States. His second step is to take a crash course in global capitalism by reading Rafaela’s papers about NAFTA : Titles like Maquiladoras & Migrants. Undocumented, Illegal & Alien: Immigrants vs. Immigration . Talks about globalization of capital. Capitalization of poverty. Internationalization of the labor force. Exploitation and political expediency. Devaluation of currency and foreign economic policy. Economic intervention . 85 Reading them he realizes, “Maybe he’s been too busy. Maybe. But it’s not like he don’t understand.” 86 He begins to see how the circuit of migrant debt and provisional freedom is orchestrated by settler colonial capitalism. The way Rafaela’s papers conceptualize the exploitation of free trade resonates powerfully with the novel’s poet-prophet, Arcangel, who also understands the flows of migrant labor back and forth across the “New World Border”: the deportation of 400,000 Mexican citizens in 1923 coaxing back of 2.2 million braceros in 1942 only to exile the same 2.2 million wetbacks in 1953 . 87 Here the border extends an invitation or expedites removal, exemplifying the contradictions of hospitality evoked earlier in Lum’s furniture sculptures. Alien laborers like him, Bobby realizes, are among the many “gifts from NAFTA ,” the “oranges, bananas, corn, lettuce, guarachis, women’s apparel, tennis shoes, radios, electrodomestics, live-in domestics, living domestics, gardeners, dishwashers, waiters, masons, ditch diggers, migrants, pickers, packers, braceros, refugees, centroamericanos, wetbacks, wops, undocumenteds, illegals, aliens.” 88 Here gifts and debt are one and the same: the gift of migrant labor is multiplied in their ongoing debt to settler colonial capitalism. Bobby’s growing awareness of the exigencies of migration born out of the “capitalization of poverty ” and “globalization of capital ” is enhanced by the situation of his teenage cousin Xiayue, who is being held by smugglers in Tijuana. Although he is skeptical of their relation, he is compelled to help her when he hears she is from Fujian, the same village his mother came from. 89 Fujian, in particular, has a long history of out-migration, more recently due to economic pressures resulting from the Chinese government’s market reforms catering to North American consumer markets. These areas are often classified as Special Economic Zones, which have few labor laws, prohibit trade unions, and slash import and export taxes in order to increase trade. In China, as Peter Kwong remarks, market reforms “have practically eliminated all labor laws, labor benefits and protections. In the ‘free enterprise zones’ workers live virtually on the factory floor, laboring fourteen hours a day for a mere two dollars—that is, about 20 cents an hour.” 90 In the novel, because both of her parents are dead, Xiayue and her older brother knew that they “would have to come [to the United States] sooner or later.” 91 His own mother dead too, Bobby identifies with the girl, thinking, “It’s like it’s maybe twenty years ago. Like it’s him and his kid brother,” 92 except her situation is far more dire. Her arrival has none of the protections of being a refugee. Bobby contemplates the fate of her brother, who, if he’s alive, will enter an America that hasn’t changed since the nineteenth century: “The brother’s gonna work. Work like all the celestials before him. Put down rail ties. Pick oranges. Wash shirts. Sew garments. Stir-fry chop suey.” 93 The sister’s fate is less clear. Passing her off as his daughter, just as he himself passed as a refugee, Bobby gets Xiayue across the border as effortlessly as swiping his credit card: “Drag themselves through the slit jus’ like any Americanos. Just like Visa cards.” 94 The “collapsing of visas and Visa cards,” as Molly Wallace observes, depicts the United States as a “landscape thoroughly mortgaged to global capital. . . . Consumerism, in Tropic of Orange , replaces nationalism.” 95 But within the Visa’s symbolism of debt accumulation, in this case it is poor Third World migrants who must assume that debt. By accompanying Xiayue across the US-Mexico border, Bobby witnesses the transparent economic logic of immigration policy. Just as business immigrants can pay their way into North American citizenship, the poor can purchase entrance, yet the poor must pay off this lifelong debt with insecure citizenship. 96 Through her depiction of US-Mexico border crossing, Yamashita eviscerates the moral standing of the refugee (as the target for the “gift of freedom”) and the immoral standing of the undocumented Asian migrant (as unworthy subject of hospitality) to emphasize the shared conditions of economic exploitation that align poor migrants across free trade zones. Their insecurity is captured when Bobby has no response for Xiayue’s repeated question “What is social security?” 97 In the way that Lum’s photo-text works Melly Shum Hates Her Job and Phew, I’m Tired present a visual challenge to the aesthetics of neoliberal multiculturalism by depicting racial and gendered labor ironically, as a kind of sentimental pop art, Emi’s character in Tropic of Orange also frustrates its homogenizing logics. Unlike Melly Shum’s, however, her private thoughts are not betrayed by the artist but, rather, willingly expressed by her character. Despite Emi’s clear disconnect from her Japanese American cultural heritage and racial politics—her idea of real “struggle” is when her parents force her to make “payments on [her] Civic” 98 —her insights about the contradictory interplay of Asian racialization and neoliberal multiculturalism reveal a surfacing political consciousness. With blithe unsentimentality, Emi recognizes the dehumanized mechanical abstraction that the Asian body signifies. Ridiculing the romantic anticapitalist sentiments of her boyfriend Gabriel’s desire to reject “all this [materialism]” and commune with nature by “mak[ing] something I can actually touch and eat,” she tells him, “I read somewhere that these days, if you are making a product you can actually touch and . . . [are] making a comfortable living at it, you are either an Asian or a machine.” 99 Her point is that Gabriel’s valorization of productive over financial labor, signaled by “planting a tree,” is a false one—that there is no nature external to capitalism. Moreover, with deindustrialization and US outsourcing of manufacturing labor, the level of exploitation experienced by Third World Asian laborers reduces them to dehumanized machines. Such a vexed conflation of Asians and machines—as high-tech coolies—is also one of the reasons she admits that “there are producers who would kill me if they knew who I was.” 100 However, Emi’s own obsession with technological gadgetry and immersion into the ephemeral world of cyber-sex suggest her own resigned participation in the increasing digital abstraction of social lives, as she remarks, “Who needs a reality check?” 101 Despite Emi’s cynical disdain for politics, she is able to see past the multiculturalist veneer of capitalist determinism. At a sushi restaurant she informs Gabriel that money drives everything, that social change has nothing to do with justice or humanity: It’s just about money. It’s not about good honest people like you or about whether us Chicanos or Asians get a bum rap or whether third world countries deserve dictators or whether we should make the world safe for democracy. It’s about selling things: Reebok, Pepsi, Chevrolet, All-State, Pampers, Pollo Loco, Levis, Fritos, Larry Parker Esq., Tide, Raid, the Pillsbury Doughboy, and Famous Amos. Them that’s smart took away the pretense and do the home shopping thing, twenty-four hours. Hey, we’re all on board to buy. 102 In Emi’s economic determinist rendition, social justice is just a “pretense”—a fetish of capitalist ideology. But in her view one may as well embrace this reality because there is no ethical outside: “We’re all on board to buy.” Her pragmatism leads her to take on a particular disdain for the pretext of multicultural ethics, to the extent that she enjoys being as “antimulticultural” 103 as possible. As a favorite pastime, she and Gabriel devise fictional stories about the “multicultural mosaic” 104 of characters while they are eating lunch in the sushi restaurant, including the “Caucasian Japanophiles who talk real Japanese with the sushi man.” 105 Predictably, an eavesdropping white woman takes offense to Emi’s pronouncements that “cultural diversity is bullshit. . . . It’s a white guy wearing a Nirvana T-shirt and dreds. That’s cultural diversity.” 106 In defense of multiculturalism and cultural diversity, the woman—wearing two “ornately-lacquered chopsticks” in her hair—retorts, “I love living in L.A. because I can find anything in the world to eat, right here. . . . A true celebration of the international world. It just makes me sick to hear people speak so cynically about something so positive and to make assumptions about people based on their color.” 107 The woman’s morally superior rationale highlights the evacuated antiracist politics that Žižek ascribes to “multiculturalism, or the cultural logic of multinational capitalism,” in which “liberal ‘tolerance’ condones the folklorist Other deprived of its substance—like the multitude of ‘ethnic cuisines’ in a contemporary megalopolis.” 108 In short, the woman’s expression of neoliberal moralism converts racial politics into a celebratory form of white cultural consumption, flattening racial difference into a commodified feature of the global city. For this reason we hear an echo of Melly Shum Hates Her Job in Emi’s retort: “I hate being multicultural.” 109 Both Melly Shum and Emi recognize that for the racialized worker operating within a capitalist logic of multicultural equivalence, “you’re invisible, I’m invisible. We’re all invisible. It’s just tea, ginger, raw fish, and a credit card.” 110 At another level, Emi’s exchange with the white woman recalls the post-modern racism evoked by Lum’s photograph Nancy Nishi and Joe Ping Chau, Real Estate : Nancy and Joe can be viewed as the inviolable poster children of multiculturalism, a shield of cultural diversity to deflect criticism of the dramatic escalation of real estate values in Vancouver that is often blamed on wealthy Asian investors. In Tropic of Orange , the woman’s implication that Emi is being racist by “mak[ing] assumptions about people based on their color” parallels the way that, in the similar urban context of Vancouver, where neoliberalism has reformed immigration policy and expanded the flow of capital across international borders, it has become racist to call into question the logic of capitalism. In a perversion of racial politics, open challenges such as Emi’s to the multicultural logic of capitalism have been conflated with racist and anti-immigrant voices. As Jodi Melamed points out, neoliberal multiculturalism “disconnects antiracism and economic justice, denying race as a structure of capitalist organization” that would reveal “continuities between prewar colonial capitalism and postwar US global ascendancy and expanding transnational capitalism.” 111 Moreover, when the white woman accuses Emi of racial intolerance, we see how her neoliberal expression of cultural appreciation obfuscates the profound continuity between racial divisions produced historically—through structures of colonialism and slavery—and the contemporary expropriation of surplus-value from racialized and gendered Third World labor working in free-trade zones. Such an ideology simultaneously naturalizes economic disparity by deflecting criticism through moralizing slogans of cultural diversity and racial equivalence. Ultimately, Emi prevails in revealing the superficiality of the woman’s moral high ground when she ridicules her self-serving multiculturalist aestheticism, asking her whether she would “consider using these [two forks] in your hair? Or would you consider that . . . unsanitary?” 112 The woman’s expression is appropriately “blanched” in response. After Los Angeles authorities wage a full-scale military assault on the homeless occupants of abandoned cars on the jammed freeway while Emi is tanning on top of the NewsNow van, her death by the first bullet evokes the doubleness signaled by the Asian body’s economism, an inherently racial ambiguity that positions her both as retro coolie underclass and high-tech coolie/robot overclass. Her last words, “Abort. Retry. Ignore. Fail,” 113 seem to recall the death of a replicant in Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner and is similarly mired in racial signifiers of mechanical and technological domination. Following David Palumbo-Liu’s reading of the film’s representation of the human/nonhuman divide as a racialized phenomenon that “serves to maintain the essential inhuman character of the replicant against that of the human,” 114 the replicants too evoke a doubleness in the sense that they are simultaneously the slaves and potential oppressors of white humans. Blurring the line between human victim and cyborg oppressor, Emi offers a renewed representation of Lye’s observation of the conspiratorial economism invested in the Asian figure: “When we are looking at Japanese, we can never be sure whether we are seeing businessmen or coolies.” 115 As a conflation of both, she epitomizes a Homo sacer , she who “may be killed and yet not sacrificed ” 116 in the free-fire zone of the homeless-occupied freeway. Within the logic of Yamashita’s narrative, Emi’s doubleness is also linked to her political and cultural alienation in the face of her estranged grandfather, Manzanar. The paralysis she experiences is symbolic of her inability to engage with her family history and Japanese American history more broadly. After initially recognizing her grandfather on the overpass and “star[ing] at him in disbelief,” 117 she can only watch him from afar cursing to herself—“Damn that old deadbeat on the overpass” 118 —and never finds “the courage to march up there to meet the man.” 119 After Buzzworm repeatedly urges her to meet him, she shrugs him off, asking, “What’s the point?” 120 Her death soon after this exchange suggests that it is this sense of apathy that is partially responsible for her untimely death. Even though she begins to absorb Manzanar’s consciousness through the music he conducts—“a melody she could not place but knew. Electronic tones representing numerical information, i.e., music” 121 —she shuns her genetic connection to the old man: “Wasn’t everything from Alzheimer’s to schizophrenia genetic? Damn.” 122 After she is shot, Emi dreams that she will be buried in the La Brea Tar Pits and later become “La Brea Woman . . . bones and a holographic image of me.” 123 Her identification with the ancient Indigenous woman buried in the tar pits suggests, perhaps, her own regret that she too will become some mysterious, decomposed hieroglyph of history. Even though her death might stem from political paralysis, her slaying catapults her to the status of Christ-like martyrdom whose endlessly repeated televised death signals the onset of urban war, particularly for Manzanar. The moment she is shot, he can no longer go on conducting the swelling sounds of revolution below him as he awakens to his own anger and pain: “The sound of the shot penetrated Manzanar’s very being with a vengeance he did not understand. The moment repeated itself again and again; he clothed it in desperation each time with pain and more pain.” 124 Coming back to the surface, his memories return in a flood, triggered by the sight of an infant’s heart that has been harvested and trafficked from south of US-Mexico border. In this moment, instead of joining sounds of the freeway into “an entire civilization of sound,” 125 he connects his own history: his wartime confinement in a Japanese American internment camp, his surgical practice of “careful incisions . . . inserting implants, facilitating transplants,” 126 and his life on the societal margins as a homeless freeway conductor. Although he is no longer a surgeon, which, as Ling observes, registers “his refusal to participate in the perpetuation of human tragedy in the name of human need” by “using organs obtained from questionable sources,” 127 the visions of premature death reanimate his connection to the world he left behind. In the profound sensory universe from which Manzanar hails, his “surfacing” is enacted through visual rather than aural stimuli: the sight of the infant heart and of his fatally wounded granddaughter. But his reconnection to the surface world of sight and sound ultimately overloads him: “He had seen enough. And he had heard everything.” 128 Our last glimpse of Manzanar is on a gurney hanging from a helicopter holding his granddaughter’s hand, witnessing from above a vision of atomic annihilation stopped short: Peering cautiously from his higher perch, saw bird’s-eye the inflation of thousands upon thousands of automotive airbags, bursting simultaneously everywhere from their pouches in steering wheels and glove compartments like white poppies in sudden bloom. All the airbags in L.A. ruptured forth, unfurled their white powdered wings against the barrage of bullets, and stunned the war to a dead stop. But Manzanar heard nothing . 129 Here the simultaneous bursting of thousands of airbags, like “white poppies in sudden bloom,” eerily evoke the mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But in this case it is the supernatural force of the airbags’ automatic deployment that stops the war. Regardless, Manzanar hears nothing. Manzanar’s deafness at this apocalyptic scene exceeds what Ling identifies as the “cognitive plenitude” 130 he performs as a freeway conductor, where his brain is comfortably submerged under an ocean of “foam and floating kelp.” 131 Without the orchestral language of his political consciousness, in his confrontation with the sensory overload of capitalist urbanity he “dissolves,” as Ling contends, “into the novel’s imagined urban tide of carnival revolts.” 132 Manzanar’s sensory collapse suggests the difficult unity of political consciousness and the materiality of racialized vulnerability to death. Although the novel ends without a clear sense of Manzanar’s fate, his ascent from the overpass onto a gurney flying across LA while “the entire city [had] sprouted grassroots conductors of every sort” 133 presents a tilted ecology of capitalist relations where Manzanar’s urban literacy has been disseminated to a next generation of conductors. Like Manzanar, whose romantic detachment as freeway conductor dissolves the moment Emi is shot, Emi and Bobby also undergo metamorphosis. Emi’s cultural alienation and immersion into digital technology ultimately leads to high-tech failure as she dies. Bobby, whose working life has turned him into a labor automaton, stops working. Reversing the inhuman tropes of Asians as “killer robots” or “Asian ‘dragon’ gangs” depicted in narratives that participate in what Mike Davis calls the “literary destruction of LA ,” 134 Yamashita’s Asian characters collectively register sensory disability (Manzanar), nonproductivity (Bobby), and technological failure (Emi). This generalized sphere of nonproductivity gestures toward what Mitchell and Snyder recognize as “forms of incapacity as the new galvanizing agent of post-modern resistance.” 135 But we are left with a far-from-sanguine vision of LA : homeless junkies feasting on trafficked infant organs “toasted like marshmallows” 136 and the mutual destruction of SUPERNAFTA and Arcangel in the wrestling match “sponsored by a generous grant from the Ministry of Multicultures [and hosted by] the CIA , the PRI , the DEA , and the INS ”; 137 “profits from the ticket sales were being divided” 138 after the match. It is a world in suspension, “unplugged and timeless,” 139 on the verge of collapse. To amplify the political stakes of narrative suspension that concludes Yamashita’s novel, I want to bring this chapter to a close by returning to Ken Lum’s artwork to tie the themes of labor and neoliberal immigration together with the strands of Asian racialization and romantic anticapitalism I have explored through this book. In particular, like the tilted capitalist ecology presented in Yamashita’s novel, Lum’s sculpture Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White (figure 4.10 ) offers a similarly “unnatural” presentation of global movement shaped by settler colonial capitalism. The sculpture is the result of a commission Lum won in 1999 that was part of Vancouver’s Millennial Public Art Project, “On Location.” The work, located on top of the Vancouver Art Gallery, cannot be viewed in its entirety from any one side of the building. It consists of four boats, each placed on a corner of the gallery roof that faces east, west, north, or south. FIGURE 4.10 Ken Lum, Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White , 2000.

The different primary colors chosen for each boat suggest racial typologies: yellow for Chinese, red for First Nations, white for Europeans, and black for Indians. The design of each boat also evokes more concrete historical periods and episodes. For instance, the red boat is a representation of a First Nations longboat used by Coast Salish communities located along the Pacific coast of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. The white boat depicts the HMS Discovery , the Royal Navy ship that led George Vancouver’s exploration of the West Coast of North America between 1791 and 1795. The black boat in Lum’s sculpture is a replica of the Komagata Maru , a Japanese boat chartered by an Indian businessman in the early twentieth century. In 1914, 376 British Indian residents of Hong Kong, China, and Japan who were onboard the Komagata Maru were detained for two months in Vancouver Harbor before being turned away. Even though the boat had fulfilled the requirements of a “continuous journey” law, specifically designed to bar entry of Indian immigrants unless they arrived “by a continuous journey on through tickets purchased before leaving the country,” 140 their legal exclusion was ultimately based on their presumed unassimilability in a white Canada. The fourth, yellow boat in Lum’s sculpture is a representation of one of the four Fujianese migrant ships that, reprising the Komagata Maru incident eighty-five years later, were detained off the coast of Vancouver in 1999 for nearly two months. On board were 599 undocumented migrants from the Fujian province of China, who—unlike Bobby’s niece Xiayue—were detained and eventually deported. The title of Lum’s sculpture, Four Boats Stranded , is a specific reference to the media’s characterization of the four Fujianese boats. For the most part, the media coverage exploited their criminality through images of barbed wire, shackles, guard dogs, orange prison uniforms, and guards. As Anna Pratt remarks, this event demonstrated the “slippage between categories of refugees, frauds, and criminals . . . [and] spectacle in the application of sovereign power.” 141 Lum’s sculpture’s subtitle, Red and Yellow, Black and White , evokes an American abolitionist context. According to Carla Benzan, the phrase refers to a Civil War–era Sunday school song whose verse goes: “Jesus loves the little children, all the children of the world; red and yellow, black and white.” 142 By drawing on dissonant tropes of settler colonialism, Asian exclusion, and racial equivalence, the sculpture’s response to the migrant crisis is largely an invocation of immigration history: a history of boat people. If we consider this sculpture against the aesthetic disorientations of Lum’s furniture sculptures and image-text works discussed earlier, Four Boats Stranded ’s invocation of immigration history is similarly irreverent. For one, despite being a public art commission, the sculpture is located on the roof of the downtown gallery and thus is largely inaccessible to the public audience. Here the work ironically inverts the duality of disinterested high art and low “popular” art in its placement above the gallery, so that it is literally “high” art. In keeping with pop art’s challenge of the exclusivity and cultural orthodoxy of the art gallery space, Lum’s bright, toylike depiction of the boats similarly evokes the staged pathos of narratives that erase Native peoples to remind us that we are “a nation of immigrants.” Given the themes of commodified repetition in pop art such as Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans or Marilyn Monroes, this pop-art rendering of the boats also suggests a banality and reproducibility as subjects of mass consumption. As such, they subvert the association of art as the original product of artistic invention and leave the viewer without a straightforward idea of the sculpture’s relation toward the historical and political content it clearly alludes to. By taking boats out of water and putting them into the air, I suggest, Lum aims here, as in his other works, to offer a decontextualized aesthetics of the border and thereby denaturalize its racial logics. From this view, the placement of the sculpture on the gallery roof connects to Yamashita’s novel in terms of the inverted, suspended ecology it similarly evokes. While the landscape of Tropic of Orange is transformed by a thread pulling the Southern Hemisphere into the North, Lum’s sculpture reconfigures the spatial properties of land, water, and air with boats that apparently fly. The very inaccessibility of these boats also highlights the work of a metaphoric and invisible border that has “stranded” these four boats high in the air. Decontextualizing the North–South border as a thread and the East–West border as air, Yamashita’s and Lum’s works suggest connection and absence, respectively. For Yamashita, that connection is first rendered ambiguous as Bobby, in the novel’s final scene, grasps the thread, asking himself, “What are these goddamn lines anyway? What do they connect? What do they divide?” 143 His decision to let go and rejoin his family suggests that the thread is no longer a border to cross; it is now a line to release. In Lum’s sculpture, the apparatus of the border is reconfigured as an art domain, a space of figuration that deconstructs a pop veneer of multicultural equivalence contained in the rhetoric of a “nation of immigrants.” Reframing the nation as a field of racial incommensurability, Lum’s boats stage a narrative of white settler colonial invasion: the conversion of Indigenous land into sovereign property with the power to exclude based on race, in the case of the Komagata Maru , followed by the neoliberal power to include on the basis of economic class, in the case of the exclusion of poor Fujianese migrants. Adopting a pop aesthetic, Lum’s sculpture undermines the rhetoric of the border as a moralizing tool of neoliberal multiculturalism whose hospitality is reserved for flexible citizens and high-tech coolies while exploiting the vulnerability of Fujianese retro coolies and other undocumented arrivals. From a more dystopic perspective, moreover, the suspended boats parody the dream of totally boundless free trade and mobility, what Postone describes as “a fantasy of freedom as the complete liberation from matter, from nature . . . a ‘dream of capital’ [that] is becoming the nightmare of that from which it strives to free itself—the planet and its inhabitants.” 144 Denaturalizing nature itself, Lum and Yamashita redirect the target of romantic anticapitalism toward the field of representation that obfuscates the dehumanizing dialectic of capitalist value. By animating the border against its North–South and East–West hemispheric histories, Yamashita and Lum accentuate its prominence in the fulfillment of settler colonial capitalism through the migrant labor system. According to Werner Biermann and Reinhart Kössler, “the settler mode of production” relies on a developed capitalist world market and exploitation of the migrant labor system, a system that has advantages over slave holding because it helps to paralyze the resistance potential of domestic labor. They explain that “from purely economic considerations, migrant labour seems more efficient in terms of absolute surplus-value formation and the minimization of the social costs of reproduction.” 145 Contrary to the notion that migrant labor is an economic burden, migrant labor often assumes the total costs of its social reproduction. Moreover, the United States’ long-standing interventionist mode has transformed economies and governments south of the border and across the Pacific and has contributed to the internationalization and expansion of the surplus labor force from which North America can draw. Settler colonial capitalism continually reinvents the levels of unfreedom through the creation of the debt-bound migrant. As Bierrman and Kössler explain, “Settler capitalism differs from slave-holding in the important respect that here the class of migrant workers as a whole is, in true capitalist fashion, dependent on the class of settler capitalists as a whole. Although the migrant workers are not personally free, their illiberty is not in terms of a personal relation of bondage to an individual master.” 146 In Yamashita’s and Lum’s respective evocations of the suspended function that interrupts the productive flow of migrant labor and capital, they emphasize the destructive interplay of human labor and value production that is objectified at the border.

      "content": "EPILOGUE THE REVENGE OF THE IRON CHINK Capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons which is mediated through things. —Karl Marx, Capital Figure E.1 is a fish-butchering machine that is on permanent display at the Royal British Columbia Museum, located in my hometown of Victoria, British Columbia. On the other side of the machine, not visible here, its name appears in large, capital letters: “IRON CHINK .” The machine was built by the Victoria Machinery Depot in 1909 and replaced a crew of thirty butchers. As indicated on the information placard at the exhibit, “it processed about 60 fish per minute, removing tail and fins, slicing open the belly and scraping out the guts.” 1 It was named the Iron Chink for the Chinese butchery crews it replaced in salmon canneries along the Pacific coast, a machine capable of gutting salmon at a rate of sixty to seventy-five fish per minute with a crew of only three laborers. As Geoff Meggs explains, “Before 1900, twenty-five men could handle only 1,500 to 2,000 fish in a ten-hour day. Now a single iron butcher could keep two canning lines amply supplied with a fraction of the labour.” 2 Today the Iron Chink resides in the museum as a relic of early industrial innovation and accompanying racial attitudes. I offer this concluding example of the Iron Chink because it serves as an unusual corollary to the example of the 2012 controversy over the erased Asian scientist from the Canadian hundred-dollar-bill that began this book. In that example, I argued that the controversy animated the negative association of Asians with money, an association that adapts a form of modern anti-Semitism which sees Jews as the architects of a destructive capitalism. The origins of such a racialized alignment of Jews with capitalism stemmed from their historical segregation in financial sectors of the economy. Such interest-generating sectors—that is, financial institutions that make money out of money—have historically been taboo and aligned with moral and sexual impurity and corruption. For example, condemnations of usury are present across Christian, Islamic, Judaic, and Buddhist religious texts. Today Islamic law outlaws charging interest, and until the mid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church similarly barred the charging of interest. 3 As David Harvey elaborates, “Conservative Catholics often compared investment houses to bordellos and viewed financial operations as a form of prostitution.” 4 Images from the period satirized this connection, and Harvey points to one cartoon that depicts a young woman trying to entice a horrified man into an investment house, telling him, “My rate of return is good for whatever amount you wish to invest. I’ll treat you very gently.” 5 Although investing in interest-generating financial products is the norm today and is no longer compared to hiring a prostitute, the connotations of race, gender, and sexual immorality are not entirely absent. One can point to Forbes magazine’s review of the 2013 feature film The Wolf of Wall Street : according to Forbes , the film “proves that Hollywood sees finance as drugs, sex and rock and roll.” 6 This is certainly not the first time Wall Street has been portrayed as a perverse universe of greed and sexual vice that corrupts individuals. 7 This book has explored Asians’ negative alignment with a destructive capitalism that is derived from value’s origins in labor, specifically abstract labor. The controversy over the one-hundred-dollar bill sheds light on how, as a negative personification of capital, Asians, unlike Jews, symbolize a destructive dimension of value based on what Marx calls “socially necessary labor time.” In a settler colonial context that relies on alien labor, Asian labor has had a precarious relation to the racial, gendered, and sexual constitution of “social necessity.” If the one-hundred-dollar bill illustrates the abstraction of Asians as money, the Iron Chink highlights the abstraction of Asians as machines. Because value is based on socially necessary human labor time, machines are not a source of value—only a source of temporary relative surplus value. What the case of the Iron Chink evokes is the way Asian labor is symbolically transposed onto a machine designed to cut human labor time, the true source of value, in exchange for the more temporary and volatile production of relative surplus-value. 8 Here the dehumanized labor efficiency evoked by the “Chink” suggests both a perverse excess and unnatural form of labor. The link between the one-hundred-dollar bill (as money commodity) and the Iron Chink (as machine commodity) is how racial signifiers animate the work of the fetish to misrepresent the relations between people as the relations between things. As money or machine, the Asian is aligned with the destructive value dimension of capitalism. Staying at the level of metaphor, it is also interesting that in personifying capital, the erased Asian scientist and the Iron Chink bear a metaphorical trace of the duplicitous role of capitalist value that emanates from the commodity form, whose “mysterious character . . . reflects the social characteristics of men’s own labour as objective characteristics of the products of labour themselves, as the socio-natural properties of these things.” 9 By projecting racial personifications of quantifiable and qualitative dimensions of labor onto money and machine commodities, both examples offer a similar metaphorical trace of “the social relation of the producers to the sum total of labour as a social relation between objects,” insofar as the social relations of race are abstracted onto the commodities themselves “apart from and outside the producers.” 10 In this light, the fetishism of commodities is essentially a figurative operation , “a substitution [whereby] the products of labour become commodities, sensuous things which are at the same time suprasensible or social.” 11 This reinforces one of this book’s main points: that capitalism is a representational (and misrepresentational) regime where the metaphoric activity of the fetish “conceals the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual workers.” 12 The fetish conceals as it substitutes, rendering unequal elements the same by turning them into values. Richard Godden describes this as the “metaphoric moment of the fetish”: even though “A is not B any more than a person is a thing or money a person,” the metaphoric work of the fetish forces them into a nonidentical unity. 13 We can go a step further and identify the value dimension of commodities as the central engine for this metaphoric work because the only way that commodities can assert their value is through the relative exchange of equivalent units of abstract labor, or socially necessary labor time. Value is thus a “metaphor in hiding” that conceals its own metaphoricity—one that is “structurally essential to capitalist reality, yet one whose advocates disavow its internal contradictions.” 14 So whether we’re talking about the Iron Chink, the Canadian one-hundreddollar polymer bill, financial derivatives, debt, and so on, at their core as commodities they retain a dual character that I’ve tracked through this book: that of concrete labor (qualitatively diverse labor) and abstract labor (commensurate units of labor time). Even though financial products appear to be in a world of their own and seem, as some have suggested, to “have nothing to do with national production or the labor of any nation’s citizen subjects,” 15 we should understand this false assessment as a consequence of the fetish. As I’ve tried to emphasize in this book, neoliberal regimes that deregulate flows of capital are concomitant with the global expansion of exploited surplus labor forces. As Godden puts it, “Given the ‘two-fold nature’ of financial value, labor, however peripheral to thought and geography, however seemingly disposable, retains its place at value’s core.” 16 It is precisely this mystified connection between labor and value that must be exposed to even contemplate a world where people control the products of their labor rather than being controlled by them. Let me clarify this point. I do not mean to suggest that in a postcapitalist world people would control the products of their labor through the ideal of collective ownership of the means of production, an underlying principle that has structured communist and socialist states past and present. By extension, so-called socialist state practices that redistribute wealth and resources, solve problems of overproduction and effective demand (Keynesianism), eliminate private property, support trade unions, or reduce the hours in the workweek will never eliminate capitalism. They accommodate capitalism by making it more bearable, which is certainly not a bad thing. Rather, what I am suggesting is that what underlies the massive racialized and gendered disparities in wealth on a global scale is embedded in the labor process itself, in labor whose sole purpose is to create more and more value. The relation between labor and value is the motor of capitalism’s immanent drive to accumulate, and it is this relationship that plays a socially mediating role in humanity’s relation to technology, nature, the modes of production, social relations, the reproduction of daily life, and mental conceptions of the world. 17 As I have argued throughout this book, social relations produced out of commodity production are antinomical, externalizing its concrete and abstract dimensions. Here again we discern the metaphoric role of the fetish, which extends its substitutions into the social world. Not only does the dual character of labor as concrete and abstract constitute the very basis of capitalism; this duality also frames the contradictions of social life. Marx’s nineteenth-century assessment seems particularly apt for our current situation: Everything seems pregnant with its contrary. Machinery gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labour, we behold starving and overworking it. The new-fangled sources of wealth, by some weird spell, are turned into sources of want. . . . This antagonism between modern industry and science on the one hand, modern misery and dissolution on the other hand . . . is a fact, palpable, overwhelming, and not to be controverted. 18 If we anchor these contradictions in the very duality that structures social relations, we may reconsider cultural and ideological contradictions of race, gender, and sexuality as extensions of the contradictions between abstract universality (of humanity) and concrete particularity of race, gender, and sexual identities. As Postone proposes, “Such an approach can address the constitution of values and worldviews in terms of specific, contradictory social forms, rather than in terms of the cognitive and moral progress of the human species [by grasping] the two-sided character of capitalist development in cultural and ideological terms as well.” 19 This proposes that the founding, metaphorical duplicity at the heart of capitalist value, the metaphoric movement of concrete labor into abstract labor, creates tensions that become manifest in social life. But let us return to the Iron Chink. As a personification of the simultaneous efficiency and disposability of the Chinese laborer, the Iron Chink articulates the contradictions of settler colonial capitalism that expose the inhumanity of commodity-determined labor. Connecting its symbolism to our contemporary moment, artist Tommy Ting’s 2012 sculpture Machine (Iron Chink, invented in 1903, found at the Gulf of Georgia Cannery in Steveston, British Columbia, refabricated in Beijing, China) resurrects the Iron Chink, giving it a new look and perhaps a new voice. Extending the symbolic presence of Black Frankenstein in American literature and visual culture, the resurrection of the Iron Chink similarly employs a gothic humor, “laughing back as well as haunting back.” 20 In this frame we can consider how the monstrously reanimated Asian Frankenstein returns to British Columbia to rebel against its original creators. The first thing we notice about Ting’s Machine (figure E.2 ) is its sly engagement with the original. Eliminating the iron, Ting instead uses PVC , painted “China Red” and manufactured in a modeling factory in China. By adapting pop art strategies, Ting has thus recontextualized the salmon-gutting machine as sculpture, transforming low to high. The bright, gleaming red of the sculpture evokes a sexiness we are more likely to associate with a race car than an early twentieth-century industrial machine. At the level of satire, this projection of sensuality seems to poke fun at the romantic glorification of machine technology. In particular, the presence of the shipping crate undercuts a monumental reading of technological glory. The shipping crate, which itself has undergone transformation into sculptural object, emphasizes the sculpture’s status as an import, a migrant machine. This emphasis speaks to our contemporary reality, in which China is the manufacturing source of many of the products we consume in the west—and apparently China is a place where we can even outsource our racial stereotypes. Moreover, as a vessel that carries the personification of a racial metaphor, the shipping crate presents a sardonic comment on the imprisoning, dehumanized conditions of global labor migration. Part of the dark comedy in Ting’s piece lies in how it perfectly embodies the dehumanized abstraction that I’ve tied to Asian racialization throughout this book. In its shiny new modern form, Machine not only evokes the continuing metaphorization of Asian labor but also dramatizes its ongoing allure through its vibrant China Red color. In its seductive appeal, Machine hyperbolizes the sexualization of the Chinese female migrant, who was subject to the 1875 Page Law, the United States’ first federal immigration law designed to bar entry to Chinese women based on their presumed sexual immorality. In this light, as a feminized Asian Frankenstein, Machine stands as an ironic invocation of the sexualized and racialized migrant system so central to the settler colonial mode of capitalist reproduction. But equally, Machine ’s China Red paint clearly evokes the color of communism, giving rise to both positive and negative connotations. On one hand, the China Red color cheerfully promotes the communist ideal of collective ownership of the means of production. On the other, the color alludes to communism’s association with the mechanization of human labor. But the reality is that Machine remains, at the end of the day, a commodity whose value is commensurable and thus exchangeable with all other commodities. As the monstrous personification of dehumanized equivalence, Asian Franken stein expresses the contradiction between the value of human beings and their exchangeability as equivalents.

Marx refers to value as a “veil” that transforms labor power into a form of equivalence, one that will not be “removed from the countenance of the social life-process . . . until it becomes production by freely associated men, and stands under their conscious and planned control.” 21 To remove value’s veil of equivalence suggests a world of radical transparency and symbolic control. If we are to imagine a world beyond capitalism, it will require reconstituting commodity-determined labor and its mediation of social and cultural temporality. Only then will it be possible to abolish capitalist value, a form of metaphoric power that obfuscates its own metaphoricity. Only then will labor time cease to play a socially mediating role that is external to the human beings performing the labor. A world beyond capitalist value means a new set of social relations between people and nature, technology, and mental conceptions but also, and perhaps most importantly, the recognition of the radical incommensurability of humanity as the basis of emancipation.",

      "content": "EPILOGUE THE REVENGE OF THE IRON CHINK Capital is not a thing, but a social relation between persons which is mediated through things. —Karl Marx, Capital Figure E.1 is a fish-butchering machine that is on permanent display at the Royal British Columbia Museum, located in my hometown of Victoria, British Columbia. On the other side of the machine, not visible here, its name appears in large, capital letters: “IRON CHINK .” The machine was built by the Victoria Machinery Depot in 1909 and replaced a crew of thirty butchers. As indicated on the information placard at the exhibit, “it processed about 60 fish per minute, removing tail and fins, slicing open the belly and scraping out the guts.” 1 It was named the Iron Chink for the Chinese butchery crews it replaced in salmon canneries along the Pacific coast, a machine capable of gutting salmon at a rate of sixty to seventy-five fish per minute with a crew of only three laborers. As Geoff Meggs explains, “Before 1900, twenty-five men could handle only 1,500 to 2,000 fish in a ten-hour day. Now a single iron butcher could keep two canning lines amply supplied with a fraction of the labour.” 2 Today the Iron Chink resides in the museum as a relic of early industrial innovation and accompanying racial attitudes. I offer this concluding example of the Iron Chink because it serves as an unusual corollary to the example of the 2012 controversy over the erased Asian scientist from the Canadian hundred-dollar-bill that began this book. In that example, I argued that the controversy animated the negative association of Asians with money, an association that adapts a form of modern anti-Semitism which sees Jews as the architects of a destructive capitalism. The origins of such a racialized alignment of Jews with capitalism stemmed from their historical segregation in financial sectors of the economy. Such interest-generating sectors—that is, financial institutions that make money out of money—have historically been taboo and aligned with moral and sexual impurity and corruption. For example, condemnations of usury are present across Christian, Islamic, Judaic, and Buddhist religious texts. Today Islamic law outlaws charging interest, and until the mid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church similarly barred the charging of interest. 3 As David Harvey elaborates, “Conservative Catholics often compared investment houses to bordellos and viewed financial operations as a form of prostitution.” 4 Images from the period satirized this connection, and Harvey points to one cartoon that depicts a young woman trying to entice a horrified man into an investment house, telling him, “My rate of return is good for whatever amount you wish to invest. I’ll treat you very gently.” 5 Although investing in interest-generating financial products is the norm today and is no longer compared to hiring a prostitute, the connotations of race, gender, and sexual immorality are not entirely absent. One can point to Forbes magazine’s review of the 2013 feature film The Wolf of Wall Street : according to Forbes , the film “proves that Hollywood sees finance as drugs, sex and rock and roll.” 6 This is certainly not the first time Wall Street has been portrayed as a perverse universe of greed and sexual vice that corrupts individuals. 7 This book has explored Asians’ negative alignment with a destructive capitalism that is derived from value’s origins in labor, specifically abstract labor. The controversy over the one-hundred-dollar bill sheds light on how, as a negative personification of capital, Asians, unlike Jews, symbolize a destructive dimension of value based on what Marx calls “socially necessary labor time.” In a settler colonial context that relies on alien labor, Asian labor has had a precarious relation to the racial, gendered, and sexual constitution of “social necessity.” If the one-hundred-dollar bill illustrates the abstraction of Asians as money, the Iron Chink highlights the abstraction of Asians as machines. Because value is based on socially necessary human labor time, machines are not a source of value—only a source of temporary relative surplus value. What the case of the Iron Chink evokes is the way Asian labor is symbolically transposed onto a machine designed to cut human labor time, the true source of value, in exchange for the more temporary and volatile production of relative surplus-value. 8 Here the dehumanized labor efficiency evoked by the “Chink” suggests both a perverse excess and unnatural form of labor. The link between the one-hundred-dollar bill (as money commodity) and the Iron Chink (as machine commodity) is how racial signifiers animate the work of the fetish to misrepresent the relations between people as the relations between things. As money or machine, the Asian is aligned with the destructive value dimension of capitalism. Staying at the level of metaphor, it is also interesting that in personifying capital, the erased Asian scientist and the Iron Chink bear a metaphorical trace of the duplicitous role of capitalist value that emanates from the commodity form, whose “mysterious character . . . reflects the social characteristics of men’s own labour as objective characteristics of the products of labour themselves, as the socio-natural properties of these things.” 9 By projecting racial personifications of quantifiable and qualitative dimensions of labor onto money and machine commodities, both examples offer a similar metaphorical trace of “the social relation of the producers to the sum total of labour as a social relation between objects,” insofar as the social relations of race are abstracted onto the commodities themselves “apart from and outside the producers.” 10 In this light, the fetishism of commodities is essentially a figurative operation , “a substitution [whereby] the products of labour become commodities, sensuous things which are at the same time suprasensible or social.” 11 This reinforces one of this book’s main points: that capitalism is a representational (and misrepresentational) regime where the metaphoric activity of the fetish “conceals the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual workers.” 12 The fetish conceals as it substitutes, rendering unequal elements the same by turning them into values. Richard Godden describes this as the “metaphoric moment of the fetish”: even though “A is not B any more than a person is a thing or money a person,” the metaphoric work of the fetish forces them into a nonidentical unity. 13 We can go a step further and identify the value dimension of commodities as the central engine for this metaphoric work because the only way that commodities can assert their value is through the relative exchange of equivalent units of abstract labor, or socially necessary labor time. Value is thus a “metaphor in hiding” that conceals its own metaphoricity—one that is “structurally essential to capitalist reality, yet one whose advocates disavow its internal contradictions.” 14 So whether we’re talking about the Iron Chink, the Canadian one-hundreddollar polymer bill, financial derivatives, debt, and so on, at their core as commodities they retain a dual character that I’ve tracked through this book: that of concrete labor (qualitatively diverse labor) and abstract labor (commensurate units of labor time). Even though financial products appear to be in a world of their own and seem, as some have suggested, to “have nothing to do with national production or the labor of any nation’s citizen subjects,” 15 we should understand this false assessment as a consequence of the fetish. As I’ve tried to emphasize in this book, neoliberal regimes that deregulate flows of capital are concomitant with the global expansion of exploited surplus labor forces. As Godden puts it, “Given the ‘two-fold nature’ of financial value, labor, however peripheral to thought and geography, however seemingly disposable, retains its place at value’s core.” 16 It is precisely this mystified connection between labor and value that must be exposed to even contemplate a world where people control the products of their labor rather than being controlled by them. Let me clarify this point. I do not mean to suggest that in a postcapitalist world people would control the products of their labor through the ideal of collective ownership of the means of production, an underlying principle that has structured communist and socialist states past and present. By extension, so-called socialist state practices that redistribute wealth and resources, solve problems of overproduction and effective demand (Keynesianism), eliminate private property, support trade unions, or reduce the hours in the workweek will never eliminate capitalism. They accommodate capitalism by making it more bearable, which is certainly not a bad thing. Rather, what I am suggesting is that what underlies the massive racialized and gendered disparities in wealth on a global scale is embedded in the labor process itself, in labor whose sole purpose is to create more and more value. The relation between labor and value is the motor of capitalism’s immanent drive to accumulate, and it is this relationship that plays a socially mediating role in humanity’s relation to technology, nature, the modes of production, social relations, the reproduction of daily life, and mental conceptions of the world. 17 As I have argued throughout this book, social relations produced out of commodity production are antinomical, externalizing its concrete and abstract dimensions. Here again we discern the metaphoric role of the fetish, which extends its substitutions into the social world. Not only does the dual character of labor as concrete and abstract constitute the very basis of capitalism; this duality also frames the contradictions of social life. Marx’s nineteenth-century assessment seems particularly apt for our current situation: Everything seems pregnant with its contrary. Machinery gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labour, we behold starving and overworking it. The new-fangled sources of wealth, by some weird spell, are turned into sources of want. . . . This antagonism between modern industry and science on the one hand, modern misery and dissolution on the other hand . . . is a fact, palpable, overwhelming, and not to be controverted. 18 If we anchor these contradictions in the very duality that structures social relations, we may reconsider cultural and ideological contradictions of race, gender, and sexuality as extensions of the contradictions between abstract universality (of humanity) and concrete particularity of race, gender, and sexual identities. As Postone proposes, “Such an approach can address the constitution of values and worldviews in terms of specific, contradictory social forms, rather than in terms of the cognitive and moral progress of the human species [by grasping] the two-sided character of capitalist development in cultural and ideological terms as well.” 19 This proposes that the founding, metaphorical duplicity at the heart of capitalist value, the metaphoric movement of concrete labor into abstract labor, creates tensions that become manifest in social life.

Becker’s theory of human capital has antecedents in the work of Adam Smith and others whom Marx referred to as “apologetic economists.” Like Becker, they attempt to claim that the worker’s labor power exists as a form of capital, proving that the worker is also a capitalist “because he always has a ‘commodity’ (himself) for sale.” If this were the case, Marx rejoins, “Even a slave would be a capitalist, even though he is sold once and for all as a commodity by a third person.” He clarifies that the worker’s labor power is her capacity rather than capital : “It is the only commodity that he can constantly sell, and he has to sell it in order to live, but it operates as capital . . . only in the hands of the buyer, the capitalist.” It is only the capitalist who profits from the laborer’s skills.

Accessed July 28, 2015. 117 . For instance, despite the absence of a similar Dawes Act allotment policy in Canada, the government took steps to alienate Indigenous peoples from their lands. However, because reserves in Canada were relatively smaller than those in the US West, only 10 percent of those lands were alienated—compared to the loss of two-thirds in the United States. See Franks, “Indian Policy,” 235. Historically, assimilation policies were much more aggressive in Canada, and strategies to divest Indigenous peoples of “Indian status” have been much more extensive. 118 .

Roediger notes that slaves themselves were among the most profitable US-produced commodities, while cotton accounted for 57 percent of the total value of US exports before the Civil War. It is also a mistake to suggest that Northern industrial capitalists were responsible for pressuring Southern plantation owners to abolish slavery, given that “multiple economic, cultural, and political ties bound Northern capital to Southern slavery.” The point is that industrial capitalism was not responsible for ending slavery; rather, it shifted the terms of race, labor, and inequality. Indeed, the expansion of capitalism in the United States was rooted in slavery. 130 . Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 894. 131 .

While the United States reproduced its enslaved population through reproduction, Brazil reproduced it by replenishing the supply of slaves through continual shipments of African slaves. Thus unlike in the United States, the hereditary fact of slavery and its fusion with blackness, which became wholly racialized after emancipation, did not produce a similar racial conception of blackness. Rather, they produced those of caste and color. See Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 904. 134 . Canadian antimiscegenation policy was even less consistent than in the United States, but various policies such as “Girls and Women’s Protection Act” prevented Chinese men from being employed in establishments that also employed white women or girls. 135 .

In declining my request to reproduce Van Horne’s sketch, which also appears in Margot Francis’s Creative Subversions , the CPR ’s manager of corporate communications indicated that the history of Chinese railroad labor would compromise Van Horne’s reputation: “My concern is not your work, but is based on the history of the construction period of the CPR . The image is speaks [sic ] to a larger issue of sensitivities around how the CPR was built, the conditions and the realities of the 1880s. The other consideration is that is a drawing done by the President of the CPR ; not some anonymous business figure. My decision on this is final.” 3 . Francis, Creative Subversions , 77. 4 .

See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , and Victor Bascara, “Cultural Politics of Redress.” Of all the nations that participated in the removal of ethnic Japanese, only those in the United States and Canada received an apology and compensation for financial losses incurred during wartime confinement. In August 1988, President Reagan signed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, H.R. 442, which enabled each Japanese American affected by Executive Order 9066 to receive a tax-free payment of $20,000. Because Latin American internees in Texas were not covered by Executive Order 9066, they were not eligible for a redress payment. In September 1988, six weeks after redress was granted in the United States, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed the redress settlement for Japanese Canadians, which provided $21,000 to the Issei and Nisei who were incarcerated during the war. Although redress was a hard-won and overdue victory for Japanese North American activists, it had the effect of recasting the legacy of Japanese internment as a triumph of democracy over an aberrant, isolated event that occurred in the distant past. But even before redress was won, perhaps the largest irony of Japanese internment in North America was that Japanese civilians were confined as the yellow peril, only to emerge in its aftermath as the model minority. 41 .

Passages from the novel were read aloud in the House of Commons during the government’s announcement of the Japanese Canadian Redress settlement in 1988, adding to its national significance in Canada. While early criticism was largely concerned with formalist issues or universal themes of overcoming suffering, later criticism engaged in debates over its mainstream reception and probed the implications of the novel’s treatment of history, racism, and racial and gendered subjectivity. Among this scholarship, Donald Goellnicht examined the novel’s combining of documentary history, archival sources, and fiction as a postmodern deconstruction of absolute truths. Others, such as Roy Miki and Scott Toguri McFarlane, challenged critical approaches that celebrated the novel’s “resolutionary” (rather than revolutionary) ending, which functioned to appease white guilt for historical injuries. Given Naomi’s complex psychology, scholars such as Smaro Kamboureli and Tomo Hattori examined the novel through the lens of psychoanalysis, while King-Kok Cheung focused on how the novel balances Western and Asian conceptions of speech and silence. 73 . Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , 134. 74 . During the war, nearly four thousand West Coast Japanese left to work on sugar beet farms in Alberta, Manitoba, and southwestern Ontario. The Issei and Nisei would remain in the three provinces as an exploited source of labor, subject to long hours of hard labor and substandard living conditions. The transparency of the government’s economic rather than security priorities came into full relief when the British Columbia Security Commission was dissolved in 1943 and transferred to the control of the Department of Labour. The Labour Department was then given full authority over the movement and resettlement of Japanese Canadians. Under its leadership, coercive measures were instituted to conscript able-bodied Nisei men to labor camps in rural parts of Ontario that were in need of workers. See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . 75 . See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . Compared to the Japanese American experience, Japanese Canadians suffered larger financial losses and were barred from the West Coast for longer. Although 75 percent of Japanese Americans lost all their property as a result of their wartime expulsion and confinement, they did not suffer the total liquidation of their property to pay for their incarceration as their Japanese Canadian counterparts did. By 1946, half of the former population of Japanese Americans returned to the coast, while Japanese Canadians remained barred until 1949, by which time few would return. Canada, already at war with Germany, was brought into the Pacific theater with Japan’s simultaneous attacks on Pearl Harbor and Hong Kong. The government’s immediate actions involved detaining suspected Japanese terrorists, closing Japanese language schools and presses, and impounding twelve hundred fishing boats. On February 24, 1942, on the heels of the US initiative, Prime Minister Mackenzie King’s government issued Order in Council P.C. 1486, mandating that the Japanese race be expelled from a one-hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, where more than 95 percent of the Japanese Canadian population resided. After being held in an assembly center in Vancouver—which, similar to those in the United States, consisted of hastily converted horse stables—twenty-two thousand Japanese civilians, of whom 75 percent were citizens, were confined in deserted mining camps in the British Columbia interior and to labor camps and “self-support” sites in eastern British Columbia. The government subsequently formed the Japanese Fishing Vessel Disposal Committee charged with supervising the forced sale of Japanese boats. In the fall of 1942 the government passed the Veterans Land Act, which gave the Director of Soldier Settlement the right to sell 939 deliberately undervalued Japanese farms without consulting the owners. On January 23, 1943, the Custodian of Alien Property was authorized to liquidate all remaining Japanese property at rock-bottom prices. All proceeds from liquidation sales as well as the wages of Japanese men forced to work on road projects were used to subsidize the internment—only after their own board expenses and, for a time, unemployment insurance were deducted. After the war, internees were forced to choose either repatriation to Japan or resettlement outside of the West, which led to the deportation of nearly four thousand inmates. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the one-hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. In large part, Japanese American families remained intact during their confinement, while able-bodied Japanese Canadian men were taken to road camps and separated from their families. Unlike the US government, which paid for the transportation, food, and the lodging of Japanese Americans, the Canadian government supplied only fuel, bunk beds, mail, and medical services. No food was provided, nor were cultivators paid for their labor. It is estimated that the Canadian government spent a third of the US government’s total expenditures. The War Relocation Authority’s budget was $162 million for housing and the US Army’s $75 million for rounding up and transporting Japanese Americans. 76 . Kogawa, Obasan , 206. 77 . Ibid., 232. 78 .

Japanese American families were directed to irrigate the land in order to develop the local economy. Promoting this plan was John Collier, famed for ending the pattern of dispossession enabled by the 1887 Dawes Act and clearing a pathway for the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. He wanted to seize the opportunity to exploit detained Japanese labor to subjugate the land by digging irrigation ditches, building canals, leveling land, and preparing the land for water. As the reservation had previously been mired in a water rights battle, Collier saw Japanese internment at Poston as a golden opportunity to turn the reservations’ undeveloped land into a source of economic sustenance. Linked to this project was a “colonization” program, in which neighboring Native nations living on other reservations that were deprived of water would move to Poston.

In her discussion of sexology, Somerville explores the influential role that women of color’s bodies had on establishing and adjudicating racial, gender, and sexual normativity. She explains that “comparative anatomy located the boundaries of race through the sexual and reproductive anatomy of the African female body, ignoring altogether the problematic absence of male bodies from these studies” (Queering the Color Line , 25). In Entry Denied , Luibhéid demonstrates how nonwhite women served to rationalize restrictions based on psychological and moral “deviance.” 7 . “‘Asian-Looking’ Woman Removed from Canada’s $100 Bill,” Angry Asian Man (blog), August 17, 2012, http://blog.angryasianman.com/2012/08/asian-looking-woman-removed-from.html . 8 .

Becker’s theory of human capital has antecedents in the work of Adam Smith and others whom Marx referred to as “apologetic economists.” Like Becker, they attempt to claim that the worker’s labor power exists as a form of capital, proving that the worker is also a capitalist “because he always has a ‘commodity’ (himself) for sale.” If this were the case, Marx rejoins, “Even a slave would be a capitalist, even though he is sold once and for all as a commodity by a third person.” He clarifies that the worker’s labor power is her capacity rather than capital : “It is the only commodity that he can constantly sell, and he has to sell it in order to live, but it operates as capital . . . only in the hands of the buyer, the capitalist.” It is only the capitalist who profits from the laborer’s skills.

Proudhon, in other words, mistook a form of appearance—money as the objectification of the abstract—for the essence of capitalism.” See Postone, “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism,” 109, footnote 14. 60 .

Termination was implemented by the Hoover administration in 1954 and represented a series of policies designed to dismantle the reservation system, disband tribal nations, and distribute their assets among tribal members—with or without the consent of tribal nations. Although no termination policies took effect in Canada, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s failed 1969 white paper was designed to divest all such nations of special status. Franks writes that “the white paper proposed a drastic shift to liberal individualism and a denial of group rights in some ways even more extreme than the failed termination policy in the United States.” See Franks, “Indian Policy,” 243. 73 .

Grant Farred has introduced the concept of the postcolonial “unsettler” in the Sudan, where the Arab paramilitary majority functions as a more brutal colonialist extension of the settler, “exceed[ing] the worst excesses of colonial violence” in “evacuat[ing] the land entirely of the native.” See Farred, “The Unsettler,” 807, 794. 100 .

Accessed July 28, 2015. 117 . For instance, despite the absence of a similar Dawes Act allotment policy in Canada, the government took steps to alienate Indigenous peoples from their lands. However, because reserves in Canada were relatively smaller than those in the US West, only 10 percent of those lands were alienated—compared to the loss of two-thirds in the United States. See Franks, “Indian Policy,” 235. Historically, assimilation policies were much more aggressive in Canada, and strategies to divest Indigenous peoples of “Indian status” have been much more extensive. 118 .

Roediger notes that slaves themselves were among the most profitable US-produced commodities, while cotton accounted for 57 percent of the total value of US exports before the Civil War. It is also a mistake to suggest that Northern industrial capitalists were responsible for pressuring Southern plantation owners to abolish slavery, given that “multiple economic, cultural, and political ties bound Northern capital to Southern slavery.” The point is that industrial capitalism was not responsible for ending slavery; rather, it shifted the terms of race, labor, and inequality. Indeed, the expansion of capitalism in the United States was rooted in slavery. 130 . Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 894. 131 .

While the United States reproduced its enslaved population through reproduction, Brazil reproduced it by replenishing the supply of slaves through continual shipments of African slaves. Thus unlike in the United States, the hereditary fact of slavery and its fusion with blackness, which became wholly racialized after emancipation, did not produce a similar racial conception of blackness. Rather, they produced those of caste and color. See Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 904. 134 . Canadian antimiscegenation policy was even less consistent than in the United States, but various policies such as “Girls and Women’s Protection Act” prevented Chinese men from being employed in establishments that also employed white women or girls. 135 .

In declining my request to reproduce Van Horne’s sketch, which also appears in Margot Francis’s Creative Subversions , the CPR ’s manager of corporate communications indicated that the history of Chinese railroad labor would compromise Van Horne’s reputation: “My concern is not your work, but is based on the history of the construction period of the CPR . The image is speaks [sic ] to a larger issue of sensitivities around how the CPR was built, the conditions and the realities of the 1880s. The other consideration is that is a drawing done by the President of the CPR ; not some anonymous business figure. My decision on this is final.” 3 . Francis, Creative Subversions , 77. 4 .

See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , and Victor Bascara, “Cultural Politics of Redress.” Of all the nations that participated in the removal of ethnic Japanese, only those in the United States and Canada received an apology and compensation for financial losses incurred during wartime confinement. In August 1988, President Reagan signed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, H.R. 442, which enabled each Japanese American affected by Executive Order 9066 to receive a tax-free payment of $20,000. Because Latin American internees in Texas were not covered by Executive Order 9066, they were not eligible for a redress payment. In September 1988, six weeks after redress was granted in the United States, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed the redress settlement for Japanese Canadians, which provided $21,000 to the Issei and Nisei who were incarcerated during the war. Although redress was a hard-won and overdue victory for Japanese North American activists, it had the effect of recasting the legacy of Japanese internment as a triumph of democracy over an aberrant, isolated event that occurred in the distant past. But even before redress was won, perhaps the largest irony of Japanese internment in North America was that Japanese civilians were confined as the yellow peril, only to emerge in its aftermath as the model minority. 41 .

Passages from the novel were read aloud in the House of Commons during the government’s announcement of the Japanese Canadian Redress settlement in 1988, adding to its national significance in Canada. While early criticism was largely concerned with formalist issues or universal themes of overcoming suffering, later criticism engaged in debates over its mainstream reception and probed the implications of the novel’s treatment of history, racism, and racial and gendered subjectivity. Among this scholarship, Donald Goellnicht examined the novel’s combining of documentary history, archival sources, and fiction as a postmodern deconstruction of absolute truths. Others, such as Roy Miki and Scott Toguri McFarlane, challenged critical approaches that celebrated the novel’s “resolutionary” (rather than revolutionary) ending, which functioned to appease white guilt for historical injuries. Given Naomi’s complex psychology, scholars such as Smaro Kamboureli and Tomo Hattori examined the novel through the lens of psychoanalysis, while King-Kok Cheung focused on how the novel balances Western and Asian conceptions of speech and silence. 73 . Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , 134. 74 . During the war, nearly four thousand West Coast Japanese left to work on sugar beet farms in Alberta, Manitoba, and southwestern Ontario. The Issei and Nisei would remain in the three provinces as an exploited source of labor, subject to long hours of hard labor and substandard living conditions. The transparency of the government’s economic rather than security priorities came into full relief when the British Columbia Security Commission was dissolved in 1943 and transferred to the control of the Department of Labour. The Labour Department was then given full authority over the movement and resettlement of Japanese Canadians. Under its leadership, coercive measures were instituted to conscript able-bodied Nisei men to labor camps in rural parts of Ontario that were in need of workers. See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . 75 . See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . Compared to the Japanese American experience, Japanese Canadians suffered larger financial losses and were barred from the West Coast for longer. Although 75 percent of Japanese Americans lost all their property as a result of their wartime expulsion and confinement, they did not suffer the total liquidation of their property to pay for their incarceration as their Japanese Canadian counterparts did. By 1946, half of the former population of Japanese Americans returned to the coast, while Japanese Canadians remained barred until 1949, by which time few would return. Canada, already at war with Germany, was brought into the Pacific theater with Japan’s simultaneous attacks on Pearl Harbor and Hong Kong. The government’s immediate actions involved detaining suspected Japanese terrorists, closing Japanese language schools and presses, and impounding twelve hundred fishing boats. On February 24, 1942, on the heels of the US initiative, Prime Minister Mackenzie King’s government issued Order in Council P.C. 1486, mandating that the Japanese race be expelled from a one-hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, where more than 95 percent of the Japanese Canadian population resided. After being held in an assembly center in Vancouver—which, similar to those in the United States, consisted of hastily converted horse stables—twenty-two thousand Japanese civilians, of whom 75 percent were citizens, were confined in deserted mining camps in the British Columbia interior and to labor camps and “self-support” sites in eastern British Columbia. The government subsequently formed the Japanese Fishing Vessel Disposal Committee charged with supervising the forced sale of Japanese boats. In the fall of 1942 the government passed the Veterans Land Act, which gave the Director of Soldier Settlement the right to sell 939 deliberately undervalued Japanese farms without consulting the owners. On January 23, 1943, the Custodian of Alien Property was authorized to liquidate all remaining Japanese property at rock-bottom prices. All proceeds from liquidation sales as well as the wages of Japanese men forced to work on road projects were used to subsidize the internment—only after their own board expenses and, for a time, unemployment insurance were deducted. After the war, internees were forced to choose either repatriation to Japan or resettlement outside of the West, which led to the deportation of nearly four thousand inmates. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the one-hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. In large part, Japanese American families remained intact during their confinement, while able-bodied Japanese Canadian men were taken to road camps and separated from their families. Unlike the US government, which paid for the transportation, food, and the lodging of Japanese Americans, the Canadian government supplied only fuel, bunk beds, mail, and medical services. No food was provided, nor were cultivators paid for their labor. It is estimated that the Canadian government spent a third of the US government’s total expenditures. The War Relocation Authority’s budget was $162 million for housing and the US Army’s $75 million for rounding up and transporting Japanese Americans. 76 . Kogawa, Obasan , 206. 77 . Ibid., 232. 78 .

Japanese American families were directed to irrigate the land in order to develop the local economy. Promoting this plan was John Collier, famed for ending the pattern of dispossession enabled by the 1887 Dawes Act and clearing a pathway for the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. He wanted to seize the opportunity to exploit detained Japanese labor to subjugate the land by digging irrigation ditches, building canals, leveling land, and preparing the land for water. As the reservation had previously been mired in a water rights battle, Collier saw Japanese internment at Poston as a golden opportunity to turn the reservations’ undeveloped land into a source of economic sustenance. Linked to this project was a “colonization” program, in which neighboring Native nations living on other reservations that were deprived of water would move to Poston.

In her discussion of sexology, Somerville explores the influential role that women of color’s bodies had on establishing and adjudicating racial, gender, and sexual normativity. She explains that “comparative anatomy located the boundaries of race through the sexual and reproductive anatomy of the African female body, ignoring altogether the problematic absence of male bodies from these studies” (Queering the Color Line , 25). In Entry Denied , Luibhéid demonstrates how nonwhite women served to rationalize restrictions based on psychological and moral “deviance.” 7 . “‘Asian-Looking’ Woman Removed from Canada’s $100 Bill,” Angry Asian Man (blog), August 17, 2012, http://blog.angryasianman.com/2012/08/asian-looking-woman-removed-from.html . 8 .

Becker’s theory of human capital has antecedents in the work of Adam Smith and others whom Marx referred to as “apologetic economists.” Like Becker, they attempt to claim that the worker’s labor power exists as a form of capital, proving that the worker is also a capitalist “because he always has a ‘commodity’ (himself) for sale.” If this were the case, Marx rejoins, “Even a slave would be a capitalist, even though he is sold once and for all as a commodity by a third person.” He clarifies that the worker’s labor power is her capacity rather than capital : “It is the only commodity that he can constantly sell, and he has to sell it in order to live, but it operates as capital . . . only in the hands of the buyer, the capitalist.” It is only the capitalist who profits from the laborer’s skills.

Proudhon, in other words, mistook a form of appearance—money as the objectification of the abstract—for the essence of capitalism.” See Postone, “Anti-Semitism and National Socialism,” 109, footnote 14. 60 .

Termination was implemented by the Hoover administration in 1954 and represented a series of policies designed to dismantle the reservation system, disband tribal nations, and distribute their assets among tribal members—with or without the consent of tribal nations. Although no termination policies took effect in Canada, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s failed 1969 white paper was designed to divest all such nations of special status. Franks writes that “the white paper proposed a drastic shift to liberal individualism and a denial of group rights in some ways even more extreme than the failed termination policy in the United States.” See Franks, “Indian Policy,” 243. 73 .

Grant Farred has introduced the concept of the postcolonial “unsettler” in the Sudan, where the Arab paramilitary majority functions as a more brutal colonialist extension of the settler, “exceed[ing] the worst excesses of colonial violence” in “evacuat[ing] the land entirely of the native.” See Farred, “The Unsettler,” 807, 794. 100 .

While earlier fur-trading posts in North America allowed for settlers and Indigenous people to coexist, the shift from mercantile (trade-centered) to industrial (land-centered) forms of capitalism marks the shift to settler colonialism. 112 .

Accessed July 28, 2015. 117 . For instance, despite the absence of a similar Dawes Act allotment policy in Canada, the government took steps to alienate Indigenous peoples from their lands. However, because reserves in Canada were relatively smaller than those in the US West, only 10 percent of those lands were alienated—compared to the loss of two-thirds in the United States. See Franks, “Indian Policy,” 235. Historically, assimilation policies were much more aggressive in Canada, and strategies to divest Indigenous peoples of “Indian status” have been much more extensive. 118 .

Lawrence, “Gender, Race, and the Regulation of Native Identity in Canada and the US.” “Status” and “non-Status” denote the federal status of an Indigenous person in Canada. In order to have status, one must be recognized as a “Registered Indian” as defined by the Indian Act. 128 .

Roediger notes that slaves themselves were among the most profitable US-produced commodities, while cotton accounted for 57 percent of the total value of US exports before the Civil War. It is also a mistake to suggest that Northern industrial capitalists were responsible for pressuring Southern plantation owners to abolish slavery, given that “multiple economic, cultural, and political ties bound Northern capital to Southern slavery.” The point is that industrial capitalism was not responsible for ending slavery; rather, it shifted the terms of race, labor, and inequality. Indeed, the expansion of capitalism in the United States was rooted in slavery. 130 . Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 894. 131 . Biermann and Kössler, “The Settler Mode of Production,” 112. 132 . Jung, Coolies and Cane . 133 . Not all slave societies reproduced their slave populations in corresponding ways. While the United States reproduced its enslaved population through reproduction, Brazil reproduced it by replenishing the supply of slaves through continual shipments of African slaves. Thus unlike in the United States, the hereditary fact of slavery and its fusion with blackness, which became wholly racialized after emancipation, did not produce a similar racial conception of blackness. Rather, they produced those of caste and color. See Wolfe, “Land, Labor, and Difference,” 904. 134 . Canadian antimiscegenation policy was even less consistent than in the United States, but various policies such as “Girls and Women’s Protection Act” prevented Chinese men from being employed in establishments that also employed white women or girls. 135 .

In declining my request to reproduce Van Horne’s sketch, which also appears in Margot Francis’s Creative Subversions , the CPR ’s manager of corporate communications indicated that the history of Chinese railroad labor would compromise Van Horne’s reputation: “My concern is not your work, but is based on the history of the construction period of the CPR . The image is speaks [sic ] to a larger issue of sensitivities around how the CPR was built, the conditions and the realities of the 1880s. The other consideration is that is a drawing done by the President of the CPR ; not some anonymous business figure. My decision on this is final.” 3 . Francis, Creative Subversions , 77. 4 .

See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , and Victor Bascara, “Cultural Politics of Redress.” Of all the nations that participated in the removal of ethnic Japanese, only those in the United States and Canada received an apology and compensation for financial losses incurred during wartime confinement. In August 1988, President Reagan signed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, H.R. 442, which enabled each Japanese American affected by Executive Order 9066 to receive a tax-free payment of $20,000. Because Latin American internees in Texas were not covered by Executive Order 9066, they were not eligible for a redress payment. In September 1988, six weeks after redress was granted in the United States, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed the redress settlement for Japanese Canadians, which provided $21,000 to the Issei and Nisei who were incarcerated during the war. Although redress was a hard-won and overdue victory for Japanese North American activists, it had the effect of recasting the legacy of Japanese internment as a triumph of democracy over an aberrant, isolated event that occurred in the distant past. But even before redress was won, perhaps the largest irony of Japanese internment in North America was that Japanese civilians were confined as the yellow peril, only to emerge in its aftermath as the model minority. 41 .

Passages from the novel were read aloud in the House of Commons during the government’s announcement of the Japanese Canadian Redress settlement in 1988, adding to its national significance in Canada. While early criticism was largely concerned with formalist issues or universal themes of overcoming suffering, later criticism engaged in debates over its mainstream reception and probed the implications of the novel’s treatment of history, racism, and racial and gendered subjectivity. Among this scholarship, Donald Goellnicht examined the novel’s combining of documentary history, archival sources, and fiction as a postmodern deconstruction of absolute truths. Others, such as Roy Miki and Scott Toguri McFarlane, challenged critical approaches that celebrated the novel’s “resolutionary” (rather than revolutionary) ending, which functioned to appease white guilt for historical injuries. Given Naomi’s complex psychology, scholars such as Smaro Kamboureli and Tomo Hattori examined the novel through the lens of psychoanalysis, while King-Kok Cheung focused on how the novel balances Western and Asian conceptions of speech and silence. 73 . Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy , 134. 74 . During the war, nearly four thousand West Coast Japanese left to work on sugar beet farms in Alberta, Manitoba, and southwestern Ontario. The Issei and Nisei would remain in the three provinces as an exploited source of labor, subject to long hours of hard labor and substandard living conditions. The transparency of the government’s economic rather than security priorities came into full relief when the British Columbia Security Commission was dissolved in 1943 and transferred to the control of the Department of Labour. The Labour Department was then given full authority over the movement and resettlement of Japanese Canadians. Under its leadership, coercive measures were instituted to conscript able-bodied Nisei men to labor camps in rural parts of Ontario that were in need of workers. See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . 75 . See Gregory Robinson, A Tragedy of Democracy . Compared to the Japanese American experience, Japanese Canadians suffered larger financial losses and were barred from the West Coast for longer. Although 75 percent of Japanese Americans lost all their property as a result of their wartime expulsion and confinement, they did not suffer the total liquidation of their property to pay for their incarceration as their Japanese Canadian counterparts did. By 1946, half of the former population of Japanese Americans returned to the coast, while Japanese Canadians remained barred until 1949, by which time few would return. Canada, already at war with Germany, was brought into the Pacific theater with Japan’s simultaneous attacks on Pearl Harbor and Hong Kong. The government’s immediate actions involved detaining suspected Japanese terrorists, closing Japanese language schools and presses, and impounding twelve hundred fishing boats. On February 24, 1942, on the heels of the US initiative, Prime Minister Mackenzie King’s government issued Order in Council P.C. 1486, mandating that the Japanese race be expelled from a one-hundred-mile “protected area” on the coast of British Columbia, where more than 95 percent of the Japanese Canadian population resided. After being held in an assembly center in Vancouver—which, similar to those in the United States, consisted of hastily converted horse stables—twenty-two thousand Japanese civilians, of whom 75 percent were citizens, were confined in deserted mining camps in the British Columbia interior and to labor camps and “self-support” sites in eastern British Columbia. The government subsequently formed the Japanese Fishing Vessel Disposal Committee charged with supervising the forced sale of Japanese boats. In the fall of 1942 the government passed the Veterans Land Act, which gave the Director of Soldier Settlement the right to sell 939 deliberately undervalued Japanese farms without consulting the owners. On January 23, 1943, the Custodian of Alien Property was authorized to liquidate all remaining Japanese property at rock-bottom prices. All proceeds from liquidation sales as well as the wages of Japanese men forced to work on road projects were used to subsidize the internment—only after their own board expenses and, for a time, unemployment insurance were deducted. After the war, internees were forced to choose either repatriation to Japan or resettlement outside of the West, which led to the deportation of nearly four thousand inmates. It was not until April 1, 1949, that federal restrictions were lifted, allowing Japanese civilians to return to the one-hundred-mile British Columbia coastal area. In large part, Japanese American families remained intact during their confinement, while able-bodied Japanese Canadian men were taken to road camps and separated from their families. Unlike the US government, which paid for the transportation, food, and the lodging of Japanese Americans, the Canadian government supplied only fuel, bunk beds, mail, and medical services. No food was provided, nor were cultivators paid for their labor. It is estimated that the Canadian government spent a third of the US government’s total expenditures. The War Relocation Authority’s budget was $162 million for housing and the US Army’s $75 million for rounding up and transporting Japanese Americans. 76 . Kogawa, Obasan , 206. 77 . Ibid., 232. 78 .

Japanese American families were directed to irrigate the land in order to develop the local economy. Promoting this plan was John Collier, famed for ending the pattern of dispossession enabled by the 1887 Dawes Act and clearing a pathway for the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. He wanted to seize the opportunity to exploit detained Japanese labor to subjugate the land by digging irrigation ditches, building canals, leveling land, and preparing the land for water. As the reservation had previously been mired in a water rights battle, Collier saw Japanese internment at Poston as a golden opportunity to turn the reservations’ undeveloped land into a source of economic sustenance. Linked to this project was a “colonization” program, in which neighboring Native nations living on other reservations that were deprived of water would move to Poston.

See Gier and Tejeda, “An Interview with Karen Tei Yamashita.” Yamashita states in this interview that she based Arcangel on the performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Peña and the poetry of Pablo Neruda: “Arcangel is a literary interpretation of Peña. Arcangel’s performance is grotesque, freakish, yet Christ-like, accounting for 500 years of history in the Americas. He’s also like Neruda, who, through his great poem, Canto General , expresses all of Latin America.” 59 . Ling, Across Meridians , 131. 60 . Yamashita, Tropic of Orange , 15. 61 .
