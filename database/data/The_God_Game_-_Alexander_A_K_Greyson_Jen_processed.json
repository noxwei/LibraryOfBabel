Evangeline Heart isn’t giving up without a fight as she returns in The God Game to locate the next relic in hopes of unlocking the back gate to Hell.\n\nEvangeline Heart (Lina) is on the quest to save her fiancé Griffin’s soul from Hell—literally. It seems as if the Angel of Death Azazel has stolen Griffin’s soul from entering the gates of Heaven after he was murdered in retaliation for a hired kill of Lina’s. Now, Lina has been strongly urged to rescue the love of her life’s soul by the Archangel Metatron who claims she is the only one with this capability… \n\nMetatron has assembled a unique team to help Lina on her quest to locate three ancient relics that hold the keys to unlocking the gates of Hell--a scholar as ancient as the relics he knows about, with a slipping mind and fierce fervor for the cause, a flippant but very cute professional thief who doesn’t take anything serious, except maybe the day’s fantasy football picks, and Lina's aging mentor recovering from hip surgery round out her crew. \n\nLina soon realizes that The Angel of Death and his foot soldiers will do whatever they can to keep her from succeeding, and while she’s used to having bad guys after her, looking over her shoulder in The God Game has upped the ante to an entirely new level.",

      "content": "Chapter One And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. — Matthew 26:51-52 I relaxed into the stylist’s chair. This was a well-deserved luxury and one I didn’t do often. Most of the time I kept my dark hair in a braid or simple ponytail so it stayed contained and out of my way. Sunlight filtered through the wide windows of the salon, bathing me in warm, bright light that didn’t quite penetrate to the shadows I’d tucked deep inside my heart. Steel and glass reflected sunbeams and scattered brilliant rainbows of color across my skin, peppering me with diamonds. Even here, the heavens transcended my life, blurring the lines between reality and the surreal. Today’s decadence was a nice reprieve from recent events that had my nerves on high alert. I still had a hard time stringing together that a few short months ago, I’d come home from my fiancé’s funeral to be drawn into a search for a trio of religious relics that together, would open a gate to hell. Oh, and the guy calling the shots? The earthly man, Enoch, who ascended into heaven to become the archangel, Metatron. My normal life as an assassin killing drug dealers and sex traffickers was a thousand times easier than dealing with the unearthly world and Metatron’s challenges. I sighed. I didn’t want to think about Metatron and all the upcoming tasks he’d given me, not right now. For sixteen more minutes, I could hide here in the salon and pretend that my otherworldly To Do list didn’t exist. The appointment had been on the book for months and when my reminder had popped up this morning, I’d almost cancelled, but my ratio of normal to unbelievable was low as it was. This would add a gram or two to tip the scale back the other way. Mika, my stylist, drew a round brush through my damp hair and flicked on the hair dryer, plunging me into a welcome sound bubble of my own thoughts. Metatron wasn’t letting me tackle this mission by myself, though. Oh, no… He’d given me a fantastic assembly of a team. I had a scholar as ancient as the religious relics he knew as well as the liver spots on his own hand—though with his slipping mind, my confidence level of his wisdom slipped daily. But he made up for those memory gaps with a fierce fervor for this cause. He knew everything there was to know about the Book of Enoch, Metatron’s personal bible of all things heavenly, earthly, and below. Then there was Clay, my partner in crime and a brilliant yet flippant thief who didn’t take anything seriously, except maybe the day’s fantasy-football picks. Rounding out the stellar grouping was my aging mentor, currently recovering from hip surgery. He’d brought me up after my parents’ murder and recruited me into the “family business” of assassins for hire. We were a motley crew, to be certain. But based on what I’d seen so far and what I feared lay in store for us, we might just be the crew best equipped to succeed. I sighed again and tried to let the tension melt from my body. To say I deserved a day at the spa was the understatement of the year. While Mika’s hair dryer smothered me in a blanket of warmth and the brush tickled my scalp, I let my thoughts wander to Griffin, my fiancé, murdered in retaliation for my hired kill of a South Asian leader—or so I’d thought. With every new rock we’d turned over in our search for the relics, I’d learned that not everything that had happened in my life was quite what I’d been told, and that Griffin’s death was only the first lie. The Angel of Death, Azazel—a former archangel in his own right—had intercepted Griffin’s soul. They’d boosted it like a painting and carted it off to hell, trapping him there. As his soul mate, I was the only one who could save him. Griffin’s holy soul—born of the most royal blood—was a hot commodity, able to wield power for its possessor. And as Azazel was currently trapped in a prison of his own making, he’d steal whatever he needed to be set free. Or so he thought. I’d already dealt with his number-one guy, Harrold, a foot soldier sent to keep me from succeeding. But they’d underestimated me. Badly. And I would not fail Griffin. Not this time. We’d already found the first relic, the Ring of Solomon, along with a handful of items that we hoped would prove their importance soon. We had a rock from the Garden of Gethsemane, where Judas betrayed Jesus, two of the silver pieces that Judas had been paid in recompense for the betrayal, and a knife once thought to be possessed of powers that shielded a high priest from bad angels. My weaponry was as eclectic as my teammates. We had yet to see which was more useful—or which was the bigger liability. I was keeping them safe and close to me until this thing was over. Next on the agenda was relic number two and that was going to require the team to walk straight back into danger. All we knew was that the actual relic was another weapon used that night in the Garden: the sword that Simon Peter—Jesus’s right hand—had used against one of the soldiers that night when they came for Jesus. (He lopped a dude’s ear clean off!) From what Clay and I had been able to figure out—and he was definitely better versed in the religious relics—the sword had disappeared that night. It had been lost in the fray of the events of the next few days and never really talked about, forsaken for the “trendier” relics like the shroud, the chalice from dinner earlier in the evening, and even bits of the cross. I’d wondered a lot over the last few months at the simplicity of the relics we’d found so far. Solomon’s ring held legendary status with the power to control demons, so that at least made a little sense as something that might open a gate to hell. But a stone? A knife? A sword? I thought for sure we were going after a holy set of keys, not a bunch of weaponry. But what did I know about opening the gates of hell? Maybe that was exactly the kind of thing that opened them. I hadn’t seen Metatron since a few days before Christmas, and he’d been as stingy as ever with details and clues. All he’d parted with was our next location—Greece. I assumed I was overdue for a visit from the archangel, but I figured he’d come see me as soon as he wanted to send us back on the trail. I hated that he took his sweet time revealing the information that we needed. He’d already told me that we had a limited amount of time to get Griffin’s soul—apparently it was being stained by evil and the longer he stayed, the less he’d be like himself by the time I got him out of hell. My heart ached at seeing him as anything other than the sweet kind man who’d loved me until his last breath. Mika finished and spun me around. I looked like me, except fancier. The deep circles around my blue eyes had faded, and my cheeks finally held some color. Now I was glad that I hadn’t cancelled the appointment. I met his eyes and smiled. He’d done far more for me today than just managing a few split ends. “Thank you so much.” “You’re so very welcome. Don’t be such a stranger next time.” He flipped the ends of my hair forward, drawing my attention back to my own image. My dark hair fell in waves past my shoulders and before I’d left the house, I’d swiped a bit of mascara so I had lashes to frame my eyes, and gloss for a hint of pink across my lips. It hadn’t been much, but enough of an improvement that I looked less like a hired assassin-cum-relic hunter. I pushed up out of the chair and grabbed my purse, but when I looked up to follow Mika he was frozen in place. And not because I’d stunned him into silence with my good looks. The entire salon was frozen in time. It was one of Metatron’s fun tricks that he used when he showed up. With a flair worthy of the high-priced salon, the archangel strode through the front doors, looking elegant and striking in his black suit, icy blond hair perfectly in place. He grinned and stretched both hands toward me like we were fast friends. “Good morning, darling. This look becomes you, like Athena herself.” “Metatron.” I arched an eyebrow and took a step back, dodging his grip. “Took you long enough. We don’t have an endless timeline, you know.” His relaxed attitude annoyed me, like we were headed to brunch and he wasn’t a month late for the date. My anxiety spiked at both the anticipation of what he’d come to tell me and being back on the job. He looked me up and down but I did not fidget beneath his scrutiny, confident in both my appearance and abilities. “You appear prepared for the next level of your journey.” That wasn’t exactly true. For the last three weeks I’d sat on my couch, staring at my blank TV trying to decide if I should watch the recording he’d given me. One I’d watched a single time, coming away overwhelmed and distraught at the imagery that had catalogued my mother’s gruesome death at the hands of my new enemy, Harrold, a man taught and trained by the Angel of Death himself. The problem wasn’t watching the horrific act. It was the lies Harrold had fed me right before Metatron had agreed to give me the recording, and there was just enough of a hint of truth in them that I was deeply troubled about how much I could trust Metatron. I rarely put my trust in anyone, but I’d eagerly—and blindly—swallowed up every detail Metatron had given. I’d wanted—needed—the information about my mom and what had happened to her after she’d made me flee to safety that awful night so many years ago. I knew better than to let fear keep me from the truth, but I was paralyzed in the step between knowing it and doing something about it. Considering that the archangel was an integral part of my success as well as a huge source of information, even a hint of distrust in him compromised my mission. For now, though, I needed to pretend that all was right between us so that he would give me the intel I needed to keep this moving forward. I swallowed and nodded, gripping my purse tightly. “We’re ready. Ralph says we have to find the sword, and you say we have to go to Greece—and I’m assuming Athens by your Athena comment.” He nodded. “So smart, Evangeline.” “Tell me what to do.”",

      "content": "Chapter Two With the world restarted and my mission tucked under my arm like my purse, I headed out the salon to find Clay—the thief—and travel with him to London to see Ralph, the scholar. I turned the corner at 56th and halted. Two storefronts down, Clay was already at our meeting place, one hand pressed into the stone wall above the head of a too-young-for-him blonde. She had her red fingernails curled into the front of his tight T-shirt, hips tilted toward his, and body supple and inviting. I huffed in annoyance. Then I made myself take a deep breath. What did I care if he was dating a college co-ed, as long as he stayed focused on the upcoming task? I leaned my shoulder into the wall and waited, hoping he’d finish up and send her on her way. While the afternoon sun heated the top of my head, I watched him, troubled that I had any sort of reaction to the way his lips moved while he talked to her. For a thief, he was built, with broad shoulders narrowing to a trim physique that suited him well as he descended ropes and climbed through windows. He still hadn’t bothered to get a haircut, so now his light curls edged over the tops of his ears and flared at his nape. Today, his navy T-shirt stopped just above the curve of his bicep, revealing the long length of his toned arms as they stretched toward the blonde. He’d matched the body-hugging tee with a pair of dark-washed jeans that nicely accented the curve of his ass. If I cared—which I didn’t. Clay kissed the blonde slowly and leisurely, then turned her and squeezed her butt as she walked to the waiting cab. She slid in with the practiced care of a woman used to being watched and I could think of a million things I’d rather practice, mostly involving guns. My attention drifted to Clay, intently watching the blonde’s departure. When he glanced up at me, the cocky grin was enough to yank me away from any attraction I felt for him—which I didn’t. I pushed away from the wall and walked toward him. “Hey,” he said, opening the door to the small deli where we’d agreed to meet for lunch and updates on what we’d been working on for the upcoming mission. We didn’t do this often, and now I was glad for that. “Hi yourself.” “Oh good, I was hoping you’d be your normal friendly self.” I ignored his barb and smiled at the hostess. She led us to a table in the far corner and I rearranged the chairs, sitting with my back to the wall and facing both exits. He shook his head and plopped into the chair opposite me, lanky and relaxed. “Doesn’t that get old, thinking someone is always after you?” “No. And after the attempt on your life in London, I’d think maybe you’d start. Have you eaten?” I lifted my menu, hiding the frustrating burn in my cheeks. He’d been so cute and jovial with that girl, but he poked and prodded me incessantly, always trying to aggravate me. He was like a sliver I couldn’t dig out from under my skin. I shouldn’t care, but I did. I liked being around him too much for my own good, especially since this entire mission revolved around my barely-dead fiancé’s soul. “Hey.” He put his index finger on the top of my menu and pulled it down. I tried to push it back up, but he held it. “You look pretty today.” I glanced up, met his gaze for a second, and looked back at the day’s specials. “Thanks.” He took the menu away and tucked it beneath his folded arms on the table. “What’s eating you?” A thousand things that shouldn’t be. I’d already lost my hold on the calm that Mika had given me. Metatron’s visit hadn’t helped and now I was antsy to get on to the next part of our mission. I cleared my throat and looked at him. “Metatron just came to see me.” He frowned. “Damn. I wanted to be there again.” His gaze skimmed my lips and the soft curls in my hair. “You really do look pretty. But something else is bothering you, what’s up?” I shook my head, hating that he was observant enough to realize the obvious. No way was I going to even hint that I cared about the kiss he’d shared with that girl. Because. I. Didn’t. “Nothing. Let’s eat and then we need to head out to Ralph’s.” I glanced around the mostly deserted deli, still wary about being overheard, though we had a lot to discuss. I credited that loose end for my unease. “I’ll fill you in on the plane.” He narrowed his eyes. “You sure that’s all that’s bugging you?” Luckily, the waitress showed up and I concealed the hint of heat warming up my face with a long drink of water and ordered a club sandwich and fries. Clay and I had been through a fair share of crazy over the last few months, including attempts on both our lives, and I was sure it was that shared experience that was affecting me, not any sort of attraction. But either way, I needed to get that under control and focus on our upcoming mission. Metatron had promised it would be much more difficult than the last and I had to be at my best. I wanted to tell Clay everything Metatron had revealed, but we couldn’t do it here and as the stakes of this mission escalated, I wasn’t sure we could do it anywhere. Clay handed the waitress our menus, then turned to me and winked. “If I’m good, will you let me get a piece of pie for the road?” I rolled my eyes, relieved to be back on joking terms—at least for the moment. I agreed, because there was no chance he could behave himself for an entire meal.",

      "content": "Chapter Three Outside the deli, Clay pointed toward a beefed-up silver Hummer. “I’m parked over here and I’ve been keeping an overnight bag in the back just in case you pulled another last-minute trip on me.” “Great. My bags are already at the jet.” I’d sent them with Malcolm when he’d left last week for another mission, knowing they’d be safe and ready at the secured airstrip instead of having to drag them around. Looks like we’d both been restless about the pause between relics. He held my door for me and I climbed into the beast. “Nice ride.” The interior was gunmetal gray and spotless. Clay was so flippant and carefree that the raw manliness of the vehicle caught me off guard. I’d pegged him for a ’69 Camaro convertible or something equally casual, but with a hint of masculinity. He climbed in and I inhaled the leather and his tropical air freshener—not his spicy cologne. He pulled into traffic and I launched into our most pressing issue—the double-cross and deception from his buyer. I’d let that one go far too long and should have dealt with it immediately, but Clay had forced me to back off, assuring me that he had it handled every time we’d talked since the party. I was done waiting on him. The last thing we needed was a loose end, especially one who’d already tried to kill Clay. “Tell me about the buyer who set us up at Jeffries. Who is this guy, anyway?” Clay checked his rearview mirror and changed lanes, speeding past the slower traffic on the right. “Never met him. That’s how I work with all my clients. He sent me a secure message through my system about five years back and I’ve stolen a dozen pieces for him since.” “Like what?” I pulled a notepad from my purse and clicked my pen. There was a connection in the details, I just had to find it and use the clues to track us back to the man who’d hired the hit. He shrugged and turned on the radio, keeping the pop station low in the background. The bass thrummed through the floorboards and made my feet tremble. “Relics, mostly. The first one was an alabaster jar, then a trio of medallions, a single painting—tiny, though. I palmed it and walked out without a single person blinking.” I shook my head. Seriously, his cockiness knew no bounds. He was undeniably good, though. And I’d stuffed our last piece in my bra, so I couldn’t exactly chide him for being discreet. The only things that ever mattered was completing the mission and staying alive. So far, we’d succeeded with those two. “What else?” “More of the same. You don’t really think you’re going to be able to find him through those, are you? He had me fence half of them and he had private buyers for the rest.” I turned and stared at him, wondering how he could stay so nonchalant and trusting. Our close calls hadn’t rattled him in the least and he was still convinced that he wasn’t in any danger. “How sure are you of that? Maybe he just told you about the private buyers and he used some of these pieces to misdirect you.” I grunted. “He obviously has no problem lying to you. Or trying to kill you.” We’d both nearly been killed on Clay’s last mission. He’d called me in to help him and we’d been attacked in the middle of boosting what was supposed to be a fifteen-million-dollar painting. “Yeah, but that’s why I think you’re wasting time on this. If he’d have wanted me dead, I wouldn’t be sitting here now.” “You’re a fool to dismiss the hit.” He glanced over at me, a wide sure grin showing his teeth. “I’m not you, babe. I don’t live and die at the end of a gun. If he kills me, who’s going to get him his next bauble?” “There are plenty of thieves out there.” I closed my notebook and leaned back in the seat. “I realize you think you’re the best, but there are more than a few people who are nearly as good as you.” I turned toward the window. “And probably half the pain.” “I heard that.” He turned up the radio and we moved through traffic to the turnoff to the airport, passing the public entry for the private one that I used. For a guy who’d been rattled by my unlimited access to Learjets, he’d come around fast. Security waved us through and he parked along the tall chain-link fence reserved for the few vehicles that stayed on the property. Most of the fliers out of here used private cars and I could have done that today, but he’d wanted to drive. Maybe he was more worried than he wanted to let on and was didn’t want anyone tampering with his car. No chance of that happening in here with the level of security surrounding this airstrip and the guests using it. We got out and walked to the jet, door open and waiting for us. Inside, I bugged him about it again. “Before we do anything, we need to eliminate that threat.” Clay made a face. “I’m sure he was just sending a message.” I blinked. Hits were the world I came from, and in it, people didn’t hire assassins as messages. They did it to take care of a problem. In all my years in the business, I’d never heard of someone going to all the trouble of hiring a kill, just to pull it at the last minute in favor for a glancing blow. Clay’d been lucky to survive the lousy shot, and wouldn’t have if I hadn’t been there to save him by killing the shooter before he could finish the job. I had a hard time believing that was the end of it. “Humor me. Tell me about every interaction you’ve had with this buyer so I can figure out who this is and identify the real threat. This is bigger than you screwing up the heist. Has there ever been anything out of the ordinary on any of your deals?” He reclined the leather seat and propped his hands behind his head. “You mean other than the time that guy pulled a gun and shot me?” I rolled my eyes and took the seat next to him. “Was there anything else about that heist that stood out?” He was silent long enough that I thought he’d fallen asleep, then one eyelid popped open, blue eye staring intently at me. “He called me.” I leaned closer. “Okay. That’s something. Do you remember anything about the call? Had he ever done that before?” He sat up and shook his head, then ran a hand through his blond curls. “No. Like I said, we always dealt through the secure site. I didn’t even know how he got my number.” “And you seriously didn’t see anything wrong with that?” I threw up my hands, then dug around for my notebook to add the detail to my list. An anomaly like that would have sent up no fewer than a dozen red flags for me. But Clay had already proved that I was a lot more suspicious and cautious than he’d ever be. Where I saw nothing but issues and problems, Clay only saw opportunities and challenges. In this, as in everything else, we were day and night.",

      "title": "Chapter 6",
      "content": "Chapter Four Though I wanted to dig deeper and ask him more rounds of questions, I relented. I figured that my subconscious would come up with a link, or a detail I’d missed that could help us. I still hated leaving the loose end, but I knew better than to chase a path without a map. I needed concrete links to get me solid on the identity of Clay’s buyer, and we weren’t there yet. Not knowing would bug me until we figured it out. “You watch your video yet?” he asked. I shook my head. “I thought you wanted to watch it with me.” “I do, but we haven’t talked about it since that night.” It was true. I’d ignored everything about the video, my mom’s death, the man who’d told me that I’d been manipulated by the events in the video. I hadn’t wanted to know the truth, fearful that it would be as bad as I’d imagined. “Come on.” He slid open the cabinet concealing the TV and grabbed the remote, then returned to his chair, patting the one beside him. “Put it in and let’s do this thing.” I crossed my arms and stared at the snow on the screen, then stiffened my back and dug the DVD from my purse. I’d packed it for the trip knowing that I couldn’t delay the inevitable any longer. “What am I looking for?” Clay asked as I put the DVD in the player and sat on the edge of the chair beside him. I shook my head. “Honestly … I’m not sure. Just watch and tell me what you see.” His gaze met mine and held. No joking, no teasing. For a moment, I felt like he could hear my thoughts and the pounding of my heart. I was terrified of what he’d see during my mom’s death that I was blind to. I appreciated not only his willingness to go through this with me, but the intensity and lack of humor he was willing to give to it. When he needed to be, he was a great guy, and a strong partner … which was why I was so conflicted when my thoughts about him strayed into a simplistic physical need that cheapened what we had together. I liked working with him and didn’t want either of us to screw that up. He rested his hand on the middle of my back. “Are you okay?” “Play it.” I squeezed my fingers tightly on my lap and concentrated on seeing the facts, not being swayed by the emotion of what I knew was coming. The image switched to that night in Jordan—flames, chaos, death. Clay muttered curses and tensed beside me as the video rolled on filling the entire cabin with screams and the lick of flames. I watched it with a removed heart, even as my mother faced off against Harrold. My thoughts swayed as I realized how little Azazel’s man hadn’t changed from the image on the screen to when he’d appeared in my apartment after we’d stolen the relic. He and I had fought, but Clay had pulled me off him before I’d killed him—and I still wasn’t sure if that had been a good thing. “Come work for us,” he’d said, as if Azazel was any other boss extending a job offer. Then he’d told me that they’d offered the same thing to my mother, an offer of protection, of help. Had they offered it to her on this night, when the screen had gone blank? Or before tonight? Harrold said he hadn’t killed her and that’s the detail I needed to see—needed Clay to see so I could stop losing my mind over who to trust. Azazel didn’t want my mother dead, Harrold had said. He’d needed her alive, to use her special gifts to find the relics. But if that was true, then who’d killed her? The video finished and we sat in stark silence, only the air against the fuselage tormenting our ears now that the screams had subsided. “What do you think?” I asked, my voice cracking. Clay slowly set the remote on the small table in front of our chairs, then turned to me, the horrors and destruction mapped across his features. His leaned over and put an arm around my shoulder, then covered my fisted hands, pressing his lips to my temple and hugging me for a moment. I shuddered and he pulled back. “That was your mother then, the woman?” I nodded. She’d been beautiful and strong and so very courageous as she’d stood in defiance of Harrold. So different than the striking, fighting beast he’d reduced me to. “There’s one thing that’s really bugging me,” Clay said. “Harrold asked her for the relic, and she refused. If Azazel wanted her to work for him, why not remind her of the offer then? Why not promise her immortality as the village burned around her? Why not offer to save her family, her friends, her own life?” He made a good point. “Mom never would have parted with a historical artifact, though. Not for anyone. She believed that they belonged to the people, to the public, catalogued and on display somewhere commemorating the history of those who’d created, honored, and sacrificed for the piece—and not just the important pieces, but every piece. Maybe they’d already been through this and she’d refused before this night and they thought this would be the ticket to bringing her around.” “Maybe. Little more difficult to know what they’d offered her then, if she wasn’t the kind of person to react like most of us.” “Even immortality wouldn’t have swayed her beliefs. She was passionate about preserving history and clearly Azazel wanted it for his own means. She didn’t agree with that … ever.” Clay ran his fingertips across his mouth, deep in thought. “I think that’s the crux of it, though, isn’t it? No matter what Azazel was offering, he’s not after these relics for good reasons. Even if he wanted to keep your Mom alive, it was only for his own gain. That makes him a bad guy in my book.” “Yeah.” I sat back and sighed. “Mine too. I can’t trust anything he or his minions say, and all he’s done with this is distract us from what matters.” He reached over and set his palm on my knee. “We’re going to set this right for all of them. We’ll get Griffin’s soul where it belongs, up there with your mom and dad.” Tears stung my eyes and I nodded. “Thanks. I need that. I don’t know who we can trust and what information hasn’t been corrupted by someone’s agenda.” “Doesn’t matter. You can trust me and we’ll figure it out together. We’ll get the other two relics and we’ll find the gate, storm in there, and get him.” His voice softened. “We will.” I put my hand over his and held it there in solidarity.",

      "content": "Chapter Five After grabbing a few hours of sleep, we landed in Chelsea to an awaiting Range Rover that I let Clay drive over to Ralph’s. Thankfully, they didn’t keep to regular hours, so our 3 a.m. arrival wasn’t as much of an interruption as it would have been to others. We hurried up the steps and Anna opened the door before we could knock. Her silver hair was in its usual bun and she had reading glasses on a chain around her neck. Today her attire was a casual gray sweater paired with a burgundy skirt. We’d probably interrupted a quiet day at home when she finally had a moment to herself. But if she was disappointed, she didn’t show it. “Welcome, welcome. I should get the two of you your own key.” Clay followed me in. “We are here a lot, aren’t we?” She tipped her cheek up for a kiss from him. “A pleasure, as always.” The thump of a cane across hardwood turned me toward Ralph’s study, where the portly professor appeared, white hair shocked around his ears and the back of his head. “Oh lovely! I was so hoping to see you today.” I smiled and gave him a hug, not bothering to remind him that I’d called yesterday to let him know that we were on our way. We’d learned to roll with the holes in Ralph’s memory and so far he hadn’t forgotten anything that had put us in danger. I needed that to hold out for a little longer. “Does that mean you have information for us?” Clay asked, reaching over my head to shake Ralph’s hand as I stepped back. “Of course, of course. Shall I tell you over a cup of Earl Grey?” In the kitchen, Anna already had tea heating and she brought a tray of biscuits and cookies to the table. I was surprised that they’d managed to keep it tidy since we’d been here at Christmas. Ralph was a hoarder of the extreme kind, and while I understood his need to not get rid of any of his important documents and papers, it made things incredibly difficult when we were trying to find pieces I needed for this journey. He probably had millions in undocumented relics stashed all over this house in crannies and buried beneath boxes of papers, but so far we’d only been able to unearth a few. I hoped this next relic wasn’t in his house anywhere. Clay sat on the far side of the table and I took the seat between him and Ralph, grabbing a tiny shortbread cookie. “Okay, Metatron confirmed that we’re starting in Athens, and you’ve said we’re after Peter’s sword from the garden. Is that it?” Ralph laughed and patted my hand. “Hardly, dear. But I do find your enthusiasm adorable. First, let me tell you the story of the sword.” Clay leaned back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest and grinning. He loved Ralph’s stories and they’d become fast friends while we’d been here. I didn’t know anything about Clay’s relationship with his dad, only that things weren’t great with his mom’s health, but now I wondered if Ralph reminded him of his dad—or the one he’d wished he’d had. These were things that I didn’t need to know about a partner with whom I had only had a working relationship, but I couldn’t help wondering about this man and the idiosyncrasies of who he was. Anna poured milk into Ralph’s cup, then the hot tea, and I did the same to my own. He took the delicate china and sipped it. “I’ve already told you that all the apostles were armed the night that Judas betrayed his Teacher, but Peter was the only one with a sword. When the soldiers arrived, Peter attacked, cutting off the ear of one man, Malchus—a servant of the high priest—and was quickly reprimanded by Jesus.” He waved his hand and set down the tea. “Jesus was taken away, Judas turned in the silver, overcome with guilt then hanged himself, but Peter…” He looked from Clay to me. “Peter couldn’t desert Jesus. He followed as they marched Him to court. Which, incidentally is where Peter denied Christ three times.” “Did he have the sword on him?” Clay asked, eating two shortbreads stacked together. “Those are details I’ve been researching. What I’ve told you is what was included in the canon, but what will aid us is the rest of the story.” “Like the rock.” He nodded. “Right. The handling of the weapons and where they went obviously didn’t matter to anyone trying to learn about Christ and what occurred in the days before His crucifixion. But they matter to us a great deal.” I folded my hands and leaned forward, surprisingly nervous about this next relic—something I was damn sure going to pay attention to this time after ignoring my intention too many times along the way. I had to be on constant alert. My gaze flickered to Clay, oblivious of everything beyond Ralph and this room. Ignorance really was bliss. But this time, his denial of the threat was going to kill him … and maybe take out the rest of us in the process. I had to be on top of every detail and every niggling of discomfort for both of us. “After the reprimand, Peter sheathed the sword, but the soldiers disarmed everyone before taking Jesus, fearful of a retaliation at their backs as they departed.” “Smart,” Clay said, standing and pouring himself a glass of milk from the fridge. Anna had left us, but was probably still close at hand in case Ralph needed anything. Clay came back to the table, pausing at the back window to survey the yard. Maybe he wasn’t as confident about his safety as he pretended. “The Romans weren’t fools enough to leave a viable weapon, so they absorbed the sword into their own armory.” I groaned and dropped my head into my hands. “Let me guess, now we’re looking for a needle in a haystack.” I lifted my head. “There were another five hundred years of battles for Rome. It could have traded hands dozens of times. Hell, it could have ended up beyond Hadrian’s Wall or in Asia after Attila’s push…” Ralph grinned and patted my hand. “Well done, girl. Took me a good two days to get there. That’s precisely what occurred. This sword isn’t a typical one and as it changed hands, its special properties didn’t go unnoticed, though it didn’t respond the same to everyone. It did make its way into Asia, but as Alexander moved back toward Greece for his own reign, so the sword came with him.” “Which is why we’re going to Athens.” Ralph leaned back in his chair, chest puffed out. “Exactly.” “Another museum?” Clay asked, his wariness quickly turning to eagerness at the mere thought of a heist. “Not this time.” He looked to me. “This time you’ll be relying on the skills you learned with your mother. This time you’ll meet up with an archeological team. Metatron believes they’ll unearth the relic within a week’s time.” “A week?” I didn’t need any more delays. I wanted to hurry this process along, get Griffin’s soul back, and finally be able to move the rest of my life forward. I needed to heal, and this journey was bringing up so many memories of him and making it hard to grieve him, knowing I was going to encounter some version of him when we finally made it to Hell, and probably not the one I’d loved and agreed to spend the rest of my life with. I couldn’t keep putting off the dreaded meeting, but I seemed to be the only one in a hurry. “I have a feeling you’ll be using every moment of that week for other matters.” Clay perked up. “Another heist?” “Sit, please.” Ralph extended his hand toward Clay’s chair. Clay looked at me and I shrugged, not having any idea what Ralph was up to. “Clay, the last time you arrived on my doorstop, you brought with you a great deal of blood.” “Sorry about that.” Clay ducked his head. “Yes, well, I’d prefer you always come here after being shot.” Ralph took another sip of tea. “We didn’t have a chance to talk about that with the flurry of Christmas and my research into the sword. The two of you need to address that before Greece.” I couldn’t agree more, but I kept my mouth shut. Clay would listen to Ralph and he’d already shown that my opinion on this matter didn’t hold any weight with him. Not enough to take it seriously anyway. He fidgeted under Ralph’s attention. “We addressed it on the way over. It’s handled.” Ralph crossed his arms over his chest, mimicking Clay’s posture. He waited, not saying anything. The men faced off, neither willing to give into the silent battle. Finally, Clay grunted and ran a hand through his hair. Still Ralph waited. It was the longest six seconds of my life before Clay finally straightened and clenched his jaw. “You don’t think it’s handled either, do you?” he asked Ralph. “I don’t, Clay, I really don’t.” Ralph relaxed and clasped his hands over his stomach. “These enemies aren’t typical men, though they may look and act like it to fool you, to infiltrate everyday life, to make you think you have a mince of a chance against them. They’ve worked hard to know you, to know your weaknesses…” He glanced quickly at me and I wasn’t sure if that was because he thought I was one of Clay’s weaknesses or because he thought I was in danger of having my own exploited. Both were true, if I wanted to be honest with myself. “Men like these will not stop until they complete whatever mission Azazel’s sent them on.” “Now, wait—” Clay stood quickly, making the chair rock backward. “I’ve known this buyer for years. Way before her.” He pointed at me, anger and confusion marring his features. I understood. It was exactly how I’d felt when Metatron had first come to me, first showed me the level of involvement of Azazel in my own life, starting with my mother and her untimely death. The sooner Clay could accept that we’d both been played, the sooner we could work together to beat these guys and finish the job. Ignorance only kept us at risk. I needed him to hear Ralph out, to see what was staring him right in the face. My stomach hurt when I thought about how we’d been played at Felt’s, then again at the Renwick, the party… We’d been nothing more than pawns, and damn if I was going to let anyone manipulate me, be it man or divinity. But Clay had to get to those conclusions on his own. Or it would continue to be a giant brick wall between us, and I couldn’t have anything working against us. We had plenty of obstacles without any irritations between he and I. And not only would it place friction between us, but it would give us a massive blind spot. If he continued to ignore this, he was a massive liability for me. One I might have to reconsider. I’d rather ditch him on this one until he came to terms with people wanting him dead, than having him dead. “Clay, your involvement in this is not coincidental,” Ralph said, sitting up and leaning toward Clay, his face intense and serious. “The farther you travel on this journey, the more intertwined your life will become with Lina’s, but do not for one moment think that they haven’t known that you were destined for her.”",

      "content": "Chapter Six I choked. Destined? Ralph’s brain had better have just taken a sharp left turn. I sat as still as possible, hoping like hell I didn’t look as terrified as that comment had made me feel. I didn’t want us to be some Team of Destiny. I had a soul mate. My heart constricted. I didn’t want to replace Griffin with Clay just because one was dead and the other was alive. If—and that was a big if—if we were destined, then it was as partners, as valors, victors, the final winning team. Nothing more. Clay’s gaze swept over me, softening only a bit. I returned the stare until he finally turned his attention to Ralph. “Go on….” “You must accept that the men who shot you, as well as the one who ordered that moment, are still after you. Right now they are aware of your every move, and possibly even the next one. Do not underestimate the power of their reach, nor the extents to which they will go.” “I’m worried about you and Anna,” I said. The more Ralph talked the more worried I became that these men would use them against us. If they knew everything about Clay, then they certainly knew that Ralph was every bit as much a weakness for him as I was, if not more. Clay cared deeply for Ralph and respected him a great deal. I knew just enough about Clay to know that he’d do just about anything to keep Ralph and Anna safe. If it were up to me, and Clay was my own hit, I’d exploit that weakness like nobody’s business. I had to assume that our opponent would absolutely do the same. But Ralph didn’t. He waved off my concern. “Good heavens, no. What would they want with two old biddies?” On the far side of the room, Anna tsked, her arms full of freshly laundered clothes. Ralph smiled and turned toward her. “That’s not what I believe, dear Anna. Why, I’ve always thought you didn’t look a day over sixty and you’re fresh as a daisy.” She shook her head and went back to folding laundry. Ralph winked at me, then turned serious and patted my hand. “Thank you for the concern. Metatron will ensure that we remain safe. I’ve talked to him about it, as I held the same concerns at one point.” I wasn’t sure how much I trusted Metatron with those I loved, but I didn’t have a lot of choice. We couldn’t really stash Ralph and Anna anywhere, but I would be speaking to Metatron about their safety when I saw him next. I’d put a guard on them if I thought it would help, but if Azazel’s men wanted to hurt them, there was nothing of this world that could stop them. And that went for Clay too. Much as he might be a liability, the only way I could truly keep him safe was keeping him right next to me. But that didn’t mean we couldn’t take out a few in the process. If there were fewer of them to attack us, then they wouldn’t have extra to send after Ralph. We had to get Clay’s buyer and all the people associated with that hit taken care of immediately. Clay let out a big breath and held out a hand to me, palm up. “Will you help me get these guys?” I lifted my hand and settled it in his, giving him a squeeze. “Of course.” He tugged, pulling me up to stand beside him. “I’m sorry that I didn’t believe you. That I didn’t take the threat seriously. I should have trusted your instinct.” I shrugged. “I’ve dismissed my instinct enough since we’ve started this wild ride, so we both need to get better.” “Tell me what we need to do.” I patted his shoulder. “We’ll figure it out.” I turned to Ralph. “We’ll get this handled. I can take out bad guys in my sleep, so I’m confident we’ll have plenty of time to do it before we need to be in Greece. What else do we need to know?” “Like everything you’ve been drawn to thus far, I believe you’ll know the sword when you see it. You’ll find the dig on the west end of the airport, near Spata. They located relics as they were tying into the sewer line for a new metro rail.” We stayed for breakfast and Ralph entertained Clay with a half-dozen stories and I helped Anna clean the kitchen. We declined their offer to stay for the day, knowing that there wasn’t enough room for us with all the boxes and papers in the house. I preferred us to have some good sleep before we started this trek. The plane was detained in Cairo, anyway, and wouldn’t be at the airport until tonight. The tension between Clay and me was still there as we left. Ralph stopped us at the door and shook Clay’s hand. “You must be there in five days, so do not tarry where your attacker is concerned.” Clay’s mouth drew tight and he nodded. “I think I’m in pretty good hands.” I tipped my head and studied him. That was the closest he’d ever come to complimenting me. Other than after he’d been shot and he told me that I made a terrible wife but was the only partner he’d ever want. I’d filled him full of morphine at that point, so I hadn’t given it a second thought. I kissed Ralph’s cheek. “I’ll keep him alive.” Clay took my hand and tucked it in the crook of his arm as we walked to the car. I started to pull away, thinking he was going to walk around, but he escorted me all the way to my door and opened it for me. It was strange, but I figured he was doing it for Ralph’s benefit and I didn’t mind being tucked against his warm strong body. I pulled free and climbed in, then reached for the door. But he blocked it, stepping into the open space, hand on the frame above my head. “I’ll be better.” I frowned. “About what?” “Trusting you.” “It’s okay, Clay. We’ll figure this out.” “I could have put you in danger—did put you in danger.” “I can handle myself.” I felt bad that he was still struggling with this and I didn’t know what else to say to ease his worries. He looked over the roof of the car and stared across Ralph’s weathered neighborhood. “You’re going to have to help me.” I knew that, but I didn’t think his ego wanted to hear it. “We’ll be fine. Let’s go to the hotel and we’ll make a plan.” He nodded, shut my door, and climbed in behind the wheel, remaining stoic and thoughtful until we got to the hotel. I checked us in and we carried our sparse bags, along with my weapons bag from beneath the front seat that the CIA had left for me. It was nice to have friends in low places and they made sure I always had whatever I needed. And better, they never asked any questions. This mission was proving to be in need of every one of those connections, and we hadn’t even started yet. I paused at the threshold, glancing up and down the walkway, checking for pursuers and creepy crawlies. The morning was a comfortable calm and I hitched my gear bag higher as I walked in the room, only to find Clay sprawled across the only bed in the room, a large king. “Oh, hell no.” He grinned and tucked his hands behind his head. “This makes twice. Pretty sure it’s a message from Metatron.” He bounced his hips against the mattress. I rolled my eyes. “Nice try.” I set my weapons on the small desk, tossed my bag beneath, and dialed the front desk, only to be told that there’d been a mixup and they didn’t have any double rooms left. We were stuck with a king room on the main floor. Not ideal. “Thanks.” I hung up and ignored Clay’s chuckle. With my back still to him, I pulled the black bag close, reveling in the weight of it as it slid across the motel table. Nothing better in the world for soothing my nerves than the feel of trusted weaponry. I unhooked the double clasp and unrolled the girthy fabric, revealing two handguns and a dozen knives: six small concealable ones, and the remaining half-dozen a sweet collection of large ones that I could carry well enough in my other holsters. I loved knifes, loved their deadly silence. Guns were handy, but they made it difficult to stay concealed with their loud reports and obvious muzzle flashes. I wouldn’t ever be comfortable using one as a main weapon. I much preferred my knives and the anonymity they afforded me. I’d taken my share of jobs that had required sniper rifles, and while they did give me the ability to stay far away, the distance troubled me, made the kill too impersonal, too machine-like. I wasn’t a killer, I was an assassin, and I realized there wasn’t more than a hair between the two definitions, but it was the hair that I’d made my own personal line of demarcation. One was a mercenary, heartless and cold. The other acted within a code, a creed, following a mission. I would never be a killer. I’d been called to be an assassin. And now I would challenge the code that I’d clung to since firing my very first shot. I hadn’t been hired to kill Clay’s buyer, but he was certainly a bad guy. And that’s where my gray area lived. There were a lot of bad guys out there, ninety-eight percent of whom I’d never killed and would not kill. I couldn’t eradicate evil from the planet, but I could do my part in eliminating the people that agencies had tracked, researched, and believed were the worst of them, or those who could spread evil like a contagion. Now I was the one doing the tracking and researching. And Clay, Ralph and I did believe that the men who’d tried to kill Clay were ones worth taking out. There was an element of self-defense, and had certainly been the case when I’d killed the shooter trying to take Clay out, but again … complete gray area. I could apply the self-defense angle to every associate of every person I’d killed. But I didn’t, because my carefully constructed rules and creed were what kept me sane, kept me believing that at the end of the day I was better than the men and women I destroyed. That was the rub, though, wasn’t it? I slipped one of the knives from the case and turned it over, back and forth. The righteous always believe that they’re on the right side of the “law.” Over the course of mankind, religious zealots had killed millions because their targets fell outside their own carefully constructed creeds. Azazel, too. He wanted to eliminate all of us who stood in the way of his goal, those with the power to keep him from succeeding. Was I that much different? I laid the knife on the desk and took another, smaller one out, turned it over and ran my finger lightly along the crisp blade. I didn’t have a choice and though I knew it, killing someone who I hadn’t been hired to kill or who wasn’t currently attacking me made my stomach sour. But without taking them out, we’d never be able to let our guard down. Savvy as I was at having alert senses and eyes in the back of my head, I still had to sleep, still had to eat a meal without inhaling it so I wouldn’t be caught off guard. My nerves needed the ability to relax, even if only for a day or two. With a killer on the loose, I’d lose that opportunity. I grimaced. You’d think that with a damn archangel on our side, that Metatron would be willing to help us out and give us some protection. “What are you thinking about over there?” I glanced over my shoulder. Clay sat on the edge of the bed, hands pressed into the mattress, shoulders hunched high. Like the stress of our situation was getting to him too. I took one of the mid-sized knives and carried it over to him. “That we’re not as prepared as I’d like.” “You mean I’m not.” “You need to be ready to kill.” I flipped the knife and held the blade, pushing the hilt toward him. He reached an unsteady hand toward it and curled his fingers tentatively around the metal. I released it. “How much hand-to-hand did you do in the military?” He shook his head and stood. “I wasn’t in the military.” I frowned. “Yes, you were. Two years.” I’d looked it up in the database. I knew all about the time he’d spent in the Army. He shook his head and moved the knife to his left hand, let the weight settle into his palm, then switched it back. His head lifted and he pierced me with those blue eyes and a cheeky grin. “Nope. Didn’t even graduate high school.” He shrugged. “But I made a couple friends good with computers.” “I knew it.” Again, I’d dismissed my first impression about his background when I’d found it. I knew little about him when I’d pulled up all the data that I had access to, but it had seemed manufactured, too perfect. I shook my head and he winked. “Well, that just means you have more work to do. You’ve proven that you’re fairly decent, but you have to be better. If I can beat you, then they’re going to annihilate you.” “You haven’t beaten me—” “First.” I was not about to get into a discussion about how many times we’d traded the upper hand when we’d fought. I’d held him off and he’d never been able to best me, and he had me by six inches and fifty pounds. I needed him to be able to take me every time if I was going to feel safe about him protecting himself … and watching my back. His mouth snapped closed and the skin around the edges of his eyes creased like he was finally taking this serious. “First,” I started again. “You need to be able to throw and then we’ll work on getting away clean. I don’t want you wrestling with these guys. I want you staying as far away from them as possible. Throw, slice, run.” “I don’t run.” “Yeah, I know.” I poked him hard in the shoulder right in his still-healing wound. “Ow, dammit!” He jerked away and rubbed his arm. “What the hell?” “You got lucky and you know it. That should have killed you. If you wouldn’t have been toppling out the window, he would have gotten a clean kill.” I would have. “I’m always lucky. I don’t have to worry about this stuff like you do. I’m not in life-or-death situations. Ever.” He handed the knife back. “I thought you were going to handle all of this. Killing is what you do. I’ll do the thief stuff, you take care of that.” He waved his hand toward the stack of weapons. I shoved the knife toward him again. “Clay, I’m serious about this. They’re going to try and kill you again.” “And what’s a knife going to do? Block the bullet? You think they aren’t going to come at me with everything they have so they don’t miss this time?” His voice rose. “Because I think I don’t stand a fucking chance. They’re probably going to blow up my car, or shoot me through that window while I’m sleeping with you tonight!” He knocked my hand away and paced the room. I holstered the knife and crossed my arms. I wanted him mad enough that he’d see reason, but I didn’t want him giving up all hope. “They’re not going to kill you like that.” “How do you know?” he growled, not letting up on his pacing. I shrugged. “I just do. Azazel is too intimate, too connected to these kills. If he’s sending his guys, it will be on a personal level.” He glared at me. “Trust me. If there’s one thing I do know, it’s how assassins have habits too.” He stopped pacing and turned, then swiftly closed the distance between us, gripping my arms tightly and shaking me once. “How would you do it?” he asked, his tone deadly soft. “If they hired you to kill me, how would you do it?” His hard gaze roamed my face, at odds with the tenderness in his voice. I let him manhandle me, knowing that he needed to control something about this situation. And I wasn’t worried that he’d hurt me. Not like this, anyway. I let him bend me backward and I tipped my chin up, exposing my neck so he could see my submission to his grip, to his question, to his fear. “How?” I thought about the question, about his habits, about how I knew him. “At night,” I whispered. “I’d slip in your room while you slept and I’d cut your throat.” He blanched and his face whitened. “Really?” I nodded and his grip relaxed. I stayed next to him, our bodies almost touching. “You’re a sound sleeper.” I laughed softly. “You sleep like the dead. Like a man who has nothing to fear.” I watched his features shift and soften as he processed what I was saying. “I envy you, actually. You’ve been that way from the very first time and it was shocking to see someone be able to fall asleep instantly without having to check exits, strategies, weapons, tick off all the people who might be coming to kill you tonight.” His hands moved around my back, holding me gently. “Is that what it’s like for you, then? Every night?” I nodded. “I’m used to it, though. If I go through my list and it hasn’t changed much since yesterday, I usually fall asleep after a few minutes. I’ve done it for so long that it’s become my nighttime ritual. Other people count sheep. I count how many people I’ve pissed off today.” He frowned. “That’s a pretty shitty way to fall asleep.” “Maybe.” Somewhere we’d gotten tangled up in my sleep patterns instead of his, but I didn’t want to get him ruffled again. That would come soon enough when I went back to training him. And okay … maybe it felt good to be standing in his arms, to feel his strength and to not have to rely on my own for just a moment. He was so rarely this passionate, this fiery, and I liked this side of him as much as I did his goofy persona. I needed him worried and alert. “Maybe we could come up with a new one.” His gaze dropped to my lips and for just a fleeting second, I was aroused and tempted to let him kiss me, to let him take me away from the pain and grief and frustration of this mission, of losing Griffin, of being so goddamn alone. His gaze flickered back up to my eyes and I saw the question there, like he’d expected me to brush him off instantly, pull out of his arms, and chastise him like I’d done every other time before. And I meant to … I did. But I hesitated once more. And this time he didn’t ask, didn’t question. His lips came down hard on mine and his hands tightened on my back, pulling me against his body. His lips were warm and firm and held a desperation that only comes from fear of dying, of seeing missed chances and future opportunities being flung away and out of reach as death comes racing forward to fill every crevice of what may come. I kissed him back, clinging to the aliveness of him, the urgency of his movements, the pressure of his fingers into the small of my back. His tongue darted out and brushed my lips. I could have pulled away then and we would have been able to chalk this up to an untethered moment of fear, but I didn’t. I didn’t. I let him press gently into my mouth and as I tasted him, I moaned at the exquisite feel of someone else. Someone other than me inside this body where I’d been imprisoned. One of his hands came up to cup my face, to tilt it to the side so he could deepen the kiss, and damned if I didn’t let him. My own hands found his waist, curled into the loose fabric of his shirt, and I felt more warmth and strength there, at the base of his ribs, the edge of his waistband. He kissed me deeply and with a longing that echoed in my own self. Then he gentled the kiss, touching his lips softly to mine and bringing his other hand up to hold my jaw. He rested his forehead against mine and my breath came in ragged gasps. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I didn’t mean—” I gave my head a little shake, our foreheads still pressed together. “Don’t. Just let it stand.” He moved one arm around my back and drew my cheek to his chest. My arms unclenched from his shirt and slid around his waist. We stood there, soldiers thrown together in a war that was not of our own making, death clinging to the door like the dark of the night, worries scratching at the hinges. But in this one moment, breathing each other’s air, we were safe.",

      "title": "Chapter 9",
      "content": "Chapter Seven I woke disoriented. And with Clay’s arms curled around me, his strong body nestled behind mine. I would have given anything to forget it was him, pretend he was someone else—not Griffin—but a faceless, nameless body that I could burrow into and lose myself for a few more hours of ignorant bliss. But awake, I couldn’t pretend that his arms didn’t feel just a little too good, or that his body didn’t fit a little too perfectly. Somewhere during the night he’d ditched his shirt and his bare skin against my exposed arms made me feel things I wasn’t ready to explore. I needed to shut that down immediately. We were partners, and I couldn’t let the lines between us blur into something confusing. After he’d kissed me, he’d tugged me down to the bed and exhaustion had overcome us both. He’d pulled the covers over our sagging bodies and held me. I’d let him, believing that it was more for him than for me, knowing it was a lie but choosing to surrender because I’d wanted it. For a handful of seconds, I’d voiced the need to train, but he’d shushed me and massaged the tension knots in my neck until I’d fallen asleep. I’d only managed a few hours of sleep, but I couldn’t stay. I slipped out of his arms and showered quickly, not wanting him to come looking for me while I was wet and naked. While he snored—lost in his sleep of the dead—I dressed, armed myself with an arsenal of knives and one gun, then pulled open the laptop that had been stored beneath the weapons. I wouldn’t be able to access the other mainframes—they kept each other locked out pretty good, at least beyond my own capabilities—but if there was anything to be found on Clay’s guy, the CIA would have enough to get us started until I could access the others. The art and relics that he’d stolen for that buyer would start the web and I could follow the trail inward from there. Thieves didn’t operate in a vacuum. Their paths always crossed into drugs, or money laundering, or some operation that the CIA needed to infiltrate. Especially a guy like Clay’s buyer, working with the high-end pieces he’d asked Clay to get. Azazel might be able to escape the CIA’s notice, but he was using regular men who were susceptible to surveillance, and that worked in my favor. All I needed was a single strand to get me going. The last painting we fenced was obviously a dead end, but maybe some of the original pieces preceded Azazel’s involvement. Those might be regular heists that weren’t tainted by Dr. Death. My fingers flew across the keyboard and I followed lead after lead, scratching out details on a notepad. This guy had sent Clay all over the world looking for relics. And he’d had other thieves picking up pieces for him too. I traced them all, not knowing where they’d intersect. One tiny detail that I overlooked now might be the key to unraveling this thing. The hair at my nape prickled and I froze, pen hovering above the notepad. I listened, not sure what had pulled me out of my zone, but I trusted the feeling. I stood, closed the laptop, and hurriedly tucked everything into the bag. I picked up a handgun from the remaining weapons. “Clay,” I whispered. “Huh?” He sat up groggily, the sheets and comforter falling away from his bare chest. “We have company.” I eased toward the window, peeking out the blinds. Impressively, he flew into action, pulling on a shirt and boots. Thank god I’d already gotten dressed. He walked over to me and checked outside. “What’s going on?” I shook my head, but didn’t dare look away. “Not sure. Something set me off. I think we need to go.” “I’ll follow you.” I handed him the gun. “Take this.” He grimaced, but stuck it in the holster I’d made him start wearing in the small of his back. Today we were picking up more weapons for him and I wanted him in a double shoulder holster too. These guys played for keeps. And I’ll be damned if I was going to let them get my partner.",

      "content": "Chapter Eight Now that we were being forced out of the hotel with too many hours before we could leave, I needed a place where we could hide out, and if we could train, too, that would be ideal. Nothing moved in the bright afternoon light but that didn’t mean they weren’t closing in on us. I’d doubted my intuition too many times over the last couple months and I’d promised to get back to trusting it. Today was the ultimate test since I hadn’t seen or heard anything to back up the feeling that had yanked me out of my research. The motel opened onto the parking lot and the Rover sat four feet to the left of the door. I hated walking out that way, but it was our only choice. Maybe if they thought that they still had the drop on us, we could get to the car and… “Fuck.” I had no reason to suspect otherwise, but I knew they’d rigged the truck. Clay pressed into me, peering out the small crack in the blinds above my head. “What?” His body tensed against mine and I could hear the worry in his voice. “We can’t take the truck.” I quickly scanned the parking lot. They might still be waiting for confirmation, needing to take it back to the boss that we’d successfully been eliminated. I had to assume we had eyes on us. “How fast can you hotwire a car?” I asked, knowing instinctively that he held the ability in his arsenal of thievery. “Never timed myself. Probably less than a minute.” “I need you to do it in ten seconds.” “Okay.” He didn’t sell it with a lot of confidence, but I knew he’d rise to the occasion. If nothing else, he was a professional and I knew his fear would fall away once we got moving. Standing here, wavering, only had him thinking. “Grab the bag.” He slung it over his shoulder and followed me into the bathroom. I wedged my feet against the rusty old window and busted the hinge loose from several coats of paint. He helped me slide it open. “The second you hit the ground, I want your arm around me and we’re the most-in-love couple anyone’s ever seen. Got it?” He grinned. “Yep!” I scrambled through the door and hit the sidewalk below, thankful that we’d ended up in the wrong room and not one on an upper floor. He landed behind me and his arm went around my shoulders and I curled into him, hiding my face. The people after us were looking for a two-man team, not a couple. Again, the difference was minute, but it mattered. I led him away from the truck and quickly through the courtyard of the dilapidated hotel, dodging benches and crumbling ashtrays. On the far side, I headed straight for an older, beige Honda Accord. Clay quickly jimmied the door and I scrambled inside, weapon drawn and scanning every shadow surrounding us. The engine fired and he pulled out of the parking lot. “Which way?” “Right. Get us as far as you can, then we’ll make a plan.” At the end of the block, I saw the first inconsistency move along the bright face of a neighboring storefront. “Shit! Gun it! And go left. Left!” He jammed his foot to the floor and the peppy car shot forward, startling the man hidden in the underbelly of a tall hedge that bordered the store. I didn’t want to shoot him, not out here in plain sight in the middle of the day, but leaving him alive was incredibly stupid and not a risk we could afford anymore. The little car’s wheels squealed as he cranked to the left and down a tight alley. The suspension shuddered as we hit a pothole. I whipped around and watched nervously as the man ran across the street chasing us, skirting parked cars and trash cans. I didn’t recognize him as the sunlight blinded me as we raced through the mottled light between buildings. His attack was all the recognition I needed. I twisted the other way, bending between the seats so I could get a better shot and sighted in on his forehead. “Go, go, go,” I shouted. “Where? Shit, this doesn’t go anywhere.” “Did you just head us down a dead end?” I couldn’t turn around and look. My heart pounded in my ears and my arms trembled. “I got this!” he shouted. “Settle down, settle down.” Clay was talking more to himself than to me but I had to trust him and his decisions. Do I take this guy out? I groaned. Leave a body in the middle of a street? Dammit. I did not want to do that. This was a worst-case scenario. If Clay could get us out of here… Fuck. That wasn’t true. No matter where he drove us, these guys would follow. They’d found us in the hotel and I’d never had that happen before. We were being chased by the best and I couldn’t leave one alive. Goddammit! I sighted again and took the shot, dropping our pursuer beside a dumpster. “Dammit.” I hated doing that but one alive was one who could keep coming after us. Azazel would send more, but at least for tonight, we’d lost our immediate tail. That didn’t mean there weren’t more. We’d have to stay vigilant. Clay skidded around a corner to the right, shooting us out into a busy roadway, nearly missing a truck and trailer. I searched the landscape to orient us, spotting the top of a building I knew. “Take your next left. Head toward the highway, then go south.” “Okay.” Clay checked all the mirrors, his fingers tight around the steering wheel. I holstered the gun and slumped in the seat, then put my seatbelt on. “We’re going to need to ditch the car. That bullet hole in the back window paints a little too much of an obvious target on us.” Clay’s eyes widened. “Did you kill him?” I clenched my teeth and nodded. I felt sick about it, even though technically it was self-defense. My gray line was shrinking and starting to blur and I didn’t like it. I’d had guys on my tail before and I’d chosen to outrun them because they weren’t part of the hit. Usually once I was out of their sight I was no longer a threat and they didn’t know how to find me. This time was different. This time they knew exactly where to find me. And out of sight was only going to make them more aggressive about hunting me. Hunting us. This was one enemy I couldn’t outrun. I didn’t know if our attacker tonight had been part of Clay’s buyer’s team or Azazel’s, but they were becoming impossible to tell apart. At the end of the day, everyone trying to kill us worked for Azazel.",

      "title": "Chapter 11",
      "content": "Chapter Nine We drove through neighborhoods and bustling industrial sections, quietly absorbed in our own thoughts. Mine skipped between what happened between Clay and I and killing that man. My comments were limited to directions as I guided Clay toward a MI6 training center. Along the way we traded the Accord for a blue Kia at a gas station, but even that had happened with a minimum of interaction between us. I’d thought about asking him what he was thinking about but couldn’t bring myself to draw him into either of my conversations. For variety, I thought about the facility and what training I wanted to put Clay through. There was a gun range and several side rooms with equipment and mats so we could work on throwing and hand-combat. I hadn’t been there in over four years, but it couldn’t have changed too much and I was fairly certain that they wouldn’t have gotten rid of it. One of the facilities best features was how well hidden it was. And as far as I knew it was the only one of its kind in the UK. The anonymity paired with the level of weaponry and security appealed to me a great deal right now. We needed all those things. I squinted at the mile marker and tried to remember the back way so we could avoid any questions at the main gate. I was nearly positive that my security code still worked and we wouldn’t have any issues using the back entrance. “Take the next exit.” Clay made a face. “Are you sure this is an exit?” “Trust me.” He did and we got off the highway, having lost our tail for good back in town. I was a little surprised that Azazel hadn’t sent more than one man after us. That was twice now that he’d underestimated us. I didn’t imagine we’d have that luxury again, which was a lot of the reason that Clay needed to get lethal. The pavement quickly switched to dirt and Clay gave me a hesitant glance but kept driving. I didn’t remember the road being dirt, but it had been so long that it certainly could have been. After fifteen minutes, I started to think I’d gotten it wrong and just as I was about to tell Clay to turn around, we crested a short hill to find a tall chain-link fence and a security reader. He slowed and I scanned the horizon, but there wasn’t anyone visibly watching this gate even though I knew we were still on surveillance somewhere on the property. He rolled down the window and I leaned across, punching in my code. I sat back in my chair and waited. Every second felt like a minute until the gate finally swung open. “What is this place?” “It’s an underground training facility that the NSA and FBI both have access to. I haven’t been here for almost five years. Not only will we be safe, but you’ll be able to do some target practice while I keep researching the databases to see what I can find on your buyer. Take a left up here at the fork.” This would give me more intel than what I’d been able to find through the CIA, and hopefully things would start intersecting more than they had. The road bent around a hill and the abundance of trees thickened until we were nearly driving through a forest. A small blue-and-white shed recessed in the trees was the only indication of life. “Pull past it and park on the right hand side.” I pointed. “Are we the only ones here?” “Probably not, but everyone else uses the front entrance.” He looked around, studying the landscape and absence of life, then parked the Kia and killed the engine, then twisted in his chair. “What kind of security clearance do you have, anyway?” I shrugged. “Whatever I need, mostly.” He blinked, not expecting that answer. “That’s pretty impressive.” “I guess.” I got out and grabbed the bag of weapons, slinging it over my shoulder. I headed toward the shed. “It’s only impressive the first time, then you realize most everyone gets that kind of clearance. At least the ones in my line of business.” He slammed the driver-side door and jogged to catch up to me. “I’d think they’d keep assassins on a tighter leash.” I laughed and entered another code into a hidden keypad on the side of the shed. “Nah. They’d rather pretend we don’t exist. If we’re always asking for clearance for the things we need, then someone has to pay attention. Easier to give us carte blanche and hope we don’t screw too much up.” He grunted. The door slid open on silent hinges and I stepped inside, glancing around to see if anything had changed in the years while I’d been away. The cavernous entry of smooth concrete was dull as ever, not showing a single sign of upgrade or wear. It was definitely still being used because it was clean and there weren’t any obvious signs of disuse like cobwebs up in the corners or the dusky smell of unused spaces. I started toward the back stairs that led down to the training rooms. Clay grabbed my arm and pulled me to a stop. “You’re sure this isn’t a trap?” I frowned and looked up and down the wide hallway. “No. Not from this end.” I elbowed him in the ribs, desperate to lighten the tension. “But I’m glad you’re at least starting to think about your six a little.” “Yeah, well, getting chased down and shot at made that a little higher on my priority list.” “Maybe if you’d have listened to me before the first shooting you wouldn’t have had to learn it that way.” “Whatever.” He let go of my arm and I moved us deeper into the facility. The hallway ended at a set of industrial, open-tread stairs leading down four stories. I hesitated, but only for a second. Clay’s warning was warranted but I had to trust something and so far, no one on my end had been compromised. That didn’t mean that they wouldn’t be, or truly that they hadn’t, only that we hadn’t been exposed to them yet. If Azazel was limited to corrupting people who had vendettas against us, there weren’t enough people in MI6 who even knew I existed, let alone any who hated me. I did their dirty work, so eliminating me didn’t serve them. Yes, like I’d told Clay, there were other people who could do their dirty work, but not many who took on the jobs I did. Clay had pissed people off and I assumed that anger, fear, and revenge were probably the easiest emotions to manipulate. If the ultimate goal was to take someone out, it wouldn’t be hard to turn an emotion like fear into an unchecked hatred. If Clay’s buyer had been pissed about me getting the relic, he would have been prime breeding ground for Azazel to add in even the tiniest amount of bitterness that could fester into a need to take Clay out. I’d already seen the proof that Clay’s buyer used other thieves, so it wasn’t like he needed Clay to do all his dirty work. Clay might be the best, but two crappy thieves were better than one great one that you couldn’t trust to either do the work. Or not flip sides like Clay had. I still wanted to do more research into Clay’s buyer. At the bottom of the final flight of stairs, a trio of big, steel, soundproof doors opened into the separate training areas. “We want this one” I pointed toward the one at the far end that led to the firing range. I punched in the code and opened the door for Clay. “I’m going to grab a couple other weapons,” I said, walking away and stopping at the first door that we’d passed. I entered the code for that door, a little surprised that they all still worked. They really did trust me with everything. But what I’d told Clay was true and I’d learned it early on—if you’re going to hire someone to do your dirty work, it’s easier to let them do their own thing instead of having to know what they’re doing and be accountable. I pulled the heavy door open and couldn’t help but grin at the arsenal on the other side. Sniper rifles, shotguns, handguns, automatic rifles. Even a surface-to-air rocket launcher. It was an impressive gluttony of the finest weaponry available. I thought about Clay—his style, his habits, and how all of those would play into a weapon he’d feel comfortable using without hesitation. Funny how silly things like that were factors but I knew he didn’t feel comfortable with my weapons and there was no point in making him fire them today. I wanted to find something that would become a natural extension of his body, something that wouldn’t feel foreign. I walked the room again, skipping over the SIG Sauers, Berettas, and Glocks, and settled on a pistol-grip Mossberg shotgun and a Colt .45 pistol, thinking that both would appeal to Clay’s sense of machismo with the nod to Jesse James. It might take us a couple times and adjustments to figure out what he preferred, but this would be a good start. I grabbed a box of ammo for my own weapons along with a box for him, and headed into the training room. His eyebrows rose as I handed him both guns. “Wow. Where’d you get these?” I jerked my thumb over my shoulder and pointed toward the other room. “Candy store down the hall.” He smiled. “You’re a fascinating woman, I’ll give you that.” “Thanks, I think.” I set the weapons on one of the low counters and grabbed ear protection off the wall rack and tossed him a pair of blue ones. “Safety first.”",

      "content": "Chapter Ten Clay grinned, weapon in each hand. “Now what?” I pointed toward the targets hanging at the other end of the range. “Now you learn how to get good.” “I’m a decent shot.” I had yet to see him handle a weapon with any sort of confidence, so as much as I wanted to believe him, we had a lot of work to do. “Decent isn’t going to cut it anymore. We’re going to see more of what we did tonight. People are going to be coming after us with deadly intent. You have to be able to take them out.” “I didn’t need to tonight.” “You can’t count on me to be there.” I put ear protectors on and turned him toward the first target, taking the shotgun away from him and nudging the arm with the pistol. He scowled and his features hardened. “What are you saying? You’re going to teach me how to shoot, and then you’re ditching me to fend for myself now that I’m a liability?” “No. Of course not. But what if something happens to me? What if they shoot me first and injure me and you’re all that stands between us and death?” He shook his head and stared at the target. “That’s not going to happen.” “I need to know that you can protect yourself.” “Done a fine job so far,” he huffed. I patted his arm. “You have. Now let’s make you better. They’ll never expect it.” He lifted his weapon and aimed at the target. I stepped behind him and watched his posture, his breathing, his aim. This first shot was going to go wildly off target, but I wanted him to see that before I made suggestions and adjustments. Some people are naturals when it came to handling weapons and Clay’s skill lay elsewhere, but I could at least make him more accurate. Weapons would never be his first line of defense, but when you’re as stealthy as a shadow, you don’t have to be a fighter. And that had served him well. Until now. I felt bad that I’d brought this on him. They’d been watching him for a long time, well before we met, but that didn’t mean that I wasn’t to blame. Azazel knew that I’d come to rely on Clay, that we’d become each other’s liabilities and I was grateful that we’d become allies before they’d been able to either turn him against me or kill him. Now we had a chance of keeping him alive and I was going to do whatever it took to keep him that way. He squeezed the trigger, missing the target. “Man, I’m not used to this one.” “That’s okay,” I yelled so he could hear me through the headgear. “First few are always to get used to the weapon. Slow your breathing and concentrate. Don’t hold your breath when you fire, just pause when you sight and pull the trigger.” He fired the remaining shots in the gun, managing to hit the target with the last two. “Getting better.” I pushed the button to retrieve the target and swap it out while he reloaded. “Wait.” I let the paper flutter halfway to us and grabbed a couple bullets. “You have to be fast at this too. They’re not going to give you a chance to reload. That’s when they’re going to double their efforts to take you out.” His fingers trembled as he loaded them and I covered them with mine, pulling him to face me. “What’s wrong?” He looked away. “Nothing. Just nerves.” I shook my head. “What’s going on?” “Nothing.” “Why do you hate guns so much?” “I never said that, I’m just not as experienced as you are.” He pulled his fingers away and jammed the remaining bullets in the gun. “No one is as capable as you.” “Clay?” I grabbed his shirt and tugged him back toward me. “What’s going on?” This wasn’t about his inability or inexperience. This was something deeper. If it was about what a lousy shot he was—and who wasn’t the first hundred targets—he’d be joking and laughing and his usual self-deprecating-comedian self. “Talk to me.” The muscle in his jaw clenched and he stared at the concrete wall over my head. I took the weapon from him and set it on the firing shelf in front of us, then stepped closer and put both palms flat on his chest. “Clay, I’m here. Talk to me.” He squeezed his eyes shut and tipped his chin up like he was trying to keep from drowning in the powerful emotions and memories. His arms hung limp at his sides, fingers clenched into tight fists. I’d never seen him like this and it made my heart hurt as it recognized grief and pain. “I had a brother,” he said. “Jeremy. He was two years younger than me.” He swallowed but still didn’t look at me, didn’t open his eyes. Beneath my fingers, his heart raced. “We were typical boys, into a lot of stupid shit and we gave my mom hell, always starting trouble. I was supposed to do a better job of setting an example.” He looked at me and the sorrow in his eyes startled me, but I didn’t say anything, knowing all too well the need to purge once the emotion starts flowing. He didn’t need my comfort right now, only a pair of ears to listen and for once, I could give him what he needed. “I wanted to. I wanted to be the great role model, the perfect older brother for him to look up to and emulate. I just always thought I’d have time to get my shit together.” He shook his head sadly. “My senior year of high school—his sophomore year—we went to a party. Some stupid drinkfest that didn’t matter, that was no different than the dozens we’d gone to that month … but I wish we hadn’t.” His voice lowered to a near whisper. “I wish we’d have stayed home that night to work on the chores Mom had asked us to do.” He laughed. “I remember being so pissed about it that night when she’d rattled off her list of things, the lawn, changing light bulbs, loading the dishwasher … stupid shit that I didn’t have time for.” His fingers curled around my elbows, anchoring him to the present as he swam in the dread of the past. “I drove, knowing that Jeremy would have to bring us home, but he was cool with it. He was always cool with it. If he was hanging with me, he didn’t care what we were doing or where we were going, he was down for anything.” “Sounds like a good kid.” His fingers tightened on my arms. “He was.” His voice tightened and he worked to get the words out, swallowing hard again. “He was.” I wasn’t sure how all of this connected to what we were doing down here in the firing range, but a dread welled up in me as we neared the climax of his story. On a subconscious level, I knew that Clay hadn’t become a thief because everything had been great at home and growing up. As someone who’d experienced the turmoil of a tough life, I didn’t want anyone else to live it, let alone someone that I was coming to care about. Part of me didn’t want him to finish the story so I could continue to imagine him having a fun, laughing childhood, not the pain and horror he was about to reveal. “What happened that night?” I asked. “It was the cliché high-school tragedy. Half a dozen guys from a neighboring school showed up at the party. There was too much beer, followed by an altercation about a girl, and a fight broke out. I was too busy getting wasted and telling stories to pay much attention to what was going on, but Jeremy…” He swallowed and looked away to gather himself, then brought his attention back to me. “Jeremy was always trying to keep the peace. Everywhere he went, he was the mediator, always trying to get everyone to get along. He hated confrontation.” My fingers slid down his chest and I linked them loosely behind his back, keeping a small circle of safety between our bodies, but afraid to let him go. “One of the guys had brought a gun.” I winced. Holy shit. No wonder he hated them. “Jeremy made a move, jumped in the middle of the fight, and the gun went off. There were a couple injuries, but his were fatal.” He pulled out of my arms and walked to the wall, lifting his arms and collapsing against it, fists still curled into tight balls of rage where they rested above his head. “I didn’t even know what was going on until the ambulance arrived. I barely pushed through the crowd to see him before they loaded him. They wouldn’t let me ride with him to the hospital. Said I was too drunk.” I turned and walked to him, settling my hand softly in the small of his back and rubbing slow circles. His breath came fast and heavy but I knew he wasn’t ready to put this to bed yet, so I didn’t insult him by placating him with apologies for his suffering, not about to be a raging hypocrite and offering the thing I’d hated the most when my grief for Griffin threatened to suffocate me. People and their I’m sorrys were hell to endure. He hit the wall with the meat of his hands, then straightened, pulling me to him. I let him, knowing it was out of a need to be close to someone, not necessarily me. His hands curled in my hair at the base of my neck and he pressed his cheek to the top of my head. I hooked my thumbs through his belt loops, letting my hands curl gently against the rise of his pockets. He sighed heavily, stirring my hair. “He died a week later, but he never came out of the coma. I never got to apologize, never got to tell him that I regretted it, us going that night. He died thinking I’d abandoned him at that party, that getting wasted was more important than he was that night.” My own regret mirrored his, squeezing my chest and constricting my heartbeat. There was no greater pain that knowing a loved one died with your name on their lips, wondering where you were and why you’d left them alone. Clay had beaten himself with the regret for years, and I still had that time and agony ahead of me. But I understood. And I also knew that there was nothing I could tell him that would lessen his guilt. I’d searched my own soul for the words that would have erased mine, and other than Griffin standing in front of me and telling me that it was okay, there was nothing anyone on this side of heaven could say that made the guilt ease even a fraction. “I know,” I whispered, offering up the only paltry thing I could. “Griffin knew you loved him.” I shook my head, my cheek rubbing against his shirt. “Maybe before that night. But run to ground, bleeding, dying, tortured…” My throat tightened, cutting off my air. I swallowed. “I’m pretty sure he condemned me to the lowest depths of hell as they finished him off.” His fingers tightened on my neck. “No,” he whispered. “No. His last thought was of you.” He lifted my face, cradling it between both of his hands and searching my features. “Mine would be.” I wasn’t sure how we’d flipped to him comforting me, but I needed the balm. Needed to hear his words now that I’d exposed my own pain in trying to help him deal with his. He brushed his lips against mine, then tucked my head down against his chest again, his strong arms wrapped around me. “Mine would.” The whispered words echoed off the concrete walls, then hung in the air. Somewhere outside, men were hunting us, coming for us, bent on eliminating us for the sake of a holy war. But again, we’d managed to carve out a slice of solace, and I clung to it. Griffin lived with a slow-burning simmer, keeping his emotions tightly in check, nothing ever out of place. He’d learned it from his mother and since I lived bold enough for both of us (even if he hadn’t known it) I’d always felt like he was the perfect other half of me, the calm to my storm, the quiet springtime to my raging winter. Clay’s deep running grief and pain of a childhood torn by tragedy gave us a way to relate on a level at which Griffin hadn’t ever been able to reach me. A missing connection that I’d been oblivious to until this moment. Clay hid behind his laugher and goofball antics, but his depth hadn’t been easy to conceal, even without the details he’d just shared with me. He was loud and obnoxious and free, dancing along the cliff edge with everything he did. Whether it was his job, his truck, or the way he gave danger the bird on a regular basis. I’d connected with that because we’d met on the cliff face, and I’d recognized myself in him—though it was only becoming clear to me now. The power of the revelation made me step away and I scrambled for a place to settle. As was becoming both his right and contribution to our relationship, Clay stepped up to the plate and hit the slow, curving ball I needed. He smiled with a shrug of his shoulder, letting the normal Clay resurface and putting us back into our comfort zone. “Sucks that you got stuck with a pussy of a partner. I’d ask for an upgrade.” I chuckled, letting him lighten the mood and return us to our easy friendship. We still had work to do, but the bond between us was stronger now than it had ever been. As was my commitment to keep him alive. “How do you feel about knives?”",

      "content": "Chapter Eleven He picked up the Mossberg and aimed it toward the target. “How about this one?” “It would be easier to make you accurate. There’s basically zero training with it.” I walked over and pushed the target button, sending it to the far end of the range. “You’ll be deadly at close range, but not far. Shoot one from this distance and tell me how it feels.” He nodded. “Put your ear protection on, though.” I put mine over my head, muffling everything. He checked in with me. “Ready?” I nodded. He fired the weapon and as I expected, the shot didn’t make it all the way to the target. I moved it in halfway. He settled into his stance and pulled the trigger. Again, the target remained untouched. It was going to take a whole lot of practice for him to be accurate at that range, but we didn’t need him taking out targets at distance. I moved it closer. “You can’t miss from here.” He unloaded the remaining rounds, leaving nothing but a strand of the target. I pulled it in so I could change it out for a new one and glanced at him. He grinned and lowered the barrel. “I like it.” “Yeah.” I laughed. “I’ll bet. I like it too and I feel better with you having one that works for you. It’s not ideal, but with the shotgun, you’ll at least have a weapon. But, remember that it’s going to spray wide, so you’re going to take out everything in front of you. Let me show you.” I switched our two targets down to a triple hanger—three targets in a line—that would effectively show him the spray. I set it at the same distance away and showed him how to load the shotgun quickly. “Ready?” he asked, a ghost of a smile on his lips. I nodded and stepped behind him so I could watch the nuances of his style. He spread his feet, bent his knees, and rocked his hips forward. This time he kept the shotgun at waist level and rattled off five shots in quick succession. Again, the target disintegrated in front of him, leaving a blistering hole three feet in diameter. I pointed at the button to recall the target. “Swap your own out this time.” We repeated the process twenty times until I felt comfortable that he could load and chamber the weapon as fast as I could and his accuracy was as good as it was going to be today. “How do you feel about that?” He set the weapon on the table and took his earmuffs off. “Good. I think. I mean, you would know better than I would, but I’m definitely better.” I nodded. “Agree.” “Okay, what’s next? We load these bitches up and hit the streets, armed and dangerous?” I laughed. “Um, not quite. I still think there’s value in hand-to-hand and knife skills.” He made a face. “I guess.” Intent on catching him off guard, I punched him in the gut and tripped him, sending him sprawling backward onto his ass. He swept my feet, grabbing my left one and yanking me down beside him. With a quick twist, he pinned me with his body and I wasn’t fast enough to slip the hold. He yanked both of my arms high above my head and spanned my chest with my other hand. I stared, surprised and okay, a little impressed. “At least you’ve practiced something.” Warmth rose from his handprint pressed across my cleavage and I didn’t budge. I could get out but only by breaking one of his bones, and he was too valuable. Besides, a little confidence couldn’t hurt him. He’d gained a lot during the last bit of shooting after purging the pain of his brother, and I needed his cocky self firmly in place when we left here. He covered my hips with his thighs, and rocked up so he towered over me. “I said I didn’t need to practice this.” “Yeah, good for you, you can pin a girl.” He laughed. “You’re so far from a girl it’s not even funny.” That stung, especially since he had proof of my girliness half an inch from his thumb. He pressed down on my chest, compressing my lungs. “You’ve proved your point,” I wheezed. “No. I don’t think I have. You’ve tortured me over this for weeks. I want you to admit that I’m better than you are.” I frowned. What was this about? He clearly had been practicing since we’d fought and wrestled last. If I didn’t know better, I’d think that it really had bugged him that I’d been so much better at this than he had been. “You’re the one on top, so you’re clearly better.” “That’s not what I want from you.” He slid his hand up and over my collarbone, across my shoulder and took one wrist in each of his hands. His face hovered over mine. “What do you want from me?” “I want you to admit that you need me.” I huffed. He was starting to push it. I could still break away and was giving him the chance to tally the win, but he was about to make me prove it. I sure wasn’t about to gush about this single time that he’d managed to pin me. “I’ve already told you that. You’re the reason we have the pieces we do.” He shook his head. “No. I want you to need me like I need you.” Oh. I stilled beneath him and quit squirming. “What are you saying?” His gaze roamed my face, touching my eyes, my cheeks, my lips. “I’ve never told anyone about my brother, Lina. I’ve told you secrets that I buried long ago. I’m not in this to steal a piece anymore.” He grinned and shifted his hips, nestling obvious parts of him against me. “I mean, maybe a piece.” I groaned. “Sorry.” He grew serious again. “I can’t be serious for too long.” He glanced away quickly, then back. “It hurts.” I understood that better than I wanted to. Living and working alone kept me from having to deal with people and that had become my defense mechanism where Clay used humor. My heart pinched at the longing in his voice, recognizing the suffering. I was already physically attracted to him, and his emotional appeal was growing at an alarming pace. “What do you want, Clay?” I asked softly.",

      "content": "Chapter Twelve The chirp of someone disarming the alarm code shot me into action. I rolled out from under Clay and he jumped up, racing toward the weapons where he’d set them. I held out a hand to hold him, then curled it in a fist. “Stay,” I mouthed. I reached behind me and curled my fingers around the butt of my pistol and flicked off the safety. If we were about to get in a gunfight, I was the one who needed to do the shooting in these tight quarters. The door swung open and I blinked. “Holy fuck,” Clay said behind me. “Clarissa?” The blonde that he’d been kissing in front of the deli strode confidently into the room, hand outstretched toward me in greeting. “Lina,” she said warmly. She wore a black skirt suit and black heels, very agentish of her. “Nice to finally put a face to the name. I’m Agent Richards.” I took her hand and shook it, dumbstruck that this was Agent Richards. We’d done over a dozen missions together and Richards was one of my top priorities and it had never, not even once, occurred to me that she was a woman. Like Clay and his buyer, I’d handled all my correspondence with this agent over the secured lines and I’d just assumed… Christ. She walked to Clay and laid her hands on his chest. “Good to see you again,” she purred. What in the fuck was going on? My head spun and I needed to get her talking and figure out why she’d come down here. Mere coincidence that she was at the only training facility in London that we’d just happened to pick after being ambushed, all after she’d been in New York yesterday with her tongue down Clay’s throat? I stared at him, eyes narrowing. He looked at me over her head and shrugged. “We didn’t get around to talking business.” “Yeah,” I huffed. “I’ll bet.” A thousand emotions swirled inside me, but I could not get conflicted about our relationship-not-a-relationship right now. “So, Richards, fancy meeting you here.” I withdrew my hand from the weapon, but left the safety off. She turned away from Clay and stopped halfway, which pissed me off that I’d let her get between us. “I’m on my way to Germany, stopped in for a little training and a new Beretta. Imagine my surprise when I saw you on the monitors when I checked in.” Surprise, my ass. Killing her inside a registered facility was going to bring my carefully constructed world down on my head. If we got out of here alive. I had no illusions that she was here on government business, or that she hadn’t tailed us since supposedly leaving in a cab. Hell, she’d probably circled the block and watched our every move. I’d been too caught up in my own feelings to spot her. Dammit, I was going to get us killed. But I’d like today to not be that day. I ignored Clay and focused on Clarissa. I hated that name, hated everything about her. She’d deceived me for who knew how long. I thought about the missions we’d done together—all for Azazel? “Who’s in Germany?” “No one you know.” She flipped her hair back and took another step toward me, her focus leaving Clay as well. Out of my periphery, I saw him edge closer to the pistol. I didn’t like whatever he was thinking, but I couldn’t let her know that he was on the move. I needed to keep her distracted. “How long have you worked with Azazel?” “Since the beginning.” Not even a flicker of surprise that I knew, not even an attempt to cover it up. Now I knew that she’d come down here to kill us. “No more job offers from him?” Not that there was the slimmest chance that I’d take it, but I was curious to know why he’d flipped from one side to the other extreme. She shook her head. “No. He’s not one to beg. He offered once, and you’ve shunned him since. Taking out his man earlier did not please him. We’re not so easy to come by, people willing to make a deal with the Angel of Death. You’d be surprised at what a person has to endure before they get to that point in their life.” Her candied red lips were at odds with her words. I laughed. “Endure.” I looked her up and down, from her five-hundred-dollar shoes to her expensive blowout. “You don’t even know the meaning of the word. You didn’t seek him out because you were at your wit’s end. You sought him out for power.” She shrugged and examined her perfect manicure. “Endurance is not limited only to suffering. I’ve expected things out of my life and my skills. Azazel agreed to help me. No matter the definition of suffering, it’s still a drastic measure and not one many are willing to take.” “For obvious reasons.” I couldn’t believe that she’d willingly sought him out. Especially after all the work we’d done together, all the time she put into climbing the ladder and checking off boxes. My frustration at her willingness to give up mingled with my annoyance that she’d be another person I’d have to kill. “You’re a fool. Do you really think that he’s going to come through on whatever he promised you?” Clarissa’s future aside, I couldn’t help being impressed at the lengths Azazel was willing to go to entrap us. He’d used her beauty against Clay and my own work ethic against me. I’d worked so hard for her. He’d bested both of us and we hadn’t even known it. But I wasn’t going to let him win. “Since we’re not going to live through this, why don’t you tell me who’s in Germany?” She laughed. “Figured that bit out, did you?” Her hand slipped inside her jacket. I curled my fingers around a knife hilt holstered to my upper thigh, not daring to let my gaze flicker to Clay as he flexed his leg muscles. I didn’t know what he had planned, but I needed to take her out before he got any bright ideas. We all moved at once. Her arm flew from her jacket, gun pointed at me. I threw the knife. Clay leapt forward, leg outstretched in a wide sweeping arc.",

      "content": "Chapter Thirteen And so we stayed. Took me a second to figure out that her bullet was frozen at the tip of her gun and it wasn’t just my life flashing before my eyes that had slowed everything down. I spun to find Metatron leaning in the doorway. “Hi,” he said flippantly, like we were crossing paths at a bakery. My mouth opened and closed, Clay hit the ground, sliding sideways on his hip and missing Clarissa’s ankle by a millimeter. “What the—oh, shit!” He scrambled to his feet and stared at Clarissa, frozen in mid-shot, then rushed over, wrapped an arm around my shoulders and tried to haul me toward the door. “We have to go. Thanks, man.” He reached over to pat Metatron’s shoulder, then thought better of it and dropped his arm. I shook my head and pulled Clay to a stop, unconcerned about fleeing now that Metatron had bothered to show up and save our lives. For once. “Where the hell have you been? We’ve almost been killed twice tonight.” Metatron inclined his head and pushed away from the jamb, stepping fully into the room. “Evangeline, Evangeline. I thought I was quite clear about your next step, and yet here you are, too far away from Greece than I’d prefer.” “And let her gun us down there?” I was fuming and could barely form coherent sentences. Every bit of my training vanished in a wave of fury. “You let me get completely blindsided by this. How am I supposed to do my job if you keep leaving out details like her?” I shouted and slammed the butt of my hand into her forehead. She rocked back slowly, like she was stuck in tar, then bobbed back, not a hair out of place. “I’m bound—” “Shut up about that,” I yelled, more frustrated with myself than at him. I’d trusted him to be a thorough member of this team, keeping me apprised of threats before they showed up so I had a chance to prepare. That’s how a good intel team worked, not like his bullshit methods and I was damn tired of it. I needed him pulling his weight or staying the hell out of it. I was done counting on him, and my anger at the situation, him, and myself bubbled over. “I don’t give a crap about your covenants.” He didn’t say anything and I was grateful for the training that had kept us alive tonight. My mom hadn’t been so lucky. Metatron hadn’t given her a fighting chance and if he’d have come to me with this mantle prior to Malcolm’s involvement in my life, I’d been the same sitting duck she had been. But I couldn’t see my mom being a docile little doe once Metatron’s involvement and the relics had put me and my dad in danger. She’d have been downright pissed—and I remembered a few times when she’d been scared straight mad and hadn’t been able to tell me why. I narrowed my eyes. “You and my mother had this exact conversation, didn’t you?” I got right in his face. “Didn’t you?” He nodded. I slapped him. Hard. His skin felt surprisingly human. I trembled with the rage and hurt of what he’d done. What he’d let happen. What he was willing to let happen again because of some deal God had made not to interfere. “Fuck your covenant.” I grabbed my knife from where it hung suspended in the air, six inches from Clarissa’s forehead—a perfect kill shot, but I wasn’t going to leave evidence here, though it lay all over the surveillance tapes. Clay scooped up the guns and our equipment, and we marched from the room and up the stairs without another word. Metatron had better keep her frozen until we were off the property or I was going to do a lot more than slap him the next time I saw him. I didn’t care why he’d come—he’d bought us time and I didn’t want anything else from him tonight. If he had something to tell us, he could damn well find us again. Clay slammed through the shed door and we ran like fleeing murderers to the car. We scrambled inside and Clay finally vented his own frustration. “Not a trap, you said!” He slapped the steering wheel, pushing the Kia as hard as it would go toward the gate. My head spun. We’d be lucky if we got off the facility now. Everything that had gone down before Metatron froze the scene had probably been watched by no less than a dozen agents. They were on their way to intercept us. When we punched out of the forest and onto the main road toward the gate, they’d be waiting for us. “I know. I’m sorry. I thought—” It didn’t matter anymore. And I wasn’t going to bring up the fact that he’d missed seeing her for the trap she was too. Right now, we had to figure out how to get off this property and I doubted that Metatron would help me out more than he already had. Especially after I slapped him and stormed out. I was lucky that he hadn’t already unfrozen her. I glanced back at the shed but Clarissa hadn’t followed. Yet. “How long do we have?” “None. I’m sure we have none. They’d have headed toward the back entrance the moment she came in and shit got ugly, so they’re probably already at the gate, even if Metatron still has everything frozen, they’ll have roadblocks.” I unholstered my weapon and racked the Mossberg. “Keep driving. No matter what’s at the gate, just keep driving.” Clay swore beneath his breath and jammed his foot to the floor, sending the little Kia airborne over the last rise before the gate. I wasn’t prepared for the sight on the other side, stark against the day’s gloaming.",

      "content": "Chapter Fourteen Nothing. He slowed at the gate and we waited every agonizing second as it opened. Not a single car, not a single agent, not a single weapon. No one had been on the other side when we’d come up over the rise. “I don’t get it,” I said, scanning the horizon. “You said they’d be here.” “Maybe he bought us another couple minutes.” This was a damn disaster no matter what. There was no undoing what had happened down there, no taking back the flight of my weapon to an agent’s head. No matter when Metatron restarted time, I was on a recorded surveillance tape taking out one of my own contacts. I was still struggling with how I’d been duped. “Shit!” I slammed my fist against the dash. I stared at the window, eyes glazed over as the landscape blurred. “I’ll hand it to Azazel. He is one patient fuck.” “Where to?” I’d screwed us both and put us in a ridiculous amount of danger, trapping us four stories below ground with only one viable exit. I’d foolishly laid all the blame for the men hunting us on his tail, hung it all on his buyer, wasting time researching leads and avenues to tie all this back to a single man who’d really only been a pawn for Azazel. I would not make that mistake again. We had one enemy—Azazel. And the best way to win against him was to get the relics. Nothing else mattered and we’d have to deal with our killers as they came. “Airport. Let’s get to Greece.” “Are you sure?” “Yeah. We need to face what’s there and get this over with.” I sighed and unloaded the weapons, clicking on safeties and making sure that none of them would accidentally fire if shit got out of hand again before the airport. We’d need to take them all to Greece and I wanted to pick up more ammo before we got to the site. I made the necessary calls to ensure that the plane and vehicles would be ready, along with ammo for the weapons we carried, and a few more just in case. I hung up, hoping that Clarissa had been the only compromised contact on my end. I’d changed us to a different, smaller airport that was only twenty minutes from here—no commercial service, only private planes. I had to trust that Azazel would let us get to Greece before attempting to take us out again. Hopefully he was limited to the same slices of time that Metatron was, and wasn’t running a live stream that allowed him to know that we’d just escaped—again. Clay pulled into the airport and we were both strung tight as bows. I grabbed the weapons and he lifted the bag from the backseat, silently closing the back door. His shoulders were tight and his jerky movements belied any surety he was projecting. “What about the car?” I shrugged. “They’ll handle it. Agencies steal half the missing cars out there. I’m not worried about it.” I laid a hand on his forearm and waited for him to look at me. The muscle in his jaw bulged. “I’m sorry.” He shook his head. “Not your fault. I clearly need to do better screening on the girls I…” He cleared his throat. “Anyway, that could have gone worse.” My fingers tightened along with my chest. Much worse. I hated that we owed our lives to Metatron right now. Not that we wouldn’t have taken her out. He’d made a hell of a move and timed it perfectly to take her out the moment my knife connected. Still, I’d have been shot, probably severely. Bad enough that I’d have bled out before the agents above could have saved me. Agent Richards was deadly and a hell of an agent, no matter who she worked for. I was glad Clay had been there, glad he hadn’t hesitated when I needed him. I finally felt like I could count on him to have my back. We were becoming a hell of a team. I tipped my chin, careful not to let us descend back into the feelings we’d damn-near shared. “Leg sweep, huh?” The corner of his mouth twitched. “It’s the only thing that ever surprises you. Figured she might not expect it either.” “It was good,” I said as he linked our fingers together and we walked to the plane. “It was very good.”",

      "content": "Chapter Fifteen We arrived in Greece in the pre-dawn hours and threw the weapons bag in the back of a silver BMW. I drove and Clay pulled up a map to the archeological site. We didn’t have far to go from the airport, and we stayed off the main roads, winding toward the small town on an indirect route. I kept an eye on the rearview mirror, wary of a tail. We were both edgy and our conversation was as minimal in the car as it had been on the plane, both of us deep into work mode. Clay had lost his jovial edge and my senses were alert. A mile from the perimeter of the dig, we scouted the neighboring blocks, making two full circles and working slowly inward. Thankfully, the landscape was flat and open, concealing nothing. The houses were spaced apart, eliminating all but the smallest shadows. Spata was a sleepy town and I relaxed a little. No tail and no unwarranted attention. Traffic was nonexistent, which made spotting a tail easier, but also made it impossible for us to hide. I had to hope that we had a few hours’ head start. “There it is” Clay pointed through the darkness to scaffolding and excavated dirt. I didn't slow as we passed the dig. For all the clean walls of dirt and equipment, it looked like any other archeological site. Chain-link kept curious onlookers at a safe distance, but the gates weren’t secured by anything more than simple locks. The site sat in the middle of the city, which on any other day wouldn't have been a big deal. But right now it was deserted, and walking onto it left us incredibly exposed. On our third rotation, I decided on a squat, three-story parking garage across the street for a stakeout spot. At least they hadn't unearthed the relic yet. Otherwise, we'd have been forced to up our time table. It would happen today, and that made me incredibly uneasy. The last thing I wanted to do was sit here, waiting and watching, because that gave everybody else an opportunity to find us. I'd prefer to storm in right now, grab the relic, and head out. But by now, anyone who wanted this relic knew it was here. Azazal knew I was coming to get it and he’d probably already laid a trap. I wouldn't be surprised if he's corrupted the entire archeological team, found some way to exploit their fears or even their overwhelming need for the glory of the find. I parked on the second-highest level in the center beside three other cars that probably belonged to locals. The Beemer stuck out more than I cared for, and now I wished I would've more specific when I requested wheels. It would have to do. And really … at this point, stealth was impossible. We got out. I loaded two handguns for each of us and pocketed four clips of ammunition, then laid out the Mossberg and our remaining weapons in the trunk along with our extra ammo, in case we needed to grab any of it on the run. Clay's fingers covered mine. \"You look like you're ready for a war.\" \"Yeah. I kind of am.\" Clay took his weapons and holstered them, looking like a professional. I was now completely at ease at having him with me. He was less of a liability now and finally an asset. Shit might have gone very wrong in the basement of the training facility, but we’d come out better off. We walked the edge of the parking structure and I scanned the open area beyond. Buildings pressed on the dig with old-world stone masonry, competing with brand-new steel and glass. Three stories below, the dig opened up into the underbelly of Spata. The hole was fifty feet wide and a hundred feet long, and stretched down twenty. Orange tape fluttered, marking off the boundaries of the dig. Nobody. Nothing. I glanced at my watch. “We have a good hour, maybe two, before anyone shows.” “I'm going down,” Clay said. I shook my head. “No. Let’s watch for a few minutes and let the day unfold.” “We have to make a move.” He leaned back and glanced down to the far corner of the garage at a set of stairs. “Now, before there’s too much foot traffic.” I didn’t like it, but waiting wasn’t helping us. Azazel would not send a single agent again. This time, he’d send an army. One I was not equipped to battle. We’d lost Metatron as an ally—shitty as he was, I kept hoping that he’d call down a heavenly army for us if things got to that point. I’d let my temper get the best of me and now I’d put us on our own. “We have to re-con the area,” Clay said. He was right. We hadn't been able to get a hold of any electronic blueprints because the dig was so new, and the plans we had been able to find for the sewage system showed that it all had be re-routed to maintain the integrity of the site, leaving us no way to access it underground. I hated splitting up, though. I’d gone from being a complete loner to depending on him… This mission had me jacked in more ways than I cared to admit. If we were together, I could take out the threats immediately, but apart, there were too many uncertainties \"I'll be fine,” Clay said, seeming to read my thoughts. “Besides, if one of us needs to cover the other, you know this is the best way to keep us both alive.\" Dammit. I walked back to the car and took out the sniper rifle. From here, handguns were useless and the scope would help me see into the shadows. I loaded and cocked it. \"I still don't feel good about it.” “Give me another choice, I'll take it.\" We didn't have one. And as long as I didn't get overtaken first, I did have the superior positioning to take out anyone on the ground coming after him. I moved over ten feet and set up behind a pillar where I could watch everything down below, as well as the incoming ramp to this level of the garage. \"I want you back up here in six minutes.\" \"What if I find something?\" \"Six minutes. Then we go back down together.\" He clenched his teeth. \"Fine.\" He passed behind me and took the opening stairs leading down to the main level and street. I scanned the building faces—doors, windows, pools of darkness. Quiet was the mood of the morning, but wouldn't be for long. A few blocks away, a dog barked, but nothing stirred below. At the bottom of the stairs, Clay paused before stepping out into the street, looked both ways, and drew his weapon. I smiled. Two days ago that sequence wouldn't have occurred to him, and he'd have walked in cocky and invincible. I hated our close calls, but I didn't mind the added awareness it had brought him. He stepped through the shadows, moving stealthily along the building. He walked the entire perimeter before descending into the lower level. I lost sight of him for too long and held my breath until he moved past the edge of the dig that had concealed him. The layout of this dig was different than what I was used to, since Mom's were always in unimproved dirt areas. Here, they’d had to work around the existing structure of the underground, laying out each level amid pipes and concrete and expensive wiring. Clay moved easily from level to level, pausing at the far end to examine the entrance of one of the blocked-off tunnels. I would have liked to have been inside one, for the concealment and stealthy vantage. Clay aimed his weapon into the yawing hole, shoulders hunching with a heightened anxiety, as if something had moved or made a noise. I was too far away to have picked up on either. Taking a cue from his posture, I sighted in over his head and into the blackness beyond. I had no idea what he'd seen, but if anything moved, I was taking it out. I held my breath and clicked off the safety. He lowered his weapon and backed away, then hurried out of the excavation and back up the stairs. I didn’t take my sights off the dig, just in case. He crossed to me, panting. \"You're not going to believe this.”",

      "content": "Chapter Sixteen \"This has trap written all over it. You know that, right?\" My stomach squeezed as we moved further along the bowels of the Spata sewer system. \"Yeah. I know,” Clay said, checking our six over his shoulder. “But we're less exposed down here.\" I didn't like that we were being directed against every set of plans we’d had available to us. Had we known this was an option, we’d never have bothered with the parking garage. This entire length of access had been marked as unused, according to every set of blueprints we'd been able to come up with. Clay's recon trip down here had exposed the misinformation, and we’d backtracked the line to a manhole and dropped in, which now had us working our way toward the excavation, coming at it on the opposite side of the parking garage. Water dripped from the ceiling, pinging against the puddles as we moved deeper along the line. Clay had the Mossberg strapped to his back and pockets full of shells, along with two handguns and three knives. I’d left the sniper rifle, but had a dozen knives, my handguns, and enough ammo to take down any reasonable offense. None of that made me feel comfortable about our odds. We hadn’t come down here to ambush anyone, only to stay protected as long as we could. I didn’t have any preconceived notions that this was going to go easy or well, but I liked being down here a lot better than I’d liked the garage with its open sides and impossible numerous entry points. Here we had one exit, one entrance. Easy to protect, easy to leave. Our footsteps splashed in the stagnant water left over from the efforts to drain this once they’d started the excavation. I’d been in my fair share of sewer systems, and a dry one was definitely preferable to a live one, but the fumes still made my eyes water. We walked forward slowly, guns drawn and ready, eyes scanning every shadow. \"First shift should start in thirty minutes,\" Clay said quietly, his words reverberating off the stone walls and ceiling. I nodded, then made us pause fifteen feet from the end, anticipating, ready, alert. Bright sunlight streamed past the nearby buildings, illuminating the entire dig with early-morning light. They probably loved that for working on it, but I loved it for the distinct shadow it cast on the tunnel. The lighting change from bright light to immediate dark kept us in shadow and no one in the pit would have a straight line of sight into this portion of the tunnel, either. We were invisible. Nothing moved, and we pressed forward. Without a good idea of what the excavation team had come up with in the last few days and what they’d planned to tackle today, we didn’t know how today would play out, but I was prepared to sit and wait until nightfall if we had to. We would be here when they found it. College students and archaeologists filtered in over the course of the next half hour. I assessed the threat level of each one, hoping desperately they hadn't all been corrupted. I didn't want to have to kill these kids or their easygoing leader, who’d been cracking jokes since setting foot on the dig. He was dressed in khakis and a worn denim shirt, blond hair sticking out from beneath a John Deere ball cap. His attitude reminded me of Dad, and being on a dig had already reopened wounds about Mom. I didn’t need any emotion creeping in on this, so I spent my time counting windows that might hold possible threats and cataloging the make and model of every car that drove past the dig. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Which made me very nervous. I wanted a glaring discrepancy, something I could pinpoint that would tell us where the threat was today. So far, we were stuck with immature students and a couple of experts who loved their jobs. Conversations filtered to us, but again, nothing that helped me at all. They talked about beer, a new club, and a cute girl who’d moved into the building. My nerves were frayed. We shifted position and traded off shifts, one staying guard over the goings-on in the dig, and one walking back to where we'd entered the system to make sure no one had set off my makeshift trip wires. Other than our nerves, the day stayed quiet. I was crouched in the shade of the opening, out of sight from all the workers, continually scanning the scene before us, looking for anything odd. The level of activity had bored me right out of my brain and Clay was struggling to sit still. “Holy shit!” One of the interns waved the group over. “Matty, come take a look at this.” Clay and I scrambled to our feet, careful to make little noise as we rose. It was mid-afternoon and the waiting had gotten increasingly painful with every hour. I was almost wishing for a shootout just so we could get it over with. The tension was nearly unbearable. With the excavation team occupied, I waved Clay forward, then checked behind us. We were still alone in our stakeout location, but if they’d just found the relic, I could be sure that Azazel was about to put his plan in motion. Warmth spread through my belly and I moved closer to Clay. The entire excavation team peered into a new hole that they’d knocked away in the system. We couldn’t see anything from our vantage and now I wished we’d have stayed high. “Can you feel it?” he whispered. The warmth spread outward, making my fingers tingle. This piece called to me far more than any of the others. Maybe it was the dig, maybe it was a fierce connection to my mother here, but we’d found what we’d come for. Now all we had to do was get it from the dozen people handling it without calling down an army of angels.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen They finally quit oohing and ahhing over it and we got our first look. The instructor, Matty, took the piece to the examination table and most of the students filtered back to their work. A few hung around him, interested in getting a better look at the day’s treasure. The sword wasn’t very big, an oversized knife, really. I wished I had the scope or a pair of field glasses so I could get a clearer look, but they hadn’t pulled up anything else today and that had to be what was pinging me. The blade was badly rusted and looked exactly like you’d think for something that had been in the underbelly of a city for centuries. The hilt had a small hole in it, but I couldn’t tell from here if that was from rust or by design. Strangely, the hole was almost the same size as the ring that had been the first relic. It was a design feature I hadn’t seen before, but I didn’t exactly deal in antique blades. I cared a lot more about the carbonite blades and ones that could take a beating than pretty ones. My life revolved around function over form. Until today. We needed that pretty knife like I’d never needed anything else. Possessing that put us nearly to the finish line. One left. One last piece and we’d be on our way to get Griffin. Matty took his sweet time cleaning and examining the piece. The afternoon air in the dank sewer thickened until I could nearly chew it. Agonizing minutes turned into hours as Matty explained detail after detail about the knife, comparing it to the other bits they’d found and speculating about how it had gotten down here and who it might have belonged to. They didn’t get anywhere close to the truth of its itinerary. “But that’s all fascinating speculation,” Matty said. “We may never know exactly where it’s been.” He chuckled. “For all we know it could have been carried by one of Jesus’s apostles.” His voice carried true and clear to us. Almost like he wanted us to hear. The hair at my nape lifted and I didn’t hesitate, easing deeper into the shadows and drawing Clay back with me. Nothing felt right about this. We needed to come back after they’d left for the day. Now we knew they had the sword—and that my body confirmed it was the sword—our next step was to make sure that we stayed within close range and grabbed it at the first opportunity. Standing at the end of this sewer pipe trapped us and left us without enough exits. Where it had been perfect for surveillance, it left us too few options and I wanted to be back above ground. Now. Clay’s hand found mine in the dark and he squeezed. I didn’t have time to relay everything I was feeling, but the pressure of his fingers let me know that he’d understood and would follow my lead. We moved backward with stealth and I didn’t take my attention off Matty and all his associates and students on the dig, even as they grew smaller and I couldn’t make out one face from another as they moved like black specks against the daylight at the end of the tunnel. In the matter of a few moments, Matty had gone from reminding me of my Dad to being Harrold’s twin in evil. The last thing I wanted to do was turn my back on him. Clay moved beside me, facing the other way as we retreated, guns up and ready. Topside, we moved rapidly to the car and got in. “Move to where we can watch,” I told him, reaching into the backseat and grabbing the sniper rifle. He eased the car out of the parking spot and up to the upper level and against the outside barrier. I removed the scope and got out, wishing again for a smaller set of glasses so I didn’t have to compromise the weapon. “Stay with the car.” “Screw that.” Clay got out and walked with me to the edge. We stayed close to the large beams that protruded from the stairwell so we wouldn’t stand out as the only thing peering over the edge. I lifted the scope and surveyed the dig. Matty still stood by the excavation table and the sword glinted in the afternoon light. That was our baby, all right. He touched it, caressing the hilt and dragging his finger down the blade. One of the students called him over to look at something and he hesitated, like he didn’t want to be away from the treasure for even a moment. “I’m worried that he’s not going to leave it on-site tonight.” “Would you?” Clay scoffed. “No.” A group of students crowded around a stack of personal effects beside the table—backpacks, water bottles, and notebooks. They gathered things as if they were taking off. “Headed to a class?” Clay asked. “Maybe. That would leave Matty and only a few people.” “Better odds.” I wasn’t about to get overconfident about our chances. Matty had been acting strange since they’d found the piece and he still wasn’t more than a dozen feet from it. This was more than just a relic—it had gotten personal for Matty. But it had always been personal for me.",

      "content": "Chapter Eighteen One by one, the remaining workers punched out, until only Matty and one other person remained. “We have to do this now,” Clay said, pacing the rooftop. He’d been restless and antsy for the last hour and I didn’t blame him. Only my training and experience with stakeouts kept me from being the same unraveling wreck. I’d been about to tell him we were stuck waiting until Matty was on the move when the last worker swung her backpack over her shoulder and waved to Matty. Clay was right. The time to do this was right now. “Agree. I’m taking the stairs so we don’t lose him. Grab the car and meet me down there. We need to be in position the moment he leaves.” His fingers wrapped around my arm. “I can’t cover you.” I clenched my teeth. That had never been a problem before but we had to roll with it. “I’ll be fine. I only have to make it down a couple flights of stairs. You did it earlier.” “Yeah, with your rifle watching my back.” “You going to stand here and argue with me?” He clenched his teeth. “Fine. If you get shot, it’s your own fault.” “I know. It’s fine.” He snorted and walked around the car and opened the door, but he didn’t get in, spreading his hands across the roof of the car. “Don’t get dead … okay?” I nodded. “Same.” We stared at each other and I didn’t know what else to tell him. I was armed, deadly, and—honestly—itching for a fight. It was coming, I didn’t know how big or fast it would be, but there’d be no clean getaway tonight.",

      "content": "Chapter Nineteen I raced down the stairs, weapon drawn and out in front of me, expecting the worst. From my vantage, I watched Matty load the sword and several other boxes into the back of a light blue van, then pause in the center of the dig. I crouched on the final landing before I’d lose my line of sight on him. He stared up in to the night like he was waiting for something—or someone. Every hair on my body tensed and my muscles were locked into fight mode. I didn’t want this to go down with Clay in the car and me out here. I wanted us together, either that or him on his way to Ralph’s to get them to safety. Metatron may have promised Ralph that he and Anna would be safe, but I didn’t trust Metatron to hold up any bargain at this point. I felt the noose tightening around us, and the compulsion to grab them all and hole up somewhere was overwhelming. I couldn’t lose anyone else. My breath came in fast gasps, and I fought to get it under control and act like the goddamn professional who’d been doing this exact thing a hundred times before. Matty turned, looked right at me and blew me a kiss. “He’s coming for you.” The words were a whisper, but they pierced my eardrums with startling clarity. I stood and straightened. “Good. I’m ready.” And I was. “But tell him to stop sending his fucking minions. I deserve a meeting with him, face to face.” A thousand feet separated us, but I could feel the intensity of Matty’s gaze, the tension in his own muscles. If I’d had the sniper rifle on me, I’d have pulled the trigger, sending a bullet through his eye. Useless as it was at this distance, I still raised the handgun and pointed it at him. Matty laughed and got in the van. I raced down the steps, holstered my gun, and dove into the car. “Do not lose him!” Clay floored it, then eased up as we turned the corner and found the van sitting in the exit of the dig, waiting. Matty’s pale face shone brightly in the driver’s-side window. Once he spotted us, he turned onto the street like we were following him to the local park for a playdate. A heavy weight settled in my stomach. “This isn’t good,” Clay said, slowing the car until we followed three car lengths behind. “No.” The back of the van didn’t have any windows, and if it had, I wasn’t sure I’d take the shot I’d been itching for all day. Matty was doing his job as Azazel had commanded and right now we were supposed to be following him. Matty was my ticket to the next step, whatever that was, and I wanted a showdown. And that sword to be in my possession. He drove us through the main part of town to an industrial section that had seen better days. Most buildings had broken windows and boarded-up entrances, and the signs on the ones that did look occupied had burned out long ago. “Getting worse,” Clay said. I fingered the hilt of a knife. “Stay in the open. No matter where he goes, keep an escape route.” “Not my first rodeo.” “Sorry.” God, I was glad he was here. Going back to jobs without him was going to suck and at the same time, I’d gotten to comfortable having someone to rely on. Even having a driver so I could focus on other details was a complete luxury. We passed a fenced yard filled with stacks of steel and a massive crane looming ominously between the building and the open space. Matty pulled through an open gate in the chain link, slowing to make sure we saw him. “Follow?” I leaned forward. “I don’t know. Slow down and let’s check it out first. I don’t want us behind that gate. We could still blast through it if they locked it, but that kind of shit will slow us down and I think anything that will cost us seconds at this point is a bad, bad deal.” “Agree.” Clay moved to the middle of the street and let the car coast to a stop. We were deep in the industrial park and there wasn’t oncoming traffic, so we could sit and wait until Matty made a move. He stopped in front of a trio of large overhead doors, parking in front of the middle one. We still had a clear view of the van and could see every door. “Wait.” “Are we following if he goes in?” Clay rested his hands on the top of the steering wheel and I pulled my handgun from the holster in case they were counting on us being so occupied with Matty that we got ambushed from the back. “I don’t know, but keep an eye on your mirrors—” He cut me a look and I ignored him. How the hell did I know what he’d done for recon and stakeouts for his jobs? I’d rather boss him around and risk making him mad than assume he knew what we were supposed to be doing. We waited long enough that my legs cramped. I fidgeted and scowled at the van. “We didn’t miss it, did we?” “He hasn’t gotten out. No way.” “What the hell is he doing?” “Waiting, I guess. It’s strange. Is he waiting for us to come over?” “I don’t care.” I checked my mirror and scanned the scenery beyond us. Nothing moved, nothing watched. For now, the three of us were the only people around. “We’re sitting ducks out here.” “Worse if we go in blind.” He ran his hands across the steering wheel. “I hate waiting.” My fingers curled around the door handle. I did too. “If we use the stacked steel as shields, we can make it around that side of the building and case it while staying out of view of the van.” “Then what?” I sighed. “We go in.” “You sure?” He shifted in his seat and looked at me. I nodded. “We go together and not until we’ve cased the entire building. If there isn’t another entrance, we come back to the car. We’re sure not walking in through the front.” “Agree.” He glanced at all the mirrors and stiffened. “Uh, Lina…”",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty Blinding light filled the interior of the car and I opened my door slowly and got out, facing the oncoming army behind us, illuminated by a brilliant halo of light. Clay followed my lead, climbing out the driver’s-side door and standing beside the car. I blinked and my fingers curled instinctively around my weapons at my hips. “What in the fuck?” Clay murmured. He could say that again. A thousand angels walked toward us—there was no mistaking their identities as they marched behind Metatron. His wings were in full glamour, protruding four feet above his head and furling out behind him. Angels flanked him on both sides, extending back hundreds of feet. They were alarmingly beautiful, dressed in full-battle gear with armor and weapons. All thoughts of avoiding a holy war vanished. If anything was frozen, we couldn’t tell, but maybe that was why Matty hadn’t moved from the van. Metatron stopped five feet from me and I shielded my eyes, squinting and blinking agains the shining light of his army. “Evangeline.” I nodded, unsure how to react. Had he come to help or take me out? Didn’t imagine a lot of people got away with smacking an archangel. “So, uh, who’s your crew?” Clay asked, jutting his chin toward the angels. “I gave thought to your issues, Evangeline and I brought them before Himself.” I coughed. “Sorry?” “Your points were valid and losing your mother cost us dearly.” He held up a hand to halt my comment and I snapped my mouth shut. “As it did for you. I now see that.” He inclined his head. “And apologize.” I blinked, shocked. Absolutely shocked. “Uh, thanks.” “After I discussed matters of the covenant with Himself, he thought perhaps I should offer you the assistance of the heavenly army. If you want, of course.” Was he serious? Of course I wanted a damn army behind me. But that came at a cost that bothered me too. “How bad is this going to get?” “He did not allow me to break every rule. I cannot foretell the future, Evangeline. I do hope you’ll understand the why of that. There is still enough uncertainty that I hope to be wrong in what I’ve seen predicted for this night.” “Yeah,” Clay said with a laugh. “Us too.” He stepped closer and examined the front row of angels. Their golden armor shone with a brilliance of a thousand candles, and the tips of their spears and swords looked like they’d been sharpened beyond the capacity of earthly tools. I wanted one. Beautiful faces looked out from beneath helmets, and held traits of both males and females. Strong jaws matched with full lips and strong cheekbones. This could have been a fierce fighting army of women as much as men. “I must take my leave of the events,” Metatron said, pulling my attention away from the angels. “But I leave you the army. They’ve been instructed to follow your every command. But choose wisely, Evangeline. Mankind will not survive another war of angels. Whatever you call down tonight will stand in time as your own decision. Himself and I have washed our hands of what comes next. This is still your journey, we’ve just chosen to arm you with something more … suitable.” I laughed. “You have no idea how to play fair, do you?” “Life is not fair, darling. I merely hope to tip the odds in your favor. Before I go, you must go get the sword and bring it to me.” I tensed and glanced at the building. We didn’t know what was waiting for us in there. “With or without them?” I pointed at the glowing warriors readied for battle. “Without. You’ll not find resistance yet.” “Then why do we need the army?” Clay asked, stepping closer and examining a spear held in a massive hand of an angel. “They’re coming for you.” That’s what Matty had said too. It didn’t sound any better coming from Metatron. “And you’re leaving us the moment you have the sword?” A chill raced up my spine. Harrold had warned me about this. Was now when Metatron double-crossed me? “Only for safekeeping. When you finish here, I’ll be waiting for you at Ralph’s. We still have one more relic, Evangeline.”",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-one With Clay at my side, we marched up to the van, weapons drawn. I eased to the front door and pointed my gun where Matty should have been in the driver’s seat. I shook my head. Clay moved carefully toward the back of the van and I took a few steps back so I could cover him. He reached slowly toward the handle. Metatron had said we wouldn’t find resistance, but Matty hadn’t gotten out. He had to be in the van. I nodded sharply and Clay yanked the door open. It was empty. Save the sword, lying on a work table, softly glowing. “Wow,” Clay said. I agreed and walked closer, holstering my gun and stopping at his side. I didn’t know how he’d done it, but Matty had managed to escape without our notice. The thought sent a freakish chill along my skin. I leaned closer. It hadn’t looked like this when Matty had found it and now I wanted to examine it, and study the intricate carvings and delicate jewel-crusted hilt. Clay’s fingers wrapped around the back of my neck. “Later, babe. Get it and let’s get the hell out of here.” “Sorry.” I pulled myself out of my trance and grabbed the sword. It tingled against my palm and I holstered all my other knives so I could hold it with both hands. “I’m following you.” Metatron waited in front of his army, arms crossed. I stopped a few feet short of him and dropped the sword to my side. I had something to say before I handed over this bit of sacred history that I needed to save Griffin. “You’ve got some making up to do. You’ve put us in danger too many times and I’m done with it. Nothing—nothing—stands between me and what I want. You called down this holy war when you brought your army into it and I can only assume that since they’re coming for me that they’ll be bringing a legion of their own, and now we’re in for a hell of a fight. Azazel’s going to be upset that you helped me.” I narrowed my eyes. “Pretty sure your boss isn’t going to be pleased about it either.” He sniffed but didn’t comment. “Be at Ralph’s.” I took a step forward and handed him the sword, my fingers tightening before I let go. I hoped I was making the right choice. “You have a lot of explaining to do and I’m not waiting weeks to go after the last relic.” He inclined his head in agreement, then glanced at Clay. “Keep her safe.” Clay laughed heartily. “Yeah, right.” His hand found the small of my back. “Come on.” Metatron vanished and I walked over to Clay. Now that we had two of the three relics, I wasn’t slowing down for even a second in our pursuit of the last and final piece I needed to open the gate to Hell and save Griffin. He'd damn well better be at Ralph's. The angels’ attention was riveted on me. “Well, boys, shit’s about to get real. Stay close, stay alert.” They nodded and snapped to formation. It was a heady feeling, but one that I didn’t expect to last long. I looked at Clay and held out my palm. “Let’s do this.” He grinned and slapped my hand with his. “Hell yeah.”",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-two We paused at the car and foolishly grabbed our mortal weapons. I held no illusions that they’d prove to be at all helpful. Not if the other side had ones that looked like the army following us, but being armed made me feel better. Clay racked the shotgun and threw his shoulders back. I stared at him and swallowed. “You don’t have to do this.” I didn’t want to lose him. I couldn’t, not after Griffin. We were walking into a battle and I wasn’t stupid enough to think that we’d survive. Azazel wasn’t the kind of guy to let bygones be bygones. I had too many of the weapons he wanted and he had the one I needed. He took a step closer. “You really think I’d do that? Bail on you now?” “No. But I was hoping I could talk you into it.” He slid his hand behind my head. “Sorry. You can’t get rid of me that easy.” I laughed nervously. “If this won’t shake you, I guess I’m stuck with you.” “Guess so.” He pulled me against him and kissed me hard, then let me go. “Now let’s go get that sword.” We marched through the gate and stopped ten feet from the back of the van. I tipped my chin up and yelled, “You’ve kept me waiting long enough!” “Evangeline.” Harrold’s voice cut through the night and he appeared from the corner of the building, then walked toward the van, stopping beside it. “We meet again.” “I said no minions.” I was done screwing around and I’d meant what I’d told Matty. We were through with the games. He laughed. “You know that’s impossible. Azazel would not need what he’s seeking if he were free to meet with you.” I crossed my arms. “I’ll wait.” Silence stretched across the night. I wasn’t about to change my position. The next move was his. “Remember two things,” Harrold said quietly. “You asked for this. And we gave you the opportunity to work for the right team.” I didn’t bother to respond. “Suit yourself.” He turned to the van and pushed it as if it were a child’s toy, sending it skidding sideways past the last door. It rocked up on the far wheels, then crashed down with a shudder. I returned my attention to him, hiding the fear and surge of adrenaline racing through my body. Matty still didn’t emerge and I had no idea where he’d gone or where the sword was. Clay stepped closer to me. Harrold turned to face us and lifted his arms, palms up, then raised them in a sweeping, controlled motion. All three doors rolled up, revealing a black-clad army, the sinister mirror image of the one behind me. Flat black armor, shielded faces, unearthly sharp weapons. Now I understood Metatron’s warning with crystal clarity. If these two armies clashed, nothing would remain. The army marched forward in perfect uniformity, stopping behind him. “As I told you, Azazel couldn’t make our little tête-à-tête tonight, but he sent someone.” “I said no minions,” I repeated myself. The men Azazel had corrupted couldn’t speak for him, couldn’t truly act on his behalf. They could do despicable things, but that wasn’t what I wanted. I wanted someone who held the power to give me Griffin’s soul, or at least the sword. I wanted a way to prevent the holy war, but I wasn’t willing to sacrifice Griffin’s eternity. The dark angel stepped forward and removed his helmet. Silken black hair spilled down his shoulders and he looked straight through me with startling green eyes. My jaw dropped at the unmatched beauty of his face. I blinked and inhaled deeply. He pushed his hair back and I narrowed my eyes to study the incongruence, glancing again at the hand to figure out what had caught my attention. He saw my glance and held his hand out to me, opening the palm, twisting it, then closing the gnarled, disfigured vestige. I quickly studied the rest of the army, noting their similarities, both in beauty and disfigurement. Each one had model-worthy faces, but they were like models who’d been in horrific car wrecks on their way to a photo shoot and then horribly put back together. Most had gnarled arms, fingers, limbs. It was a brilliant distortion of our earthly ideas of beauty. I yanked my attention back to the one beside Harrold. “Evangeline,” Harrold said with a wicked smile. “I’d like to introduce Lucifer.”",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty-three I didn’t fear him. Odd, I know, but the effect of having Lucifer here had the opposite effect and infused me with a sudden rush of confidence. Azazel wouldn’t have sent his partner if they didn’t believe that we had a chance of succeeding. If they thought we were going to fail, they’d have waited patiently for it to happen, then they’d have collected the relics, and continued on with their disturbed mission. For them, as for me, the stakes were incredibly high. Azazel was worried. I smiled. He should be, because he was going to lose. “He’s truly imprisoned, Evangeline,” Lucifer said, his velvet voice a match for his perfectly curved lips. “But Azazel did agree that you deserved the respect of a face-to-face meeting.” He bowed. “I do hope I’ll suffice in his stead.” “Sure. Give me what I want.” He smiled and I got caught up in the striking beauty of it, like when a billboard catches my eye and I’m forced to appreciate a work of art. “We’re evenly matched,” he said. “You have one weapon, I have one. We both want the third.” Holy shit. He didn’t know that I’d just given the sword to Metatron. I managed to hide my shock and clenched my fists. We still had work to do here and I wanted him to know that he couldn’t bully me. “I don’t make deals.” “Yes, I thought you might say that.” “Then what’s your counter-offer?” He grinned. “You’re a brilliant girl, truly a worthy adversary.” He said it with a sense of wonderment, as if he’d not expected me. I doubted that would afford me any allowances, but it infused my confidence another notch. “The trouble is, you don’t understand this game you’ve been playing.” “This isn’t a game to me.” It was deadly serious. One I was willing to die for, one that Griffin had already given all that he could. It pissed me right off that he would dismiss it so flippantly. This probably was nothing more than a stupid weekend playoff game to them. What did they care if their wars wiped us out? That was what they wanted anyway, to go back to the beginning when they were responsible for populating the earth with their own giant offspring. The sooner the game started, the sooner they could get back to life the way they wanted it. “It is a game, Lina. A God game. If you don’t understand that, then who are you to play at this level? We”—he tapped three long gnarled fingers to his chest, then spread his arms to encompass the mass of demons standing behind him—“we have played this game with Himself for millennia. But this time, we have nothing to lose. What about you?” I refused to feel the fear he wanted to instill in me. “If that’s your best threat, it’s weak.” I took a step forward. “See, you think that having nothing to lose is what makes you the best player, because you’ve truly never had anything worth losing. You may think that your power, your freedom … that those things are worth losing, but you don’t have a clue. I’ve known your power, the heady rush of being on top of the world, knowing that I’ve conquered every fear, every evil, every challenge, but that’s nothing—nothing compared to the rush that comes from being loved—loved by a soul mate.” I laughed and looked him straight in his beautiful face, then met the gazes of the other demons. “Soul mates require a soul. An essence of goodness, of rightness. You’ve missed out on that and let me tell you, that’s a tragedy. Maybe having loved ones gives me liabilities, makes me vulnerable, because now I have so, so much to lose, but you’re wrong. So very wrong.” He sniffed and the demons let out a low laugh. I continued, embracing the truth of what I’d just realized. “Well, I’m here to tell you that it’s the soldier who has everything to lose that will expend it all on the battle field to save her loved ones.” I stood up straighter, feeling the weight and power of the angels behind me, as well as the physical force of the love extended by my most precious people—both living and dead. I so did not want to start another holy war. And I wasn’t sure he did either. They’d lost massively the last time, and we still had a relic to find, one Azazel desperately needed. One we both needed with a fierce desperation. “I’ve come for one thing. Give me Griffin’s soul and we can both walk away to fight another day.” He laughed, and it was the deep bass of a thousand church bells. Lucifer looked at me as if seeing me for the first time. “You’re something else, Evangeline. Our common Father knows the greatness in you. It’s why he afforded you the angels who stand behind you. But what’s different, what sets you apart from all the others, is that you see your own greatness. Few do, and it seems a shame to waste a treasure such as you.” He chuckled again. “I’ll let you in on a little secret, women like you—the ones who know their worth—they’re incorruptible. I can’t touch them. Can’t even get close. But”—he brushed his fingernails across his chest and examined them—“enamored as I am with you, I reject your terms.” I raised my arm and felt the army behind me tense. My fingers tightened on the hilt of my blade and I smiled, mocking him with his own comment. “Suit yourself.”",

I was trying to negotiate with the devil, for God’s sakes, and now I had an army of angels behind me and an army of demons in front of me. “You do know that if we start ourselves a war here, Lucifer, that there is a chance your pal Azazel will never be released from his prison, and isn’t it true then that your legion here will never actually reign? Is that a chance you’re willing to take? If we go our separate ways and continue to ‘play the game’—as you so eloquently put it—we’re on equal footing. Isn’t that the fairest way to play a game, or do you always have to cheat to win? If we war tonight and your legion loses, then I can only assume that all will be lost for you. But, let’s say you take us all out. Let’s say you win. But do you really win? I’m under the impression that I may be the only one who can find what we all seek. I mean, if your minions are so good at their job, why haven’t they pieced it all together? Why is your BFF still imprisoned?” Lucifer stared at me, amusement and hatred gleaming in his eyes. “I have a point, don’t I?” A slow smile spread across his face. “I really do like you. I can so understand why Griffin fell in love with you. You’ll be joining us soon enough, Evangeline.” He laughed then, like he liked the thought of playing a bit longer. “Why the hell not? Let’s keep playing the game.” He turned around and faced his army. With the snap of his fingers they all disappeared but I felt they were all still right there, just unseen. I turned and faced the glorious angels that Metatron had sent me. The light within them had increased. They’d indeed had my back for this war and I was grateful. “I think it’s safe for you to go home now.” The light intensified further until that’s all it was—one glorious light, and then they, too, were gone. I dropped to my knees. Clay came over and crouched beside me. “You just negotiated with the devil, Lina. That was insane.” He took my hands in his and the warmth of human hands filled me as I fell into him. “I’d like to go get a drink. I don’t think this game is going to get any easier. Something tells me that the rules just changed.” He nodded, stood, and reached for my hand. I smiled up at him. “You still in? I mean, after all that?” “You’re kidding, right? Are you still in?” “Yeah. I’m still in.” “Come on, partner. I’ll buy you that drink.” Follow Lina and Clay on the next adventure in The Lucifer Legion, COMING SOON!",

      "content": "Extras Also available: The Dead Celeb An Evie Preston/Grey Tier Book 1 by Michele Scott (AKA—A.K. Alexander) (read on for a sample) Chapter One MY NAME IS EVIE PRESTON and I hang out with dead rock stars. Oh, and the occasional dead movie star or two. I’ve learned quite a bit about those who live on the other side over the past few months. For instance, they aren’t all ghostly and transparent. Oh no. The ones I see are almost always in full- color and 3-D except when they exert, ah...certain energies. Then they go a bit hazy. Oh, and they prefer to be called spirits. Yeah, I know...I sound completely insane. Like, “commit me” insane. But honestly, I am not crazy. Believe me, the first time I saw Bob Marley in my place (well, technically not my place, but I’ll get to that) in the Hollywood Hills, getting high and singing “Buffalo Soldier,” I thought I was either dreaming, hallucinating, or, yes, completely nuts. Thankfully, it was none of the above. In fact, Bob is a very real, very dead guy who likes to hang out with me, along with a handful of other deceased, famous rock musicians (and a few who never quite made the charts, one of whom I’ve recently developed feelings for—more about him later). So, not only do I hang out with dead rock stars, I also think I am in love with one, or at least in lust… which makes me totally screwed up. But I am not crazy. I swear. Before I go any further, though, I need to take you back a few months to the day after my twenty-eighth birthday. Welcome to Brady, Texas—population 5,500—and, according to the sign on the main road into town, “The Heart of Texas.” Truth be told, the signs were everywhere. Signs, that is, telling me to get the hell out of Brady. I was at Mrs. Betty LaRue’s place. Her house smelled of Tide, home cooking, and mothballs. Betty was comforting me over the dismal turnout of my Mary Kay presentation—my latest attempt at becoming an entrepreneur—which she’d kindly hosted. We were drinking apple-cranberry tea, with her Lhasa Apso, Princess, curled in a ball under Betty’s chair, and my dog (of indeterminate breed...possibly part-coyote and part-lab, with a dash of border collie in there), Mama Cass, across my feet. I loved how Betty always let me bring Cass in the house. My dog went everywhere with me, but not everyone was as gracious about her presence as Betty. “I really thought this would go much better,” I said, bringing the warm cup of tea to my lips. Betty smiled sympathetically, the fine lines in her eighty- something face creasing deeper into her skin, “Oh, honey, I don’t know what happened to my girls today. I am so sorry. I thought there’d be at least ten of us. They all love my snickerdoodles. But you know how some of us old gals are; we forget things.” She twirled a yellow-white wisp of curled hair around her finger. The rest of it was pulled up into a loose bun (or chignon as Mama calls it). She’d obviously been in to see my mother that morning for her weekly hair appointment. I nodded. “It’s okay, Betty. Thanks for hosting anyway, and the cookies were delicious. Three isn’t such a bad turnout.” Thing was, only Betty bought anything. Her friends, Margaret and Hazel, came for the cookies and samples. “And I made about ten dollars, so that will buy me a couple of meals. You’ll love that anti-wrinkle cream, by the way.” Betty ran a hand over her face and laughed sweetly. “Child, ain’t nothing gonna work on this face now. And I’m proud of these lines. I earned them.” I laughed back. “So you only bought the cream because you felt sorry for me?” Cass’s ears perked up and she lifted her head to peer at me. Betty sighed. “Evie Preston, I have known you since you started kicking up a fuss in your mama’s belly.” She winked at me. “I’ve watched you try so hard to be exactly what your mama and daddy wanted, especially after all that bad business. And there was that unfortunate situation with—” She paused. “What was his name?” She brought her cup to her lips, her hand shaking ever so slightly. I sighed, knowing exactly what bad business she was referring to. As for the unfortunate situation, he was the star quarterback my senior year and the lucky recipient of my virginity. Sadly, he was also the jerk who then decided to share the news with the entire town. Thank God my mother was able to intercept that little tidbit before it reached my father’s ears. Betty waved her free hand in the air as if to brush the painful thoughts away. “I know you were hoping to be a good Texas girl and marry a good Texas boy and have babies and run a family like your folks did, not because you really wanted it,” she said, shaking a finger at me. “But because your parents wanted it for you. And now, my dear,” Betty leaned over and gave me one of her rare, stern looks. “It’s high time you stopped pretending and started living!” “What do you mean?” “You got a God-given talent. You need to get out there and do something with it.” She tried to set the tea cup down on the side table and almost missed. I grabbed it and set it down for her. Betty beamed at me. “Thank you, honey! Always so polite.” I looked down at my dog, licking the unpolished toes peeking out of the only pair of high-heeled sandals I owned. “Fact is, Betty, I know I’m good, but there are a lot of good musicians out there.” I dejectedly twirled the ends of my long, baby-fine hair. Mama always said God hadn’t been paying close attention when it came time to give me hair. It was stick straight, dark brown, and silky. I couldn’t do a darn thing with it, except put it into ponytails. Betty waved her hand again. “Nonsense!” Placing her hands on the sides of her chair, she slowly pushed herself up to a stand and ambled over to the white brick mantle. She grabbed an envelope and handed it to me. “What’s this?” I asked. “Your birthday was yesterday, wasn’t it?” “You remembered?” She frowned. “I may be old, Evie, but I don’t forget birthdays. Especially when they’re for people I care about.” “That is so sweet of you.” I was flattered and grateful someone seemed happy to have me around. “Oh honey, you know you’re one of my favorite people. You got spunk! Had it since you came out ass-backward, showing the world what you thought of it.” “Thank you, I think.” I couldn’t help smiling. Betty was the only one I knew who spoke the truth without holding back. She didn’t tiptoe around stuff like my family. Tiptoeing was what we did best. “Open it! I don’t have all day. It’s about time for my nap.” I tore open the envelope and found a check inside for five thousand dollars, made out to me. I gasped. “Betty! What...” Cass jumped up, her huge ears pricked forward, tail wagging, watching me like a hawk. “It’s okay, girl.” She lay back down but still alert. “I was twenty-eight once too, you know, and I had dreams...big dreams.” Betty’s blue eyes glazed over for a moment. “I wanted to be a movie star, and I could have, too. I was damn good, like you are at what you do, and, believe it or not, I used to be good looking.” She winked at me again, but there were tears in her eyes. I knew about Betty’s dreams from long ago. I also knew there was a part of her life that hadn’t been so good. “But then my folks, like yours, had other ideas and I decided to play by their rules. I don’t regret it...well, maybe I do a little. Thing is, young lady, you can sing like a nightingale and you can play the guitar like nobody’s business. You need to get the hell out of this town before you wind up like every other girl here—knocked up, changing dirty diapers, and cleaning up after some idiot male who spends his nights with a beer in one hand and a TV remote in the other.” I frowned. I’d already seen almost every girl from my high school graduating class living the life Betty had just described. The lucky ones skipped town and went to college. I hadn’t been quite that lucky for a variety of reasons. I had the grades and the desire, but life had other ideas. On the positive side, which is where I like to go, I’d at least not had the misfortune of marrying some guy who didn’t appreciate me, expected his dinner on the table when he got home from his shift at Walmart, and wanted his wife and children to obey, just because he said so. “Betty, I really do appreciate your vote of confidence but still, I can’t accept this.” I held the check towards her. “Yes, you can, and you will. Go live your life, Evie Preston. Pack up that van of yours, your guitar, and Mama Cass, and head west. You sing your heart out in every bar, every café, every church—I don’t care where you go, but go and sing. I know one thing: you have what it takes to be a star. Forget all about them cosmetics you’re trying to pawn . . .” “Mary Kay,” I interrupted. “It is a really good line. Mama swears by it.” She frowned and waved that hand at me. “Just forget all that, because you and I both know it won’t get you nowhere. That kind of thing is for people like Shirley Swan up the road trying to make an extra buck to take care of those four kids of hers. Take the money, cut your losses, and run. You gotta stop living for your mama and daddy. You didn’t cause what happened and you can’t never change it.” She shook her head vehemently. “Go on and live life. Do it for me. Humor an old woman, please?” Her blue eyes watered, the creases crinkling as she choked back emotion. How could I refuse after a plea like that? I tried one last time, for the sake of courtesy. “But my daddy—” Betty dabbed at her eyes with a kerchief. “He’ll get over it. And your mama is gonna secretly be cheering you on. It’ll be hard on them, but this’ll be the best thing for all of you.” She sighed heavily. “Especially you, Evie. Trust me.” So I did. I trusted Betty LaRue. The next day I packed up my 1974 VW bus, a suitcase of clothes, my Rosewood Gibson acoustic guitar, and Mama Cass. I pulled out of my parents’ driveway while Daddy waved his arms wildly in the air, yelling, “You’re gonna ruin your life out there, Evangeline!” (He’s the only one who ever calls me by my full name.) “Los Angeles isn’t the city of angels. It’s a city of heathens and devils!” I knew he was just scared. I’m pretty sure if I looked closer, I’d see tears in his eyes. But Betty was right. This was something I had to do. I could see tears for sure in my mother’s big hazel eyes, the same color as my own, as she mouthed, “I love you.” I rolled down the window, choking back my own sobs. “I love you, too! I’ll call. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.” With blurred eyes, Mama Cass’s head in my lap, a Patsy Cline cassette in the tape deck (thank God for eBay—you have no idea how hard it is to find cassette tapes these days), I headed west to the City of Angels. For the first time in sixteen years, I felt like I could finally breathe again. I was leaving behind the only two people I knew who I had never been able to heal even a little bit, and I didn’t think I ever could. Chapter Two I AM NOT A REBEL by nature. Or who knows...maybe I am. Regardless, it’s never really been an option for me. Not after what my parents went through. I could never yell, lie, sneak out of the house, or talk back. None of that. And those weren’t their rules; they were my own. So leaving my mother and father behind on that late April afternoon was by far the most rebellious thing I had ever done in my twenty-eight years, and honestly, it left me feeling cold. Poor Cass with her thick coat must have hated me on that fifteen hundred mile trip, because I was freezing the whole way and cranked up the heater in my van, even as we drove through Arizona’s hot, desert climate. It was the kind of cold you can feel on the inside—that only a real hot bath combined with a hot drink and a tuck between the covers can cure. I wasn’t sick. No sore throat. No aching body. Nothing like that. I was just cold. And then, after three days of driving and staying in cheap motels, I took the 10 West all the way to L.A., and the chill left as suddenly and mysteriously as it had arrived. The first thing I did was head to the ocean—Venice Beach to be exact. Yes, Los Angeles has plenty of tan, beautiful people and then some, but let me just say for the record, there are also a ton of freaks here, especially in Venice Beach. I saw one guy with hair the color of mashed peas that hung down to his rear in twisted, greasy ropes. He wasn’t wearing a shirt and the waistband of his shorts sat well beneath his boxers. Not an attractive look, especially considering the live iguana wrapped around his neck. Never seen that before. Cass went totally berserk, yapping at him and the lizard. I had to yank pretty hard on her leash to get her to move while the guy snarled, “Get your mangy piece of shit mutt outta my face, dude!” Um, excuse me? At least my dog takes regular baths, which is certainly more than I could say about Mr. Mange and his lizard sidekick. I decided to keep my mouth shut and move along, tugging on Cass the entire way. I made an effort to give him as wide a berth as possible, not wanting to accidentally brush against him and deal with the onslaught of negative emotions that would happen as a result. Okay. I guess it’s probably time I let this particular cat out of the bag. See the thing is, when I turned twelve, my parents and I went through some tough times. And ever since, I’ve been able to get information about people through touch. But not just any information—traumatic, painful information. Caught your husband of thirty years sleeping with your best friend? Lost your mom in a car accident when you were a teen? Well, if you and I have come into contact before, chances are, I already know all about it. But that’s not all. I can also help ease the pain...give people a permanent Band-Aid to slap on that painful memory. I can’t make the pain disappear, but I sure can help you to cope with it, minus years of therapy or self-medication. Sounds great, right? Well, have you ever paid attention to just how many times a day you touch someone? At the supermarket, at the salon, at a restaurant...it happens all the time, and you’re mostly not aware of it at all. I’ve had to train myself to be extra focused on where I am and who’s around me in order to cope. Truth be told, I’m pretty cautious who I touch these days, and I also make a conscious effort to put some kind of barrier in place (gloves, mittens, napkins, whatever’s handy) if I know there’s a chance my hands might brush up against another person, because it is my hands that tend to be the main conductor of this gift. If my hands touch someone else, particularly their hands, that is when I get the clearest visions. I’d receive some information if someone were to bump against me, but the touching of hands is what I am most aware of. Betty LaRue was one of the first people I “read.” It happened at Easter, sixteen years ago, when I took her hand to show her the new kitten Mama brought home for me (another gift meant to help me deal with our recent loss). All I got were glimpses—of a much younger Betty and the baby she lost when she was only seventeen, courtesy of a pregnancy caused by a boyfriend who didn’t take no for an answer one night—and they scared the hell out of me. In any case, touching people like Cranky Dreadlock Man was simply not an option for me. No telling what sorts of nasty images I’d pick up from him. Once we got past him, we reached the ocean. Color—silvery blue. Smell—fresh and salty—minus the cigarette smoke and sickly sweet scent of tanning oil that occasionally wafted its way toward us. The crashing waves and sandy beach were like something from a postcard. Cass and I people-watched for some time. Cheapest entertainment in the world. Bring a lawn chair, a bag of Tostitos, and a six-pack of soda, and you’ll find the movies have nothing on Venice Beach. When I need to get away from anyone famous—dead or alive—I head there. And I figure, the best way to beat crazy is to go and see even more crazy. Cass and I shared a couple slices of pizza and a Coke (yes, Cass drinks Coke, too, but none of that diet stuff), and I decided we needed to find a place to stay for the night. And then I needed to find a job. I knew five thousand dollars was probably not going to get us very far in the land of glitz and glamour. I found a motel a few blocks from the beach. It was fifty-five bucks for the night, which seemed like a lot. But we were tired, and I thought being close to the ocean might be cool, because I could take Cass for a walk in the morning. Problem was, they had a “no pets” policy. “You gotta stay in the bus, girl,” I told her. She thumped her tail slightly and looked at me with her big, dark eyes. I whispered in her ear, “Only for a little bit. Soon as the coast is clear, I’ll come get you.” She thumped her tail even harder. I may sound a bit biased here, but Cass is the smartest dog ever. “You be a good girl, and I’ll be back.” And I was, after a shower and a change of clothes. I snuck my half-coyote, half-lab, possibly some border collie pooch into the dingy motel room that smelled of stale cigarettes, bug spray, and mildew. She jumped on the bed with me and we fell fast asleep. The Dead Celeb is available at: Amazon Kindle and Amazon UK Paperback * Audio Book Also available: Shadow Boxer Alterations, Book 2 By Jen Greyson (read on for a sample) Chapter One Based on the last two, I’m getting an increasingly bad taste for Tuesdays. “Damn.” I grind my teeth as the needle stitches color onto my right shoulder blade. Brin rakes a paper towel across the bloody area and slathers Vaseline over my new tattoo. “Wanna see?” I press my shirt over my boobs and hop off the chair. The ache in my back radiates through my entire arm, but I peer over my shoulder at my reflection and his impromptu handiwork. High on my right shoulder blade, he’s painted a vibrant orange-yellow sun with a crescent moon piercing the bottom, and eight long strands of lightning radiating outward in feathery bolts. Day blurs into night and back again, held together by nothing more than lightning. A perfect illustration of time’s chaotic movement for me. I gingerly pull my shirt on. “Nice.” One-word answers are enough here. I’m not capable of much else. “Eighty bucks work?” I dig in my front pocket for a crumpled hundred. My waistband slides over my hip and I grimace at how much weight I’ve lost. I don’t like being this skinny. I want my curves back. Brin takes the cash, enveloping my hands between both of his. “Merry Christmas, Evy. You have plans?” I force my gaze to stay steady, though I wince inside. “Dinner with the folks.” “Cool.” He lets me go and taps the cash register, popping open the drawer. I wave away his money. “Keep it.” He jams the bill into the drawer and hums “Jingle Bells.” “Thanks, babe. Don’t be such a stranger.” I test a smile and fight the burn stinging my eyes. “Thanks for fitting me in. Tell Tasha we need to go out for a drink.” He walks me to the door and holds it open. “She’d like that.” Back in Papi’s truck, I roll my shoulders. Even though some of the tension is gone, I still fight to stay above water. Please let this get easier. I’m going to run out of skin if this is how I have to unload the stress of an arc every time. A snow-covered Accord slides toward my bumper and I brace for the impact, but the driver gains control at the last second and waves in apology. She grins, buoyed by the Christmas packages piled high in the back of her car. I manage to lift my hand in forgiveness. If only the rest of my problems were that easy. I shift Papi’s truck into drive and pull out of the snowy parking lot, grateful he didn’t let me take my bike. I know he’s worried about me, but I don’t know how to reassure him—or if I even can. Not that he’s faring much better than I am, but at least he’s had a couple months to come to grips with what we are. Lightning leaps from my fingertips and rings the gearshift. Another bolt races around the steering wheel. My heartbeat steadies and my chest expands with a calming fullness. I need to play with it again. Nothing else can get me balanced and centered like my lightning. My throat tightens and I fight the flood of memories. Empty streets guide me home, but as I pass each driveway overflowing with visitors settling in for the long holiday weekend, the stiffness returns to my shoulders. I suppose I need to decide where I’m going to spend it as well. Someone’s shoveled my driveway, and I park between the small mounds of snow. It’s weird to be back here in my own house. I’ve spent what feels like months between Papi’s house and ancient Spain. Everything here is so . . . normal. Bamboo floors gleam, the stainless-steel kitchen is unused as ever, and the couch and gadgets remain untouched. I pace the length of my living room. The plan Papi and I formed earlier disintegrates as quickly as I try to recall the details. It seemed so easy and simple while we talked through saving Aurelia and then rescuing Penya. I pull a blue strand of lightning from my middle finger and twist it around my hand, covering and uncovering my fingers. That’s not the right order. Penya’s abduction weighs on me, but not just because I failed to save her in the forest. That whole situation doesn’t feel right. The longer I wait to save her, the more chances of something going wrong. She thinks Aurelia is important—and I completely agree—but leaving Penya to Ilif’s mercy until I save Aurelia makes me uneasy. The lightning jumps and pops around my hand. I close my eyes and inhale, drawing the cord of light out and back in a slow rhythm. When my mind empties and the unease quiets, I snuff the lightning and return to my living room. Badly as I want to leave this decision up to someone else, I need to decide between the two. Time travel should not be this hard. In a perfect world, I could stop time and do both. Ilif is both the wild card and the ultimate pain in my ass. My shoulders sag and I run a hand over my braid. It’s crusted and beyond grunge. I have no idea the last time I washed it—a week ago, a month? Time holds no meaning for me anymore. I growl and shake my arms. “Snap out of this, Evy! Do something. Anything!” A shower will help me sort things out. Right now any movement is progress. I toe my boots off and pad across the floor to the bathroom. Even the opulence of my simple place is jarring. I twist the knob on the shower and peel my T-shirt off, wincing at the new soreness on my back and the days-old scrape on my forearm. The one Constantine gave me. Tears burn the back of my eyes, and I swallow and scramble to get myself under control. We knew it was an impossible situation. We knew a relationship wouldn’t work. As I shimmy out of my pants, my fingers brush the bruise on my hip where he had me pressed against the rock wall of his bedroom while my naked limbs entwined with his. I can’t hold the sob anymore. It bursts free in a tortured wail. My hand flies to my lips and I bite my fist. No falling apart. Even though I gave myself permission to do it once I was alone, this is no time for a meltdown. Only a few hours until Christmas dinner, and I need days to purge all this. I grip the edge of the sink and lean over the marble countertop, avoiding my image in the mirror. My braid slithers over my shoulder like his fingers across my skin. I squeeze my eyes shut and block everything. Bolts absentmindedly extend from my hands. They skitter across the counter and retract like an electric yo-yo. I force a breath into my lungs and hold it then let it seep out. The exhale shakes as it leaves my lips, but I calm, even if just a small amount. On trembling legs, I turn toward the shower and check the water temperature. I slip my fingers beneath the waistband of my boy shorts— Thunk. Something hits the closed door. I freeze. It can’t be Ilif. Not yet. Not here. I hold my breath. Straining for any sound, any indication of which stranger prowls my hallway. Ilif doesn’t know where I live. He’s never been here, but who knows what kind of tracking software he uses to monitor me now. If he’s using Penya to compensate for his shortcomings, he could go anywhere . . . even here. I force air from my lungs before I hyperventilate. I’m a warrior and need to effing act like one. Down the hallway, the floor creaks, but the silence stretches too long for a footstep. I press myself against the door and listen again. Nothing. Steam curls above my head and against the ceiling, swirling and billowing in white clouds. I flick the light off and let my eyes adjust then curl my fingers around the doorknob and twist, concentrating on silence, drawing on all the warrior stealth Constantine taught me. The steam sneaks out before me, my lookout. Tendrils of lightning crisscross my palms. Tensed for battle, I take one big breath and sweep into the hall, silent on bare feet. Something hard strikes my foot and I stumble. Instinctively, I tuck and lean into the momentum. With a roll and twist so I can see my attacker, I come up on one knee, hands splayed with thick bolts of lightning leaping from my palms. Snapping white bolts extend all the way past the bathroom door. The hallway looms empty except for a strange, small book propped against the doorframe. I ease toward it, ready for whoever left it. My ragged breathing and the crackle of electricity are the only noises. Standing, I retract my lightning. I like that my reaction time is getting better. I suppose attacking a book isn’t exactly the right response, but I’d rather be ready than dead. Not that Ilif would kill me . . . but then again, I’m not one hundred percent positive he wouldn’t. I march to the stairs and peer over the railing. Nothing moves. Returning to the book, I crouch and poke at it, but as far as I can tell, it’s exactly what it seems. A leather thong holds the worn cover closed. Deep grooves carve the front, and the edges are worn with what I imagine must have been constant use to make the leather so light. I rub my hand over the smooth surface to wipe away a fine layer of dust then turn it over and examine the back. There’s no writing or anything. No one sneaks into a house, drops off an old book, and leaves. Whoever left this is coming back. Cold fingers of ice trace my spine. Coming to harm or to help. With my luck lately, my money isn’t on help. I tuck the book beneath my arm and turn off the shower. Silence. Still half-naked, I creep upstairs, but all the rooms are empty. Downstairs is the same. I don’t get it. Taking a breath, I relax. It’s no good for me to stay wound this tight. I need to chill until they face me. Nothing I can do until then. I retrace my steps and burrow into the corner of the couch, tucking my feet beneath me. I undo the book’s strap and ease the cover open. Hard slashes of script mark the page, punching me in the gut and yanking me instantly to another place. My fingers trace the letters, recognizing the handwriting from a map drawn nearly two thousand years ago while I stood next to him. If this is someone’s idea of a joke, it’s beyond brutal. I see him bent over this book, pouring out thoughts, dreams, plans . . . A sob wrenches from my throat, but I choke it down before it breaks completely free. My lips tremble and I bite them hard until my breathing slows. I try again. On the page, the words shift from Latin to English. Aurelia mortuus est hodie. They blur, and I wipe my eyes and spread the tears on my bare thigh in a long, wet streak. When I begin again, the rich timbre of Constantine’s voice carries the words to my heart. Aurelia died today. Without me there to save her. She died alone while I busied away the day on trifles of war. A mystery flood carried her away from me forever. Such pain. I am without breath. My grief threatens to consume me. To kill me. Oh, I wish it could. I would die in a flame of grief if it could take away this pain. My sweet Aurelia is gone. Gone, not to a husband I could choose, but to a lover who stole her from me without warning or apology. My heart twists until I can’t breathe, but I force myself to keep reading. I flip a chunk of pages to another entry, months later... I relive the morning of her journey again and again. I search my memory for some indicator of the storm, but I find nothing. I remember her face that morning, her jubilation to visit her friends . . . her laughter. I hear it, chasing me through the halls. She calls to me from the grave, beckons me to come and play. This life needs me for something, though I know not what. I can feel it like an abrasion under my finger, for it is the only other feeling I have beyond my pain. I tire of this grief. Would that I could take my sword to it. I miss her. I miss her so. My hands drop and the pages fan closed in a cascade of sorrow. There’s more, but I can’t bear another word. Every page is full. When we were together, he brushed the edge of his misery with me, but not like this. I didn’t know . . . “Oh, Constantine.” I close my eyes and relive the aching horror when we saw a glimpse of her. In that split second I got a clue about how losing her devastated him, but somehow, seeing such emotion in his own hand . . . It kills me. Our time together was so short. My chest constricts. Even if we’d had the time, he wouldn’t have shared this. To expose this much vulnerability would have been a weakness. And now Penya wants me to find Aurelia and save her before he has to go through this. Eradicate all of this sorrow and pain from his life. And change the man I know . . . I correct myself, the man I thought I knew. My fingers hover above the pages then curl into a fist. To prevent this, I’d do anything. With a sigh, I let my head drop back against the couch. My fingers drift to the pages and across each indentation of his words. There has to be more to Aurelia’s story. Either Penya isn’t telling me the whole story or she doesn’t know. Ancestor to a famous scientist, sure, but who will she be? A mother, a wife . . . I can’t accept that she’s nothing more than an incubator for greatness. My thoughts drift, bouncing and floating from one to another. Drowsy from the emotional beating, it takes me a minute to realize the bright column of light shining in the middle of the room isn’t coming from a window. Silvery and cylindrical, it slowly rotates counterclockwise—I jerk upright—like last time she visited after the kidnapping. “Penya!” I dive off the couch and kneel beside the emerging shape. It morphs and shifts into her short, earthy silhouette. Though she’s transparent and some sort of projection, I can make out all her features, but nothing about where she is. I lean closer. “Where are you? You still haven’t told me how you’re projecting your image here.” Her face falls and she glances over her shoulder, waving my question away with a violent swat. My hands fly to cover my mouth. I didn’t think about someone hearing me on her side. After listening for something I can’t see, she turns back then spots the journal on the couch behind me and clasps her hands together. “Good, good.” Her voice sounds far away, like she’s standing at the end of a tunnel. “I was not certain the journal would travel without me.” “You left it?” “Who else? Ilif will not help you. He has almost figured out Aurelia’s connection. You must complete the alteration now.” “Her connection? What does that mean? Like her connection to Constantine? And it’s Christmas. I have a family dinner in four hours.” “I have no time to explain, and you will return in time.” I bristle. “You don’t know that. Last time cost me six months.” “You must risk it. If Ilif gets to her first . . .” She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. “Go now. There is no time to lose.” I grind my teeth and point at her chest. “Not this time. You’re not leaving me in the dark again. Where are you? How do I get to you?” “Ilif’s new lab is all I know—” I cross my arms. “Okay, about that. You guys worked together? Didn’t you think that was worth mentioning?” She glances behind her again and lowers her voice until I can hardly hear her. “It was long ago. We have no time for this, Evy.” “No. Not a long time ago. In my future!” I don’t know when I’m going to see her again, and I need this information. She sighs. “Yes, your future.” “How are you traveling? You’re here, but you’re not, just like in the forest. What did he do to you?” “This is why you must hurry. He is developing new methods of travel. Aurelia’s sudden death wiped out an entire line of scientists. Ones he needed.” So much information . . . I squeeze my eyes shut. Think, Evy. Ask the right questions. “What is Ilif working on?” Her image leans closer. “I do not know. I promise I do not. But you are strong enough to handle the answers this time. I promise you will know everything as I do.” My lightning flickers at her praise. “I will learn more. He leaves me for days at a time—but there may be stretches when I cannot get to you. I must go.” “Wait!” I press forward, grinding my knees into the bamboo floorboards. “What time are you in right now—when are you?” “I have not pinpointed an exact date. Same with our location. To say Ilif put a good deal of thought into this lab is an understatement. When I do get to wander, it is fully contained and he does not permit me beyond the building.” “Then how are you traveling?” “I used the tracking software to locate you and project this image, but otherwise, my physical form is captive. I also think he found a way to block certain places from arcs, starting with this one.” “I’ll find you.” My heart tightens at the thought of losing her. She’s the only one who ever seems to be on my side. “I am your smallest problem. Worry for Aurelia. You must save her before Ilif interferes. Your alterations are different enough that he cannot manipulate them, but it is only a matter of time. And his determination is endless. Aurelia is too important. Whatever he is working on centers around her. You must get to her first.” My empty gut clenches. “No pressure.” Her head jerks to the right and she watches something in her time that I can’t see. “Save Aurelia. Now.” A dangerous undertone in her whisper snakes a chill up my spine. She vanishes. “Penya!” My hand grasps air, and I press my fist against my forehead. Dammit. There are so many reasons I don’t want to go right now. A night in my own bed would be nice . . . I’m at least taking a shower before I go. Dread seeps through my bones and I stand. While I’d love to join in her optimism, my arcs don’t work like that. I’ll be lucky to get back here today, let alone before dinner. The soles of my feet stick to the wood floor, smacking loudly as I return to the bathroom and start the shower. After dropping my panties, I step under the spray and unbraid my hair. Dark strands cling to my fingers. As I rinse them down the drain, my mind is consumed with what’s coming. This time will be different. This time I’m knowingly trying to alter history. There is so much uncertainty at the beginning of an alteration. I never know what intersection of someone’s life is the perfect point for me to change things . . . where we’ll meet . . . who will be there. Or in this case, if a certain someone will be there. Vanilla infuses the steam as I squirt bodywash into my palm and lather up. My shoulders are fuller and there’s muscle beneath my curves. I ignore what the new shape of my arms means and quickly soap my chest—no danger of those getting muscley—then race across my flatter stomach and over my full hips. I’m surprised that the training with Constantine would have such an effect on me so soon, and I definitely don’t want to look like he does. I liked my soft curves. I miss them. Shampoo slides in soapy tracks down my face, and I turn into the hot water and refocus. Ilif is still the biggest uncertainty, precariously balanced between bad guy and worst co-worker on the face of Earth. No chance he’s lightened up on his feelings about females, and since I’m still wearing a set of boobs, we’re at an impasse. No way I trust his recent crazy-train flip-flop—he wanted to use me. I towel off and head upstairs to my bedroom. A pair of chocolate-brown leather pants are still folded on the end of my bed, but as I slip my fingers beneath the buttery softness, I pause. Finding Aurelia while she’s still alive puts me pre-149 BC, and I know she died in Rome. I toss my pants back on the bed and scout the closet for something less barbaric. The only skirt I have is from someone’s funeral, a pinstriped black number with a slit up the back, not exactly something I can traipse about in ancient Rome. I finger the top rack, letting my hand travel across my long-sleeved tees, my cashmere sweaters . . . at least now the juxtaposition of my wardrobe makes more sense. I’m not meant to live in one time period. Time traveler or no, nothing here will work. Last time, Constantine’s sister, Anna, made me the greatest wardrobe ever. I miss those clothes. Maybe if I get better at arcing I’ll figure out how to bring stuff home with me. For now, it’s incredibly annoying, so I resort to the leather pants, a matched set of baby-blue bra and panties, and a seaweed-green tee. With leather motorcycle boots and wet, braided hair, I stride back to the living room and stand in Penya’s empty spot. The journal mocks me. I pick it up and close it tightly then tuck it in the back of my pants. I inhale and quit stalling. Arms relaxed, palms open, I let go of everything else and let the lightning come. White bolts spark from my fingertips, writhing and crackling against each other, slipping backward over my elbow and stretching toward the floor. With deliberate slowness, I bring my hands together until they’re eight inches apart. Attraction pulls the bolts together into an electric ball. I picture Aurelia, her spirit, her love of life and of friends, and her willfulness. Black arms of nothingness open wide and embrace me in an all-consuming possession. I am deaf, blind, and mute. And for once, my heart doesn’t hurt. Chapter Two I arrive in Rome on the wings of sunrise. Wisps of an orange and pink sky bleed into morning blue, and the sun shines bright from the east, already warming the dry air. Over rooftops, grand buildings rise in the distance, oddly pristine and unfamiliar. My shoulders relax and I take the first deep breath of the week. This is going to be a cinch—no rain, no flood. Hopefully I can get in and out without a single issue. Pride puffs up my chest. I’m getting good at this. In front of me, tall box elms create an impenetrable wall around a home’s garden and repeat again near what looks like a rear entry into the house. Hand-painted and etched pots overflow with bright blossoms. Clusters of them dot the space and cuddle up to several benches scattered throughout the garden. Beyond the lazy floating butterflies and working bees, the garden is silent and empty. Everyone must still be inside this morning. I hesitate and scan the entire back wall of the house, not sure I can sneak in without being seen—especially if my plan is to keep Aurelia from leaving. I step forward and a familiar blonde steps through the doorway, making me duck back behind a hedge. I’ve only seen Aurelia once before, but it must have been last week, because she looks the same. Curls held back by a gold braid frame a heart-shaped face, round with youthful pudginess. I slip behind a tall container bursting with tall, fluffy-headed grass so I can study her in secret. She’s barely as tall as I am and dressed in a simple tunic pinned at the shoulders with matching brooches. Turning to respond to a question, the curls spill down her back, stopping just short of the matching gold braid around her teeny waist. She skirts a narrow table and sits, smiling up at a servant as he sets a fruit plate and bread in front of her. “Aurelia?” I jerk toward the voice that haunts my dreams and try to dislodge my heart from my throat while I press deeper into the foliage. Greenery leans across my face, but I can still make out every single one of Constantine’s features as he comes outside. Golden eyes assess every possible threat and a youthful bunching of freckles dust his cheekbones. His demeanor changes and he scans the garden, pausing on my location. Aurelia looks up, but I can’t shift my attention off Constantine. While he stares intently at my etched clay planter, I curl my fingers around the lip and try to suck breath into my collapsed windpipe. Whenever I am, however long it will be until he touches me, his raw handsomeness makes all the wrong parts of my body take notice. Impossibly tall, Constantine is somewhere between the thick, wide warrior I first met, and the lean death machine who trained me to be the same. His dark blond curls are cut close to his head and his fingers twitch constantly. I wonder when he got that nervous tic under control. “Papa.” He snaps back to Aurelia and rubs the edge of his eyebrow. “Me paenitet. Ego vidi.” Sorry. I thought I saw something. Their Latin shifts in my head. I’m still not sure how that works, but I’ve stopped questioning. She lifts a small hand to his forearm. “You worry too much.” He smiles, and the sheer joy of it illuminates his entire face. I press my lips together and my heart finds a regular rhythm. “You don’t worry enough.” He sits on the adjacent bench. She nibbles a slice of fruit ad he plucks a slice of pear off the plate. “What time are you leaving?” “Rom is bringing the chariot this afternoon.” I sigh, and the gust makes the grass wave. About time I had an easy one. I loosen my grip on the planter and straighten. As soon as Constantine leaves, I’ll figure out how to stop her. He stands and rubs the back of his neck. He’s made that gesture a thousand times with me . . . something is bothering him, but he’s trying to hide it. I narrow my eyes and study each nuance of his body language, but even now he’s a master at secrecy. Unaware, Aurelia wipes her fingers, jumps up, and throws her arms around his waist. His eyes squeeze closed. I lean closer. He drops a quick kiss on her head and tucks his emotion away before she lets go. “I’ll be home in a week, Papa.” He straightens and clears his throat. “I’ll talk to Rom and ensure he’s readied everything. Though I don’t know why I bother. He worries about you more than I.” She bites her lip and a blush reddens her cheeks. If he notices, he doesn’t say anything but squeezes her shoulder, then returns to the house. Aurelia fidgets, straightens her belt, and trails in his wake. I want to run after him, make him remember me, tell him not to be such a jackass from the get-go so we can have more good moments. But I don’t because it won’t matter, because that time is over for me, even if it hasn’t yet come for him. Biting my lower lip, I step from behind the planter and creep toward the table, skirting a splashing fountain. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and I cringe. Constantine’s journal is warm against my back, and I pull it out. Keeping it will only make this harder after I’m gone. I lift it, press the leather against my lips in a silent goodbye, and set it next to Aurelia’s plate, fingers lingering for one last second. “Read this,” I whisper, and my throat tightens. “Remember me. Remember us.” Straightening my shoulders, I step toward the door. Light flashes to my left and I spin. Ilif’s image materializes next to the fountain and I leap behind the hedge near the door. Shit. Shit. Shit. That’s what I get for having a sentimental moment about Constantine. I should have grabbed Aurelia the second I could. If Ilif’s here, he’s obviously not into playing nice. He’s out to win. No chance. I separate the branches of the hedge and glare across the small yard. Dressed in a dark-brown suit today, that superfuck straightens his tie, aligning the blue and brown stripes with the horizon. The light-brown pattern on his shirt does nothing to enhance his translucent skin. Spindly fingers smooth the gray hair at his temples, making me smile at the amount now peppering his shiny black pompadour. When he’s artfully arranged his entire countenance enough to make me gag, he moves around the back of the fountain. Not a chance he’s going to get any closer to screwing this up. I burst through the hedge and splash through the basin, drawing a long rope of lightning between my outstretched arms as I race toward him. Errant strands leap from my hands and ricochet off the water. He jerks away, but not before his features contort with betrayal, quickly covering a trace of awe. Fueled by his rage, I flex my knees and lunge. He flickers and ducks, but I catch him in the side of the face with my right hand. He solidifies, and a triple fork of lightning erupts from the fountain as I flare my own. I wrap my arm around his neck, and a sharp pain spears the base of my spine as we disappear. Blackness rips him from my grasp and tumbles me backward. The pain ebbs as a high afternoon sun blinds me. I crouch and search the flat white landscape for that scuttling cockroach, Ilif, but there’s only me. In the distance, mountains rise from the glaring expanse of nothing. I pinch the white dirt. It’s crusty and coarse. Straightening, I study the horizon again and frown. I’m on either the Salt Flats near home in Utah or an alien planet. Okay, so this is new. Like I need more things to figure out. I prod the muscles of my back, trying to recreate the pain, but fail. I twist and lift my shirt. No wound, not even a red mark. Whatever that weirdness was in Rome, the arc healed it. Even so, something made my lightning go haywire. All that should have happened was that my lightning created interference so it was impossible for Ilif to stay. At least that’s how it worked last time. So where is he? And where am I? This is a disaster. Just when I have a small grasp on my lightning and how it works—or at least the arcing part, I find another new component. This is such bullshit. I rub my forehead and focus on the Ilif part for now. When we were in Spain and I used my lightning, I never bothered to figure out where the interference caused him to go. All I cared was that he wasn’t with me anymore. I’m not sure if he goes back to the same place every time, or if I’ve screwed up his life enough to keep him busy. That would be too handy . . . so, no. I need to expect him back at Aurelia’s side any moment. With another quick look around at the barren plains, I open my hands and fill them with twin balls of lightning. Blackness holds me only briefly, and the silence of the salt morphs into the roar of water. Color and the pungency of wetlands surround me as heat and sunlight become misting droplets of rain beneath a gray sky that I recognize instantly. The river is louder than when Constantine and I arced here after Aurelia’s death. I’m at the same narrow section, flanked on either side by thick trees that make it impossible to see upstream past the sharp bend to the right. Easy to see how people could get lured into a false sense of security. The river looks peaceful, especially since the changing landscape works as a distraction. An uneasy lump forms in my stomach, and I pull a strand of lightning from my fingertips and slowly tease it longer then let it snap back and repeat the motion while I scan for something sinister. Downstream, the trees fade quickly into reeds as the ground becomes smooth clay. The bank is sloping and beachy. A nice contrast to the cliffs and rocks at the bend beneath the tree roots, enough to make someone forget they’re basically standing in a tight canyon. People die like that every year back home, trapped in narrow canyons when the rainwater comes. Though nothing looks obviously out of place or deadly, the tall walls will make escape impossible—just like home. I snuff my lightning. Twenty feet farther downriver stands an arched bridge. Thick with a short railing, it spans the water in a wide curve with massive supports of stone rising from the water. Roman architecture doesn’t skimp, and even here their brilliance shines through. There’s a dirt road leading up to it, but the reeds obscure parts from where I am. The cramping is back in my stomach. I tug at my collar as raindrops slip beneath the cotton fabric of my shirt. No time to whine about the weather, I push through the reeds and stop at the edge of the road. Travelers wander along, warily skirting me and averting their gazes. Long, deserted silences stretch between the large groups as they hurry through the light rain. If I’ve landed here now, that can only mean Aurelia’s chariot will come around the corner within the next few minutes. I need to quit with the sightseeing and make a plan that will convince her she can’t cross the river. I wince and bite my lip. If her driver is more protective than Constantine, he’s not going to be an easy sell. As the road twists away from the river, wide expanses of barren soil flank both sides. The reeds are confined to a few feet next to the river, but otherwise, short, brittle grass grows in patches. Hugging the road’s left side, a wide hill slopes gently upward a good twenty feet, at least enough to get us out of immediate harm. It’s topped with a group of trees that flow down the side, hop the road, and continue on a parallel path to the river. Though there isn’t an actual road to the top, the grass won’t be tough to navigate. When I was here with Constantine, I realized horses are just ancient four-wheelers, so a half-decent charioteer shouldn’t have an issue, and I’m positive Constantine wouldn’t entrust Aurelia to a novice. I jam my fists into my hips and scowl at the horizon. There has to be a reasonable way to get Aurelia and her driver off the main road and climbing up a random hill. An occasional shrub dots the landscape, but nothing that can help me divert the chariot’s path. The most obvious plan is to use my lightning to scare everyone away, but I don’t trust the reaction. If I stand in the middle of the road and play the sorceress, odds are good the charioteer will just drive around me, probably with spit and well-deserved curse—most definitely a sword aimed at my head—all while inciting a complete panic and speeding Aurelia to her death. Saving that option for last. Thunder rumbles in the distance and the edges of the clouds darken. More pedestrians hurry along the road, and I study their paths to see if that helps me at all. They stay to the confines of the road for the most part, but big groups spread into wide swaths and overflow the road into the short grass. I glance over my shoulder at the racing water. I swear it’s moving faster. A few more inches of reeds are beneath the surface now. Penya’s flickering light spears the dirt next to me and I jump sideways. “Where have you been?” I wipe my hands on my pants. “Ilif was at Aurelia’s. I tried to flare my lightning to get him out, but it flung me to the Salt Flats. What’s that all about?” “Possibly his attempts to tamper with the arc. I told you he was close, and that is why we cannot waste time trying to get me out of here. Not yet. Save Aurelia. What have you figured out?” I rub the end of my braid across my lips. “Nothing yet. It’s not like I can flag her down and ask her to please wait by the side of the road.” “Why not?” I flounder, opening and closing my mouth while my brain tries to compute a snappy retort. A raindrop slips off my lip and onto my tongue. “Stop making life so difficult. Simplicity is key.” She moves closer. “Life is the same, Evy. Yet you doubt.” She sighs and reaches for me. Her face softens and her eyes betray a pride she hasn’t revealed before now. “Life is not this complicated series of tests and struggles you seem to imagine. It is meant to be lived, not endured. How many of the struggles in your life have you created? Stop inventing obstacles. Stop making arcing harder than it has to be. Your alterations will continue to be massive complications if you do not start looking past the impossible.” I shudder and my heartbeat hammers against my breastbone. Easy for her to say. Thunder cracks, and the center of a storm cloud to the west starts a clockwise rotation. My shirt is soaked through at the shoulders now. I inhale and consider all the possibilities. Behind my lids I envision my goal. There has to be a way to get Aurelia safe. A simple way. “I can arc her.” Penya’s swift inhale isn’t encouraging. “Simple, I said.” “Work with me here.” “Not without preparation,” she says. “I spent months with Constantine working on it, and then you prepared him well for the actual moment he traveled. Even with your disaster in the glen, he had been readied.” “But it worked. I just need to get her out of here. I’m not teaching her to travel, so I can just grab her like I did in the glen, right? I even arced the horse, so surely I can arc a girl. I’m talking about when I arced him with my lightning—not when he traveled on his own. If she uses mine, won’t it work the same way?” In what I’d come to know as her you’re-going-to-be-the-death-of-me gesture, Penya taps her index finger against her lips. I cross my arms. “You said anyone could time travel.” “Yes, but under reasonable circumstances. By trying it here, you risk much. Arcing a virgin traveler must be your last resort. And you must move with her, like Constantine.” “How much prep does she need?” “She is Constantine’s, which leads me to believe she will need less than most, but still . . .” “I’ll try to get them to stop, but—” She jerks toward something over my shoulder and disappears. I spin. A chariot crests the small hill with Aurelia in it beside a towering black man. Behind me, Penya’s voice carries down a long tunnel. “Think of all possibilities. Do not disregard what seems impossible. There is no impossible. Not for you.” I flinch. Splashes of water spray behind Aurelia’s chariot. At this pace, I have minutes. Don’t disregard what seems impossible, Penya said. Well, that’s about everything. Not a lot of ways to stop a chariot. All I have is a lot of lightning, and maybe a little luck. They’re forced to slow behind a large group clogging the road. I glance behind me. The river has risen to cover at least another foot of reeds. They would have been up and over the bridge without this latest delay. Less than a mile separates me from the chariot. Impossible. Unless I arc there. “Too reckless,” I say to the damp air. Any arc I try between now and the alteration costs me. Each one will jump time forward and pull me closer to her death. And considering I’ve only managed to hit my target once out of all the times I’ve arced, this is not my best idea. Never mind that this time I’m trying to hit a moving one and not kill or maim anybody. My heart pounds, nearly deafening me to every other sound. Thunder rumbles, and a blanket of humidity drops from the sky. I can taste the moisture. I have to try, even if the next one leaves me only seconds. At the hint of request, twin snakes of lightning tumble from my palms and darkness blinds me. I land ten feet behind the chariot and scare an old woman carrying a basket of greens. She screams and runs away, cursing about gods and their storm. I arc back to my starting point, jumping me forward ten seconds. Now I have less than a quarter mile to get this right, and my aim is worse than usual. I compress another ball, keeping it tight against my belly. This time when I land, the chariot wheel skims my shin and Aurelia’s startled face whips backward as she goes by. The driver flicks the reins, and the horse surges through the crowd then slows hard in a bottleneck. Last chance. No more errors. I focus every particle of thought on the horse, on feeling its warm skin beneath my hands, short slick bay coat beneath my palms. I picture weaving the wiry mane through my fingers, feeling the harness bounce beneath me. Lightning flares into an egg shape and stretches into a jagged square. I scowl and force it into a normal ball and arc before it changes again. My feet slip on the sweaty leather as I land on the horse’s back. Crap. Too much movement. I yelp like a sissy and fall forward onto the horse’s neck. Frantic, I grab a handful of mane, push up into a half crouch, and squint through the pelting rain. Since I can barely ride a horse with a saddle, I’m not sure why I thought this was a doable idea. I dig the toes of my boots under the wet harness across the base of its neck and situate myself. The horse surges ahead and bucks, not happy about me, I’m sure. I crouch lower, drop a knee to the middle of the horse’s bouncing back, and twist around. The reins hang loose in the driver’s hand, and his mouth is frozen in shock. Aurelia peeks under his outstretched arm, more curious than scared. Taking advantage of the slack, the horse lengthens his stride, making me lose my precious balance. I slip sideways and roll, but manage to hang on through the biting leather twisting my fingers. One boot sails over my head and through the air then smacks hard against the packed road. My legs are stretched enough to win the lead in a ballet competition, but I push my foot deeper into the harness and press my heel against the horse. Every muscle from my ankle to my hip is on fire. I bear down and force my legs together, pulling myself back on. The driver regains his senses and yanks the horse to a stop. I pat the bay’s neck, and damp hairs stick to my hand. I wipe it on the bottom of my shirt but don’t slide off, wary of giving them any opportunity to flee. Aurelia pokes her head around the giant driver. “Why, it’s just a girl.” I smile back. Been a while since I’ve been called that. “Es in periculo, Aurelia.” You’re in danger, Aurelia. “There’s a flood coming. I know this is drastic. Showing up on your horse—” “How did you appear like that? Will you teach me?” A smile sweetens Aurelia’s face. My own widens into a grin. I can’t help it. It shouldn’t surprise me that Aurelia can take my arrival in stride. After all, Constantine did. “Let’s worry about you first.” Beneath me, the horse fidgets, and I swing my leg over his rump and slide to the ground. A ball of nerves quivers in my stomach and I step quickly away from his fidgeting hooves. For now, Aurelia’s curiosity will keep her from bolting, so I ease my way around the back of the chariot. I smile at her again and avoid eye contact with the seething driver. “I need you to turn around. There’s a flood coming.” The driver sweeps Aurelia behind him and puts his big body between us. “Who are you? The river appears fine. This is mere rain. We can make it if we hurry. Your intrusion is our only delay.” His tone lowers. “Any threat against Aurelia will cost you more than your magic, sorceress.” Great, here we go again with the sorceress thing. I force a smile and hold up my hands. “I’m not here to harm her. That’s the last time you’ll see my magic.” I hope. Aurelia turns back to me. “How do you know who I am?” This might get tricky. “I know your father. He sent me to save you.” From another time. “Why didn’t he tell me not to go today?” I slowly lower my hands. “There’s a lot I don’t have time to tell you. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me. If I’m wrong, you can go in an hour.” Aurelia lays a hand on the driver’s arm. “Rom? What if she speaks truth? We could use a break. I wouldn’t mind setting a small meal.” He dips his chin, and in the depth of his gaze something else mixes with his duty to obey her. I bite back the smile. Wears his heart on his sleeve where Aurelia’s concerned . . . Pretty sure I can use that against him if I need it. His head lowers in a silent bow of acquiescence. “We can return to the small copse of trees before the hill if you wish.” When he turns his attention to me, all softness is gone, replaced by hard features that immediately convey the threat. “Will that suffice?” “I don’t know,” I answer honestly. “Stay alert. We might need to move quickly.” Aurelia presses to the far side of the chariot and gestures to the extra space. “Come.” I step onto the woven leather floor and reach around Aurelia to grab a handhold. Pretty sure Rom won’t make any effort to keep me in the vehicle. As I settle myself, Aurelia’s fingertips brush my pants. I stiffen, but she gives me a shy smile as she faces forward. Rom turns the chariot around with a flick of the reins, and as the wheels pivot, it’s impossible to miss the black sky to the north. The short hairs rising on my nape have nothing to do with the drenching rain, and I shiver as icy tentacles tighten around my limbs. Rom pulls us to a halt again and we stare openmouthed at the utter blackness. He glances over his shoulder and studies me. He’s still not happy about the added delay, but his resentment slips away as the sky darkens. I check the swirler of a cloud. A huge circle is turning and the eye has a definite cone shape forming toward the earth. Thunder rumbles and the breeze picks up, pushing debris across the road and whipping at nearby pedestrians’ clothes and possessions. The horse fidgets and jerks Rom’s arms and upper body forward. He searches the traffic pattern of the people, his head on a swivel. I track his movements and bite my lip. We don’t have many options to get us out of the crowd. He sends us through a tiny opening and turns us off the road, coaxing the bay forward up the hill. People are everywhere. I can barely tell where the road ends. We ease our way over the short grass that’s now been trampled by hundreds of feet. Another large group crests from the backside at the same time, and Rom slows us to a walk until we’re through the crowd’s thickest part. Restless, the horse swings his frontend to the left and pushes a man and boy deeper into the thick pulsing mob. Rom croons to the big bay and leans forward to stroke the dark hip. The gesture doesn’t calm any of us. I don’t like this. Waiting it out seems too easy. Too vulnerable. I’d rather get her out of here. “We’re almost there.” Aurelia grips the front of the bucket and leans forward. At the top of the hill, the clumps of trees make small pockets of dry ground, but if this storm gets any worse, it’s not the brightest spot to wait out a lightning storm. That would be my luck though . . . save Aurelia from a flood to kill her with regular lightning. I scan the landscape. For now, there’s no other place to run. A baby screams and the bay rears, scattering the rest of the travelers around the chariot and inching us back down the hill until I can no longer see over the top. While Rom wrestles to get the horse controlled, I glance again at the storm clouds. They’ve doubled in size, roiling like an overflowing pot of black oil. Not good. Rom curses, and I wonder if he’s reconsidering his ban on my sorcery. The slightly inconvenient mist becomes real rain, quieting the wind, but drenching us within seconds. Time to go. I’ve given Rom long enough to get us out of here. I grip the chariot’s iron scrollwork until it bites my palms. I close my eyes and breathe. This has to work. The ozone stings my nostrils, and I fight to control my racing heart and the panic of screwing this up. Constantine’s angry tirade of the last time doesn’t help, and I silence the memory. Bad enough it’s his daughter I’m saving. Lightning flares from my fingers and I make the coil swing beneath the bucket. Pedestrians closest to the chariot freak out and press away, tightening the crowd and squashing the spaces Rom was using to maneuver the horse through. Doesn’t matter. I tighten my grip, dig deep, and curl another strand around the top of the bucket to get us out of there. The lightning flares and jerks away from the bucket then slams it like a battering ram. Darkness flickers. I hold tight to the image of Constantine’s house, but something yanks it away like a paper in a storm. Images layer over the top of each other and we spin left, then right like we’re in a psychotic tornado. We crash-land at the river’s edge, behind the entire group, giving up every foot we’d gained. The horse backs up faster than I’ve ever seen him go forward, and Rom does nothing to stop him. Aurelia grabs Rom’s arm and raises her voice. “Rom!” Crap. I knew he wouldn’t be able to handle it, but Aurelia was supposed to be safe. It was supposed to be worth the risk. Not this. Not both parts wrong. I don’t understand why nothing works like it’s supposed to. Rom gives himself a hard shake, but he wobbles and sags against the side of the chariot. I lean forward and slap the horse hard enough to make my entire hand sting and my elbow ache. He jumps to a stop, snorts, and takes a tentative step forward. Aurelia puts her hands on Rom’s cheek, and her touch pulls him out of his stupor. His eyes lose their glassiness and he smothers her fingers with his own. I give him half a second to recover. “No time for this!” My terseness jerks him upright and he sweeps Aurelia behind him. “You said no more magic.” “Really?” I yell. “You pick now to chew me out?” I point at the river less than three feet from the wheels of the chariot. He glares at me and pats the horse’s quivering rump. The tight skin by his lips is still an ashy gray. Scooping the reins, he swallows and clucks softly while he rubs the horse’s coat. It seems scared. Super glad we’re tied to the damn thing with a thousand straps and buckles. At least jumping out is closer to the ground than jumping off. “Now what?” Rom yells while his head whips back and forth, eying one end of the crowd to the other. The path to the top of the hill is covered with people frantic to cross the river. We are so screwed. I completely robbed us of every gain. Overhead, thunder rumbles. Both the road and path to the top of the hill clog with travelers, and not just the group we met. That bunch is almost to the bridge, but there’s a constant stream rounding the hill, creating a massive bottleneck. Very few take the small walkway toward the town on this side of the river, choosing instead to head toward the bridge. Maybe if most of the group were able-bodied young men, this wouldn’t have disaster written all over it, but moms carry babies and parcels, men lead animals and wagons loaded with cages of goods, and clumps of elderly men and women block the passage of everyone else. Easygoing attitudes fall by the wayside as more people push and shove to get over the river. I wish I’d have taken the time to get a better view of the backside of the hill when we were on top. “Where are these people coming from?” “The city,” Rom answers with a grunt as the horse leaps forward. “They went in to trade early this morn, but know the river will trap them if they don’t cross before the storm.” I glare at him. Just “mere rain,” my ass. He knew this was coming. He scowls back, the unsaid threat clear. Do not alarm Aurelia any more than you already have. Then stop working against me. I scowl back. He breaks contact as Aurelia says, “Those people will die if she speaks the truth. We cannot let them.” Rom stiffens and glances at me. Now the unsaid is worry and a plea. I’m in agreement and grip Aurelia’s elbow. “You can’t go. I’m here to keep you safe. There’s no way I’m letting you anywhere near that water.” She leans dangerously over the edge of the chariot. “But all those poor people.” I open my mouth and close it again. Nothing I can say will make this easier. But I can’t exactly stand here and watch them die, either. “Will you stay?” I ask her. “If Rom and I go to save them, will you stay put?” She sucks her lower lip between her teeth and nods. “I promise.” A worried pallor lightens the skin around Rom’s cheekbones. “This is a bad idea. We need to worry about Aurelia.” “But those people—” she says. “Are not you,” Rom says, interrupting and lowering his intense gaze until their noses almost touch. She plants her hands on her hips, lifts her chin, and glares back, managing to look imposing. “You will obey me, Rom.” He crosses his arms and mimics her. “I obey your father.” “Fine, then I’ll tell him you killed hundreds of people today and put me in danger.” His flinch is nearly imperceptible. If anything, he increases in size. “You wouldn’t dare.” “Would, too.” “Seconds matter here, people,” I say, interrupting. “Aurelia, I agree with Rom. Your safety is paramount.” “Look.” She points toward an outcropping on the other side of the road. “Take me there and I’ll wait. I promise not to stray.” The spot isn’t as high as I’d like, but we might have plenty of time to get her out of here before the water rises much more. Unless something goes wrong. A shiver coils around my spine. This is stupid. I need to get her safe, not the rest of these people. Ilif would never let a tourist get in the way of an arc. “No.” “Please.” She grabs my arm and tugs. “All these children. Please.” The plea in her voice breaks my heart, and for no other reason than because Ilif wouldn’t, I relent. Unless Rom tells her no. Rom uncrosses his arms. “Five attempts,” he says. “After that, we go.” Dammit. She looks to me for a counter, but I nod. An uneasy nausea builds as she beams and kisses our cheeks. First mine and then Rom’s, with a lingering touch at his jawline. Even though I avoid his attention, there’s no mistaking Rom’s glare as he urges the horse toward the outcropping. “Use your magic if it will keep her safe.” I clench my jaw. This is beyond stupid. I assume his reference to five “attempts” gives me less than fifteen minutes. Barely enough time to alert everyone near the bridge and get the stragglers across it, but hopefully it’s enough for Aurelia. Rom eases us back through the swarm of people until the outcropping edges alongside the chariot. Raindrops slide down my forehead and drip from my jaw, but I’ve stopped trying to stay dry. Hordes of travelers bump against our metal basket, making it sway and rock in the wheelset. Any confidence I’ve had in its construction wanes. Every small movement grates on my nerves, and I can almost hear the second hand of an invisible clock ticking loudly beside my ear. The horse prances in time to the second hand, our own personal metronome of impending doom. Aurelia turns to Rom. “Be safe. Please come back to me. . .” He lifts a dark hand to her porcelain cheek, but halts before making contact, leaving a stretch of air between them. Aurelia presses forward, closing the inches. His caress is butterfly soft. “I must come back. Who else will keep you from trouble?” She doesn’t laugh at his weak attempt at levity, but curls her slim fingers around his, answering his unsaid feelings. A cold river of rain leaks under my collar. I force myself not to fidget. Come on, come on. He clears his throat and straightens, dropping his arm. She spins and grabs my hands. “Come back and teach me these fantastic things you know.” I bite back my antsiness. She’s a whole lot of Constantine with a sprinkle of his sister, Anna. I could like her. But first, I have to save her. Keep reading Shadow Boxer on Amazon. To download the first book in the series, Lightning Rider, for FREE.",

      "content": "Chapter One And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. — Matthew 26:51-52 I relaxed into the stylist’s chair. This was a well-deserved luxury and one I didn’t do often. Most of the time I kept my dark hair in a braid or simple ponytail so it stayed contained and out of my way. Sunlight filtered through the wide windows of the salon, bathing me in warm, bright light that didn’t quite penetrate to the shadows I’d tucked deep inside my heart. Steel and glass reflected sunbeams and scattered brilliant rainbows of color across my skin, peppering me with diamonds. Even here, the heavens transcended my life, blurring the lines between reality and the surreal. Today’s decadence was a nice reprieve from recent events that had my nerves on high alert. I still had a hard time stringing together that a few short months ago, I’d come home from my fiancé’s funeral to be drawn into a search for a trio of religious relics that together, would open a gate to hell. Oh, and the guy calling the shots? The earthly man, Enoch, who ascended into heaven to become the archangel, Metatron. My normal life as an assassin killing drug dealers and sex traffickers was a thousand times easier than dealing with the unearthly world and Metatron’s challenges. I sighed. I didn’t want to think about Metatron and all the upcoming tasks he’d given me, not right now. For sixteen more minutes, I could hide here in the salon and pretend that my otherworldly To Do list didn’t exist. The appointment had been on the book for months and when my reminder had popped up this morning, I’d almost cancelled, but my ratio of normal to unbelievable was low as it was. This would add a gram or two to tip the scale back the other way. Mika, my stylist, drew a round brush through my damp hair and flicked on the hair dryer, plunging me into a welcome sound bubble of my own thoughts. Metatron wasn’t letting me tackle this mission by myself, though. Oh, no… He’d given me a fantastic assembly of a team. I had a scholar as ancient as the religious relics he knew as well as the liver spots on his own hand—though with his slipping mind, my confidence level of his wisdom slipped daily. But he made up for those memory gaps with a fierce fervor for this cause. He knew everything there was to know about the Book of Enoch, Metatron’s personal bible of all things heavenly, earthly, and below. Then there was Clay, my partner in crime and a brilliant yet flippant thief who didn’t take anything seriously, except maybe the day’s fantasy-football picks. Rounding out the stellar grouping was my aging mentor, currently recovering from hip surgery. He’d brought me up after my parents’ murder and recruited me into the “family business” of assassins for hire. We were a motley crew, to be certain. But based on what I’d seen so far and what I feared lay in store for us, we might just be the crew best equipped to succeed. I sighed again and tried to let the tension melt from my body. To say I deserved a day at the spa was the understatement of the year. While Mika’s hair dryer smothered me in a blanket of warmth and the brush tickled my scalp, I let my thoughts wander to Griffin, my fiancé, murdered in retaliation for my hired kill of a South Asian leader—or so I’d thought. With every new rock we’d turned over in our search for the relics, I’d learned that not everything that had happened in my life was quite what I’d been told, and that Griffin’s death was only the first lie. The Angel of Death, Azazel—a former archangel in his own right—had intercepted Griffin’s soul. They’d boosted it like a painting and carted it off to hell, trapping him there. As his soul mate, I was the only one who could save him. Griffin’s holy soul—born of the most royal blood—was a hot commodity, able to wield power for its possessor. And as Azazel was currently trapped in a prison of his own making, he’d steal whatever he needed to be set free. Or so he thought. I’d already dealt with his number-one guy, Harrold, a foot soldier sent to keep me from succeeding. But they’d underestimated me. Badly. And I would not fail Griffin. Not this time. We’d already found the first relic, the Ring of Solomon, along with a handful of items that we hoped would prove their importance soon. We had a rock from the Garden of Gethsemane, where Judas betrayed Jesus, two of the silver pieces that Judas had been paid in recompense for the betrayal, and a knife once thought to be possessed of powers that shielded a high priest from bad angels. My weaponry was as eclectic as my teammates. We had yet to see which was more useful—or which was the bigger liability. I was keeping them safe and close to me until this thing was over. Next on the agenda was relic number two and that was going to require the team to walk straight back into danger. All we knew was that the actual relic was another weapon used that night in the Garden: the sword that Simon Peter—Jesus’s right hand—had used against one of the soldiers that night when they came for Jesus. (He lopped a dude’s ear clean off!) From what Clay and I had been able to figure out—and he was definitely better versed in the religious relics—the sword had disappeared that night. It had been lost in the fray of the events of the next few days and never really talked about, forsaken for the “trendier” relics like the shroud, the chalice from dinner earlier in the evening, and even bits of the cross. I’d wondered a lot over the last few months at the simplicity of the relics we’d found so far. Solomon’s ring held legendary status with the power to control demons, so that at least made a little sense as something that might open a gate to hell. But a stone? A knife? A sword? I thought for sure we were going after a holy set of keys, not a bunch of weaponry. But what did I know about opening the gates of hell? Maybe that was exactly the kind of thing that opened them. I hadn’t seen Metatron since a few days before Christmas, and he’d been as stingy as ever with details and clues. All he’d parted with was our next location—Greece. I assumed I was overdue for a visit from the archangel, but I figured he’d come see me as soon as he wanted to send us back on the trail. I hated that he took his sweet time revealing the information that we needed. He’d already told me that we had a limited amount of time to get Griffin’s soul—apparently it was being stained by evil and the longer he stayed, the less he’d be like himself by the time I got him out of hell. My heart ached at seeing him as anything other than the sweet kind man who’d loved me until his last breath. Mika finished and spun me around. I looked like me, except fancier. The deep circles around my blue eyes had faded, and my cheeks finally held some color. Now I was glad that I hadn’t cancelled the appointment. I met his eyes and smiled. He’d done far more for me today than just managing a few split ends. “Thank you so much.” “You’re so very welcome. Don’t be such a stranger next time.” He flipped the ends of my hair forward, drawing my attention back to my own image. My dark hair fell in waves past my shoulders and before I’d left the house, I’d swiped a bit of mascara so I had lashes to frame my eyes, and gloss for a hint of pink across my lips. It hadn’t been much, but enough of an improvement that I looked less like a hired assassin-cum-relic hunter. I pushed up out of the chair and grabbed my purse, but when I looked up to follow Mika he was frozen in place. And not because I’d stunned him into silence with my good looks. The entire salon was frozen in time. It was one of Metatron’s fun tricks that he used when he showed up. With a flair worthy of the high-priced salon, the archangel strode through the front doors, looking elegant and striking in his black suit, icy blond hair perfectly in place. He grinned and stretched both hands toward me like we were fast friends. “Good morning, darling. This look becomes you, like Athena herself.” “Metatron.” I arched an eyebrow and took a step back, dodging his grip. “Took you long enough. We don’t have an endless timeline, you know.” His relaxed attitude annoyed me, like we were headed to brunch and he wasn’t a month late for the date. My anxiety spiked at both the anticipation of what he’d come to tell me and being back on the job. He looked me up and down but I did not fidget beneath his scrutiny, confident in both my appearance and abilities. “You appear prepared for the next level of your journey.” That wasn’t exactly true. For the last three weeks I’d sat on my couch, staring at my blank TV trying to decide if I should watch the recording he’d given me. One I’d watched a single time, coming away overwhelmed and distraught at the imagery that had catalogued my mother’s gruesome death at the hands of my new enemy, Harrold, a man taught and trained by the Angel of Death himself. The problem wasn’t watching the horrific act. It was the lies Harrold had fed me right before Metatron had agreed to give me the recording, and there was just enough of a hint of truth in them that I was deeply troubled about how much I could trust Metatron. I rarely put my trust in anyone, but I’d eagerly—and blindly—swallowed up every detail Metatron had given. I’d wanted—needed—the information about my mom and what had happened to her after she’d made me flee to safety that awful night so many years ago. I knew better than to let fear keep me from the truth, but I was paralyzed in the step between knowing it and doing something about it. Considering that the archangel was an integral part of my success as well as a huge source of information, even a hint of distrust in him compromised my mission. For now, though, I needed to pretend that all was right between us so that he would give me the intel I needed to keep this moving forward. I swallowed and nodded, gripping my purse tightly. “We’re ready. Ralph says we have to find the sword, and you say we have to go to Greece—and I’m assuming Athens by your Athena comment.” He nodded. “So smart, Evangeline.” “Tell me what to do.”",

I’d wanted—needed—the information about my mom and what had happened to her after she’d made me flee to safety that awful night so many years ago. I knew better than to let fear keep me from the truth, but I was paralyzed in the step between knowing it and doing something about it. Considering that the archangel was an integral part of my success as well as a huge source of information, even a hint of distrust in him compromised my mission. For now, though, I needed to pretend that all was right between us so that he would give me the intel I needed to keep this moving forward. I swallowed and nodded, gripping my purse tightly. “We’re ready. Ralph says we have to find the sword, and you say we have to go to Greece—and I’m assuming Athens by your Athena comment.” He nodded. “So smart, Evangeline.” “Tell me what to do.”",

      "content": "Chapter Two With the world restarted and my mission tucked under my arm like my purse, I headed out the salon to find Clay—the thief—and travel with him to London to see Ralph, the scholar. I turned the corner at 56th and halted. Two storefronts down, Clay was already at our meeting place, one hand pressed into the stone wall above the head of a too-young-for-him blonde. She had her red fingernails curled into the front of his tight T-shirt, hips tilted toward his, and body supple and inviting. I huffed in annoyance. Then I made myself take a deep breath. What did I care if he was dating a college co-ed, as long as he stayed focused on the upcoming task? I leaned my shoulder into the wall and waited, hoping he’d finish up and send her on her way. While the afternoon sun heated the top of my head, I watched him, troubled that I had any sort of reaction to the way his lips moved while he talked to her. For a thief, he was built, with broad shoulders narrowing to a trim physique that suited him well as he descended ropes and climbed through windows. He still hadn’t bothered to get a haircut, so now his light curls edged over the tops of his ears and flared at his nape. Today, his navy T-shirt stopped just above the curve of his bicep, revealing the long length of his toned arms as they stretched toward the blonde. He’d matched the body-hugging tee with a pair of dark-washed jeans that nicely accented the curve of his ass. If I cared—which I didn’t. Clay kissed the blonde slowly and leisurely, then turned her and squeezed her butt as she walked to the waiting cab. She slid in with the practiced care of a woman used to being watched and I could think of a million things I’d rather practice, mostly involving guns. My attention drifted to Clay, intently watching the blonde’s departure. When he glanced up at me, the cocky grin was enough to yank me away from any attraction I felt for him—which I didn’t. I pushed away from the wall and walked toward him. “Hey,” he said, opening the door to the small deli where we’d agreed to meet for lunch and updates on what we’d been working on for the upcoming mission. We didn’t do this often, and now I was glad for that. “Hi yourself.” “Oh good, I was hoping you’d be your normal friendly self.” I ignored his barb and smiled at the hostess. She led us to a table in the far corner and I rearranged the chairs, sitting with my back to the wall and facing both exits. He shook his head and plopped into the chair opposite me, lanky and relaxed. “Doesn’t that get old, thinking someone is always after you?” “No. And after the attempt on your life in London, I’d think maybe you’d start. Have you eaten?” I lifted my menu, hiding the frustrating burn in my cheeks. He’d been so cute and jovial with that girl, but he poked and prodded me incessantly, always trying to aggravate me. He was like a sliver I couldn’t dig out from under my skin. I shouldn’t care, but I did. I liked being around him too much for my own good, especially since this entire mission revolved around my barely-dead fiancé’s soul. “Hey.” He put his index finger on the top of my menu and pulled it down. I tried to push it back up, but he held it. “You look pretty today.” I glanced up, met his gaze for a second, and looked back at the day’s specials. “Thanks.” He took the menu away and tucked it beneath his folded arms on the table. “What’s eating you?” A thousand things that shouldn’t be. I’d already lost my hold on the calm that Mika had given me. Metatron’s visit hadn’t helped and now I was antsy to get on to the next part of our mission. I cleared my throat and looked at him. “Metatron just came to see me.” He frowned. “Damn. I wanted to be there again.” His gaze skimmed my lips and the soft curls in my hair. “You really do look pretty. But something else is bothering you, what’s up?” I shook my head, hating that he was observant enough to realize the obvious. No way was I going to even hint that I cared about the kiss he’d shared with that girl. Because. I. Didn’t. “Nothing. Let’s eat and then we need to head out to Ralph’s.” I glanced around the mostly deserted deli, still wary about being overheard, though we had a lot to discuss. I credited that loose end for my unease. “I’ll fill you in on the plane.” He narrowed his eyes. “You sure that’s all that’s bugging you?” Luckily, the waitress showed up and I concealed the hint of heat warming up my face with a long drink of water and ordered a club sandwich and fries. Clay and I had been through a fair share of crazy over the last few months, including attempts on both our lives, and I was sure it was that shared experience that was affecting me, not any sort of attraction. But either way, I needed to get that under control and focus on our upcoming mission. Metatron had promised it would be much more difficult than the last and I had to be at my best. I wanted to tell Clay everything Metatron had revealed, but we couldn’t do it here and as the stakes of this mission escalated, I wasn’t sure we could do it anywhere. Clay handed the waitress our menus, then turned to me and winked. “If I’m good, will you let me get a piece of pie for the road?” I rolled my eyes, relieved to be back on joking terms—at least for the moment. I agreed, because there was no chance he could behave himself for an entire meal.",

      "content": "Chapter Three Outside the deli, Clay pointed toward a beefed-up silver Hummer. “I’m parked over here and I’ve been keeping an overnight bag in the back just in case you pulled another last-minute trip on me.” “Great. My bags are already at the jet.” I’d sent them with Malcolm when he’d left last week for another mission, knowing they’d be safe and ready at the secured airstrip instead of having to drag them around. Looks like we’d both been restless about the pause between relics. He held my door for me and I climbed into the beast. “Nice ride.” The interior was gunmetal gray and spotless. Clay was so flippant and carefree that the raw manliness of the vehicle caught me off guard. I’d pegged him for a ’69 Camaro convertible or something equally casual, but with a hint of masculinity. He climbed in and I inhaled the leather and his tropical air freshener—not his spicy cologne. He pulled into traffic and I launched into our most pressing issue—the double-cross and deception from his buyer. I’d let that one go far too long and should have dealt with it immediately, but Clay had forced me to back off, assuring me that he had it handled every time we’d talked since the party. I was done waiting on him. The last thing we needed was a loose end, especially one who’d already tried to kill Clay. “Tell me about the buyer who set us up at Jeffries. Who is this guy, anyway?” Clay checked his rearview mirror and changed lanes, speeding past the slower traffic on the right. “Never met him. That’s how I work with all my clients. He sent me a secure message through my system about five years back and I’ve stolen a dozen pieces for him since.” “Like what?” I pulled a notepad from my purse and clicked my pen. There was a connection in the details, I just had to find it and use the clues to track us back to the man who’d hired the hit. He shrugged and turned on the radio, keeping the pop station low in the background. The bass thrummed through the floorboards and made my feet tremble. “Relics, mostly. The first one was an alabaster jar, then a trio of medallions, a single painting—tiny, though. I palmed it and walked out without a single person blinking.” I shook my head. Seriously, his cockiness knew no bounds. He was undeniably good, though. And I’d stuffed our last piece in my bra, so I couldn’t exactly chide him for being discreet. The only things that ever mattered was completing the mission and staying alive. So far, we’d succeeded with those two. “What else?” “More of the same. You don’t really think you’re going to be able to find him through those, are you? He had me fence half of them and he had private buyers for the rest.” I turned and stared at him, wondering how he could stay so nonchalant and trusting. Our close calls hadn’t rattled him in the least and he was still convinced that he wasn’t in any danger. “How sure are you of that? Maybe he just told you about the private buyers and he used some of these pieces to misdirect you.” I grunted. “He obviously has no problem lying to you. Or trying to kill you.” We’d both nearly been killed on Clay’s last mission. He’d called me in to help him and we’d been attacked in the middle of boosting what was supposed to be a fifteen-million-dollar painting. “Yeah, but that’s why I think you’re wasting time on this. If he’d have wanted me dead, I wouldn’t be sitting here now.” “You’re a fool to dismiss the hit.” He glanced over at me, a wide sure grin showing his teeth. “I’m not you, babe. I don’t live and die at the end of a gun. If he kills me, who’s going to get him his next bauble?” “There are plenty of thieves out there.” I closed my notebook and leaned back in the seat. “I realize you think you’re the best, but there are more than a few people who are nearly as good as you.” I turned toward the window. “And probably half the pain.” “I heard that.” He turned up the radio and we moved through traffic to the turnoff to the airport, passing the public entry for the private one that I used. For a guy who’d been rattled by my unlimited access to Learjets, he’d come around fast. Security waved us through and he parked along the tall chain-link fence reserved for the few vehicles that stayed on the property. Most of the fliers out of here used private cars and I could have done that today, but he’d wanted to drive. Maybe he was more worried than he wanted to let on and was didn’t want anyone tampering with his car. No chance of that happening in here with the level of security surrounding this airstrip and the guests using it. We got out and walked to the jet, door open and waiting for us. Inside, I bugged him about it again. “Before we do anything, we need to eliminate that threat.” Clay made a face. “I’m sure he was just sending a message.” I blinked. Hits were the world I came from, and in it, people didn’t hire assassins as messages. They did it to take care of a problem. In all my years in the business, I’d never heard of someone going to all the trouble of hiring a kill, just to pull it at the last minute in favor for a glancing blow. Clay’d been lucky to survive the lousy shot, and wouldn’t have if I hadn’t been there to save him by killing the shooter before he could finish the job. I had a hard time believing that was the end of it. “Humor me. Tell me about every interaction you’ve had with this buyer so I can figure out who this is and identify the real threat. This is bigger than you screwing up the heist. Has there ever been anything out of the ordinary on any of your deals?” He reclined the leather seat and propped his hands behind his head. “You mean other than the time that guy pulled a gun and shot me?” I rolled my eyes and took the seat next to him. “Was there anything else about that heist that stood out?” He was silent long enough that I thought he’d fallen asleep, then one eyelid popped open, blue eye staring intently at me. “He called me.” I leaned closer. “Okay. That’s something. Do you remember anything about the call? Had he ever done that before?” He sat up and shook his head, then ran a hand through his blond curls. “No. Like I said, we always dealt through the secure site. I didn’t even know how he got my number.” “And you seriously didn’t see anything wrong with that?” I threw up my hands, then dug around for my notebook to add the detail to my list. An anomaly like that would have sent up no fewer than a dozen red flags for me. But Clay had already proved that I was a lot more suspicious and cautious than he’d ever be. Where I saw nothing but issues and problems, Clay only saw opportunities and challenges. In this, as in everything else, we were day and night.",

      "content": "Chapter Four Though I wanted to dig deeper and ask him more rounds of questions, I relented. I figured that my subconscious would come up with a link, or a detail I’d missed that could help us. I still hated leaving the loose end, but I knew better than to chase a path without a map. I needed concrete links to get me solid on the identity of Clay’s buyer, and we weren’t there yet. Not knowing would bug me until we figured it out. “You watch your video yet?” he asked. I shook my head. “I thought you wanted to watch it with me.” “I do, but we haven’t talked about it since that night.” It was true. I’d ignored everything about the video, my mom’s death, the man who’d told me that I’d been manipulated by the events in the video. I hadn’t wanted to know the truth, fearful that it would be as bad as I’d imagined. “Come on.” He slid open the cabinet concealing the TV and grabbed the remote, then returned to his chair, patting the one beside him. “Put it in and let’s do this thing.” I crossed my arms and stared at the snow on the screen, then stiffened my back and dug the DVD from my purse. I’d packed it for the trip knowing that I couldn’t delay the inevitable any longer. “What am I looking for?” Clay asked as I put the DVD in the player and sat on the edge of the chair beside him. I shook my head. “Honestly … I’m not sure. Just watch and tell me what you see.” His gaze met mine and held. No joking, no teasing. For a moment, I felt like he could hear my thoughts and the pounding of my heart. I was terrified of what he’d see during my mom’s death that I was blind to. I appreciated not only his willingness to go through this with me, but the intensity and lack of humor he was willing to give to it. When he needed to be, he was a great guy, and a strong partner … which was why I was so conflicted when my thoughts about him strayed into a simplistic physical need that cheapened what we had together. I liked working with him and didn’t want either of us to screw that up. He rested his hand on the middle of my back. “Are you okay?” “Play it.” I squeezed my fingers tightly on my lap and concentrated on seeing the facts, not being swayed by the emotion of what I knew was coming. The image switched to that night in Jordan—flames, chaos, death. Clay muttered curses and tensed beside me as the video rolled on filling the entire cabin with screams and the lick of flames. I watched it with a removed heart, even as my mother faced off against Harrold. My thoughts swayed as I realized how little Azazel’s man hadn’t changed from the image on the screen to when he’d appeared in my apartment after we’d stolen the relic. He and I had fought, but Clay had pulled me off him before I’d killed him—and I still wasn’t sure if that had been a good thing. “Come work for us,” he’d said, as if Azazel was any other boss extending a job offer. Then he’d told me that they’d offered the same thing to my mother, an offer of protection, of help. Had they offered it to her on this night, when the screen had gone blank? Or before tonight? Harrold said he hadn’t killed her and that’s the detail I needed to see—needed Clay to see so I could stop losing my mind over who to trust. Azazel didn’t want my mother dead, Harrold had said. He’d needed her alive, to use her special gifts to find the relics. But if that was true, then who’d killed her? The video finished and we sat in stark silence, only the air against the fuselage tormenting our ears now that the screams had subsided. “What do you think?” I asked, my voice cracking. Clay slowly set the remote on the small table in front of our chairs, then turned to me, the horrors and destruction mapped across his features. His leaned over and put an arm around my shoulder, then covered my fisted hands, pressing his lips to my temple and hugging me for a moment. I shuddered and he pulled back. “That was your mother then, the woman?” I nodded. She’d been beautiful and strong and so very courageous as she’d stood in defiance of Harrold. So different than the striking, fighting beast he’d reduced me to. “There’s one thing that’s really bugging me,” Clay said. “Harrold asked her for the relic, and she refused. If Azazel wanted her to work for him, why not remind her of the offer then? Why not promise her immortality as the village burned around her? Why not offer to save her family, her friends, her own life?” He made a good point. “Mom never would have parted with a historical artifact, though. Not for anyone. She believed that they belonged to the people, to the public, catalogued and on display somewhere commemorating the history of those who’d created, honored, and sacrificed for the piece—and not just the important pieces, but every piece. Maybe they’d already been through this and she’d refused before this night and they thought this would be the ticket to bringing her around.” “Maybe. Little more difficult to know what they’d offered her then, if she wasn’t the kind of person to react like most of us.” “Even immortality wouldn’t have swayed her beliefs. She was passionate about preserving history and clearly Azazel wanted it for his own means. She didn’t agree with that … ever.” Clay ran his fingertips across his mouth, deep in thought. “I think that’s the crux of it, though, isn’t it? No matter what Azazel was offering, he’s not after these relics for good reasons. Even if he wanted to keep your Mom alive, it was only for his own gain. That makes him a bad guy in my book.” “Yeah.” I sat back and sighed. “Mine too. I can’t trust anything he or his minions say, and all he’s done with this is distract us from what matters.” He reached over and set his palm on my knee. “We’re going to set this right for all of them. We’ll get Griffin’s soul where it belongs, up there with your mom and dad.” Tears stung my eyes and I nodded. “Thanks. I need that. I don’t know who we can trust and what information hasn’t been corrupted by someone’s agenda.” “Doesn’t matter. You can trust me and we’ll figure it out together. We’ll get the other two relics and we’ll find the gate, storm in there, and get him.” His voice softened. “We will.” I put my hand over his and held it there in solidarity.",

      "content": "Chapter Four Though I wanted to dig deeper and ask him more rounds of questions, I relented. I figured that my subconscious would come up with a link, or a detail I’d missed that could help us. I still hated leaving the loose end, but I knew better than to chase a path without a map. I needed concrete links to get me solid on the identity of Clay’s buyer, and we weren’t there yet. Not knowing would bug me until we figured it out. “You watch your video yet?” he asked. I shook my head. “I thought you wanted to watch it with me.” “I do, but we haven’t talked about it since that night.” It was true. I’d ignored everything about the video, my mom’s death, the man who’d told me that I’d been manipulated by the events in the video. I hadn’t wanted to know the truth, fearful that it would be as bad as I’d imagined. “Come on.” He slid open the cabinet concealing the TV and grabbed the remote, then returned to his chair, patting the one beside him. “Put it in and let’s do this thing.” I crossed my arms and stared at the snow on the screen, then stiffened my back and dug the DVD from my purse. I’d packed it for the trip knowing that I couldn’t delay the inevitable any longer. “What am I looking for?” Clay asked as I put the DVD in the player and sat on the edge of the chair beside him. I shook my head. “Honestly … I’m not sure. Just watch and tell me what you see.” His gaze met mine and held. No joking, no teasing. For a moment, I felt like he could hear my thoughts and the pounding of my heart. I was terrified of what he’d see during my mom’s death that I was blind to. I appreciated not only his willingness to go through this with me, but the intensity and lack of humor he was willing to give to it. When he needed to be, he was a great guy, and a strong partner … which was why I was so conflicted when my thoughts about him strayed into a simplistic physical need that cheapened what we had together. I liked working with him and didn’t want either of us to screw that up. He rested his hand on the middle of my back. “Are you okay?” “Play it.” I squeezed my fingers tightly on my lap and concentrated on seeing the facts, not being swayed by the emotion of what I knew was coming. The image switched to that night in Jordan—flames, chaos, death. Clay muttered curses and tensed beside me as the video rolled on filling the entire cabin with screams and the lick of flames. I watched it with a removed heart, even as my mother faced off against Harrold. My thoughts swayed as I realized how little Azazel’s man hadn’t changed from the image on the screen to when he’d appeared in my apartment after we’d stolen the relic. He and I had fought, but Clay had pulled me off him before I’d killed him—and I still wasn’t sure if that had been a good thing. “Come work for us,” he’d said, as if Azazel was any other boss extending a job offer.

      "content": "Chapter Five After grabbing a few hours of sleep, we landed in Chelsea to an awaiting Range Rover that I let Clay drive over to Ralph’s. Thankfully, they didn’t keep to regular hours, so our 3 a.m. arrival wasn’t as much of an interruption as it would have been to others. We hurried up the steps and Anna opened the door before we could knock. Her silver hair was in its usual bun and she had reading glasses on a chain around her neck. Today her attire was a casual gray sweater paired with a burgundy skirt. We’d probably interrupted a quiet day at home when she finally had a moment to herself. But if she was disappointed, she didn’t show it. “Welcome, welcome. I should get the two of you your own key.” Clay followed me in. “We are here a lot, aren’t we?” She tipped her cheek up for a kiss from him. “A pleasure, as always.” The thump of a cane across hardwood turned me toward Ralph’s study, where the portly professor appeared, white hair shocked around his ears and the back of his head. “Oh lovely! I was so hoping to see you today.” I smiled and gave him a hug, not bothering to remind him that I’d called yesterday to let him know that we were on our way. We’d learned to roll with the holes in Ralph’s memory and so far he hadn’t forgotten anything that had put us in danger. I needed that to hold out for a little longer. “Does that mean you have information for us?” Clay asked, reaching over my head to shake Ralph’s hand as I stepped back. “Of course, of course. Shall I tell you over a cup of Earl Grey?” In the kitchen, Anna already had tea heating and she brought a tray of biscuits and cookies to the table. I was surprised that they’d managed to keep it tidy since we’d been here at Christmas. Ralph was a hoarder of the extreme kind, and while I understood his need to not get rid of any of his important documents and papers, it made things incredibly difficult when we were trying to find pieces I needed for this journey. He probably had millions in undocumented relics stashed all over this house in crannies and buried beneath boxes of papers, but so far we’d only been able to unearth a few. I hoped this next relic wasn’t in his house anywhere. Clay sat on the far side of the table and I took the seat between him and Ralph, grabbing a tiny shortbread cookie. “Okay, Metatron confirmed that we’re starting in Athens, and you’ve said we’re after Peter’s sword from the garden. Is that it?” Ralph laughed and patted my hand. “Hardly, dear. But I do find your enthusiasm adorable. First, let me tell you the story of the sword.” Clay leaned back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest and grinning. He loved Ralph’s stories and they’d become fast friends while we’d been here. I didn’t know anything about Clay’s relationship with his dad, only that things weren’t great with his mom’s health, but now I wondered if Ralph reminded him of his dad—or the one he’d wished he’d had. These were things that I didn’t need to know about a partner with whom I had only had a working relationship, but I couldn’t help wondering about this man and the idiosyncrasies of who he was. Anna poured milk into Ralph’s cup, then the hot tea, and I did the same to my own. He took the delicate china and sipped it. “I’ve already told you that all the apostles were armed the night that Judas betrayed his Teacher, but Peter was the only one with a sword. When the soldiers arrived, Peter attacked, cutting off the ear of one man, Malchus—a servant of the high priest—and was quickly reprimanded by Jesus.” He waved his hand and set down the tea. “Jesus was taken away, Judas turned in the silver, overcome with guilt then hanged himself, but Peter…” He looked from Clay to me. “Peter couldn’t desert Jesus. He followed as they marched Him to court. Which, incidentally is where Peter denied Christ three times.” “Did he have the sword on him?” Clay asked, eating two shortbreads stacked together. “Those are details I’ve been researching. What I’ve told you is what was included in the canon, but what will aid us is the rest of the story.” “Like the rock.” He nodded. “Right. The handling of the weapons and where they went obviously didn’t matter to anyone trying to learn about Christ and what occurred in the days before His crucifixion. But they matter to us a great deal.” I folded my hands and leaned forward, surprisingly nervous about this next relic—something I was damn sure going to pay attention to this time after ignoring my intention too many times along the way. I had to be on constant alert. My gaze flickered to Clay, oblivious of everything beyond Ralph and this room. Ignorance really was bliss. But this time, his denial of the threat was going to kill him … and maybe take out the rest of us in the process. I had to be on top of every detail and every niggling of discomfort for both of us. “After the reprimand, Peter sheathed the sword, but the soldiers disarmed everyone before taking Jesus, fearful of a retaliation at their backs as they departed.” “Smart,” Clay said, standing and pouring himself a glass of milk from the fridge. Anna had left us, but was probably still close at hand in case Ralph needed anything. Clay came back to the table, pausing at the back window to survey the yard. Maybe he wasn’t as confident about his safety as he pretended. “The Romans weren’t fools enough to leave a viable weapon, so they absorbed the sword into their own armory.” I groaned and dropped my head into my hands. “Let me guess, now we’re looking for a needle in a haystack.” I lifted my head. “There were another five hundred years of battles for Rome. It could have traded hands dozens of times. Hell, it could have ended up beyond Hadrian’s Wall or in Asia after Attila’s push…” Ralph grinned and patted my hand. “Well done, girl. Took me a good two days to get there. That’s precisely what occurred. This sword isn’t a typical one and as it changed hands, its special properties didn’t go unnoticed, though it didn’t respond the same to everyone. It did make its way into Asia, but as Alexander moved back toward Greece for his own reign, so the sword came with him.” “Which is why we’re going to Athens.” Ralph leaned back in his chair, chest puffed out. “Exactly.” “Another museum?” Clay asked, his wariness quickly turning to eagerness at the mere thought of a heist. “Not this time.” He looked to me. “This time you’ll be relying on the skills you learned with your mother. This time you’ll meet up with an archeological team. Metatron believes they’ll unearth the relic within a week’s time.” “A week?” I didn’t need any more delays. I wanted to hurry this process along, get Griffin’s soul back, and finally be able to move the rest of my life forward. I needed to heal, and this journey was bringing up so many memories of him and making it hard to grieve him, knowing I was going to encounter some version of him when we finally made it to Hell, and probably not the one I’d loved and agreed to spend the rest of my life with. I couldn’t keep putting off the dreaded meeting, but I seemed to be the only one in a hurry. “I have a feeling you’ll be using every moment of that week for other matters.” Clay perked up. “Another heist?” “Sit, please.” Ralph extended his hand toward Clay’s chair. Clay looked at me and I shrugged, not having any idea what Ralph was up to. “Clay, the last time you arrived on my doorstop, you brought with you a great deal of blood.” “Sorry about that.” Clay ducked his head. “Yes, well, I’d prefer you always come here after being shot.” Ralph took another sip of tea. “We didn’t have a chance to talk about that with the flurry of Christmas and my research into the sword. The two of you need to address that before Greece.” I couldn’t agree more, but I kept my mouth shut. Clay would listen to Ralph and he’d already shown that my opinion on this matter didn’t hold any weight with him. Not enough to take it seriously anyway. He fidgeted under Ralph’s attention. “We addressed it on the way over. It’s handled.” Ralph crossed his arms over his chest, mimicking Clay’s posture. He waited, not saying anything. The men faced off, neither willing to give into the silent battle. Finally, Clay grunted and ran a hand through his hair. Still Ralph waited. It was the longest six seconds of my life before Clay finally straightened and clenched his jaw. “You don’t think it’s handled either, do you?” he asked Ralph. “I don’t, Clay, I really don’t.” Ralph relaxed and clasped his hands over his stomach. “These enemies aren’t typical men, though they may look and act like it to fool you, to infiltrate everyday life, to make you think you have a mince of a chance against them. They’ve worked hard to know you, to know your weaknesses…” He glanced quickly at me and I wasn’t sure if that was because he thought I was one of Clay’s weaknesses or because he thought I was in danger of having my own exploited. Both were true, if I wanted to be honest with myself. “Men like these will not stop until they complete whatever mission Azazel’s sent them on.” “Now, wait—” Clay stood quickly, making the chair rock backward. “I’ve known this buyer for years. Way before her.” He pointed at me, anger and confusion marring his features. I understood. It was exactly how I’d felt when Metatron had first come to me, first showed me the level of involvement of Azazel in my own life, starting with my mother and her untimely death. The sooner Clay could accept that we’d both been played, the sooner we could work together to beat these guys and finish the job. Ignorance only kept us at risk. I needed him to hear Ralph out, to see what was staring him right in the face. My stomach hurt when I thought about how we’d been played at Felt’s, then again at the Renwick, the party… We’d been nothing more than pawns, and damn if I was going to let anyone manipulate me, be it man or divinity. But Clay had to get to those conclusions on his own. Or it would continue to be a giant brick wall between us, and I couldn’t have anything working against us. We had plenty of obstacles without any irritations between he and I. And not only would it place friction between us, but it would give us a massive blind spot. If he continued to ignore this, he was a massive liability for me. One I might have to reconsider. I’d rather ditch him on this one until he came to terms with people wanting him dead, than having him dead. “Clay, your involvement in this is not coincidental,” Ralph said, sitting up and leaning toward Clay, his face intense and serious. “The farther you travel on this journey, the more intertwined your life will become with Lina’s, but do not for one moment think that they haven’t known that you were destined for her.”",

My stomach hurt when I thought about how we’d been played at Felt’s, then again at the Renwick, the party… We’d been nothing more than pawns, and damn if I was going to let anyone manipulate me, be it man or divinity. But Clay had to get to those conclusions on his own. Or it would continue to be a giant brick wall between us, and I couldn’t have anything working against us. We had plenty of obstacles without any irritations between he and I. And not only would it place friction between us, but it would give us a massive blind spot. If he continued to ignore this, he was a massive liability for me. One I might have to reconsider. I’d rather ditch him on this one until he came to terms with people wanting him dead, than having him dead. “Clay, your involvement in this is not coincidental,” Ralph said, sitting up and leaning toward Clay, his face intense and serious. “The farther you travel on this journey, the more intertwined your life will become with Lina’s, but do not for one moment think that they haven’t known that you were destined for her.”",

      "content": "Chapter Six I choked. Destined? Ralph’s brain had better have just taken a sharp left turn. I sat as still as possible, hoping like hell I didn’t look as terrified as that comment had made me feel. I didn’t want us to be some Team of Destiny. I had a soul mate. My heart constricted. I didn’t want to replace Griffin with Clay just because one was dead and the other was alive. If—and that was a big if—if we were destined, then it was as partners, as valors, victors, the final winning team. Nothing more. Clay’s gaze swept over me, softening only a bit. I returned the stare until he finally turned his attention to Ralph. “Go on….” “You must accept that the men who shot you, as well as the one who ordered that moment, are still after you. Right now they are aware of your every move, and possibly even the next one. Do not underestimate the power of their reach, nor the extents to which they will go.” “I’m worried about you and Anna,” I said. The more Ralph talked the more worried I became that these men would use them against us. If they knew everything about Clay, then they certainly knew that Ralph was every bit as much a weakness for him as I was, if not more. Clay cared deeply for Ralph and respected him a great deal. I knew just enough about Clay to know that he’d do just about anything to keep Ralph and Anna safe. If it were up to me, and Clay was my own hit, I’d exploit that weakness like nobody’s business. I had to assume that our opponent would absolutely do the same. But Ralph didn’t. He waved off my concern. “Good heavens, no. What would they want with two old biddies?” On the far side of the room, Anna tsked, her arms full of freshly laundered clothes. Ralph smiled and turned toward her. “That’s not what I believe, dear Anna. Why, I’ve always thought you didn’t look a day over sixty and you’re fresh as a daisy.” She shook her head and went back to folding laundry. Ralph winked at me, then turned serious and patted my hand. “Thank you for the concern. Metatron will ensure that we remain safe. I’ve talked to him about it, as I held the same concerns at one point.” I wasn’t sure how much I trusted Metatron with those I loved, but I didn’t have a lot of choice. We couldn’t really stash Ralph and Anna anywhere, but I would be speaking to Metatron about their safety when I saw him next. I’d put a guard on them if I thought it would help, but if Azazel’s men wanted to hurt them, there was nothing of this world that could stop them. And that went for Clay too. Much as he might be a liability, the only way I could truly keep him safe was keeping him right next to me. But that didn’t mean we couldn’t take out a few in the process. If there were fewer of them to attack us, then they wouldn’t have extra to send after Ralph. We had to get Clay’s buyer and all the people associated with that hit taken care of immediately. Clay let out a big breath and held out a hand to me, palm up. “Will you help me get these guys?” I lifted my hand and settled it in his, giving him a squeeze. “Of course.” He tugged, pulling me up to stand beside him. “I’m sorry that I didn’t believe you. That I didn’t take the threat seriously. I should have trusted your instinct.” I shrugged. “I’ve dismissed my instinct enough since we’ve started this wild ride, so we both need to get better.” “Tell me what we need to do.” I patted his shoulder. “We’ll figure it out.” I turned to Ralph. “We’ll get this handled. I can take out bad guys in my sleep, so I’m confident we’ll have plenty of time to do it before we need to be in Greece. What else do we need to know?” “Like everything you’ve been drawn to thus far, I believe you’ll know the sword when you see it. You’ll find the dig on the west end of the airport, near Spata. They located relics as they were tying into the sewer line for a new metro rail.” We stayed for breakfast and Ralph entertained Clay with a half-dozen stories and I helped Anna clean the kitchen. We declined their offer to stay for the day, knowing that there wasn’t enough room for us with all the boxes and papers in the house. I preferred us to have some good sleep before we started this trek. The plane was detained in Cairo, anyway, and wouldn’t be at the airport until tonight. The tension between Clay and me was still there as we left. Ralph stopped us at the door and shook Clay’s hand. “You must be there in five days, so do not tarry where your attacker is concerned.” Clay’s mouth drew tight and he nodded. “I think I’m in pretty good hands.” I tipped my head and studied him. That was the closest he’d ever come to complimenting me. Other than after he’d been shot and he told me that I made a terrible wife but was the only partner he’d ever want. I’d filled him full of morphine at that point, so I hadn’t given it a second thought. I kissed Ralph’s cheek. “I’ll keep him alive.” Clay took my hand and tucked it in the crook of his arm as we walked to the car. I started to pull away, thinking he was going to walk around, but he escorted me all the way to my door and opened it for me. It was strange, but I figured he was doing it for Ralph’s benefit and I didn’t mind being tucked against his warm strong body. I pulled free and climbed in, then reached for the door. But he blocked it, stepping into the open space, hand on the frame above my head. “I’ll be better.” I frowned. “About what?” “Trusting you.” “It’s okay, Clay. We’ll figure this out.” “I could have put you in danger—did put you in danger.” “I can handle myself.” I felt bad that he was still struggling with this and I didn’t know what else to say to ease his worries. He looked over the roof of the car and stared across Ralph’s weathered neighborhood. “You’re going to have to help me.” I knew that, but I didn’t think his ego wanted to hear it. “We’ll be fine. Let’s go to the hotel and we’ll make a plan.” He nodded, shut my door, and climbed in behind the wheel, remaining stoic and thoughtful until we got to the hotel. I checked us in and we carried our sparse bags, along with my weapons bag from beneath the front seat that the CIA had left for me. It was nice to have friends in low places and they made sure I always had whatever I needed. And better, they never asked any questions. This mission was proving to be in need of every one of those connections, and we hadn’t even started yet. I paused at the threshold, glancing up and down the walkway, checking for pursuers and creepy crawlies. The morning was a comfortable calm and I hitched my gear bag higher as I walked in the room, only to find Clay sprawled across the only bed in the room, a large king. “Oh, hell no.” He grinned and tucked his hands behind his head. “This makes twice. Pretty sure it’s a message from Metatron.” He bounced his hips against the mattress. I rolled my eyes. “Nice try.” I set my weapons on the small desk, tossed my bag beneath, and dialed the front desk, only to be told that there’d been a mixup and they didn’t have any double rooms left. We were stuck with a king room on the main floor. Not ideal. “Thanks.” I hung up and ignored Clay’s chuckle. With my back still to him, I pulled the black bag close, reveling in the weight of it as it slid across the motel table. Nothing better in the world for soothing my nerves than the feel of trusted weaponry. I unhooked the double clasp and unrolled the girthy fabric, revealing two handguns and a dozen knives: six small concealable ones, and the remaining half-dozen a sweet collection of large ones that I could carry well enough in my other holsters. I loved knifes, loved their deadly silence. Guns were handy, but they made it difficult to stay concealed with their loud reports and obvious muzzle flashes. I wouldn’t ever be comfortable using one as a main weapon. I much preferred my knives and the anonymity they afforded me. I’d taken my share of jobs that had required sniper rifles, and while they did give me the ability to stay far away, the distance troubled me, made the kill too impersonal, too machine-like. I wasn’t a killer, I was an assassin, and I realized there wasn’t more than a hair between the two definitions, but it was the hair that I’d made my own personal line of demarcation. One was a mercenary, heartless and cold. The other acted within a code, a creed, following a mission. I would never be a killer. I’d been called to be an assassin. And now I would challenge the code that I’d clung to since firing my very first shot. I hadn’t been hired to kill Clay’s buyer, but he was certainly a bad guy. And that’s where my gray area lived. There were a lot of bad guys out there, ninety-eight percent of whom I’d never killed and would not kill. I couldn’t eradicate evil from the planet, but I could do my part in eliminating the people that agencies had tracked, researched, and believed were the worst of them, or those who could spread evil like a contagion. Now I was the one doing the tracking and researching. And Clay, Ralph and I did believe that the men who’d tried to kill Clay were ones worth taking out. There was an element of self-defense, and had certainly been the case when I’d killed the shooter trying to take Clay out, but again … complete gray area. I could apply the self-defense angle to every associate of every person I’d killed. But I didn’t, because my carefully constructed rules and creed were what kept me sane, kept me believing that at the end of the day I was better than the men and women I destroyed. That was the rub, though, wasn’t it? I slipped one of the knives from the case and turned it over, back and forth. The righteous always believe that they’re on the right side of the “law.” Over the course of mankind, religious zealots had killed millions because their targets fell outside their own carefully constructed creeds. Azazel, too. He wanted to eliminate all of us who stood in the way of his goal, those with the power to keep him from succeeding. Was I that much different? I laid the knife on the desk and took another, smaller one out, turned it over and ran my finger lightly along the crisp blade. I didn’t have a choice and though I knew it, killing someone who I hadn’t been hired to kill or who wasn’t currently attacking me made my stomach sour. But without taking them out, we’d never be able to let our guard down. Savvy as I was at having alert senses and eyes in the back of my head, I still had to sleep, still had to eat a meal without inhaling it so I wouldn’t be caught off guard. My nerves needed the ability to relax, even if only for a day or two. With a killer on the loose, I’d lose that opportunity. I grimaced. You’d think that with a damn archangel on our side, that Metatron would be willing to help us out and give us some protection. “What are you thinking about over there?” I glanced over my shoulder. Clay sat on the edge of the bed, hands pressed into the mattress, shoulders hunched high. Like the stress of our situation was getting to him too. I took one of the mid-sized knives and carried it over to him. “That we’re not as prepared as I’d like.” “You mean I’m not.” “You need to be ready to kill.” I flipped the knife and held the blade, pushing the hilt toward him. He reached an unsteady hand toward it and curled his fingers tentatively around the metal. I released it. “How much hand-to-hand did you do in the military?” He shook his head and stood. “I wasn’t in the military.” I frowned. “Yes, you were. Two years.” I’d looked it up in the database. I knew all about the time he’d spent in the Army. He shook his head and moved the knife to his left hand, let the weight settle into his palm, then switched it back. His head lifted and he pierced me with those blue eyes and a cheeky grin. “Nope. Didn’t even graduate high school.” He shrugged. “But I made a couple friends good with computers.” “I knew it.” Again, I’d dismissed my first impression about his background when I’d found it. I knew little about him when I’d pulled up all the data that I had access to, but it had seemed manufactured, too perfect. I shook my head and he winked. “Well, that just means you have more work to do. You’ve proven that you’re fairly decent, but you have to be better. If I can beat you, then they’re going to annihilate you.” “You haven’t beaten me—” “First.” I was not about to get into a discussion about how many times we’d traded the upper hand when we’d fought. I’d held him off and he’d never been able to best me, and he had me by six inches and fifty pounds. I needed him to be able to take me every time if I was going to feel safe about him protecting himself … and watching my back. His mouth snapped closed and the skin around the edges of his eyes creased like he was finally taking this serious. “First,” I started again. “You need to be able to throw and then we’ll work on getting away clean. I don’t want you wrestling with these guys. I want you staying as far away from them as possible. Throw, slice, run.” “I don’t run.” “Yeah, I know.” I poked him hard in the shoulder right in his still-healing wound. “Ow, dammit!” He jerked away and rubbed his arm. “What the hell?” “You got lucky and you know it. That should have killed you. If you wouldn’t have been toppling out the window, he would have gotten a clean kill.” I would have. “I’m always lucky. I don’t have to worry about this stuff like you do. I’m not in life-or-death situations. Ever.” He handed the knife back. “I thought you were going to handle all of this. Killing is what you do. I’ll do the thief stuff, you take care of that.” He waved his hand toward the stack of weapons. I shoved the knife toward him again. “Clay, I’m serious about this. They’re going to try and kill you again.” “And what’s a knife going to do? Block the bullet? You think they aren’t going to come at me with everything they have so they don’t miss this time?” His voice rose. “Because I think I don’t stand a fucking chance. They’re probably going to blow up my car, or shoot me through that window while I’m sleeping with you tonight!” He knocked my hand away and paced the room. I holstered the knife and crossed my arms. I wanted him mad enough that he’d see reason, but I didn’t want him giving up all hope. “They’re not going to kill you like that.” “How do you know?” he growled, not letting up on his pacing. I shrugged. “I just do. Azazel is too intimate, too connected to these kills. If he’s sending his guys, it will be on a personal level.” He glared at me. “Trust me. If there’s one thing I do know, it’s how assassins have habits too.” He stopped pacing and turned, then swiftly closed the distance between us, gripping my arms tightly and shaking me once. “How would you do it?” he asked, his tone deadly soft. “If they hired you to kill me, how would you do it?” His hard gaze roamed my face, at odds with the tenderness in his voice. I let him manhandle me, knowing that he needed to control something about this situation. And I wasn’t worried that he’d hurt me. Not like this, anyway. I let him bend me backward and I tipped my chin up, exposing my neck so he could see my submission to his grip, to his question, to his fear. “How?” I thought about the question, about his habits, about how I knew him. “At night,” I whispered. “I’d slip in your room while you slept and I’d cut your throat.” He blanched and his face whitened. “Really?” I nodded and his grip relaxed. I stayed next to him, our bodies almost touching. “You’re a sound sleeper.” I laughed softly. “You sleep like the dead. Like a man who has nothing to fear.” I watched his features shift and soften as he processed what I was saying. “I envy you, actually. You’ve been that way from the very first time and it was shocking to see someone be able to fall asleep instantly without having to check exits, strategies, weapons, tick off all the people who might be coming to kill you tonight.” His hands moved around my back, holding me gently. “Is that what it’s like for you, then? Every night?” I nodded. “I’m used to it, though. If I go through my list and it hasn’t changed much since yesterday, I usually fall asleep after a few minutes. I’ve done it for so long that it’s become my nighttime ritual. Other people count sheep. I count how many people I’ve pissed off today.” He frowned. “That’s a pretty shitty way to fall asleep.” “Maybe.” Somewhere we’d gotten tangled up in my sleep patterns instead of his, but I didn’t want to get him ruffled again. That would come soon enough when I went back to training him. And okay … maybe it felt good to be standing in his arms, to feel his strength and to not have to rely on my own for just a moment. He was so rarely this passionate, this fiery, and I liked this side of him as much as I did his goofy persona. I needed him worried and alert. “Maybe we could come up with a new one.” His gaze dropped to my lips and for just a fleeting second, I was aroused and tempted to let him kiss me, to let him take me away from the pain and grief and frustration of this mission, of losing Griffin, of being so goddamn alone. His gaze flickered back up to my eyes and I saw the question there, like he’d expected me to brush him off instantly, pull out of his arms, and chastise him like I’d done every other time before. And I meant to … I did. But I hesitated once more. And this time he didn’t ask, didn’t question. His lips came down hard on mine and his hands tightened on my back, pulling me against his body. His lips were warm and firm and held a desperation that only comes from fear of dying, of seeing missed chances and future opportunities being flung away and out of reach as death comes racing forward to fill every crevice of what may come. I kissed him back, clinging to the aliveness of him, the urgency of his movements, the pressure of his fingers into the small of my back. His tongue darted out and brushed my lips. I could have pulled away then and we would have been able to chalk this up to an untethered moment of fear, but I didn’t. I didn’t. I let him press gently into my mouth and as I tasted him, I moaned at the exquisite feel of someone else. Someone other than me inside this body where I’d been imprisoned. One of his hands came up to cup my face, to tilt it to the side so he could deepen the kiss, and damned if I didn’t let him. My own hands found his waist, curled into the loose fabric of his shirt, and I felt more warmth and strength there, at the base of his ribs, the edge of his waistband. He kissed me deeply and with a longing that echoed in my own self. Then he gentled the kiss, touching his lips softly to mine and bringing his other hand up to hold my jaw. He rested his forehead against mine and my breath came in ragged gasps. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I didn’t mean—” I gave my head a little shake, our foreheads still pressed together. “Don’t. Just let it stand.” He moved one arm around my back and drew my cheek to his chest. My arms unclenched from his shirt and slid around his waist. We stood there, soldiers thrown together in a war that was not of our own making, death clinging to the door like the dark of the night, worries scratching at the hinges. But in this one moment, breathing each other’s air, we were safe.",

I laid the knife on the desk and took another, smaller one out, turned it over and ran my finger lightly along the crisp blade. I didn’t have a choice and though I knew it, killing someone who I hadn’t been hired to kill or who wasn’t currently attacking me made my stomach sour. But without taking them out, we’d never be able to let our guard down. Savvy as I was at having alert senses and eyes in the back of my head, I still had to sleep, still had to eat a meal without inhaling it so I wouldn’t be caught off guard. My nerves needed the ability to relax, even if only for a day or two. With a killer on the loose, I’d lose that opportunity. I grimaced. You’d think that with a damn archangel on our side, that Metatron would be willing to help us out and give us some protection. “What are you thinking about over there?” I glanced over my shoulder. Clay sat on the edge of the bed, hands pressed into the mattress, shoulders hunched high. Like the stress of our situation was getting to him too. I took one of the mid-sized knives and carried it over to him. “That we’re not as prepared as I’d like.” “You mean I’m not.” “You need to be ready to kill.” I flipped the knife and held the blade, pushing the hilt toward him. He reached an unsteady hand toward it and curled his fingers tentatively around the metal. I released it. “How much hand-to-hand did you do in the military?” He shook his head and stood. “I wasn’t in the military.” I frowned. “Yes, you were. Two years.” I’d looked it up in the database. I knew all about the time he’d spent in the Army. He shook his head and moved the knife to his left hand, let the weight settle into his palm, then switched it back. His head lifted and he pierced me with those blue eyes and a cheeky grin. “Nope. Didn’t even graduate high school.” He shrugged. “But I made a couple friends good with computers.” “I knew it.” Again, I’d dismissed my first impression about his background when I’d found it. I knew little about him when I’d pulled up all the data that I had access to, but it had seemed manufactured, too perfect. I shook my head and he winked. “Well, that just means you have more work to do. You’ve proven that you’re fairly decent, but you have to be better. If I can beat you, then they’re going to annihilate you.” “You haven’t beaten me—” “First.” I was not about to get into a discussion about how many times we’d traded the upper hand when we’d fought. I’d held him off and he’d never been able to best me, and he had me by six inches and fifty pounds. I needed him to be able to take me every time if I was going to feel safe about him protecting himself … and watching my back. His mouth snapped closed and the skin around the edges of his eyes creased like he was finally taking this serious. “First,” I started again. “You need to be able to throw and then we’ll work on getting away clean. I don’t want you wrestling with these guys. I want you staying as far away from them as possible. Throw, slice, run.” “I don’t run.” “Yeah, I know.” I poked him hard in the shoulder right in his still-healing wound. “Ow, dammit!” He jerked away and rubbed his arm. “What the hell?” “You got lucky and you know it. That should have killed you. If you wouldn’t have been toppling out the window, he would have gotten a clean kill.” I would have. “I’m always lucky. I don’t have to worry about this stuff like you do. I’m not in life-or-death situations. Ever.” He handed the knife back. “I thought you were going to handle all of this. Killing is what you do. I’ll do the thief stuff, you take care of that.” He waved his hand toward the stack of weapons. I shoved the knife toward him again. “Clay, I’m serious about this. They’re going to try and kill you again.” “And what’s a knife going to do? Block the bullet? You think they aren’t going to come at me with everything they have so they don’t miss this time?” His voice rose. “Because I think I don’t stand a fucking chance. They’re probably going to blow up my car, or shoot me through that window while I’m sleeping with you tonight!” He knocked my hand away and paced the room. I holstered the knife and crossed my arms. I wanted him mad enough that he’d see reason, but I didn’t want him giving up all hope. “They’re not going to kill you like that.” “How do you know?” he growled, not letting up on his pacing. I shrugged. “I just do. Azazel is too intimate, too connected to these kills. If he’s sending his guys, it will be on a personal level.” He glared at me. “Trust me. If there’s one thing I do know, it’s how assassins have habits too.” He stopped pacing and turned, then swiftly closed the distance between us, gripping my arms tightly and shaking me once. “How would you do it?” he asked, his tone deadly soft. “If they hired you to kill me, how would you do it?” His hard gaze roamed my face, at odds with the tenderness in his voice. I let him manhandle me, knowing that he needed to control something about this situation. And I wasn’t worried that he’d hurt me. Not like this, anyway. I let him bend me backward and I tipped my chin up, exposing my neck so he could see my submission to his grip, to his question, to his fear. “How?” I thought about the question, about his habits, about how I knew him. “At night,” I whispered. “I’d slip in your room while you slept and I’d cut your throat.” He blanched and his face whitened. “Really?” I nodded and his grip relaxed. I stayed next to him, our bodies almost touching. “You’re a sound sleeper.” I laughed softly. “You sleep like the dead. Like a man who has nothing to fear.” I watched his features shift and soften as he processed what I was saying. “I envy you, actually. You’ve been that way from the very first time and it was shocking to see someone be able to fall asleep instantly without having to check exits, strategies, weapons, tick off all the people who might be coming to kill you tonight.” His hands moved around my back, holding me gently. “Is that what it’s like for you, then? Every night?” I nodded. “I’m used to it, though. If I go through my list and it hasn’t changed much since yesterday, I usually fall asleep after a few minutes. I’ve done it for so long that it’s become my nighttime ritual. Other people count sheep. I count how many people I’ve pissed off today.” He frowned. “That’s a pretty shitty way to fall asleep.” “Maybe.” Somewhere we’d gotten tangled up in my sleep patterns instead of his, but I didn’t want to get him ruffled again. That would come soon enough when I went back to training him. And okay … maybe it felt good to be standing in his arms, to feel his strength and to not have to rely on my own for just a moment. He was so rarely this passionate, this fiery, and I liked this side of him as much as I did his goofy persona. I needed him worried and alert. “Maybe we could come up with a new one.” His gaze dropped to my lips and for just a fleeting second, I was aroused and tempted to let him kiss me, to let him take me away from the pain and grief and frustration of this mission, of losing Griffin, of being so goddamn alone. His gaze flickered back up to my eyes and I saw the question there, like he’d expected me to brush him off instantly, pull out of his arms, and chastise him like I’d done every other time before. And I meant to … I did. But I hesitated once more. And this time he didn’t ask, didn’t question. His lips came down hard on mine and his hands tightened on my back, pulling me against his body. His lips were warm and firm and held a desperation that only comes from fear of dying, of seeing missed chances and future opportunities being flung away and out of reach as death comes racing forward to fill every crevice of what may come. I kissed him back, clinging to the aliveness of him, the urgency of his movements, the pressure of his fingers into the small of my back. His tongue darted out and brushed my lips. I could have pulled away then and we would have been able to chalk this up to an untethered moment of fear, but I didn’t. I didn’t. I let him press gently into my mouth and as I tasted him, I moaned at the exquisite feel of someone else. Someone other than me inside this body where I’d been imprisoned. One of his hands came up to cup my face, to tilt it to the side so he could deepen the kiss, and damned if I didn’t let him. My own hands found his waist, curled into the loose fabric of his shirt, and I felt more warmth and strength there, at the base of his ribs, the edge of his waistband. He kissed me deeply and with a longing that echoed in my own self. Then he gentled the kiss, touching his lips softly to mine and bringing his other hand up to hold my jaw. He rested his forehead against mine and my breath came in ragged gasps. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I didn’t mean—” I gave my head a little shake, our foreheads still pressed together. “Don’t. Just let it stand.” He moved one arm around my back and drew my cheek to his chest. My arms unclenched from his shirt and slid around his waist. We stood there, soldiers thrown together in a war that was not of our own making, death clinging to the door like the dark of the night, worries scratching at the hinges. But in this one moment, breathing each other’s air, we were safe.",

I would have given anything to forget it was him, pretend he was someone else—not Griffin—but a faceless, nameless body that I could burrow into and lose myself for a few more hours of ignorant bliss. But awake, I couldn’t pretend that his arms didn’t feel just a little too good, or that his body didn’t fit a little too perfectly. Somewhere during the night he’d ditched his shirt and his bare skin against my exposed arms made me feel things I wasn’t ready to explore. I needed to shut that down immediately. We were partners, and I couldn’t let the lines between us blur into something confusing. After he’d kissed me, he’d tugged me down to the bed and exhaustion had overcome us both. He’d pulled the covers over our sagging bodies and held me. I’d let him, believing that it was more for him than for me, knowing it was a lie but choosing to surrender because I’d wanted it. For a handful of seconds, I’d voiced the need to train, but he’d shushed me and massaged the tension knots in my neck until I’d fallen asleep. I’d only managed a few hours of sleep, but I couldn’t stay. I slipped out of his arms and showered quickly, not wanting him to come looking for me while I was wet and naked. While he snored—lost in his sleep of the dead—I dressed, armed myself with an arsenal of knives and one gun, then pulled open the laptop that had been stored beneath the weapons. I wouldn’t be able to access the other mainframes—they kept each other locked out pretty good, at least beyond my own capabilities—but if there was anything to be found on Clay’s guy, the CIA would have enough to get us started until I could access the others. The art and relics that he’d stolen for that buyer would start the web and I could follow the trail inward from there. Thieves didn’t operate in a vacuum. Their paths always crossed into drugs, or money laundering, or some operation that the CIA needed to infiltrate. Especially a guy like Clay’s buyer, working with the high-end pieces he’d asked Clay to get. Azazel might be able to escape the CIA’s notice, but he was using regular men who were susceptible to surveillance, and that worked in my favor. All I needed was a single strand to get me going. The last painting we fenced was obviously a dead end, but maybe some of the original pieces preceded Azazel’s involvement. Those might be regular heists that weren’t tainted by Dr. Death. My fingers flew across the keyboard and I followed lead after lead, scratching out details on a notepad. This guy had sent Clay all over the world looking for relics. And he’d had other thieves picking up pieces for him too. I traced them all, not knowing where they’d intersect. One tiny detail that I overlooked now might be the key to unraveling this thing. The hair at my nape prickled and I froze, pen hovering above the notepad. I listened, not sure what had pulled me out of my zone, but I trusted the feeling. I stood, closed the laptop, and hurriedly tucked everything into the bag. I picked up a handgun from the remaining weapons. “Clay,” I whispered. “Huh?” He sat up groggily, the sheets and comforter falling away from his bare chest. “We have company.” I eased toward the window, peeking out the blinds. Impressively, he flew into action, pulling on a shirt and boots. Thank god I’d already gotten dressed. He walked over to me and checked outside. “What’s going on?” I shook my head, but didn’t dare look away. “Not sure. Something set me off. I think we need to go.” “I’ll follow you.” I handed him the gun. “Take this.” He grimaced, but stuck it in the holster I’d made him start wearing in the small of his back. Today we were picking up more weapons for him and I wanted him in a double shoulder holster too. These guys played for keeps. And I’ll be damned if I was going to let them get my partner.",

      "content": "Chapter Eight Now that we were being forced out of the hotel with too many hours before we could leave, I needed a place where we could hide out, and if we could train, too, that would be ideal. Nothing moved in the bright afternoon light but that didn’t mean they weren’t closing in on us. I’d doubted my intuition too many times over the last couple months and I’d promised to get back to trusting it. Today was the ultimate test since I hadn’t seen or heard anything to back up the feeling that had yanked me out of my research. The motel opened onto the parking lot and the Rover sat four feet to the left of the door. I hated walking out that way, but it was our only choice. Maybe if they thought that they still had the drop on us, we could get to the car and… “Fuck.” I had no reason to suspect otherwise, but I knew they’d rigged the truck. Clay pressed into me, peering out the small crack in the blinds above my head. “What?” His body tensed against mine and I could hear the worry in his voice. “We can’t take the truck.” I quickly scanned the parking lot. They might still be waiting for confirmation, needing to take it back to the boss that we’d successfully been eliminated. I had to assume we had eyes on us. “How fast can you hotwire a car?” I asked, knowing instinctively that he held the ability in his arsenal of thievery. “Never timed myself. Probably less than a minute.” “I need you to do it in ten seconds.” “Okay.” He didn’t sell it with a lot of confidence, but I knew he’d rise to the occasion. If nothing else, he was a professional and I knew his fear would fall away once we got moving. Standing here, wavering, only had him thinking. “Grab the bag.” He slung it over his shoulder and followed me into the bathroom. I wedged my feet against the rusty old window and busted the hinge loose from several coats of paint. He helped me slide it open. “The second you hit the ground, I want your arm around me and we’re the most-in-love couple anyone’s ever seen. Got it?” He grinned. “Yep!” I scrambled through the door and hit the sidewalk below, thankful that we’d ended up in the wrong room and not one on an upper floor. He landed behind me and his arm went around my shoulders and I curled into him, hiding my face. The people after us were looking for a two-man team, not a couple. Again, the difference was minute, but it mattered. I led him away from the truck and quickly through the courtyard of the dilapidated hotel, dodging benches and crumbling ashtrays. On the far side, I headed straight for an older, beige Honda Accord. Clay quickly jimmied the door and I scrambled inside, weapon drawn and scanning every shadow surrounding us. The engine fired and he pulled out of the parking lot. “Which way?” “Right. Get us as far as you can, then we’ll make a plan.” At the end of the block, I saw the first inconsistency move along the bright face of a neighboring storefront. “Shit! Gun it! And go left. Left!” He jammed his foot to the floor and the peppy car shot forward, startling the man hidden in the underbelly of a tall hedge that bordered the store. I didn’t want to shoot him, not out here in plain sight in the middle of the day, but leaving him alive was incredibly stupid and not a risk we could afford anymore. The little car’s wheels squealed as he cranked to the left and down a tight alley. The suspension shuddered as we hit a pothole. I whipped around and watched nervously as the man ran across the street chasing us, skirting parked cars and trash cans. I didn’t recognize him as the sunlight blinded me as we raced through the mottled light between buildings. His attack was all the recognition I needed. I twisted the other way, bending between the seats so I could get a better shot and sighted in on his forehead. “Go, go, go,” I shouted. “Where? Shit, this doesn’t go anywhere.” “Did you just head us down a dead end?” I couldn’t turn around and look. My heart pounded in my ears and my arms trembled. “I got this!” he shouted. “Settle down, settle down.” Clay was talking more to himself than to me but I had to trust him and his decisions. Do I take this guy out? I groaned. Leave a body in the middle of a street? Dammit. I did not want to do that. This was a worst-case scenario. If Clay could get us out of here… Fuck. That wasn’t true. No matter where he drove us, these guys would follow. They’d found us in the hotel and I’d never had that happen before. We were being chased by the best and I couldn’t leave one alive. Goddammit! I sighted again and took the shot, dropping our pursuer beside a dumpster. “Dammit.” I hated doing that but one alive was one who could keep coming after us. Azazel would send more, but at least for tonight, we’d lost our immediate tail. That didn’t mean there weren’t more. We’d have to stay vigilant. Clay skidded around a corner to the right, shooting us out into a busy roadway, nearly missing a truck and trailer. I searched the landscape to orient us, spotting the top of a building I knew. “Take your next left. Head toward the highway, then go south.” “Okay.” Clay checked all the mirrors, his fingers tight around the steering wheel. I holstered the gun and slumped in the seat, then put my seatbelt on. “We’re going to need to ditch the car. That bullet hole in the back window paints a little too much of an obvious target on us.” Clay’s eyes widened. “Did you kill him?” I clenched my teeth and nodded. I felt sick about it, even though technically it was self-defense. My gray line was shrinking and starting to blur and I didn’t like it. I’d had guys on my tail before and I’d chosen to outrun them because they weren’t part of the hit. Usually once I was out of their sight I was no longer a threat and they didn’t know how to find me. This time was different. This time they knew exactly where to find me. And out of sight was only going to make them more aggressive about hunting me. Hunting us. This was one enemy I couldn’t outrun. I didn’t know if our attacker tonight had been part of Clay’s buyer’s team or Azazel’s, but they were becoming impossible to tell apart. At the end of the day, everyone trying to kill us worked for Azazel.",

I holstered the gun and slumped in the seat, then put my seatbelt on. “We’re going to need to ditch the car. That bullet hole in the back window paints a little too much of an obvious target on us.” Clay’s eyes widened. “Did you kill him?” I clenched my teeth and nodded. I felt sick about it, even though technically it was self-defense. My gray line was shrinking and starting to blur and I didn’t like it. I’d had guys on my tail before and I’d chosen to outrun them because they weren’t part of the hit. Usually once I was out of their sight I was no longer a threat and they didn’t know how to find me. This time was different. This time they knew exactly where to find me. And out of sight was only going to make them more aggressive about hunting me. Hunting us. This was one enemy I couldn’t outrun. I didn’t know if our attacker tonight had been part of Clay’s buyer’s team or Azazel’s, but they were becoming impossible to tell apart. At the end of the day, everyone trying to kill us worked for Azazel.",

      "content": "Chapter Nine We drove through neighborhoods and bustling industrial sections, quietly absorbed in our own thoughts. Mine skipped between what happened between Clay and I and killing that man. My comments were limited to directions as I guided Clay toward a MI6 training center. Along the way we traded the Accord for a blue Kia at a gas station, but even that had happened with a minimum of interaction between us. I’d thought about asking him what he was thinking about but couldn’t bring myself to draw him into either of my conversations. For variety, I thought about the facility and what training I wanted to put Clay through. There was a gun range and several side rooms with equipment and mats so we could work on throwing and hand-combat. I hadn’t been there in over four years, but it couldn’t have changed too much and I was fairly certain that they wouldn’t have gotten rid of it. One of the facilities best features was how well hidden it was. And as far as I knew it was the only one of its kind in the UK. The anonymity paired with the level of weaponry and security appealed to me a great deal right now. We needed all those things. I squinted at the mile marker and tried to remember the back way so we could avoid any questions at the main gate. I was nearly positive that my security code still worked and we wouldn’t have any issues using the back entrance. “Take the next exit.” Clay made a face. “Are you sure this is an exit?” “Trust me.” He did and we got off the highway, having lost our tail for good back in town. I was a little surprised that Azazel hadn’t sent more than one man after us. That was twice now that he’d underestimated us. I didn’t imagine we’d have that luxury again, which was a lot of the reason that Clay needed to get lethal. The pavement quickly switched to dirt and Clay gave me a hesitant glance but kept driving. I didn’t remember the road being dirt, but it had been so long that it certainly could have been. After fifteen minutes, I started to think I’d gotten it wrong and just as I was about to tell Clay to turn around, we crested a short hill to find a tall chain-link fence and a security reader. He slowed and I scanned the horizon, but there wasn’t anyone visibly watching this gate even though I knew we were still on surveillance somewhere on the property. He rolled down the window and I leaned across, punching in my code. I sat back in my chair and waited. Every second felt like a minute until the gate finally swung open. “What is this place?” “It’s an underground training facility that the NSA and FBI both have access to. I haven’t been here for almost five years. Not only will we be safe, but you’ll be able to do some target practice while I keep researching the databases to see what I can find on your buyer. Take a left up here at the fork.” This would give me more intel than what I’d been able to find through the CIA, and hopefully things would start intersecting more than they had. The road bent around a hill and the abundance of trees thickened until we were nearly driving through a forest. A small blue-and-white shed recessed in the trees was the only indication of life. “Pull past it and park on the right hand side.” I pointed. “Are we the only ones here?” “Probably not, but everyone else uses the front entrance.” He looked around, studying the landscape and absence of life, then parked the Kia and killed the engine, then twisted in his chair. “What kind of security clearance do you have, anyway?” I shrugged. “Whatever I need, mostly.” He blinked, not expecting that answer. “That’s pretty impressive.” “I guess.” I got out and grabbed the bag of weapons, slinging it over my shoulder. I headed toward the shed. “It’s only impressive the first time, then you realize most everyone gets that kind of clearance. At least the ones in my line of business.” He slammed the driver-side door and jogged to catch up to me. “I’d think they’d keep assassins on a tighter leash.” I laughed and entered another code into a hidden keypad on the side of the shed. “Nah. They’d rather pretend we don’t exist. If we’re always asking for clearance for the things we need, then someone has to pay attention. Easier to give us carte blanche and hope we don’t screw too much up.” He grunted. The door slid open on silent hinges and I stepped inside, glancing around to see if anything had changed in the years while I’d been away. The cavernous entry of smooth concrete was dull as ever, not showing a single sign of upgrade or wear. It was definitely still being used because it was clean and there weren’t any obvious signs of disuse like cobwebs up in the corners or the dusky smell of unused spaces. I started toward the back stairs that led down to the training rooms. Clay grabbed my arm and pulled me to a stop. “You’re sure this isn’t a trap?” I frowned and looked up and down the wide hallway. “No. Not from this end.” I elbowed him in the ribs, desperate to lighten the tension. “But I’m glad you’re at least starting to think about your six a little.” “Yeah, well, getting chased down and shot at made that a little higher on my priority list.” “Maybe if you’d have listened to me before the first shooting you wouldn’t have had to learn it that way.” “Whatever.” He let go of my arm and I moved us deeper into the facility. The hallway ended at a set of industrial, open-tread stairs leading down four stories. I hesitated, but only for a second. Clay’s warning was warranted but I had to trust something and so far, no one on my end had been compromised. That didn’t mean that they wouldn’t be, or truly that they hadn’t, only that we hadn’t been exposed to them yet. If Azazel was limited to corrupting people who had vendettas against us, there weren’t enough people in MI6 who even knew I existed, let alone any who hated me. I did their dirty work, so eliminating me didn’t serve them. Yes, like I’d told Clay, there were other people who could do their dirty work, but not many who took on the jobs I did. Clay had pissed people off and I assumed that anger, fear, and revenge were probably the easiest emotions to manipulate. If the ultimate goal was to take someone out, it wouldn’t be hard to turn an emotion like fear into an unchecked hatred. If Clay’s buyer had been pissed about me getting the relic, he would have been prime breeding ground for Azazel to add in even the tiniest amount of bitterness that could fester into a need to take Clay out. I’d already seen the proof that Clay’s buyer used other thieves, so it wasn’t like he needed Clay to do all his dirty work. Clay might be the best, but two crappy thieves were better than one great one that you couldn’t trust to either do the work. Or not flip sides like Clay had. I still wanted to do more research into Clay’s buyer. At the bottom of the final flight of stairs, a trio of big, steel, soundproof doors opened into the separate training areas. “We want this one” I pointed toward the one at the far end that led to the firing range. I punched in the code and opened the door for Clay. “I’m going to grab a couple other weapons,” I said, walking away and stopping at the first door that we’d passed. I entered the code for that door, a little surprised that they all still worked. They really did trust me with everything. But what I’d told Clay was true and I’d learned it early on—if you’re going to hire someone to do your dirty work, it’s easier to let them do their own thing instead of having to know what they’re doing and be accountable. I pulled the heavy door open and couldn’t help but grin at the arsenal on the other side. Sniper rifles, shotguns, handguns, automatic rifles. Even a surface-to-air rocket launcher. It was an impressive gluttony of the finest weaponry available. I thought about Clay—his style, his habits, and how all of those would play into a weapon he’d feel comfortable using without hesitation. Funny how silly things like that were factors but I knew he didn’t feel comfortable with my weapons and there was no point in making him fire them today. I wanted to find something that would become a natural extension of his body, something that wouldn’t feel foreign. I walked the room again, skipping over the SIG Sauers, Berettas, and Glocks, and settled on a pistol-grip Mossberg shotgun and a Colt .45 pistol, thinking that both would appeal to Clay’s sense of machismo with the nod to Jesse James. It might take us a couple times and adjustments to figure out what he preferred, but this would be a good start. I grabbed a box of ammo for my own weapons along with a box for him, and headed into the training room. His eyebrows rose as I handed him both guns. “Wow. Where’d you get these?” I jerked my thumb over my shoulder and pointed toward the other room. “Candy store down the hall.” He smiled. “You’re a fascinating woman, I’ll give you that.” “Thanks, I think.” I set the weapons on one of the low counters and grabbed ear protection off the wall rack and tossed him a pair of blue ones. “Safety first.”",

      "content": "Chapter Ten Clay grinned, weapon in each hand. “Now what?” I pointed toward the targets hanging at the other end of the range. “Now you learn how to get good.” “I’m a decent shot.” I had yet to see him handle a weapon with any sort of confidence, so as much as I wanted to believe him, we had a lot of work to do. “Decent isn’t going to cut it anymore. We’re going to see more of what we did tonight. People are going to be coming after us with deadly intent. You have to be able to take them out.” “I didn’t need to tonight.” “You can’t count on me to be there.” I put ear protectors on and turned him toward the first target, taking the shotgun away from him and nudging the arm with the pistol. He scowled and his features hardened. “What are you saying? You’re going to teach me how to shoot, and then you’re ditching me to fend for myself now that I’m a liability?” “No. Of course not. But what if something happens to me? What if they shoot me first and injure me and you’re all that stands between us and death?” He shook his head and stared at the target. “That’s not going to happen.” “I need to know that you can protect yourself.” “Done a fine job so far,” he huffed. I patted his arm. “You have. Now let’s make you better. They’ll never expect it.” He lifted his weapon and aimed at the target. I stepped behind him and watched his posture, his breathing, his aim. This first shot was going to go wildly off target, but I wanted him to see that before I made suggestions and adjustments. Some people are naturals when it came to handling weapons and Clay’s skill lay elsewhere, but I could at least make him more accurate. Weapons would never be his first line of defense, but when you’re as stealthy as a shadow, you don’t have to be a fighter. And that had served him well. Until now. I felt bad that I’d brought this on him. They’d been watching him for a long time, well before we met, but that didn’t mean that I wasn’t to blame. Azazel knew that I’d come to rely on Clay, that we’d become each other’s liabilities and I was grateful that we’d become allies before they’d been able to either turn him against me or kill him. Now we had a chance of keeping him alive and I was going to do whatever it took to keep him that way. He squeezed the trigger, missing the target. “Man, I’m not used to this one.” “That’s okay,” I yelled so he could hear me through the headgear. “First few are always to get used to the weapon. Slow your breathing and concentrate. Don’t hold your breath when you fire, just pause when you sight and pull the trigger.” He fired the remaining shots in the gun, managing to hit the target with the last two. “Getting better.” I pushed the button to retrieve the target and swap it out while he reloaded. “Wait.” I let the paper flutter halfway to us and grabbed a couple bullets. “You have to be fast at this too. They’re not going to give you a chance to reload. That’s when they’re going to double their efforts to take you out.” His fingers trembled as he loaded them and I covered them with mine, pulling him to face me. “What’s wrong?” He looked away. “Nothing. Just nerves.” I shook my head. “What’s going on?” “Nothing.” “Why do you hate guns so much?” “I never said that, I’m just not as experienced as you are.” He pulled his fingers away and jammed the remaining bullets in the gun. “No one is as capable as you.” “Clay?” I grabbed his shirt and tugged him back toward me. “What’s going on?” This wasn’t about his inability or inexperience. This was something deeper. If it was about what a lousy shot he was—and who wasn’t the first hundred targets—he’d be joking and laughing and his usual self-deprecating-comedian self. “Talk to me.” The muscle in his jaw clenched and he stared at the concrete wall over my head. I took the weapon from him and set it on the firing shelf in front of us, then stepped closer and put both palms flat on his chest. “Clay, I’m here. Talk to me.” He squeezed his eyes shut and tipped his chin up like he was trying to keep from drowning in the powerful emotions and memories. His arms hung limp at his sides, fingers clenched into tight fists. I’d never seen him like this and it made my heart hurt as it recognized grief and pain. “I had a brother,” he said. “Jeremy. He was two years younger than me.” He swallowed but still didn’t look at me, didn’t open his eyes. Beneath my fingers, his heart raced. “We were typical boys, into a lot of stupid shit and we gave my mom hell, always starting trouble. I was supposed to do a better job of setting an example.” He looked at me and the sorrow in his eyes startled me, but I didn’t say anything, knowing all too well the need to purge once the emotion starts flowing. He didn’t need my comfort right now, only a pair of ears to listen and for once, I could give him what he needed. “I wanted to. I wanted to be the great role model, the perfect older brother for him to look up to and emulate. I just always thought I’d have time to get my shit together.” He shook his head sadly. “My senior year of high school—his sophomore year—we went to a party. Some stupid drinkfest that didn’t matter, that was no different than the dozens we’d gone to that month … but I wish we hadn’t.” His voice lowered to a near whisper. “I wish we’d have stayed home that night to work on the chores Mom had asked us to do.” He laughed. “I remember being so pissed about it that night when she’d rattled off her list of things, the lawn, changing light bulbs, loading the dishwasher … stupid shit that I didn’t have time for.” His fingers curled around my elbows, anchoring him to the present as he swam in the dread of the past. “I drove, knowing that Jeremy would have to bring us home, but he was cool with it. He was always cool with it. If he was hanging with me, he didn’t care what we were doing or where we were going, he was down for anything.” “Sounds like a good kid.” His fingers tightened on my arms. “He was.” His voice tightened and he worked to get the words out, swallowing hard again. “He was.” I wasn’t sure how all of this connected to what we were doing down here in the firing range, but a dread welled up in me as we neared the climax of his story. On a subconscious level, I knew that Clay hadn’t become a thief because everything had been great at home and growing up. As someone who’d experienced the turmoil of a tough life, I didn’t want anyone else to live it, let alone someone that I was coming to care about. Part of me didn’t want him to finish the story so I could continue to imagine him having a fun, laughing childhood, not the pain and horror he was about to reveal. “What happened that night?” I asked. “It was the cliché high-school tragedy. Half a dozen guys from a neighboring school showed up at the party. There was too much beer, followed by an altercation about a girl, and a fight broke out. I was too busy getting wasted and telling stories to pay much attention to what was going on, but Jeremy…” He swallowed and looked away to gather himself, then brought his attention back to me. “Jeremy was always trying to keep the peace. Everywhere he went, he was the mediator, always trying to get everyone to get along. He hated confrontation.” My fingers slid down his chest and I linked them loosely behind his back, keeping a small circle of safety between our bodies, but afraid to let him go. “One of the guys had brought a gun.” I winced. Holy shit. No wonder he hated them. “Jeremy made a move, jumped in the middle of the fight, and the gun went off. There were a couple injuries, but his were fatal.” He pulled out of my arms and walked to the wall, lifting his arms and collapsing against it, fists still curled into tight balls of rage where they rested above his head. “I didn’t even know what was going on until the ambulance arrived. I barely pushed through the crowd to see him before they loaded him. They wouldn’t let me ride with him to the hospital. Said I was too drunk.” I turned and walked to him, settling my hand softly in the small of his back and rubbing slow circles. His breath came fast and heavy but I knew he wasn’t ready to put this to bed yet, so I didn’t insult him by placating him with apologies for his suffering, not about to be a raging hypocrite and offering the thing I’d hated the most when my grief for Griffin threatened to suffocate me. People and their I’m sorrys were hell to endure. He hit the wall with the meat of his hands, then straightened, pulling me to him. I let him, knowing it was out of a need to be close to someone, not necessarily me. His hands curled in my hair at the base of my neck and he pressed his cheek to the top of my head. I hooked my thumbs through his belt loops, letting my hands curl gently against the rise of his pockets. He sighed heavily, stirring my hair. “He died a week later, but he never came out of the coma. I never got to apologize, never got to tell him that I regretted it, us going that night. He died thinking I’d abandoned him at that party, that getting wasted was more important than he was that night.” My own regret mirrored his, squeezing my chest and constricting my heartbeat. There was no greater pain that knowing a loved one died with your name on their lips, wondering where you were and why you’d left them alone. Clay had beaten himself with the regret for years, and I still had that time and agony ahead of me. But I understood. And I also knew that there was nothing I could tell him that would lessen his guilt. I’d searched my own soul for the words that would have erased mine, and other than Griffin standing in front of me and telling me that it was okay, there was nothing anyone on this side of heaven could say that made the guilt ease even a fraction. “I know,” I whispered, offering up the only paltry thing I could. “Griffin knew you loved him.” I shook my head, my cheek rubbing against his shirt. “Maybe before that night. But run to ground, bleeding, dying, tortured…” My throat tightened, cutting off my air. I swallowed. “I’m pretty sure he condemned me to the lowest depths of hell as they finished him off.” His fingers tightened on my neck. “No,” he whispered. “No. His last thought was of you.” He lifted my face, cradling it between both of his hands and searching my features. “Mine would be.” I wasn’t sure how we’d flipped to him comforting me, but I needed the balm. Needed to hear his words now that I’d exposed my own pain in trying to help him deal with his. He brushed his lips against mine, then tucked my head down against his chest again, his strong arms wrapped around me. “Mine would.” The whispered words echoed off the concrete walls, then hung in the air. Somewhere outside, men were hunting us, coming for us, bent on eliminating us for the sake of a holy war. But again, we’d managed to carve out a slice of solace, and I clung to it. Griffin lived with a slow-burning simmer, keeping his emotions tightly in check, nothing ever out of place. He’d learned it from his mother and since I lived bold enough for both of us (even if he hadn’t known it) I’d always felt like he was the perfect other half of me, the calm to my storm, the quiet springtime to my raging winter. Clay’s deep running grief and pain of a childhood torn by tragedy gave us a way to relate on a level at which Griffin hadn’t ever been able to reach me. A missing connection that I’d been oblivious to until this moment. Clay hid behind his laugher and goofball antics, but his depth hadn’t been easy to conceal, even without the details he’d just shared with me. He was loud and obnoxious and free, dancing along the cliff edge with everything he did. Whether it was his job, his truck, or the way he gave danger the bird on a regular basis. I’d connected with that because we’d met on the cliff face, and I’d recognized myself in him—though it was only becoming clear to me now. The power of the revelation made me step away and I scrambled for a place to settle. As was becoming both his right and contribution to our relationship, Clay stepped up to the plate and hit the slow, curving ball I needed. He smiled with a shrug of his shoulder, letting the normal Clay resurface and putting us back into our comfort zone. “Sucks that you got stuck with a pussy of a partner. I’d ask for an upgrade.” I chuckled, letting him lighten the mood and return us to our easy friendship. We still had work to do, but the bond between us was stronger now than it had ever been. As was my commitment to keep him alive. “How do you feel about knives?”",

      "content": "Chapter Ten Clay grinned, weapon in each hand. “Now what?” I pointed toward the targets hanging at the other end of the range. “Now you learn how to get good.” “I’m a decent shot.” I had yet to see him handle a weapon with any sort of confidence, so as much as I wanted to believe him, we had a lot of work to do. “Decent isn’t going to cut it anymore. We’re going to see more of what we did tonight. People are going to be coming after us with deadly intent. You have to be able to take them out.” “I didn’t need to tonight.” “You can’t count on me to be there.” I put ear protectors on and turned him toward the first target, taking the shotgun away from him and nudging the arm with the pistol. He scowled and his features hardened. “What are you saying? You’re going to teach me how to shoot, and then you’re ditching me to fend for myself now that I’m a liability?” “No. Of course not. But what if something happens to me? What if they shoot me first and injure me and you’re all that stands between us and death?” He shook his head and stared at the target. “That’s not going to happen.” “I need to know that you can protect yourself.” “Done a fine job so far,” he huffed. I patted his arm. “You have. Now let’s make you better. They’ll never expect it.” He lifted his weapon and aimed at the target. I stepped behind him and watched his posture, his breathing, his aim. This first shot was going to go wildly off target, but I wanted him to see that before I made suggestions and adjustments. Some people are naturals when it came to handling weapons and Clay’s skill lay elsewhere, but I could at least make him more accurate. Weapons would never be his first line of defense, but when you’re as stealthy as a shadow, you don’t have to be a fighter. And that had served him well. Until now. I felt bad that I’d brought this on him. They’d been watching him for a long time, well before we met, but that didn’t mean that I wasn’t to blame. Azazel knew that I’d come to rely on Clay, that we’d become each other’s liabilities and I was grateful that we’d become allies before they’d been able to either turn him against me or kill him. Now we had a chance of keeping him alive and I was going to do whatever it took to keep him that way. He squeezed the trigger, missing the target. “Man, I’m not used to this one.” “That’s okay,” I yelled so he could hear me through the headgear. “First few are always to get used to the weapon. Slow your breathing and concentrate. Don’t hold your breath when you fire, just pause when you sight and pull the trigger.” He fired the remaining shots in the gun, managing to hit the target with the last two. “Getting better.” I pushed the button to retrieve the target and swap it out while he reloaded. “Wait.” I let the paper flutter halfway to us and grabbed a couple bullets. “You have to be fast at this too. They’re not going to give you a chance to reload. That’s when they’re going to double their efforts to take you out.” His fingers trembled as he loaded them and I covered them with mine, pulling him to face me. “What’s wrong?” He looked away. “Nothing. Just nerves.” I shook my head. “What’s going on?” “Nothing.” “Why do you hate guns so much?” “I never said that, I’m just not as experienced as you are.” He pulled his fingers away and jammed the remaining bullets in the gun. “No one is as capable as you.” “Clay?” I grabbed his shirt and tugged him back toward me. “What’s going on?” This wasn’t about his inability or inexperience. This was something deeper. If it was about what a lousy shot he was—and who wasn’t the first hundred targets—he’d be joking and laughing and his usual self-deprecating-comedian self. “Talk to me.” The muscle in his jaw clenched and he stared at the concrete wall over my head. I took the weapon from him and set it on the firing shelf in front of us, then stepped closer and put both palms flat on his chest. “Clay, I’m here. Talk to me.” He squeezed his eyes shut and tipped his chin up like he was trying to keep from drowning in the powerful emotions and memories. His arms hung limp at his sides, fingers clenched into tight fists. I’d never seen him like this and it made my heart hurt as it recognized grief and pain. “I had a brother,” he said. “Jeremy. He was two years younger than me.” He swallowed but still didn’t look at me, didn’t open his eyes. Beneath my fingers, his heart raced. “We were typical boys, into a lot of stupid shit and we gave my mom hell, always starting trouble. I was supposed to do a better job of setting an example.” He looked at me and the sorrow in his eyes startled me, but I didn’t say anything, knowing all too well the need to purge once the emotion starts flowing. He didn’t need my comfort right now, only a pair of ears to listen and for once, I could give him what he needed. “I wanted to. I wanted to be the great role model, the perfect older brother for him to look up to and emulate. I just always thought I’d have time to get my shit together.” He shook his head sadly. “My senior year of high school—his sophomore year—we went to a party. Some stupid drinkfest that didn’t matter, that was no different than the dozens we’d gone to that month … but I wish we hadn’t.” His voice lowered to a near whisper. “I wish we’d have stayed home that night to work on the chores Mom had asked us to do.” He laughed. “I remember being so pissed about it that night when she’d rattled off her list of things, the lawn, changing light bulbs, loading the dishwasher … stupid shit that I didn’t have time for.” His fingers curled around my elbows, anchoring him to the present as he swam in the dread of the past. “I drove, knowing that Jeremy would have to bring us home, but he was cool with it. He was always cool with it. If he was hanging with me, he didn’t care what we were doing or where we were going, he was down for anything.” “Sounds like a good kid.” His fingers tightened on my arms. “He was.” His voice tightened and he worked to get the words out, swallowing hard again. “He was.” I wasn’t sure how all of this connected to what we were doing down here in the firing range, but a dread welled up in me as we neared the climax of his story. On a subconscious level, I knew that Clay hadn’t become a thief because everything had been great at home and growing up. As someone who’d experienced the turmoil of a tough life, I didn’t want anyone else to live it, let alone someone that I was coming to care about. Part of me didn’t want him to finish the story so I could continue to imagine him having a fun, laughing childhood, not the pain and horror he was about to reveal. “What happened that night?” I asked. “It was the cliché high-school tragedy. Half a dozen guys from a neighboring school showed up at the party. There was too much beer, followed by an altercation about a girl, and a fight broke out. I was too busy getting wasted and telling stories to pay much attention to what was going on, but Jeremy…” He swallowed and looked away to gather himself, then brought his attention back to me. “Jeremy was always trying to keep the peace. Everywhere he went, he was the mediator, always trying to get everyone to get along. He hated confrontation.” My fingers slid down his chest and I linked them loosely behind his back, keeping a small circle of safety between our bodies, but afraid to let him go. “One of the guys had brought a gun.” I winced. Holy shit. No wonder he hated them. “Jeremy made a move, jumped in the middle of the fight, and the gun went off. There were a couple injuries, but his were fatal.” He pulled out of my arms and walked to the wall, lifting his arms and collapsing against it, fists still curled into tight balls of rage where they rested above his head. “I didn’t even know what was going on until the ambulance arrived. I barely pushed through the crowd to see him before they loaded him. They wouldn’t let me ride with him to the hospital. Said I was too drunk.” I turned and walked to him, settling my hand softly in the small of his back and rubbing slow circles. His breath came fast and heavy but I knew he wasn’t ready to put this to bed yet, so I didn’t insult him by placating him with apologies for his suffering, not about to be a raging hypocrite and offering the thing I’d hated the most when my grief for Griffin threatened to suffocate me. People and their I’m sorrys were hell to endure. He hit the wall with the meat of his hands, then straightened, pulling me to him. I let him, knowing it was out of a need to be close to someone, not necessarily me. His hands curled in my hair at the base of my neck and he pressed his cheek to the top of my head. I hooked my thumbs through his belt loops, letting my hands curl gently against the rise of his pockets. He sighed heavily, stirring my hair. “He died a week later, but he never came out of the coma. I never got to apologize, never got to tell him that I regretted it, us going that night. He died thinking I’d abandoned him at that party, that getting wasted was more important than he was that night.” My own regret mirrored his, squeezing my chest and constricting my heartbeat. There was no greater pain that knowing a loved one died with your name on their lips, wondering where you were and why you’d left them alone. Clay had beaten himself with the regret for years, and I still had that time and agony ahead of me. But I understood. And I also knew that there was nothing I could tell him that would lessen his guilt. I’d searched my own soul for the words that would have erased mine, and other than Griffin standing in front of me and telling me that it was okay, there was nothing anyone on this side of heaven could say that made the guilt ease even a fraction. “I know,” I whispered, offering up the only paltry thing I could. “Griffin knew you loved him.” I shook my head, my cheek rubbing against his shirt. “Maybe before that night. But run to ground, bleeding, dying, tortured…” My throat tightened, cutting off my air. I swallowed. “I’m pretty sure he condemned me to the lowest depths of hell as they finished him off.” His fingers tightened on my neck. “No,” he whispered. “No. His last thought was of you.” He lifted my face, cradling it between both of his hands and searching my features. “Mine would be.” I wasn’t sure how we’d flipped to him comforting me, but I needed the balm. Needed to hear his words now that I’d exposed my own pain in trying to help him deal with his. He brushed his lips against mine, then tucked my head down against his chest again, his strong arms wrapped around me. “Mine would.” The whispered words echoed off the concrete walls, then hung in the air. Somewhere outside, men were hunting us, coming for us, bent on eliminating us for the sake of a holy war. But again, we’d managed to carve out a slice of solace, and I clung to it. Griffin lived with a slow-burning simmer, keeping his emotions tightly in check, nothing ever out of place. He’d learned it from his mother and since I lived bold enough for both of us (even if he hadn’t known it) I’d always felt like he was the perfect other half of me, the calm to my storm, the quiet springtime to my raging winter.

There’s basically zero training with it.” I walked over and pushed the target button, sending it to the far end of the range. “You’ll be deadly at close range, but not far. Shoot one from this distance and tell me how it feels.” He nodded. “Put your ear protection on, though.” I put mine over my head, muffling everything. He checked in with me. “Ready?” I nodded. He fired the weapon and as I expected, the shot didn’t make it all the way to the target. I moved it in halfway. He settled into his stance and pulled the trigger. Again, the target remained untouched. It was going to take a whole lot of practice for him to be accurate at that range, but we didn’t need him taking out targets at distance. I moved it closer. “You can’t miss from here.” He unloaded the remaining rounds, leaving nothing but a strand of the target. I pulled it in so I could change it out for a new one and glanced at him. He grinned and lowered the barrel. “I like it.” “Yeah.” I laughed. “I’ll bet. I like it too and I feel better with you having one that works for you. It’s not ideal, but with the shotgun, you’ll at least have a weapon. But, remember that it’s going to spray wide, so you’re going to take out everything in front of you. Let me show you.” I switched our two targets down to a triple hanger—three targets in a line—that would effectively show him the spray. I set it at the same distance away and showed him how to load the shotgun quickly. “Ready?” he asked, a ghost of a smile on his lips. I nodded and stepped behind him so I could watch the nuances of his style. He spread his feet, bent his knees, and rocked his hips forward. This time he kept the shotgun at waist level and rattled off five shots in quick succession. Again, the target disintegrated in front of him, leaving a blistering hole three feet in diameter. I pointed at the button to recall the target. “Swap your own out this time.” We repeated the process twenty times until I felt comfortable that he could load and chamber the weapon as fast as I could and his accuracy was as good as it was going to be today. “How do you feel about that?” He set the weapon on the table and took his earmuffs off. “Good. I think. I mean, you would know better than I would, but I’m definitely better.” I nodded. “Agree.” “Okay, what’s next? We load these bitches up and hit the streets, armed and dangerous?” I laughed. “Um, not quite. I still think there’s value in hand-to-hand and knife skills.” He made a face. “I guess.” Intent on catching him off guard, I punched him in the gut and tripped him, sending him sprawling backward onto his ass. He swept my feet, grabbing my left one and yanking me down beside him. With a quick twist, he pinned me with his body and I wasn’t fast enough to slip the hold. He yanked both of my arms high above my head and spanned my chest with my other hand. I stared, surprised and okay, a little impressed. “At least you’ve practiced something.” Warmth rose from his handprint pressed across my cleavage and I didn’t budge. I could get out but only by breaking one of his bones, and he was too valuable. Besides, a little confidence couldn’t hurt him. He’d gained a lot during the last bit of shooting after purging the pain of his brother, and I needed his cocky self firmly in place when we left here. He covered my hips with his thighs, and rocked up so he towered over me. “I said I didn’t need to practice this.” “Yeah, good for you, you can pin a girl.” He laughed. “You’re so far from a girl it’s not even funny.” That stung, especially since he had proof of my girliness half an inch from his thumb. He pressed down on my chest, compressing my lungs. “You’ve proved your point,” I wheezed. “No. I don’t think I have. You’ve tortured me over this for weeks. I want you to admit that I’m better than you are.” I frowned. What was this about? He clearly had been practicing since we’d fought and wrestled last. If I didn’t know better, I’d think that it really had bugged him that I’d been so much better at this than he had been. “You’re the one on top, so you’re clearly better.” “That’s not what I want from you.” He slid his hand up and over my collarbone, across my shoulder and took one wrist in each of his hands. His face hovered over mine. “What do you want from me?” “I want you to admit that you need me.” I huffed. He was starting to push it. I could still break away and was giving him the chance to tally the win, but he was about to make me prove it. I sure wasn’t about to gush about this single time that he’d managed to pin me. “I’ve already told you that. You’re the reason we have the pieces we do.” He shook his head. “No. I want you to need me like I need you.” Oh. I stilled beneath him and quit squirming. “What are you saying?” His gaze roamed my face, touching my eyes, my cheeks, my lips. “I’ve never told anyone about my brother, Lina. I’ve told you secrets that I buried long ago. I’m not in this to steal a piece anymore.” He grinned and shifted his hips, nestling obvious parts of him against me. “I mean, maybe a piece.” I groaned. “Sorry.” He grew serious again. “I can’t be serious for too long.” He glanced away quickly, then back. “It hurts.” I understood that better than I wanted to. Living and working alone kept me from having to deal with people and that had become my defense mechanism where Clay used humor. My heart pinched at the longing in his voice, recognizing the suffering. I was already physically attracted to him, and his emotional appeal was growing at an alarming pace. “What do you want, Clay?” I asked softly.",

      "content": "Chapter Twelve The chirp of someone disarming the alarm code shot me into action. I rolled out from under Clay and he jumped up, racing toward the weapons where he’d set them. I held out a hand to hold him, then curled it in a fist. “Stay,” I mouthed. I reached behind me and curled my fingers around the butt of my pistol and flicked off the safety. If we were about to get in a gunfight, I was the one who needed to do the shooting in these tight quarters. The door swung open and I blinked. “Holy fuck,” Clay said behind me. “Clarissa?” The blonde that he’d been kissing in front of the deli strode confidently into the room, hand outstretched toward me in greeting. “Lina,” she said warmly. She wore a black skirt suit and black heels, very agentish of her. “Nice to finally put a face to the name. I’m Agent Richards.” I took her hand and shook it, dumbstruck that this was Agent Richards. We’d done over a dozen missions together and Richards was one of my top priorities and it had never, not even once, occurred to me that she was a woman. Like Clay and his buyer, I’d handled all my correspondence with this agent over the secured lines and I’d just assumed… Christ. She walked to Clay and laid her hands on his chest. “Good to see you again,” she purred. What in the fuck was going on? My head spun and I needed to get her talking and figure out why she’d come down here. Mere coincidence that she was at the only training facility in London that we’d just happened to pick after being ambushed, all after she’d been in New York yesterday with her tongue down Clay’s throat? I stared at him, eyes narrowing. He looked at me over her head and shrugged. “We didn’t get around to talking business.” “Yeah,” I huffed. “I’ll bet.” A thousand emotions swirled inside me, but I could not get conflicted about our relationship-not-a-relationship right now. “So, Richards, fancy meeting you here.” I withdrew my hand from the weapon, but left the safety off. She turned away from Clay and stopped halfway, which pissed me off that I’d let her get between us. “I’m on my way to Germany, stopped in for a little training and a new Beretta. Imagine my surprise when I saw you on the monitors when I checked in.” Surprise, my ass. Killing her inside a registered facility was going to bring my carefully constructed world down on my head. If we got out of here alive. I had no illusions that she was here on government business, or that she hadn’t tailed us since supposedly leaving in a cab. Hell, she’d probably circled the block and watched our every move. I’d been too caught up in my own feelings to spot her. Dammit, I was going to get us killed. But I’d like today to not be that day. I ignored Clay and focused on Clarissa. I hated that name, hated everything about her. She’d deceived me for who knew how long. I thought about the missions we’d done together—all for Azazel? “Who’s in Germany?” “No one you know.” She flipped her hair back and took another step toward me, her focus leaving Clay as well. Out of my periphery, I saw him edge closer to the pistol. I didn’t like whatever he was thinking, but I couldn’t let her know that he was on the move. I needed to keep her distracted. “How long have you worked with Azazel?” “Since the beginning.” Not even a flicker of surprise that I knew, not even an attempt to cover it up. Now I knew that she’d come down here to kill us. “No more job offers from him?” Not that there was the slimmest chance that I’d take it, but I was curious to know why he’d flipped from one side to the other extreme. She shook her head. “No. He’s not one to beg. He offered once, and you’ve shunned him since. Taking out his man earlier did not please him. We’re not so easy to come by, people willing to make a deal with the Angel of Death. You’d be surprised at what a person has to endure before they get to that point in their life.” Her candied red lips were at odds with her words. I laughed. “Endure.” I looked her up and down, from her five-hundred-dollar shoes to her expensive blowout. “You don’t even know the meaning of the word. You didn’t seek him out because you were at your wit’s end. You sought him out for power.” She shrugged and examined her perfect manicure. “Endurance is not limited only to suffering. I’ve expected things out of my life and my skills. Azazel agreed to help me. No matter the definition of suffering, it’s still a drastic measure and not one many are willing to take.” “For obvious reasons.” I couldn’t believe that she’d willingly sought him out. Especially after all the work we’d done together, all the time she put into climbing the ladder and checking off boxes. My frustration at her willingness to give up mingled with my annoyance that she’d be another person I’d have to kill. “You’re a fool. Do you really think that he’s going to come through on whatever he promised you?” Clarissa’s future aside, I couldn’t help being impressed at the lengths Azazel was willing to go to entrap us. He’d used her beauty against Clay and my own work ethic against me. I’d worked so hard for her. He’d bested both of us and we hadn’t even known it. But I wasn’t going to let him win. “Since we’re not going to live through this, why don’t you tell me who’s in Germany?” She laughed. “Figured that bit out, did you?” Her hand slipped inside her jacket. I curled my fingers around a knife hilt holstered to my upper thigh, not daring to let my gaze flicker to Clay as he flexed his leg muscles. I didn’t know what he had planned, but I needed to take her out before he got any bright ideas. We all moved at once. Her arm flew from her jacket, gun pointed at me. I threw the knife. Clay leapt forward, leg outstretched in a wide sweeping arc.",

      "content": "Chapter Twelve The chirp of someone disarming the alarm code shot me into action. I rolled out from under Clay and he jumped up, racing toward the weapons where he’d set them. I held out a hand to hold him, then curled it in a fist. “Stay,” I mouthed. I reached behind me and curled my fingers around the butt of my pistol and flicked off the safety. If we were about to get in a gunfight, I was the one who needed to do the shooting in these tight quarters. The door swung open and I blinked. “Holy fuck,” Clay said behind me. “Clarissa?” The blonde that he’d been kissing in front of the deli strode confidently into the room, hand outstretched toward me in greeting. “Lina,” she said warmly. She wore a black skirt suit and black heels, very agentish of her. “Nice to finally put a face to the name. I’m Agent Richards.” I took her hand and shook it, dumbstruck that this was Agent Richards. We’d done over a dozen missions together and Richards was one of my top priorities and it had never, not even once, occurred to me that she was a woman. Like Clay and his buyer, I’d handled all my correspondence with this agent over the secured lines and I’d just assumed… Christ. She walked to Clay and laid her hands on his chest. “Good to see you again,” she purred. What in the fuck was going on? My head spun and I needed to get her talking and figure out why she’d come down here. Mere coincidence that she was at the only training facility in London that we’d just happened to pick after being ambushed, all after she’d been in New York yesterday with her tongue down Clay’s throat? I stared at him, eyes narrowing. He looked at me over her head and shrugged. “We didn’t get around to talking business.” “Yeah,” I huffed. “I’ll bet.” A thousand emotions swirled inside me, but I could not get conflicted about our relationship-not-a-relationship right now. “So, Richards, fancy meeting you here.” I withdrew my hand from the weapon, but left the safety off. She turned away from Clay and stopped halfway, which pissed me off that I’d let her get between us. “I’m on my way to Germany, stopped in for a little training and a new Beretta. Imagine my surprise when I saw you on the monitors when I checked in.” Surprise, my ass. Killing her inside a registered facility was going to bring my carefully constructed world down on my head. If we got out of here alive. I had no illusions that she was here on government business, or that she hadn’t tailed us since supposedly leaving in a cab. Hell, she’d probably circled the block and watched our every move. I’d been too caught up in my own feelings to spot her. Dammit, I was going to get us killed. But I’d like today to not be that day. I ignored Clay and focused on Clarissa. I hated that name, hated everything about her. She’d deceived me for who knew how long.

Took me a second to figure out that her bullet was frozen at the tip of her gun and it wasn’t just my life flashing before my eyes that had slowed everything down. I spun to find Metatron leaning in the doorway. “Hi,” he said flippantly, like we were crossing paths at a bakery. My mouth opened and closed, Clay hit the ground, sliding sideways on his hip and missing Clarissa’s ankle by a millimeter. “What the—oh, shit!” He scrambled to his feet and stared at Clarissa, frozen in mid-shot, then rushed over, wrapped an arm around my shoulders and tried to haul me toward the door. “We have to go. Thanks, man.” He reached over to pat Metatron’s shoulder, then thought better of it and dropped his arm. I shook my head and pulled Clay to a stop, unconcerned about fleeing now that Metatron had bothered to show up and save our lives. For once. “Where the hell have you been? We’ve almost been killed twice tonight.” Metatron inclined his head and pushed away from the jamb, stepping fully into the room. “Evangeline, Evangeline. I thought I was quite clear about your next step, and yet here you are, too far away from Greece than I’d prefer.” “And let her gun us down there?” I was fuming and could barely form coherent sentences. Every bit of my training vanished in a wave of fury. “You let me get completely blindsided by this. How am I supposed to do my job if you keep leaving out details like her?” I shouted and slammed the butt of my hand into her forehead. She rocked back slowly, like she was stuck in tar, then bobbed back, not a hair out of place. “I’m bound—” “Shut up about that,” I yelled, more frustrated with myself than at him. I’d trusted him to be a thorough member of this team, keeping me apprised of threats before they showed up so I had a chance to prepare. That’s how a good intel team worked, not like his bullshit methods and I was damn tired of it. I needed him pulling his weight or staying the hell out of it. I was done counting on him, and my anger at the situation, him, and myself bubbled over. “I don’t give a crap about your covenants.” He didn’t say anything and I was grateful for the training that had kept us alive tonight. My mom hadn’t been so lucky. Metatron hadn’t given her a fighting chance and if he’d have come to me with this mantle prior to Malcolm’s involvement in my life, I’d been the same sitting duck she had been. But I couldn’t see my mom being a docile little doe once Metatron’s involvement and the relics had put me and my dad in danger. She’d have been downright pissed—and I remembered a few times when she’d been scared straight mad and hadn’t been able to tell me why. I narrowed my eyes. “You and my mother had this exact conversation, didn’t you?” I got right in his face. “Didn’t you?” He nodded. I slapped him. Hard. His skin felt surprisingly human. I trembled with the rage and hurt of what he’d done. What he’d let happen. What he was willing to let happen again because of some deal God had made not to interfere. “Fuck your covenant.” I grabbed my knife from where it hung suspended in the air, six inches from Clarissa’s forehead—a perfect kill shot, but I wasn’t going to leave evidence here, though it lay all over the surveillance tapes. Clay scooped up the guns and our equipment, and we marched from the room and up the stairs without another word. Metatron had better keep her frozen until we were off the property or I was going to do a lot more than slap him the next time I saw him. I didn’t care why he’d come—he’d bought us time and I didn’t want anything else from him tonight. If he had something to tell us, he could damn well find us again. Clay slammed through the shed door and we ran like fleeing murderers to the car. We scrambled inside and Clay finally vented his own frustration. “Not a trap, you said!” He slapped the steering wheel, pushing the Kia as hard as it would go toward the gate. My head spun. We’d be lucky if we got off the facility now. Everything that had gone down before Metatron froze the scene had probably been watched by no less than a dozen agents. They were on their way to intercept us. When we punched out of the forest and onto the main road toward the gate, they’d be waiting for us. “I know. I’m sorry. I thought—” It didn’t matter anymore. And I wasn’t going to bring up the fact that he’d missed seeing her for the trap she was too. Right now, we had to figure out how to get off this property and I doubted that Metatron would help me out more than he already had. Especially after I slapped him and stormed out. I was lucky that he hadn’t already unfrozen her. I glanced back at the shed but Clarissa hadn’t followed. Yet. “How long do we have?” “None. I’m sure we have none. They’d have headed toward the back entrance the moment she came in and shit got ugly, so they’re probably already at the gate, even if Metatron still has everything frozen, they’ll have roadblocks.” I unholstered my weapon and racked the Mossberg. “Keep driving. No matter what’s at the gate, just keep driving.” Clay swore beneath his breath and jammed his foot to the floor, sending the little Kia airborne over the last rise before the gate. I wasn’t prepared for the sight on the other side, stark against the day’s gloaming.",

No one had been on the other side when we’d come up over the rise. “I don’t get it,” I said, scanning the horizon. “You said they’d be here.” “Maybe he bought us another couple minutes.” This was a damn disaster no matter what. There was no undoing what had happened down there, no taking back the flight of my weapon to an agent’s head. No matter when Metatron restarted time, I was on a recorded surveillance tape taking out one of my own contacts. I was still struggling with how I’d been duped. “Shit!” I slammed my fist against the dash. I stared at the window, eyes glazed over as the landscape blurred. “I’ll hand it to Azazel. He is one patient fuck.” “Where to?” I’d screwed us both and put us in a ridiculous amount of danger, trapping us four stories below ground with only one viable exit. I’d foolishly laid all the blame for the men hunting us on his tail, hung it all on his buyer, wasting time researching leads and avenues to tie all this back to a single man who’d really only been a pawn for Azazel. I would not make that mistake again. We had one enemy—Azazel. And the best way to win against him was to get the relics. Nothing else mattered and we’d have to deal with our killers as they came. “Airport. Let’s get to Greece.” “Are you sure?” “Yeah. We need to face what’s there and get this over with.” I sighed and unloaded the weapons, clicking on safeties and making sure that none of them would accidentally fire if shit got out of hand again before the airport. We’d need to take them all to Greece and I wanted to pick up more ammo before we got to the site. I made the necessary calls to ensure that the plane and vehicles would be ready, along with ammo for the weapons we carried, and a few more just in case. I hung up, hoping that Clarissa had been the only compromised contact on my end. I’d changed us to a different, smaller airport that was only twenty minutes from here—no commercial service, only private planes. I had to trust that Azazel would let us get to Greece before attempting to take us out again. Hopefully he was limited to the same slices of time that Metatron was, and wasn’t running a live stream that allowed him to know that we’d just escaped—again. Clay pulled into the airport and we were both strung tight as bows. I grabbed the weapons and he lifted the bag from the backseat, silently closing the back door. His shoulders were tight and his jerky movements belied any surety he was projecting. “What about the car?” I shrugged. “They’ll handle it. Agencies steal half the missing cars out there. I’m not worried about it.” I laid a hand on his forearm and waited for him to look at me. The muscle in his jaw bulged. “I’m sorry.” He shook his head. “Not your fault. I clearly need to do better screening on the girls I…” He cleared his throat. “Anyway, that could have gone worse.” My fingers tightened along with my chest. Much worse. I hated that we owed our lives to Metatron right now. Not that we wouldn’t have taken her out. He’d made a hell of a move and timed it perfectly to take her out the moment my knife connected. Still, I’d have been shot, probably severely. Bad enough that I’d have bled out before the agents above could have saved me. Agent Richards was deadly and a hell of an agent, no matter who she worked for. I was glad Clay had been there, glad he hadn’t hesitated when I needed him. I finally felt like I could count on him to have my back. We were becoming a hell of a team. I tipped my chin, careful not to let us descend back into the feelings we’d damn-near shared. “Leg sweep, huh?” The corner of his mouth twitched. “It’s the only thing that ever surprises you. Figured she might not expect it either.” “It was good,” I said as he linked our fingers together and we walked to the plane. “It was very good.”",

      "content": "Chapter Fifteen We arrived in Greece in the pre-dawn hours and threw the weapons bag in the back of a silver BMW. I drove and Clay pulled up a map to the archeological site. We didn’t have far to go from the airport, and we stayed off the main roads, winding toward the small town on an indirect route. I kept an eye on the rearview mirror, wary of a tail. We were both edgy and our conversation was as minimal in the car as it had been on the plane, both of us deep into work mode. Clay had lost his jovial edge and my senses were alert. A mile from the perimeter of the dig, we scouted the neighboring blocks, making two full circles and working slowly inward. Thankfully, the landscape was flat and open, concealing nothing. The houses were spaced apart, eliminating all but the smallest shadows. Spata was a sleepy town and I relaxed a little. No tail and no unwarranted attention. Traffic was nonexistent, which made spotting a tail easier, but also made it impossible for us to hide. I had to hope that we had a few hours’ head start. “There it is” Clay pointed through the darkness to scaffolding and excavated dirt. I didn't slow as we passed the dig. For all the clean walls of dirt and equipment, it looked like any other archeological site. Chain-link kept curious onlookers at a safe distance, but the gates weren’t secured by anything more than simple locks. The site sat in the middle of the city, which on any other day wouldn't have been a big deal. But right now it was deserted, and walking onto it left us incredibly exposed. On our third rotation, I decided on a squat, three-story parking garage across the street for a stakeout spot. At least they hadn't unearthed the relic yet. Otherwise, we'd have been forced to up our time table. It would happen today, and that made me incredibly uneasy. The last thing I wanted to do was sit here, waiting and watching, because that gave everybody else an opportunity to find us. I'd prefer to storm in right now, grab the relic, and head out. But by now, anyone who wanted this relic knew it was here. Azazal knew I was coming to get it and he’d probably already laid a trap. I wouldn't be surprised if he's corrupted the entire archeological team, found some way to exploit their fears or even their overwhelming need for the glory of the find. I parked on the second-highest level in the center beside three other cars that probably belonged to locals. The Beemer stuck out more than I cared for, and now I wished I would've more specific when I requested wheels. It would have to do. And really … at this point, stealth was impossible. We got out. I loaded two handguns for each of us and pocketed four clips of ammunition, then laid out the Mossberg and our remaining weapons in the trunk along with our extra ammo, in case we needed to grab any of it on the run. Clay's fingers covered mine. \"You look like you're ready for a war.\" \"Yeah. I kind of am.\" Clay took his weapons and holstered them, looking like a professional. I was now completely at ease at having him with me. He was less of a liability now and finally an asset. Shit might have gone very wrong in the basement of the training facility, but we’d come out better off. We walked the edge of the parking structure and I scanned the open area beyond. Buildings pressed on the dig with old-world stone masonry, competing with brand-new steel and glass. Three stories below, the dig opened up into the underbelly of Spata. The hole was fifty feet wide and a hundred feet long, and stretched down twenty. Orange tape fluttered, marking off the boundaries of the dig. Nobody. Nothing. I glanced at my watch. “We have a good hour, maybe two, before anyone shows.” “I'm going down,” Clay said. I shook my head. “No. Let’s watch for a few minutes and let the day unfold.” “We have to make a move.” He leaned back and glanced down to the far corner of the garage at a set of stairs. “Now, before there’s too much foot traffic.” I didn’t like it, but waiting wasn’t helping us. Azazel would not send a single agent again. This time, he’d send an army. One I was not equipped to battle. We’d lost Metatron as an ally—shitty as he was, I kept hoping that he’d call down a heavenly army for us if things got to that point. I’d let my temper get the best of me and now I’d put us on our own. “We have to re-con the area,” Clay said. He was right. We hadn't been able to get a hold of any electronic blueprints because the dig was so new, and the plans we had been able to find for the sewage system showed that it all had be re-routed to maintain the integrity of the site, leaving us no way to access it underground. I hated splitting up, though. I’d gone from being a complete loner to depending on him… This mission had me jacked in more ways than I cared to admit. If we were together, I could take out the threats immediately, but apart, there were too many uncertainties \"I'll be fine,” Clay said, seeming to read my thoughts. “Besides, if one of us needs to cover the other, you know this is the best way to keep us both alive.\" Dammit. I walked back to the car and took out the sniper rifle. From here, handguns were useless and the scope would help me see into the shadows. I loaded and cocked it. \"I still don't feel good about it.” “Give me another choice, I'll take it.\" We didn't have one. And as long as I didn't get overtaken first, I did have the superior positioning to take out anyone on the ground coming after him. I moved over ten feet and set up behind a pillar where I could watch everything down below, as well as the incoming ramp to this level of the garage. \"I want you back up here in six minutes.\" \"What if I find something?\" \"Six minutes. Then we go back down together.\" He clenched his teeth. \"Fine.\" He passed behind me and took the opening stairs leading down to the main level and street. I scanned the building faces—doors, windows, pools of darkness. Quiet was the mood of the morning, but wouldn't be for long. A few blocks away, a dog barked, but nothing stirred below. At the bottom of the stairs, Clay paused before stepping out into the street, looked both ways, and drew his weapon. I smiled. Two days ago that sequence wouldn't have occurred to him, and he'd have walked in cocky and invincible. I hated our close calls, but I didn't mind the added awareness it had brought him. He stepped through the shadows, moving stealthily along the building. He walked the entire perimeter before descending into the lower level. I lost sight of him for too long and held my breath until he moved past the edge of the dig that had concealed him. The layout of this dig was different than what I was used to, since Mom's were always in unimproved dirt areas. Here, they’d had to work around the existing structure of the underground, laying out each level amid pipes and concrete and expensive wiring. Clay moved easily from level to level, pausing at the far end to examine the entrance of one of the blocked-off tunnels. I would have liked to have been inside one, for the concealment and stealthy vantage. Clay aimed his weapon into the yawing hole, shoulders hunching with a heightened anxiety, as if something had moved or made a noise. I was too far away to have picked up on either. Taking a cue from his posture, I sighted in over his head and into the blackness beyond. I had no idea what he'd seen, but if anything moved, I was taking it out. I held my breath and clicked off the safety. He lowered his weapon and backed away, then hurried out of the excavation and back up the stairs. I didn’t take my sights off the dig, just in case. He crossed to me, panting. \"You're not going to believe this.”",

I know,” Clay said, checking our six over his shoulder. “But we're less exposed down here.\" I didn't like that we were being directed against every set of plans we’d had available to us. Had we known this was an option, we’d never have bothered with the parking garage. This entire length of access had been marked as unused, according to every set of blueprints we'd been able to come up with. Clay's recon trip down here had exposed the misinformation, and we’d backtracked the line to a manhole and dropped in, which now had us working our way toward the excavation, coming at it on the opposite side of the parking garage. Water dripped from the ceiling, pinging against the puddles as we moved deeper along the line. Clay had the Mossberg strapped to his back and pockets full of shells, along with two handguns and three knives. I’d left the sniper rifle, but had a dozen knives, my handguns, and enough ammo to take down any reasonable offense. None of that made me feel comfortable about our odds. We hadn’t come down here to ambush anyone, only to stay protected as long as we could. I didn’t have any preconceived notions that this was going to go easy or well, but I liked being down here a lot better than I’d liked the garage with its open sides and impossible numerous entry points. Here we had one exit, one entrance. Easy to protect, easy to leave. Our footsteps splashed in the stagnant water left over from the efforts to drain this once they’d started the excavation. I’d been in my fair share of sewer systems, and a dry one was definitely preferable to a live one, but the fumes still made my eyes water. We walked forward slowly, guns drawn and ready, eyes scanning every shadow. \"First shift should start in thirty minutes,\" Clay said quietly, his words reverberating off the stone walls and ceiling. I nodded, then made us pause fifteen feet from the end, anticipating, ready, alert. Bright sunlight streamed past the nearby buildings, illuminating the entire dig with early-morning light. They probably loved that for working on it, but I loved it for the distinct shadow it cast on the tunnel. The lighting change from bright light to immediate dark kept us in shadow and no one in the pit would have a straight line of sight into this portion of the tunnel, either. We were invisible. Nothing moved, and we pressed forward. Without a good idea of what the excavation team had come up with in the last few days and what they’d planned to tackle today, we didn’t know how today would play out, but I was prepared to sit and wait until nightfall if we had to. We would be here when they found it. College students and archaeologists filtered in over the course of the next half hour. I assessed the threat level of each one, hoping desperately they hadn't all been corrupted. I didn't want to have to kill these kids or their easygoing leader, who’d been cracking jokes since setting foot on the dig. He was dressed in khakis and a worn denim shirt, blond hair sticking out from beneath a John Deere ball cap. His attitude reminded me of Dad, and being on a dig had already reopened wounds about Mom. I didn’t need any emotion creeping in on this, so I spent my time counting windows that might hold possible threats and cataloging the make and model of every car that drove past the dig. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Which made me very nervous. I wanted a glaring discrepancy, something I could pinpoint that would tell us where the threat was today. So far, we were stuck with immature students and a couple of experts who loved their jobs. Conversations filtered to us, but again, nothing that helped me at all. They talked about beer, a new club, and a cute girl who’d moved into the building. My nerves were frayed. We shifted position and traded off shifts, one staying guard over the goings-on in the dig, and one walking back to where we'd entered the system to make sure no one had set off my makeshift trip wires. Other than our nerves, the day stayed quiet. I was crouched in the shade of the opening, out of sight from all the workers, continually scanning the scene before us, looking for anything odd. The level of activity had bored me right out of my brain and Clay was struggling to sit still. “Holy shit!” One of the interns waved the group over. “Matty, come take a look at this.” Clay and I scrambled to our feet, careful to make little noise as we rose. It was mid-afternoon and the waiting had gotten increasingly painful with every hour. I was almost wishing for a shootout just so we could get it over with. The tension was nearly unbearable. With the excavation team occupied, I waved Clay forward, then checked behind us. We were still alone in our stakeout location, but if they’d just found the relic, I could be sure that Azazel was about to put his plan in motion. Warmth spread through my belly and I moved closer to Clay. The entire excavation team peered into a new hole that they’d knocked away in the system. We couldn’t see anything from our vantage and now I wished we’d have stayed high. “Can you feel it?” he whispered. The warmth spread outward, making my fingers tingle. This piece called to me far more than any of the others. Maybe it was the dig, maybe it was a fierce connection to my mother here, but we’d found what we’d come for. Now all we had to do was get it from the dozen people handling it without calling down an army of angels.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen They finally quit oohing and ahhing over it and we got our first look. The instructor, Matty, took the piece to the examination table and most of the students filtered back to their work. A few hung around him, interested in getting a better look at the day’s treasure. The sword wasn’t very big, an oversized knife, really. I wished I had the scope or a pair of field glasses so I could get a clearer look, but they hadn’t pulled up anything else today and that had to be what was pinging me. The blade was badly rusted and looked exactly like you’d think for something that had been in the underbelly of a city for centuries. The hilt had a small hole in it, but I couldn’t tell from here if that was from rust or by design. Strangely, the hole was almost the same size as the ring that had been the first relic. It was a design feature I hadn’t seen before, but I didn’t exactly deal in antique blades. I cared a lot more about the carbonite blades and ones that could take a beating than pretty ones. My life revolved around function over form. Until today. We needed that pretty knife like I’d never needed anything else. Possessing that put us nearly to the finish line. One left. One last piece and we’d be on our way to get Griffin. Matty took his sweet time cleaning and examining the piece. The afternoon air in the dank sewer thickened until I could nearly chew it. Agonizing minutes turned into hours as Matty explained detail after detail about the knife, comparing it to the other bits they’d found and speculating about how it had gotten down here and who it might have belonged to. They didn’t get anywhere close to the truth of its itinerary. “But that’s all fascinating speculation,” Matty said. “We may never know exactly where it’s been.” He chuckled. “For all we know it could have been carried by one of Jesus’s apostles.” His voice carried true and clear to us. Almost like he wanted us to hear. The hair at my nape lifted and I didn’t hesitate, easing deeper into the shadows and drawing Clay back with me. Nothing felt right about this. We needed to come back after they’d left for the day. Now we knew they had the sword—and that my body confirmed it was the sword—our next step was to make sure that we stayed within close range and grabbed it at the first opportunity. Standing at the end of this sewer pipe trapped us and left us without enough exits. Where it had been perfect for surveillance, it left us too few options and I wanted to be back above ground. Now. Clay’s hand found mine in the dark and he squeezed. I didn’t have time to relay everything I was feeling, but the pressure of his fingers let me know that he’d understood and would follow my lead. We moved backward with stealth and I didn’t take my attention off Matty and all his associates and students on the dig, even as they grew smaller and I couldn’t make out one face from another as they moved like black specks against the daylight at the end of the tunnel. In the matter of a few moments, Matty had gone from reminding me of my Dad to being Harrold’s twin in evil. The last thing I wanted to do was turn my back on him. Clay moved beside me, facing the other way as we retreated, guns up and ready. Topside, we moved rapidly to the car and got in. “Move to where we can watch,” I told him, reaching into the backseat and grabbing the sniper rifle. He eased the car out of the parking spot and up to the upper level and against the outside barrier. I removed the scope and got out, wishing again for a smaller set of glasses so I didn’t have to compromise the weapon. “Stay with the car.” “Screw that.” Clay got out and walked with me to the edge. We stayed close to the large beams that protruded from the stairwell so we wouldn’t stand out as the only thing peering over the edge. I lifted the scope and surveyed the dig. Matty still stood by the excavation table and the sword glinted in the afternoon light. That was our baby, all right. He touched it, caressing the hilt and dragging his finger down the blade. One of the students called him over to look at something and he hesitated, like he didn’t want to be away from the treasure for even a moment. “I’m worried that he’s not going to leave it on-site tonight.” “Would you?” Clay scoffed. “No.” A group of students crowded around a stack of personal effects beside the table—backpacks, water bottles, and notebooks. They gathered things as if they were taking off. “Headed to a class?” Clay asked. “Maybe. That would leave Matty and only a few people.” “Better odds.” I wasn’t about to get overconfident about our chances. Matty had been acting strange since they’d found the piece and he still wasn’t more than a dozen feet from it. This was more than just a relic—it had gotten personal for Matty. But it had always been personal for me.",

      "content": "Chapter Seventeen They finally quit oohing and ahhing over it and we got our first look. The instructor, Matty, took the piece to the examination table and most of the students filtered back to their work. A few hung around him, interested in getting a better look at the day’s treasure. The sword wasn’t very big, an oversized knife, really. I wished I had the scope or a pair of field glasses so I could get a clearer look, but they hadn’t pulled up anything else today and that had to be what was pinging me. The blade was badly rusted and looked exactly like you’d think for something that had been in the underbelly of a city for centuries. The hilt had a small hole in it, but I couldn’t tell from here if that was from rust or by design. Strangely, the hole was almost the same size as the ring that had been the first relic. It was a design feature I hadn’t seen before, but I didn’t exactly deal in antique blades. I cared a lot more about the carbonite blades and ones that could take a beating than pretty ones. My life revolved around function over form. Until today. We needed that pretty knife like I’d never needed anything else. Possessing that put us nearly to the finish line. One left. One last piece and we’d be on our way to get Griffin. Matty took his sweet time cleaning and examining the piece. The afternoon air in the dank sewer thickened until I could nearly chew it. Agonizing minutes turned into hours as Matty explained detail after detail about the knife, comparing it to the other bits they’d found and speculating about how it had gotten down here and who it might have belonged to. They didn’t get anywhere close to the truth of its itinerary. “But that’s all fascinating speculation,” Matty said. “We may never know exactly where it’s been.” He chuckled. “For all we know it could have been carried by one of Jesus’s apostles.” His voice carried true and clear to us. Almost like he wanted us to hear. The hair at my nape lifted and I didn’t hesitate, easing deeper into the shadows and drawing Clay back with me. Nothing felt right about this. We needed to come back after they’d left for the day. Now we knew they had the sword—and that my body confirmed it was the sword—our next step was to make sure that we stayed within close range and grabbed it at the first opportunity.

You did it earlier.” “Yeah, with your rifle watching my back.” “You going to stand here and argue with me?” He clenched his teeth. “Fine. If you get shot, it’s your own fault.” “I know. It’s fine.” He snorted and walked around the car and opened the door, but he didn’t get in, spreading his hands across the roof of the car. “Don’t get dead … okay?” I nodded. “Same.” We stared at each other and I didn’t know what else to tell him.

      "content": "Chapter Nineteen I raced down the stairs, weapon drawn and out in front of me, expecting the worst. From my vantage, I watched Matty load the sword and several other boxes into the back of a light blue van, then pause in the center of the dig. I crouched on the final landing before I’d lose my line of sight on him. He stared up in to the night like he was waiting for something—or someone. Every hair on my body tensed and my muscles were locked into fight mode. I didn’t want this to go down with Clay in the car and me out here. I wanted us together, either that or him on his way to Ralph’s to get them to safety. Metatron may have promised Ralph that he and Anna would be safe, but I didn’t trust Metatron to hold up any bargain at this point. I felt the noose tightening around us, and the compulsion to grab them all and hole up somewhere was overwhelming. I couldn’t lose anyone else. My breath came in fast gasps, and I fought to get it under control and act like the goddamn professional who’d been doing this exact thing a hundred times before. Matty turned, looked right at me and blew me a kiss. “He’s coming for you.” The words were a whisper, but they pierced my eardrums with startling clarity. I stood and straightened. “Good. I’m ready.” And I was. “But tell him to stop sending his fucking minions. I deserve a meeting with him, face to face.” A thousand feet separated us, but I could feel the intensity of Matty’s gaze, the tension in his own muscles. If I’d had the sniper rifle on me, I’d have pulled the trigger, sending a bullet through his eye. Useless as it was at this distance, I still raised the handgun and pointed it at him. Matty laughed and got in the van. I raced down the steps, holstered my gun, and dove into the car. “Do not lose him!” Clay floored it, then eased up as we turned the corner and found the van sitting in the exit of the dig, waiting. Matty’s pale face shone brightly in the driver’s-side window. Once he spotted us, he turned onto the street like we were following him to the local park for a playdate. A heavy weight settled in my stomach. “This isn’t good,” Clay said, slowing the car until we followed three car lengths behind. “No.” The back of the van didn’t have any windows, and if it had, I wasn’t sure I’d take the shot I’d been itching for all day. Matty was doing his job as Azazel had commanded and right now we were supposed to be following him. Matty was my ticket to the next step, whatever that was, and I wanted a showdown. And that sword to be in my possession. He drove us through the main part of town to an industrial section that had seen better days. Most buildings had broken windows and boarded-up entrances, and the signs on the ones that did look occupied had burned out long ago. “Getting worse,” Clay said. I fingered the hilt of a knife. “Stay in the open. No matter where he goes, keep an escape route.” “Not my first rodeo.” “Sorry.” God, I was glad he was here. Going back to jobs without him was going to suck and at the same time, I’d gotten to comfortable having someone to rely on. Even having a driver so I could focus on other details was a complete luxury. We passed a fenced yard filled with stacks of steel and a massive crane looming ominously between the building and the open space. Matty pulled through an open gate in the chain link, slowing to make sure we saw him. “Follow?” I leaned forward. “I don’t know. Slow down and let’s check it out first. I don’t want us behind that gate. We could still blast through it if they locked it, but that kind of shit will slow us down and I think anything that will cost us seconds at this point is a bad, bad deal.” “Agree.” Clay moved to the middle of the street and let the car coast to a stop. We were deep in the industrial park and there wasn’t oncoming traffic, so we could sit and wait until Matty made a move. He stopped in front of a trio of large overhead doors, parking in front of the middle one. We still had a clear view of the van and could see every door. “Wait.” “Are we following if he goes in?” Clay rested his hands on the top of the steering wheel and I pulled my handgun from the holster in case they were counting on us being so occupied with Matty that we got ambushed from the back. “I don’t know, but keep an eye on your mirrors—” He cut me a look and I ignored him. How the hell did I know what he’d done for recon and stakeouts for his jobs? I’d rather boss him around and risk making him mad than assume he knew what we were supposed to be doing. We waited long enough that my legs cramped. I fidgeted and scowled at the van. “We didn’t miss it, did we?” “He hasn’t gotten out. No way.” “What the hell is he doing?” “Waiting, I guess. It’s strange. Is he waiting for us to come over?” “I don’t care.” I checked my mirror and scanned the scenery beyond us. Nothing moved, nothing watched. For now, the three of us were the only people around. “We’re sitting ducks out here.” “Worse if we go in blind.” He ran his hands across the steering wheel. “I hate waiting.” My fingers curled around the door handle. I did too. “If we use the stacked steel as shields, we can make it around that side of the building and case it while staying out of view of the van.” “Then what?” I sighed. “We go in.” “You sure?” He shifted in his seat and looked at me. I nodded. “We go together and not until we’ve cased the entire building. If there isn’t another entrance, we come back to the car. We’re sure not walking in through the front.” “Agree.” He glanced at all the mirrors and stiffened. “Uh, Lina…”",

      "content": "Chapter Twenty Blinding light filled the interior of the car and I opened my door slowly and got out, facing the oncoming army behind us, illuminated by a brilliant halo of light. Clay followed my lead, climbing out the driver’s-side door and standing beside the car. I blinked and my fingers curled instinctively around my weapons at my hips. “What in the fuck?” Clay murmured. He could say that again. A thousand angels walked toward us—there was no mistaking their identities as they marched behind Metatron. His wings were in full glamour, protruding four feet above his head and furling out behind him. Angels flanked him on both sides, extending back hundreds of feet. They were alarmingly beautiful, dressed in full-battle gear with armor and weapons. All thoughts of avoiding a holy war vanished. If anything was frozen, we couldn’t tell, but maybe that was why Matty hadn’t moved from the van. Metatron stopped five feet from me and I shielded my eyes, squinting and blinking agains the shining light of his army. “Evangeline.” I nodded, unsure how to react. Had he come to help or take me out? Didn’t imagine a lot of people got away with smacking an archangel. “So, uh, who’s your crew?” Clay asked, jutting his chin toward the angels. “I gave thought to your issues, Evangeline and I brought them before Himself.” I coughed. “Sorry?” “Your points were valid and losing your mother cost us dearly.” He held up a hand to halt my comment and I snapped my mouth shut. “As it did for you. I now see that.” He inclined his head. “And apologize.” I blinked, shocked. Absolutely shocked. “Uh, thanks.” “After I discussed matters of the covenant with Himself, he thought perhaps I should offer you the assistance of the heavenly army. If you want, of course.” Was he serious? Of course I wanted a damn army behind me. But that came at a cost that bothered me too. “How bad is this going to get?” “He did not allow me to break every rule. I cannot foretell the future, Evangeline. I do hope you’ll understand the why of that. There is still enough uncertainty that I hope to be wrong in what I’ve seen predicted for this night.” “Yeah,” Clay said with a laugh. “Us too.” He stepped closer and examined the front row of angels. Their golden armor shone with a brilliance of a thousand candles, and the tips of their spears and swords looked like they’d been sharpened beyond the capacity of earthly tools. I wanted one. Beautiful faces looked out from beneath helmets, and held traits of both males and females. Strong jaws matched with full lips and strong cheekbones. This could have been a fierce fighting army of women as much as men. “I must take my leave of the events,” Metatron said, pulling my attention away from the angels. “But I leave you the army. They’ve been instructed to follow your every command. But choose wisely, Evangeline. Mankind will not survive another war of angels. Whatever you call down tonight will stand in time as your own decision. Himself and I have washed our hands of what comes next. This is still your journey, we’ve just chosen to arm you with something more … suitable.” I laughed. “You have no idea how to play fair, do you?” “Life is not fair, darling. I merely hope to tip the odds in your favor. Before I go, you must go get the sword and bring it to me.” I tensed and glanced at the building. We didn’t know what was waiting for us in there. “With or without them?” I pointed at the glowing warriors readied for battle. “Without. You’ll not find resistance yet.” “Then why do we need the army?” Clay asked, stepping closer and examining a spear held in a massive hand of an angel. “They’re coming for you.” That’s what Matty had said too. It didn’t sound any better coming from Metatron. “And you’re leaving us the moment you have the sword?” A chill raced up my spine. Harrold had warned me about this. Was now when Metatron double-crossed me? “Only for safekeeping. When you finish here, I’ll be waiting for you at Ralph’s. We still have one more relic, Evangeline.”",

He could say that again. A thousand angels walked toward us—there was no mistaking their identities as they marched behind Metatron. His wings were in full glamour, protruding four feet above his head and furling out behind him. Angels flanked him on both sides, extending back hundreds of feet. They were alarmingly beautiful, dressed in full-battle gear with armor and weapons. All thoughts of avoiding a holy war vanished. If anything was frozen, we couldn’t tell, but maybe that was why Matty hadn’t moved from the van. Metatron stopped five feet from me and I shielded my eyes, squinting and blinking agains the shining light of his army. “Evangeline.” I nodded, unsure how to react. Had he come to help or take me out? Didn’t imagine a lot of people got away with smacking an archangel. “So, uh, who’s your crew?” Clay asked, jutting his chin toward the angels. “I gave thought to your issues, Evangeline and I brought them before Himself.” I coughed. “Sorry?” “Your points were valid and losing your mother cost us dearly.” He held up a hand to halt my comment and I snapped my mouth shut. “As it did for you. I now see that.” He inclined his head. “And apologize.” I blinked, shocked. Absolutely shocked. “Uh, thanks.” “After I discussed matters of the covenant with Himself, he thought perhaps I should offer you the assistance of the heavenly army. If you want, of course.” Was he serious? Of course I wanted a damn army behind me. But that came at a cost that bothered me too. “How bad is this going to get?” “He did not allow me to break every rule. I cannot foretell the future, Evangeline. I do hope you’ll understand the why of that. There is still enough uncertainty that I hope to be wrong in what I’ve seen predicted for this night.” “Yeah,” Clay said with a laugh. “Us too.” He stepped closer and examined the front row of angels. Their golden armor shone with a brilliance of a thousand candles, and the tips of their spears and swords looked like they’d been sharpened beyond the capacity of earthly tools. I wanted one. Beautiful faces looked out from beneath helmets, and held traits of both males and females. Strong jaws matched with full lips and strong cheekbones. This could have been a fierce fighting army of women as much as men. “I must take my leave of the events,” Metatron said, pulling my attention away from the angels. “But I leave you the army. They’ve been instructed to follow your every command. But choose wisely, Evangeline. Mankind will not survive another war of angels. Whatever you call down tonight will stand in time as your own decision. Himself and I have washed our hands of what comes next. This is still your journey, we’ve just chosen to arm you with something more … suitable.” I laughed. “You have no idea how to play fair, do you?” “Life is not fair, darling. I merely hope to tip the odds in your favor. Before I go, you must go get the sword and bring it to me.” I tensed and glanced at the building. We didn’t know what was waiting for us in there. “With or without them?” I pointed at the glowing warriors readied for battle. “Without. You’ll not find resistance yet.” “Then why do we need the army?” Clay asked, stepping closer and examining a spear held in a massive hand of an angel. “They’re coming for you.” That’s what Matty had said too. It didn’t sound any better coming from Metatron. “And you’re leaving us the moment you have the sword?” A chill raced up my spine. Harrold had warned me about this. Was now when Metatron double-crossed me? “Only for safekeeping. When you finish here, I’ll be waiting for you at Ralph’s. We still have one more relic, Evangeline.”",

I shook my head. Clay moved carefully toward the back of the van and I took a few steps back so I could cover him. He reached slowly toward the handle. Metatron had said we wouldn’t find resistance, but Matty hadn’t gotten out. He had to be in the van. I nodded sharply and Clay yanked the door open. It was empty. Save the sword, lying on a work table, softly glowing. “Wow,” Clay said. I agreed and walked closer, holstering my gun and stopping at his side. I didn’t know how he’d done it, but Matty had managed to escape without our notice. The thought sent a freakish chill along my skin. I leaned closer. It hadn’t looked like this when Matty had found it and now I wanted to examine it, and study the intricate carvings and delicate jewel-crusted hilt. Clay’s fingers wrapped around the back of my neck. “Later, babe. Get it and let’s get the hell out of here.” “Sorry.” I pulled myself out of my trance and grabbed the sword. It tingled against my palm and I holstered all my other knives so I could hold it with both hands. “I’m following you.” Metatron waited in front of his army, arms crossed. I stopped a few feet short of him and dropped the sword to my side. I had something to say before I handed over this bit of sacred history that I needed to save Griffin. “You’ve got some making up to do. You’ve put us in danger too many times and I’m done with it. Nothing—nothing—stands between me and what I want. You called down this holy war when you brought your army into it and I can only assume that since they’re coming for me that they’ll be bringing a legion of their own, and now we’re in for a hell of a fight. Azazel’s going to be upset that you helped me.” I narrowed my eyes. “Pretty sure your boss isn’t going to be pleased about it either.” He sniffed but didn’t comment. “Be at Ralph’s.” I took a step forward and handed him the sword, my fingers tightening before I let go. I hoped I was making the right choice. “You have a lot of explaining to do and I’m not waiting weeks to go after the last relic.” He inclined his head in agreement, then glanced at Clay. “Keep her safe.” Clay laughed heartily. “Yeah, right.” His hand found the small of my back. “Come on.” Metatron vanished and I walked over to Clay. Now that we had two of the three relics, I wasn’t slowing down for even a second in our pursuit of the last and final piece I needed to open the gate to Hell and save Griffin. He'd damn well better be at Ralph's. The angels’ attention was riveted on me. “Well, boys, shit’s about to get real. Stay close, stay alert.” They nodded and snapped to formation. It was a heady feeling, but one that I didn’t expect to last long. I looked at Clay and held out my palm. “Let’s do this.” He grinned and slapped my hand with his. “Hell yeah.”",

Not if the other side had ones that looked like the army following us, but being armed made me feel better. Clay racked the shotgun and threw his shoulders back. I stared at him and swallowed. “You don’t have to do this.” I didn’t want to lose him. I couldn’t, not after Griffin. We were walking into a battle and I wasn’t stupid enough to think that we’d survive. Azazel wasn’t the kind of guy to let bygones be bygones. I had too many of the weapons he wanted and he had the one I needed. He took a step closer. “You really think I’d do that? Bail on you now?” “No. But I was hoping I could talk you into it.” He slid his hand behind my head. “Sorry. You can’t get rid of me that easy.” I laughed nervously. “If this won’t shake you, I guess I’m stuck with you.” “Guess so.” He pulled me against him and kissed me hard, then let me go. “Now let’s go get that sword.” We marched through the gate and stopped ten feet from the back of the van. I tipped my chin up and yelled, “You’ve kept me waiting long enough!” “Evangeline.” Harrold’s voice cut through the night and he appeared from the corner of the building, then walked toward the van, stopping beside it. “We meet again.” “I said no minions.” I was done screwing around and I’d meant what I’d told Matty. We were through with the games. He laughed. “You know that’s impossible. Azazel would not need what he’s seeking if he were free to meet with you.” I crossed my arms. “I’ll wait.” Silence stretched across the night. I wasn’t about to change my position. The next move was his. “Remember two things,” Harrold said quietly. “You asked for this. And we gave you the opportunity to work for the right team.” I didn’t bother to respond. “Suit yourself.” He turned to the van and pushed it as if it were a child’s toy, sending it skidding sideways past the last door. It rocked up on the far wheels, then crashed down with a shudder. I returned my attention to him, hiding the fear and surge of adrenaline racing through my body. Matty still didn’t emerge and I had no idea where he’d gone or where the sword was. Clay stepped closer to me. Harrold turned to face us and lifted his arms, palms up, then raised them in a sweeping, controlled motion. All three doors rolled up, revealing a black-clad army, the sinister mirror image of the one behind me. Flat black armor, shielded faces, unearthly sharp weapons. Now I understood Metatron’s warning with crystal clarity. If these two armies clashed, nothing would remain. The army marched forward in perfect uniformity, stopping behind him. “As I told you, Azazel couldn’t make our little tête-à-tête tonight, but he sent someone.” “I said no minions,” I repeated myself. The men Azazel had corrupted couldn’t speak for him, couldn’t truly act on his behalf. They could do despicable things, but that wasn’t what I wanted. I wanted someone who held the power to give me Griffin’s soul, or at least the sword. I wanted a way to prevent the holy war, but I wasn’t willing to sacrifice Griffin’s eternity. The dark angel stepped forward and removed his helmet. Silken black hair spilled down his shoulders and he looked straight through me with startling green eyes. My jaw dropped at the unmatched beauty of his face. I blinked and inhaled deeply. He pushed his hair back and I narrowed my eyes to study the incongruence, glancing again at the hand to figure out what had caught my attention. He saw my glance and held his hand out to me, opening the palm, twisting it, then closing the gnarled, disfigured vestige. I quickly studied the rest of the army, noting their similarities, both in beauty and disfigurement. Each one had model-worthy faces, but they were like models who’d been in horrific car wrecks on their way to a photo shoot and then horribly put back together. Most had gnarled arms, fingers, limbs. It was a brilliant distortion of our earthly ideas of beauty. I yanked my attention back to the one beside Harrold. “Evangeline,” Harrold said with a wicked smile. “I’d like to introduce Lucifer.”",

Azazel wouldn’t have sent his partner if they didn’t believe that we had a chance of succeeding. If they thought we were going to fail, they’d have waited patiently for it to happen, then they’d have collected the relics, and continued on with their disturbed mission. For them, as for me, the stakes were incredibly high. Azazel was worried. I smiled. He should be, because he was going to lose. “He’s truly imprisoned, Evangeline,” Lucifer said, his velvet voice a match for his perfectly curved lips. “But Azazel did agree that you deserved the respect of a face-to-face meeting.” He bowed. “I do hope I’ll suffice in his stead.” “Sure. Give me what I want.” He smiled and I got caught up in the striking beauty of it, like when a billboard catches my eye and I’m forced to appreciate a work of art. “We’re evenly matched,” he said. “You have one weapon, I have one. We both want the third.” Holy shit. He didn’t know that I’d just given the sword to Metatron. I managed to hide my shock and clenched my fists. We still had work to do here and I wanted him to know that he couldn’t bully me. “I don’t make deals.” “Yes, I thought you might say that.” “Then what’s your counter-offer?” He grinned. “You’re a brilliant girl, truly a worthy adversary.” He said it with a sense of wonderment, as if he’d not expected me. I doubted that would afford me any allowances, but it infused my confidence another notch. “The trouble is, you don’t understand this game you’ve been playing.” “This isn’t a game to me.” It was deadly serious. One I was willing to die for, one that Griffin had already given all that he could. It pissed me right off that he would dismiss it so flippantly. This probably was nothing more than a stupid weekend playoff game to them. What did they care if their wars wiped us out? That was what they wanted anyway, to go back to the beginning when they were responsible for populating the earth with their own giant offspring. The sooner the game started, the sooner they could get back to life the way they wanted it. “It is a game, Lina. A God game. If you don’t understand that, then who are you to play at this level? We”—he tapped three long gnarled fingers to his chest, then spread his arms to encompass the mass of demons standing behind him—“we have played this game with Himself for millennia. But this time, we have nothing to lose. What about you?” I refused to feel the fear he wanted to instill in me. “If that’s your best threat, it’s weak.” I took a step forward. “See, you think that having nothing to lose is what makes you the best player, because you’ve truly never had anything worth losing. You may think that your power, your freedom … that those things are worth losing, but you don’t have a clue. I’ve known your power, the heady rush of being on top of the world, knowing that I’ve conquered every fear, every evil, every challenge, but that’s nothing—nothing compared to the rush that comes from being loved—loved by a soul mate.” I laughed and looked him straight in his beautiful face, then met the gazes of the other demons. “Soul mates require a soul. An essence of goodness, of rightness. You’ve missed out on that and let me tell you, that’s a tragedy. Maybe having loved ones gives me liabilities, makes me vulnerable, because now I have so, so much to lose, but you’re wrong. So very wrong.” He sniffed and the demons let out a low laugh. I continued, embracing the truth of what I’d just realized. “Well, I’m here to tell you that it’s the soldier who has everything to lose that will expend it all on the battle field to save her loved ones.” I stood up straighter, feeling the weight and power of the angels behind me, as well as the physical force of the love extended by my most precious people—both living and dead. I so did not want to start another holy war. And I wasn’t sure he did either. They’d lost massively the last time, and we still had a relic to find, one Azazel desperately needed. One we both needed with a fierce desperation. “I’ve come for one thing. Give me Griffin’s soul and we can both walk away to fight another day.” He laughed, and it was the deep bass of a thousand church bells. Lucifer looked at me as if seeing me for the first time. “You’re something else, Evangeline. Our common Father knows the greatness in you. It’s why he afforded you the angels who stand behind you. But what’s different, what sets you apart from all the others, is that you see your own greatness. Few do, and it seems a shame to waste a treasure such as you.” He chuckled again. “I’ll let you in on a little secret, women like you—the ones who know their worth—they’re incorruptible. I can’t touch them. Can’t even get close. But”—he brushed his fingernails across his chest and examined them—“enamored as I am with you, I reject your terms.” I raised my arm and felt the army behind me tense. My fingers tightened on the hilt of my blade and I smiled, mocking him with his own comment. “Suit yourself.”",

I’ve known your power, the heady rush of being on top of the world, knowing that I’ve conquered every fear, every evil, every challenge, but that’s nothing—nothing compared to the rush that comes from being loved—loved by a soul mate.” I laughed and looked him straight in his beautiful face, then met the gazes of the other demons. “Soul mates require a soul. An essence of goodness, of rightness. You’ve missed out on that and let me tell you, that’s a tragedy. Maybe having loved ones gives me liabilities, makes me vulnerable, because now I have so, so much to lose, but you’re wrong. So very wrong.” He sniffed and the demons let out a low laugh. I continued, embracing the truth of what I’d just realized. “Well, I’m here to tell you that it’s the soldier who has everything to lose that will expend it all on the battle field to save her loved ones.” I stood up straighter, feeling the weight and power of the angels behind me, as well as the physical force of the love extended by my most precious people—both living and dead. I so did not want to start another holy war. And I wasn’t sure he did either. They’d lost massively the last time, and we still had a relic to find, one Azazel desperately needed. One we both needed with a fierce desperation. “I’ve come for one thing. Give me Griffin’s soul and we can both walk away to fight another day.” He laughed, and it was the deep bass of a thousand church bells. Lucifer looked at me as if seeing me for the first time. “You’re something else, Evangeline. Our common Father knows the greatness in you. It’s why he afforded you the angels who stand behind you. But what’s different, what sets you apart from all the others, is that you see your own greatness. Few do, and it seems a shame to waste a treasure such as you.” He chuckled again. “I’ll let you in on a little secret, women like you—the ones who know their worth—they’re incorruptible. I can’t touch them. Can’t even get close. But”—he brushed his fingernails across his chest and examined them—“enamored as I am with you, I reject your terms.” I raised my arm and felt the army behind me tense. My fingers tightened on the hilt of my blade and I smiled, mocking him with his own comment. “Suit yourself.”",

      "content": "Extras Also available: The Dead Celeb An Evie Preston/Grey Tier Book 1 by Michele Scott (AKA—A.K. Alexander) (read on for a sample) Chapter One MY NAME IS EVIE PRESTON and I hang out with dead rock stars. Oh, and the occasional dead movie star or two. I’ve learned quite a bit about those who live on the other side over the past few months. For instance, they aren’t all ghostly and transparent. Oh no. The ones I see are almost always in full- color and 3-D except when they exert, ah...certain energies. Then they go a bit hazy. Oh, and they prefer to be called spirits. Yeah, I know...I sound completely insane. Like, “commit me” insane. But honestly, I am not crazy. Believe me, the first time I saw Bob Marley in my place (well, technically not my place, but I’ll get to that) in the Hollywood Hills, getting high and singing “Buffalo Soldier,” I thought I was either dreaming, hallucinating, or, yes, completely nuts. Thankfully, it was none of the above. In fact, Bob is a very real, very dead guy who likes to hang out with me, along with a handful of other deceased, famous rock musicians (and a few who never quite made the charts, one of whom I’ve recently developed feelings for—more about him later). So, not only do I hang out with dead rock stars, I also think I am in love with one, or at least in lust… which makes me totally screwed up. But I am not crazy. I swear. Before I go any further, though, I need to take you back a few months to the day after my twenty-eighth birthday. Welcome to Brady, Texas—population 5,500—and, according to the sign on the main road into town, “The Heart of Texas.” Truth be told, the signs were everywhere. Signs, that is, telling me to get the hell out of Brady. I was at Mrs. Betty LaRue’s place. Her house smelled of Tide, home cooking, and mothballs. Betty was comforting me over the dismal turnout of my Mary Kay presentation—my latest attempt at becoming an entrepreneur—which she’d kindly hosted. We were drinking apple-cranberry tea, with her Lhasa Apso, Princess, curled in a ball under Betty’s chair, and my dog (of indeterminate breed...possibly part-coyote and part-lab, with a dash of border collie in there), Mama Cass, across my feet. I loved how Betty always let me bring Cass in the house. My dog went everywhere with me, but not everyone was as gracious about her presence as Betty. “I really thought this would go much better,” I said, bringing the warm cup of tea to my lips. Betty smiled sympathetically, the fine lines in her eighty- something face creasing deeper into her skin, “Oh, honey, I don’t know what happened to my girls today. I am so sorry. I thought there’d be at least ten of us. They all love my snickerdoodles. But you know how some of us old gals are; we forget things.” She twirled a yellow-white wisp of curled hair around her finger. The rest of it was pulled up into a loose bun (or chignon as Mama calls it). She’d obviously been in to see my mother that morning for her weekly hair appointment. I nodded. “It’s okay, Betty. Thanks for hosting anyway, and the cookies were delicious. Three isn’t such a bad turnout.” Thing was, only Betty bought anything. Her friends, Margaret and Hazel, came for the cookies and samples. “And I made about ten dollars, so that will buy me a couple of meals. You’ll love that anti-wrinkle cream, by the way.” Betty ran a hand over her face and laughed sweetly. “Child, ain’t nothing gonna work on this face now. And I’m proud of these lines. I earned them.” I laughed back. “So you only bought the cream because you felt sorry for me?” Cass’s ears perked up and she lifted her head to peer at me. Betty sighed. “Evie Preston, I have known you since you started kicking up a fuss in your mama’s belly.” She winked at me. “I’ve watched you try so hard to be exactly what your mama and daddy wanted, especially after all that bad business. And there was that unfortunate situation with—” She paused. “What was his name?” She brought her cup to her lips, her hand shaking ever so slightly. I sighed, knowing exactly what bad business she was referring to. As for the unfortunate situation, he was the star quarterback my senior year and the lucky recipient of my virginity. Sadly, he was also the jerk who then decided to share the news with the entire town. Thank God my mother was able to intercept that little tidbit before it reached my father’s ears. Betty waved her free hand in the air as if to brush the painful thoughts away. “I know you were hoping to be a good Texas girl and marry a good Texas boy and have babies and run a family like your folks did, not because you really wanted it,” she said, shaking a finger at me. “But because your parents wanted it for you. And now, my dear,” Betty leaned over and gave me one of her rare, stern looks. “It’s high time you stopped pretending and started living!” “What do you mean?” “You got a God-given talent. You need to get out there and do something with it.” She tried to set the tea cup down on the side table and almost missed. I grabbed it and set it down for her. Betty beamed at me. “Thank you, honey! Always so polite.” I looked down at my dog, licking the unpolished toes peeking out of the only pair of high-heeled sandals I owned. “Fact is, Betty, I know I’m good, but there are a lot of good musicians out there.” I dejectedly twirled the ends of my long, baby-fine hair. Mama always said God hadn’t been paying close attention when it came time to give me hair. It was stick straight, dark brown, and silky. I couldn’t do a darn thing with it, except put it into ponytails. Betty waved her hand again. “Nonsense!” Placing her hands on the sides of her chair, she slowly pushed herself up to a stand and ambled over to the white brick mantle. She grabbed an envelope and handed it to me. “What’s this?” I asked. “Your birthday was yesterday, wasn’t it?” “You remembered?” She frowned. “I may be old, Evie, but I don’t forget birthdays. Especially when they’re for people I care about.” “That is so sweet of you.” I was flattered and grateful someone seemed happy to have me around. “Oh honey, you know you’re one of my favorite people. You got spunk! Had it since you came out ass-backward, showing the world what you thought of it.” “Thank you, I think.” I couldn’t help smiling. Betty was the only one I knew who spoke the truth without holding back. She didn’t tiptoe around stuff like my family. Tiptoeing was what we did best. “Open it! I don’t have all day. It’s about time for my nap.” I tore open the envelope and found a check inside for five thousand dollars, made out to me. I gasped. “Betty! What...” Cass jumped up, her huge ears pricked forward, tail wagging, watching me like a hawk. “It’s okay, girl.” She lay back down but still alert. “I was twenty-eight once too, you know, and I had dreams...big dreams.” Betty’s blue eyes glazed over for a moment. “I wanted to be a movie star, and I could have, too. I was damn good, like you are at what you do, and, believe it or not, I used to be good looking.” She winked at me again, but there were tears in her eyes. I knew about Betty’s dreams from long ago. I also knew there was a part of her life that hadn’t been so good. “But then my folks, like yours, had other ideas and I decided to play by their rules. I don’t regret it...well, maybe I do a little. Thing is, young lady, you can sing like a nightingale and you can play the guitar like nobody’s business. You need to get the hell out of this town before you wind up like every other girl here—knocked up, changing dirty diapers, and cleaning up after some idiot male who spends his nights with a beer in one hand and a TV remote in the other.” I frowned. I’d already seen almost every girl from my high school graduating class living the life Betty had just described. The lucky ones skipped town and went to college. I hadn’t been quite that lucky for a variety of reasons. I had the grades and the desire, but life had other ideas. On the positive side, which is where I like to go, I’d at least not had the misfortune of marrying some guy who didn’t appreciate me, expected his dinner on the table when he got home from his shift at Walmart, and wanted his wife and children to obey, just because he said so. “Betty, I really do appreciate your vote of confidence but still, I can’t accept this.” I held the check towards her. “Yes, you can, and you will. Go live your life, Evie Preston. Pack up that van of yours, your guitar, and Mama Cass, and head west. You sing your heart out in every bar, every café, every church—I don’t care where you go, but go and sing. I know one thing: you have what it takes to be a star. Forget all about them cosmetics you’re trying to pawn . . .” “Mary Kay,” I interrupted. “It is a really good line. Mama swears by it.” She frowned and waved that hand at me. “Just forget all that, because you and I both know it won’t get you nowhere. That kind of thing is for people like Shirley Swan up the road trying to make an extra buck to take care of those four kids of hers. Take the money, cut your losses, and run. You gotta stop living for your mama and daddy. You didn’t cause what happened and you can’t never change it.” She shook her head vehemently. “Go on and live life. Do it for me. Humor an old woman, please?” Her blue eyes watered, the creases crinkling as she choked back emotion. How could I refuse after a plea like that? I tried one last time, for the sake of courtesy. “But my daddy—” Betty dabbed at her eyes with a kerchief. “He’ll get over it. And your mama is gonna secretly be cheering you on. It’ll be hard on them, but this’ll be the best thing for all of you.” She sighed heavily. “Especially you, Evie. Trust me.” So I did. I trusted Betty LaRue. The next day I packed up my 1974 VW bus, a suitcase of clothes, my Rosewood Gibson acoustic guitar, and Mama Cass. I pulled out of my parents’ driveway while Daddy waved his arms wildly in the air, yelling, “You’re gonna ruin your life out there, Evangeline!” (He’s the only one who ever calls me by my full name.) “Los Angeles isn’t the city of angels. It’s a city of heathens and devils!” I knew he was just scared. I’m pretty sure if I looked closer, I’d see tears in his eyes. But Betty was right. This was something I had to do. I could see tears for sure in my mother’s big hazel eyes, the same color as my own, as she mouthed, “I love you.” I rolled down the window, choking back my own sobs. “I love you, too! I’ll call. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.” With blurred eyes, Mama Cass’s head in my lap, a Patsy Cline cassette in the tape deck (thank God for eBay—you have no idea how hard it is to find cassette tapes these days), I headed west to the City of Angels. For the first time in sixteen years, I felt like I could finally breathe again. I was leaving behind the only two people I knew who I had never been able to heal even a little bit, and I didn’t think I ever could. Chapter Two I AM NOT A REBEL by nature. Or who knows...maybe I am. Regardless, it’s never really been an option for me. Not after what my parents went through. I could never yell, lie, sneak out of the house, or talk back. None of that. And those weren’t their rules; they were my own. So leaving my mother and father behind on that late April afternoon was by far the most rebellious thing I had ever done in my twenty-eight years, and honestly, it left me feeling cold. Poor Cass with her thick coat must have hated me on that fifteen hundred mile trip, because I was freezing the whole way and cranked up the heater in my van, even as we drove through Arizona’s hot, desert climate. It was the kind of cold you can feel on the inside—that only a real hot bath combined with a hot drink and a tuck between the covers can cure. I wasn’t sick. No sore throat. No aching body. Nothing like that. I was just cold. And then, after three days of driving and staying in cheap motels, I took the 10 West all the way to L.A., and the chill left as suddenly and mysteriously as it had arrived. The first thing I did was head to the ocean—Venice Beach to be exact. Yes, Los Angeles has plenty of tan, beautiful people and then some, but let me just say for the record, there are also a ton of freaks here, especially in Venice Beach. I saw one guy with hair the color of mashed peas that hung down to his rear in twisted, greasy ropes. He wasn’t wearing a shirt and the waistband of his shorts sat well beneath his boxers. Not an attractive look, especially considering the live iguana wrapped around his neck. Never seen that before. Cass went totally berserk, yapping at him and the lizard. I had to yank pretty hard on her leash to get her to move while the guy snarled, “Get your mangy piece of shit mutt outta my face, dude!” Um, excuse me? At least my dog takes regular baths, which is certainly more than I could say about Mr. Mange and his lizard sidekick. I decided to keep my mouth shut and move along, tugging on Cass the entire way. I made an effort to give him as wide a berth as possible, not wanting to accidentally brush against him and deal with the onslaught of negative emotions that would happen as a result. Okay. I guess it’s probably time I let this particular cat out of the bag. See the thing is, when I turned twelve, my parents and I went through some tough times. And ever since, I’ve been able to get information about people through touch. But not just any information—traumatic, painful information. Caught your husband of thirty years sleeping with your best friend? Lost your mom in a car accident when you were a teen? Well, if you and I have come into contact before, chances are, I already know all about it. But that’s not all. I can also help ease the pain...give people a permanent Band-Aid to slap on that painful memory. I can’t make the pain disappear, but I sure can help you to cope with it, minus years of therapy or self-medication. Sounds great, right? Well, have you ever paid attention to just how many times a day you touch someone? At the supermarket, at the salon, at a restaurant...it happens all the time, and you’re mostly not aware of it at all. I’ve had to train myself to be extra focused on where I am and who’s around me in order to cope. Truth be told, I’m pretty cautious who I touch these days, and I also make a conscious effort to put some kind of barrier in place (gloves, mittens, napkins, whatever’s handy) if I know there’s a chance my hands might brush up against another person, because it is my hands that tend to be the main conductor of this gift. If my hands touch someone else, particularly their hands, that is when I get the clearest visions. I’d receive some information if someone were to bump against me, but the touching of hands is what I am most aware of. Betty LaRue was one of the first people I “read.” It happened at Easter, sixteen years ago, when I took her hand to show her the new kitten Mama brought home for me (another gift meant to help me deal with our recent loss). All I got were glimpses—of a much younger Betty and the baby she lost when she was only seventeen, courtesy of a pregnancy caused by a boyfriend who didn’t take no for an answer one night—and they scared the hell out of me. In any case, touching people like Cranky Dreadlock Man was simply not an option for me. No telling what sorts of nasty images I’d pick up from him. Once we got past him, we reached the ocean. Color—silvery blue. Smell—fresh and salty—minus the cigarette smoke and sickly sweet scent of tanning oil that occasionally wafted its way toward us. The crashing waves and sandy beach were like something from a postcard. Cass and I people-watched for some time. Cheapest entertainment in the world. Bring a lawn chair, a bag of Tostitos, and a six-pack of soda, and you’ll find the movies have nothing on Venice Beach. When I need to get away from anyone famous—dead or alive—I head there. And I figure, the best way to beat crazy is to go and see even more crazy. Cass and I shared a couple slices of pizza and a Coke (yes, Cass drinks Coke, too, but none of that diet stuff), and I decided we needed to find a place to stay for the night. And then I needed to find a job. I knew five thousand dollars was probably not going to get us very far in the land of glitz and glamour. I found a motel a few blocks from the beach. It was fifty-five bucks for the night, which seemed like a lot. But we were tired, and I thought being close to the ocean might be cool, because I could take Cass for a walk in the morning. Problem was, they had a “no pets” policy. “You gotta stay in the bus, girl,” I told her. She thumped her tail slightly and looked at me with her big, dark eyes. I whispered in her ear, “Only for a little bit. Soon as the coast is clear, I’ll come get you.” She thumped her tail even harder. I may sound a bit biased here, but Cass is the smartest dog ever. “You be a good girl, and I’ll be back.” And I was, after a shower and a change of clothes. I snuck my half-coyote, half-lab, possibly some border collie pooch into the dingy motel room that smelled of stale cigarettes, bug spray, and mildew. She jumped on the bed with me and we fell fast asleep. The Dead Celeb is available at: Amazon Kindle and Amazon UK Paperback * Audio Book Also available: Shadow Boxer Alterations, Book 2 By Jen Greyson (read on for a sample) Chapter One Based on the last two, I’m getting an increasingly bad taste for Tuesdays. “Damn.” I grind my teeth as the needle stitches color onto my right shoulder blade. Brin rakes a paper towel across the bloody area and slathers Vaseline over my new tattoo. “Wanna see?” I press my shirt over my boobs and hop off the chair. The ache in my back radiates through my entire arm, but I peer over my shoulder at my reflection and his impromptu handiwork. High on my right shoulder blade, he’s painted a vibrant orange-yellow sun with a crescent moon piercing the bottom, and eight long strands of lightning radiating outward in feathery bolts. Day blurs into night and back again, held together by nothing more than lightning. A perfect illustration of time’s chaotic movement for me. I gingerly pull my shirt on. “Nice.” One-word answers are enough here. I’m not capable of much else. “Eighty bucks work?” I dig in my front pocket for a crumpled hundred. My waistband slides over my hip and I grimace at how much weight I’ve lost. I don’t like being this skinny. I want my curves back. Brin takes the cash, enveloping my hands between both of his. “Merry Christmas, Evy. You have plans?” I force my gaze to stay steady, though I wince inside. “Dinner with the folks.” “Cool.” He lets me go and taps the cash register, popping open the drawer. I wave away his money. “Keep it.” He jams the bill into the drawer and hums “Jingle Bells.” “Thanks, babe. Don’t be such a stranger.” I test a smile and fight the burn stinging my eyes. “Thanks for fitting me in. Tell Tasha we need to go out for a drink.” He walks me to the door and holds it open. “She’d like that.” Back in Papi’s truck, I roll my shoulders. Even though some of the tension is gone, I still fight to stay above water. Please let this get easier. I’m going to run out of skin if this is how I have to unload the stress of an arc every time. A snow-covered Accord slides toward my bumper and I brace for the impact, but the driver gains control at the last second and waves in apology. She grins, buoyed by the Christmas packages piled high in the back of her car. I manage to lift my hand in forgiveness. If only the rest of my problems were that easy. I shift Papi’s truck into drive and pull out of the snowy parking lot, grateful he didn’t let me take my bike. I know he’s worried about me, but I don’t know how to reassure him—or if I even can. Not that he’s faring much better than I am, but at least he’s had a couple months to come to grips with what we are. Lightning leaps from my fingertips and rings the gearshift. Another bolt races around the steering wheel. My heartbeat steadies and my chest expands with a calming fullness. I need to play with it again. Nothing else can get me balanced and centered like my lightning. My throat tightens and I fight the flood of memories. Empty streets guide me home, but as I pass each driveway overflowing with visitors settling in for the long holiday weekend, the stiffness returns to my shoulders. I suppose I need to decide where I’m going to spend it as well. Someone’s shoveled my driveway, and I park between the small mounds of snow. It’s weird to be back here in my own house. I’ve spent what feels like months between Papi’s house and ancient Spain. Everything here is so . . . normal. Bamboo floors gleam, the stainless-steel kitchen is unused as ever, and the couch and gadgets remain untouched. I pace the length of my living room. The plan Papi and I formed earlier disintegrates as quickly as I try to recall the details. It seemed so easy and simple while we talked through saving Aurelia and then rescuing Penya. I pull a blue strand of lightning from my middle finger and twist it around my hand, covering and uncovering my fingers. That’s not the right order. Penya’s abduction weighs on me, but not just because I failed to save her in the forest. That whole situation doesn’t feel right. The longer I wait to save her, the more chances of something going wrong. She thinks Aurelia is important—and I completely agree—but leaving Penya to Ilif’s mercy until I save Aurelia makes me uneasy. The lightning jumps and pops around my hand. I close my eyes and inhale, drawing the cord of light out and back in a slow rhythm. When my mind empties and the unease quiets, I snuff the lightning and return to my living room. Badly as I want to leave this decision up to someone else, I need to decide between the two. Time travel should not be this hard. In a perfect world, I could stop time and do both. Ilif is both the wild card and the ultimate pain in my ass. My shoulders sag and I run a hand over my braid. It’s crusted and beyond grunge. I have no idea the last time I washed it—a week ago, a month? Time holds no meaning for me anymore. I growl and shake my arms. “Snap out of this, Evy! Do something. Anything!” A shower will help me sort things out. Right now any movement is progress. I toe my boots off and pad across the floor to the bathroom. Even the opulence of my simple place is jarring. I twist the knob on the shower and peel my T-shirt off, wincing at the new soreness on my back and the days-old scrape on my forearm. The one Constantine gave me. Tears burn the back of my eyes, and I swallow and scramble to get myself under control. We knew it was an impossible situation. We knew a relationship wouldn’t work. As I shimmy out of my pants, my fingers brush the bruise on my hip where he had me pressed against the rock wall of his bedroom while my naked limbs entwined with his. I can’t hold the sob anymore. It bursts free in a tortured wail. My hand flies to my lips and I bite my fist. No falling apart. Even though I gave myself permission to do it once I was alone, this is no time for a meltdown. Only a few hours until Christmas dinner, and I need days to purge all this. I grip the edge of the sink and lean over the marble countertop, avoiding my image in the mirror. My braid slithers over my shoulder like his fingers across my skin. I squeeze my eyes shut and block everything. Bolts absentmindedly extend from my hands. They skitter across the counter and retract like an electric yo-yo. I force a breath into my lungs and hold it then let it seep out. The exhale shakes as it leaves my lips, but I calm, even if just a small amount. On trembling legs, I turn toward the shower and check the water temperature. I slip my fingers beneath the waistband of my boy shorts— Thunk. Something hits the closed door. I freeze. It can’t be Ilif. Not yet. Not here. I hold my breath. Straining for any sound, any indication of which stranger prowls my hallway. Ilif doesn’t know where I live. He’s never been here, but who knows what kind of tracking software he uses to monitor me now. If he’s using Penya to compensate for his shortcomings, he could go anywhere . . . even here. I force air from my lungs before I hyperventilate. I’m a warrior and need to effing act like one. Down the hallway, the floor creaks, but the silence stretches too long for a footstep. I press myself against the door and listen again. Nothing. Steam curls above my head and against the ceiling, swirling and billowing in white clouds. I flick the light off and let my eyes adjust then curl my fingers around the doorknob and twist, concentrating on silence, drawing on all the warrior stealth Constantine taught me. The steam sneaks out before me, my lookout. Tendrils of lightning crisscross my palms. Tensed for battle, I take one big breath and sweep into the hall, silent on bare feet. Something hard strikes my foot and I stumble. Instinctively, I tuck and lean into the momentum. With a roll and twist so I can see my attacker, I come up on one knee, hands splayed with thick bolts of lightning leaping from my palms. Snapping white bolts extend all the way past the bathroom door. The hallway looms empty except for a strange, small book propped against the doorframe. I ease toward it, ready for whoever left it. My ragged breathing and the crackle of electricity are the only noises. Standing, I retract my lightning. I like that my reaction time is getting better. I suppose attacking a book isn’t exactly the right response, but I’d rather be ready than dead. Not that Ilif would kill me . . . but then again, I’m not one hundred percent positive he wouldn’t. I march to the stairs and peer over the railing. Nothing moves. Returning to the book, I crouch and poke at it, but as far as I can tell, it’s exactly what it seems. A leather thong holds the worn cover closed. Deep grooves carve the front, and the edges are worn with what I imagine must have been constant use to make the leather so light. I rub my hand over the smooth surface to wipe away a fine layer of dust then turn it over and examine the back. There’s no writing or anything. No one sneaks into a house, drops off an old book, and leaves. Whoever left this is coming back. Cold fingers of ice trace my spine. Coming to harm or to help. With my luck lately, my money isn’t on help. I tuck the book beneath my arm and turn off the shower. Silence. Still half-naked, I creep upstairs, but all the rooms are empty. Downstairs is the same. I don’t get it. Taking a breath, I relax. It’s no good for me to stay wound this tight. I need to chill until they face me. Nothing I can do until then. I retrace my steps and burrow into the corner of the couch, tucking my feet beneath me. I undo the book’s strap and ease the cover open. Hard slashes of script mark the page, punching me in the gut and yanking me instantly to another place. My fingers trace the letters, recognizing the handwriting from a map drawn nearly two thousand years ago while I stood next to him. If this is someone’s idea of a joke, it’s beyond brutal. I see him bent over this book, pouring out thoughts, dreams, plans . . . A sob wrenches from my throat, but I choke it down before it breaks completely free. My lips tremble and I bite them hard until my breathing slows. I try again. On the page, the words shift from Latin to English. Aurelia mortuus est hodie. They blur, and I wipe my eyes and spread the tears on my bare thigh in a long, wet streak. When I begin again, the rich timbre of Constantine’s voice carries the words to my heart. Aurelia died today. Without me there to save her. She died alone while I busied away the day on trifles of war. A mystery flood carried her away from me forever. Such pain. I am without breath. My grief threatens to consume me. To kill me. Oh, I wish it could. I would die in a flame of grief if it could take away this pain. My sweet Aurelia is gone. Gone, not to a husband I could choose, but to a lover who stole her from me without warning or apology. My heart twists until I can’t breathe, but I force myself to keep reading. I flip a chunk of pages to another entry, months later... I relive the morning of her journey again and again. I search my memory for some indicator of the storm, but I find nothing. I remember her face that morning, her jubilation to visit her friends . . . her laughter. I hear it, chasing me through the halls. She calls to me from the grave, beckons me to come and play. This life needs me for something, though I know not what. I can feel it like an abrasion under my finger, for it is the only other feeling I have beyond my pain. I tire of this grief. Would that I could take my sword to it. I miss her. I miss her so. My hands drop and the pages fan closed in a cascade of sorrow. There’s more, but I can’t bear another word. Every page is full. When we were together, he brushed the edge of his misery with me, but not like this. I didn’t know . . . “Oh, Constantine.” I close my eyes and relive the aching horror when we saw a glimpse of her. In that split second I got a clue about how losing her devastated him, but somehow, seeing such emotion in his own hand . . . It kills me. Our time together was so short. My chest constricts. Even if we’d had the time, he wouldn’t have shared this. To expose this much vulnerability would have been a weakness. And now Penya wants me to find Aurelia and save her before he has to go through this. Eradicate all of this sorrow and pain from his life. And change the man I know . . . I correct myself, the man I thought I knew. My fingers hover above the pages then curl into a fist. To prevent this, I’d do anything. With a sigh, I let my head drop back against the couch. My fingers drift to the pages and across each indentation of his words. There has to be more to Aurelia’s story. Either Penya isn’t telling me the whole story or she doesn’t know. Ancestor to a famous scientist, sure, but who will she be? A mother, a wife . . . I can’t accept that she’s nothing more than an incubator for greatness. My thoughts drift, bouncing and floating from one to another. Drowsy from the emotional beating, it takes me a minute to realize the bright column of light shining in the middle of the room isn’t coming from a window. Silvery and cylindrical, it slowly rotates counterclockwise—I jerk upright—like last time she visited after the kidnapping. “Penya!” I dive off the couch and kneel beside the emerging shape. It morphs and shifts into her short, earthy silhouette. Though she’s transparent and some sort of projection, I can make out all her features, but nothing about where she is. I lean closer. “Where are you? You still haven’t told me how you’re projecting your image here.” Her face falls and she glances over her shoulder, waving my question away with a violent swat. My hands fly to cover my mouth. I didn’t think about someone hearing me on her side. After listening for something I can’t see, she turns back then spots the journal on the couch behind me and clasps her hands together. “Good, good.” Her voice sounds far away, like she’s standing at the end of a tunnel. “I was not certain the journal would travel without me.” “You left it?” “Who else? Ilif will not help you. He has almost figured out Aurelia’s connection. You must complete the alteration now.” “Her connection? What does that mean? Like her connection to Constantine? And it’s Christmas. I have a family dinner in four hours.” “I have no time to explain, and you will return in time.” I bristle. “You don’t know that. Last time cost me six months.” “You must risk it. If Ilif gets to her first . . .” She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. “Go now. There is no time to lose.” I grind my teeth and point at her chest. “Not this time. You’re not leaving me in the dark again. Where are you? How do I get to you?” “Ilif’s new lab is all I know—” I cross my arms. “Okay, about that. You guys worked together? Didn’t you think that was worth mentioning?” She glances behind her again and lowers her voice until I can hardly hear her. “It was long ago. We have no time for this, Evy.” “No. Not a long time ago. In my future!” I don’t know when I’m going to see her again, and I need this information. She sighs. “Yes, your future.” “How are you traveling? You’re here, but you’re not, just like in the forest. What did he do to you?” “This is why you must hurry. He is developing new methods of travel. Aurelia’s sudden death wiped out an entire line of scientists. Ones he needed.” So much information . . . I squeeze my eyes shut. Think, Evy. Ask the right questions. “What is Ilif working on?” Her image leans closer. “I do not know. I promise I do not. But you are strong enough to handle the answers this time. I promise you will know everything as I do.” My lightning flickers at her praise. “I will learn more. He leaves me for days at a time—but there may be stretches when I cannot get to you. I must go.” “Wait!” I press forward, grinding my knees into the bamboo floorboards. “What time are you in right now—when are you?” “I have not pinpointed an exact date. Same with our location. To say Ilif put a good deal of thought into this lab is an understatement. When I do get to wander, it is fully contained and he does not permit me beyond the building.” “Then how are you traveling?” “I used the tracking software to locate you and project this image, but otherwise, my physical form is captive. I also think he found a way to block certain places from arcs, starting with this one.” “I’ll find you.” My heart tightens at the thought of losing her. She’s the only one who ever seems to be on my side. “I am your smallest problem. Worry for Aurelia. You must save her before Ilif interferes. Your alterations are different enough that he cannot manipulate them, but it is only a matter of time. And his determination is endless. Aurelia is too important. Whatever he is working on centers around her. You must get to her first.” My empty gut clenches. “No pressure.” Her head jerks to the right and she watches something in her time that I can’t see. “Save Aurelia. Now.” A dangerous undertone in her whisper snakes a chill up my spine. She vanishes. “Penya!” My hand grasps air, and I press my fist against my forehead. Dammit. There are so many reasons I don’t want to go right now. A night in my own bed would be nice . . . I’m at least taking a shower before I go. Dread seeps through my bones and I stand. While I’d love to join in her optimism, my arcs don’t work like that. I’ll be lucky to get back here today, let alone before dinner. The soles of my feet stick to the wood floor, smacking loudly as I return to the bathroom and start the shower. After dropping my panties, I step under the spray and unbraid my hair. Dark strands cling to my fingers. As I rinse them down the drain, my mind is consumed with what’s coming. This time will be different. This time I’m knowingly trying to alter history. There is so much uncertainty at the beginning of an alteration. I never know what intersection of someone’s life is the perfect point for me to change things . . . where we’ll meet . . . who will be there. Or in this case, if a certain someone will be there. Vanilla infuses the steam as I squirt bodywash into my palm and lather up. My shoulders are fuller and there’s muscle beneath my curves. I ignore what the new shape of my arms means and quickly soap my chest—no danger of those getting muscley—then race across my flatter stomach and over my full hips. I’m surprised that the training with Constantine would have such an effect on me so soon, and I definitely don’t want to look like he does. I liked my soft curves. I miss them. Shampoo slides in soapy tracks down my face, and I turn into the hot water and refocus. Ilif is still the biggest uncertainty, precariously balanced between bad guy and worst co-worker on the face of Earth. No chance he’s lightened up on his feelings about females, and since I’m still wearing a set of boobs, we’re at an impasse. No way I trust his recent crazy-train flip-flop—he wanted to use me. I towel off and head upstairs to my bedroom. A pair of chocolate-brown leather pants are still folded on the end of my bed, but as I slip my fingers beneath the buttery softness, I pause. Finding Aurelia while she’s still alive puts me pre-149 BC, and I know she died in Rome. I toss my pants back on the bed and scout the closet for something less barbaric. The only skirt I have is from someone’s funeral, a pinstriped black number with a slit up the back, not exactly something I can traipse about in ancient Rome. I finger the top rack, letting my hand travel across my long-sleeved tees, my cashmere sweaters . . . at least now the juxtaposition of my wardrobe makes more sense. I’m not meant to live in one time period. Time traveler or no, nothing here will work. Last time, Constantine’s sister, Anna, made me the greatest wardrobe ever. I miss those clothes. Maybe if I get better at arcing I’ll figure out how to bring stuff home with me. For now, it’s incredibly annoying, so I resort to the leather pants, a matched set of baby-blue bra and panties, and a seaweed-green tee. With leather motorcycle boots and wet, braided hair, I stride back to the living room and stand in Penya’s empty spot. The journal mocks me. I pick it up and close it tightly then tuck it in the back of my pants. I inhale and quit stalling. Arms relaxed, palms open, I let go of everything else and let the lightning come. White bolts spark from my fingertips, writhing and crackling against each other, slipping backward over my elbow and stretching toward the floor. With deliberate slowness, I bring my hands together until they’re eight inches apart. Attraction pulls the bolts together into an electric ball. I picture Aurelia, her spirit, her love of life and of friends, and her willfulness. Black arms of nothingness open wide and embrace me in an all-consuming possession. I am deaf, blind, and mute. And for once, my heart doesn’t hurt. Chapter Two I arrive in Rome on the wings of sunrise. Wisps of an orange and pink sky bleed into morning blue, and the sun shines bright from the east, already warming the dry air. Over rooftops, grand buildings rise in the distance, oddly pristine and unfamiliar. My shoulders relax and I take the first deep breath of the week. This is going to be a cinch—no rain, no flood. Hopefully I can get in and out without a single issue. Pride puffs up my chest. I’m getting good at this. In front of me, tall box elms create an impenetrable wall around a home’s garden and repeat again near what looks like a rear entry into the house. Hand-painted and etched pots overflow with bright blossoms. Clusters of them dot the space and cuddle up to several benches scattered throughout the garden. Beyond the lazy floating butterflies and working bees, the garden is silent and empty. Everyone must still be inside this morning. I hesitate and scan the entire back wall of the house, not sure I can sneak in without being seen—especially if my plan is to keep Aurelia from leaving. I step forward and a familiar blonde steps through the doorway, making me duck back behind a hedge. I’ve only seen Aurelia once before, but it must have been last week, because she looks the same. Curls held back by a gold braid frame a heart-shaped face, round with youthful pudginess. I slip behind a tall container bursting with tall, fluffy-headed grass so I can study her in secret. She’s barely as tall as I am and dressed in a simple tunic pinned at the shoulders with matching brooches. Turning to respond to a question, the curls spill down her back, stopping just short of the matching gold braid around her teeny waist. She skirts a narrow table and sits, smiling up at a servant as he sets a fruit plate and bread in front of her. “Aurelia?” I jerk toward the voice that haunts my dreams and try to dislodge my heart from my throat while I press deeper into the foliage. Greenery leans across my face, but I can still make out every single one of Constantine’s features as he comes outside. Golden eyes assess every possible threat and a youthful bunching of freckles dust his cheekbones. His demeanor changes and he scans the garden, pausing on my location. Aurelia looks up, but I can’t shift my attention off Constantine. While he stares intently at my etched clay planter, I curl my fingers around the lip and try to suck breath into my collapsed windpipe. Whenever I am, however long it will be until he touches me, his raw handsomeness makes all the wrong parts of my body take notice. Impossibly tall, Constantine is somewhere between the thick, wide warrior I first met, and the lean death machine who trained me to be the same. His dark blond curls are cut close to his head and his fingers twitch constantly. I wonder when he got that nervous tic under control. “Papa.” He snaps back to Aurelia and rubs the edge of his eyebrow. “Me paenitet. Ego vidi.” Sorry. I thought I saw something. Their Latin shifts in my head. I’m still not sure how that works, but I’ve stopped questioning. She lifts a small hand to his forearm. “You worry too much.” He smiles, and the sheer joy of it illuminates his entire face. I press my lips together and my heart finds a regular rhythm. “You don’t worry enough.” He sits on the adjacent bench. She nibbles a slice of fruit ad he plucks a slice of pear off the plate. “What time are you leaving?” “Rom is bringing the chariot this afternoon.” I sigh, and the gust makes the grass wave. About time I had an easy one. I loosen my grip on the planter and straighten. As soon as Constantine leaves, I’ll figure out how to stop her. He stands and rubs the back of his neck. He’s made that gesture a thousand times with me . . . something is bothering him, but he’s trying to hide it. I narrow my eyes and study each nuance of his body language, but even now he’s a master at secrecy. Unaware, Aurelia wipes her fingers, jumps up, and throws her arms around his waist. His eyes squeeze closed. I lean closer. He drops a quick kiss on her head and tucks his emotion away before she lets go. “I’ll be home in a week, Papa.” He straightens and clears his throat. “I’ll talk to Rom and ensure he’s readied everything. Though I don’t know why I bother. He worries about you more than I.” She bites her lip and a blush reddens her cheeks. If he notices, he doesn’t say anything but squeezes her shoulder, then returns to the house. Aurelia fidgets, straightens her belt, and trails in his wake. I want to run after him, make him remember me, tell him not to be such a jackass from the get-go so we can have more good moments. But I don’t because it won’t matter, because that time is over for me, even if it hasn’t yet come for him. Biting my lower lip, I step from behind the planter and creep toward the table, skirting a splashing fountain. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and I cringe. Constantine’s journal is warm against my back, and I pull it out. Keeping it will only make this harder after I’m gone. I lift it, press the leather against my lips in a silent goodbye, and set it next to Aurelia’s plate, fingers lingering for one last second. “Read this,” I whisper, and my throat tightens. “Remember me. Remember us.” Straightening my shoulders, I step toward the door. Light flashes to my left and I spin. Ilif’s image materializes next to the fountain and I leap behind the hedge near the door. Shit. Shit. Shit. That’s what I get for having a sentimental moment about Constantine. I should have grabbed Aurelia the second I could. If Ilif’s here, he’s obviously not into playing nice. He’s out to win. No chance. I separate the branches of the hedge and glare across the small yard. Dressed in a dark-brown suit today, that superfuck straightens his tie, aligning the blue and brown stripes with the horizon. The light-brown pattern on his shirt does nothing to enhance his translucent skin. Spindly fingers smooth the gray hair at his temples, making me smile at the amount now peppering his shiny black pompadour. When he’s artfully arranged his entire countenance enough to make me gag, he moves around the back of the fountain. Not a chance he’s going to get any closer to screwing this up. I burst through the hedge and splash through the basin, drawing a long rope of lightning between my outstretched arms as I race toward him. Errant strands leap from my hands and ricochet off the water. He jerks away, but not before his features contort with betrayal, quickly covering a trace of awe. Fueled by his rage, I flex my knees and lunge. He flickers and ducks, but I catch him in the side of the face with my right hand. He solidifies, and a triple fork of lightning erupts from the fountain as I flare my own. I wrap my arm around his neck, and a sharp pain spears the base of my spine as we disappear. Blackness rips him from my grasp and tumbles me backward. The pain ebbs as a high afternoon sun blinds me. I crouch and search the flat white landscape for that scuttling cockroach, Ilif, but there’s only me. In the distance, mountains rise from the glaring expanse of nothing. I pinch the white dirt. It’s crusty and coarse. Straightening, I study the horizon again and frown. I’m on either the Salt Flats near home in Utah or an alien planet. Okay, so this is new. Like I need more things to figure out. I prod the muscles of my back, trying to recreate the pain, but fail. I twist and lift my shirt. No wound, not even a red mark. Whatever that weirdness was in Rome, the arc healed it. Even so, something made my lightning go haywire. All that should have happened was that my lightning created interference so it was impossible for Ilif to stay. At least that’s how it worked last time. So where is he? And where am I? This is a disaster. Just when I have a small grasp on my lightning and how it works—or at least the arcing part, I find another new component. This is such bullshit. I rub my forehead and focus on the Ilif part for now. When we were in Spain and I used my lightning, I never bothered to figure out where the interference caused him to go. All I cared was that he wasn’t with me anymore. I’m not sure if he goes back to the same place every time, or if I’ve screwed up his life enough to keep him busy. That would be too handy . . . so, no. I need to expect him back at Aurelia’s side any moment. With another quick look around at the barren plains, I open my hands and fill them with twin balls of lightning. Blackness holds me only briefly, and the silence of the salt morphs into the roar of water. Color and the pungency of wetlands surround me as heat and sunlight become misting droplets of rain beneath a gray sky that I recognize instantly. The river is louder than when Constantine and I arced here after Aurelia’s death. I’m at the same narrow section, flanked on either side by thick trees that make it impossible to see upstream past the sharp bend to the right. Easy to see how people could get lured into a false sense of security. The river looks peaceful, especially since the changing landscape works as a distraction. An uneasy lump forms in my stomach, and I pull a strand of lightning from my fingertips and slowly tease it longer then let it snap back and repeat the motion while I scan for something sinister. Downstream, the trees fade quickly into reeds as the ground becomes smooth clay. The bank is sloping and beachy. A nice contrast to the cliffs and rocks at the bend beneath the tree roots, enough to make someone forget they’re basically standing in a tight canyon. People die like that every year back home, trapped in narrow canyons when the rainwater comes. Though nothing looks obviously out of place or deadly, the tall walls will make escape impossible—just like home. I snuff my lightning. Twenty feet farther downriver stands an arched bridge. Thick with a short railing, it spans the water in a wide curve with massive supports of stone rising from the water. Roman architecture doesn’t skimp, and even here their brilliance shines through. There’s a dirt road leading up to it, but the reeds obscure parts from where I am. The cramping is back in my stomach. I tug at my collar as raindrops slip beneath the cotton fabric of my shirt. No time to whine about the weather, I push through the reeds and stop at the edge of the road. Travelers wander along, warily skirting me and averting their gazes. Long, deserted silences stretch between the large groups as they hurry through the light rain. If I’ve landed here now, that can only mean Aurelia’s chariot will come around the corner within the next few minutes. I need to quit with the sightseeing and make a plan that will convince her she can’t cross the river. I wince and bite my lip. If her driver is more protective than Constantine, he’s not going to be an easy sell. As the road twists away from the river, wide expanses of barren soil flank both sides. The reeds are confined to a few feet next to the river, but otherwise, short, brittle grass grows in patches. Hugging the road’s left side, a wide hill slopes gently upward a good twenty feet, at least enough to get us out of immediate harm. It’s topped with a group of trees that flow down the side, hop the road, and continue on a parallel path to the river. Though there isn’t an actual road to the top, the grass won’t be tough to navigate. When I was here with Constantine, I realized horses are just ancient four-wheelers, so a half-decent charioteer shouldn’t have an issue, and I’m positive Constantine wouldn’t entrust Aurelia to a novice. I jam my fists into my hips and scowl at the horizon. There has to be a reasonable way to get Aurelia and her driver off the main road and climbing up a random hill. An occasional shrub dots the landscape, but nothing that can help me divert the chariot’s path. The most obvious plan is to use my lightning to scare everyone away, but I don’t trust the reaction. If I stand in the middle of the road and play the sorceress, odds are good the charioteer will just drive around me, probably with spit and well-deserved curse—most definitely a sword aimed at my head—all while inciting a complete panic and speeding Aurelia to her death. Saving that option for last. Thunder rumbles in the distance and the edges of the clouds darken. More pedestrians hurry along the road, and I study their paths to see if that helps me at all. They stay to the confines of the road for the most part, but big groups spread into wide swaths and overflow the road into the short grass. I glance over my shoulder at the racing water. I swear it’s moving faster. A few more inches of reeds are beneath the surface now. Penya’s flickering light spears the dirt next to me and I jump sideways. “Where have you been?” I wipe my hands on my pants. “Ilif was at Aurelia’s. I tried to flare my lightning to get him out, but it flung me to the Salt Flats. What’s that all about?” “Possibly his attempts to tamper with the arc. I told you he was close, and that is why we cannot waste time trying to get me out of here. Not yet. Save Aurelia. What have you figured out?” I rub the end of my braid across my lips. “Nothing yet. It’s not like I can flag her down and ask her to please wait by the side of the road.” “Why not?” I flounder, opening and closing my mouth while my brain tries to compute a snappy retort. A raindrop slips off my lip and onto my tongue. “Stop making life so difficult. Simplicity is key.” She moves closer. “Life is the same, Evy. Yet you doubt.” She sighs and reaches for me. Her face softens and her eyes betray a pride she hasn’t revealed before now. “Life is not this complicated series of tests and struggles you seem to imagine. It is meant to be lived, not endured. How many of the struggles in your life have you created? Stop inventing obstacles. Stop making arcing harder than it has to be. Your alterations will continue to be massive complications if you do not start looking past the impossible.” I shudder and my heartbeat hammers against my breastbone. Easy for her to say. Thunder cracks, and the center of a storm cloud to the west starts a clockwise rotation. My shirt is soaked through at the shoulders now. I inhale and consider all the possibilities. Behind my lids I envision my goal. There has to be a way to get Aurelia safe. A simple way. “I can arc her.” Penya’s swift inhale isn’t encouraging. “Simple, I said.” “Work with me here.” “Not without preparation,” she says. “I spent months with Constantine working on it, and then you prepared him well for the actual moment he traveled. Even with your disaster in the glen, he had been readied.” “But it worked. I just need to get her out of here. I’m not teaching her to travel, so I can just grab her like I did in the glen, right? I even arced the horse, so surely I can arc a girl. I’m talking about when I arced him with my lightning—not when he traveled on his own. If she uses mine, won’t it work the same way?” In what I’d come to know as her you’re-going-to-be-the-death-of-me gesture, Penya taps her index finger against her lips. I cross my arms. “You said anyone could time travel.” “Yes, but under reasonable circumstances. By trying it here, you risk much. Arcing a virgin traveler must be your last resort. And you must move with her, like Constantine.” “How much prep does she need?” “She is Constantine’s, which leads me to believe she will need less than most, but still . . .” “I’ll try to get them to stop, but—” She jerks toward something over my shoulder and disappears. I spin. A chariot crests the small hill with Aurelia in it beside a towering black man. Behind me, Penya’s voice carries down a long tunnel. “Think of all possibilities. Do not disregard what seems impossible. There is no impossible. Not for you.” I flinch. Splashes of water spray behind Aurelia’s chariot. At this pace, I have minutes. Don’t disregard what seems impossible, Penya said. Well, that’s about everything. Not a lot of ways to stop a chariot. All I have is a lot of lightning, and maybe a little luck. They’re forced to slow behind a large group clogging the road. I glance behind me. The river has risen to cover at least another foot of reeds. They would have been up and over the bridge without this latest delay. Less than a mile separates me from the chariot. Impossible. Unless I arc there. “Too reckless,” I say to the damp air. Any arc I try between now and the alteration costs me. Each one will jump time forward and pull me closer to her death. And considering I’ve only managed to hit my target once out of all the times I’ve arced, this is not my best idea. Never mind that this time I’m trying to hit a moving one and not kill or maim anybody. My heart pounds, nearly deafening me to every other sound. Thunder rumbles, and a blanket of humidity drops from the sky. I can taste the moisture. I have to try, even if the next one leaves me only seconds. At the hint of request, twin snakes of lightning tumble from my palms and darkness blinds me. I land ten feet behind the chariot and scare an old woman carrying a basket of greens. She screams and runs away, cursing about gods and their storm. I arc back to my starting point, jumping me forward ten seconds. Now I have less than a quarter mile to get this right, and my aim is worse than usual. I compress another ball, keeping it tight against my belly. This time when I land, the chariot wheel skims my shin and Aurelia’s startled face whips backward as she goes by. The driver flicks the reins, and the horse surges through the crowd then slows hard in a bottleneck. Last chance. No more errors. I focus every particle of thought on the horse, on feeling its warm skin beneath my hands, short slick bay coat beneath my palms. I picture weaving the wiry mane through my fingers, feeling the harness bounce beneath me. Lightning flares into an egg shape and stretches into a jagged square. I scowl and force it into a normal ball and arc before it changes again. My feet slip on the sweaty leather as I land on the horse’s back. Crap. Too much movement. I yelp like a sissy and fall forward onto the horse’s neck. Frantic, I grab a handful of mane, push up into a half crouch, and squint through the pelting rain. Since I can barely ride a horse with a saddle, I’m not sure why I thought this was a doable idea. I dig the toes of my boots under the wet harness across the base of its neck and situate myself. The horse surges ahead and bucks, not happy about me, I’m sure. I crouch lower, drop a knee to the middle of the horse’s bouncing back, and twist around. The reins hang loose in the driver’s hand, and his mouth is frozen in shock. Aurelia peeks under his outstretched arm, more curious than scared. Taking advantage of the slack, the horse lengthens his stride, making me lose my precious balance. I slip sideways and roll, but manage to hang on through the biting leather twisting my fingers. One boot sails over my head and through the air then smacks hard against the packed road. My legs are stretched enough to win the lead in a ballet competition, but I push my foot deeper into the harness and press my heel against the horse. Every muscle from my ankle to my hip is on fire. I bear down and force my legs together, pulling myself back on. The driver regains his senses and yanks the horse to a stop. I pat the bay’s neck, and damp hairs stick to my hand. I wipe it on the bottom of my shirt but don’t slide off, wary of giving them any opportunity to flee. Aurelia pokes her head around the giant driver. “Why, it’s just a girl.” I smile back. Been a while since I’ve been called that. “Es in periculo, Aurelia.” You’re in danger, Aurelia. “There’s a flood coming. I know this is drastic. Showing up on your horse—” “How did you appear like that? Will you teach me?” A smile sweetens Aurelia’s face. My own widens into a grin. I can’t help it. It shouldn’t surprise me that Aurelia can take my arrival in stride. After all, Constantine did. “Let’s worry about you first.” Beneath me, the horse fidgets, and I swing my leg over his rump and slide to the ground. A ball of nerves quivers in my stomach and I step quickly away from his fidgeting hooves. For now, Aurelia’s curiosity will keep her from bolting, so I ease my way around the back of the chariot. I smile at her again and avoid eye contact with the seething driver. “I need you to turn around. There’s a flood coming.” The driver sweeps Aurelia behind him and puts his big body between us. “Who are you? The river appears fine. This is mere rain. We can make it if we hurry. Your intrusion is our only delay.” His tone lowers. “Any threat against Aurelia will cost you more than your magic, sorceress.” Great, here we go again with the sorceress thing. I force a smile and hold up my hands. “I’m not here to harm her. That’s the last time you’ll see my magic.” I hope. Aurelia turns back to me. “How do you know who I am?” This might get tricky. “I know your father. He sent me to save you.” From another time. “Why didn’t he tell me not to go today?” I slowly lower my hands. “There’s a lot I don’t have time to tell you. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me. If I’m wrong, you can go in an hour.” Aurelia lays a hand on the driver’s arm. “Rom? What if she speaks truth? We could use a break. I wouldn’t mind setting a small meal.” He dips his chin, and in the depth of his gaze something else mixes with his duty to obey her. I bite back the smile. Wears his heart on his sleeve where Aurelia’s concerned . . . Pretty sure I can use that against him if I need it. His head lowers in a silent bow of acquiescence. “We can return to the small copse of trees before the hill if you wish.” When he turns his attention to me, all softness is gone, replaced by hard features that immediately convey the threat. “Will that suffice?” “I don’t know,” I answer honestly. “Stay alert. We might need to move quickly.” Aurelia presses to the far side of the chariot and gestures to the extra space. “Come.” I step onto the woven leather floor and reach around Aurelia to grab a handhold. Pretty sure Rom won’t make any effort to keep me in the vehicle. As I settle myself, Aurelia’s fingertips brush my pants. I stiffen, but she gives me a shy smile as she faces forward. Rom turns the chariot around with a flick of the reins, and as the wheels pivot, it’s impossible to miss the black sky to the north. The short hairs rising on my nape have nothing to do with the drenching rain, and I shiver as icy tentacles tighten around my limbs. Rom pulls us to a halt again and we stare openmouthed at the utter blackness. He glances over his shoulder and studies me. He’s still not happy about the added delay, but his resentment slips away as the sky darkens. I check the swirler of a cloud. A huge circle is turning and the eye has a definite cone shape forming toward the earth. Thunder rumbles and the breeze picks up, pushing debris across the road and whipping at nearby pedestrians’ clothes and possessions. The horse fidgets and jerks Rom’s arms and upper body forward. He searches the traffic pattern of the people, his head on a swivel. I track his movements and bite my lip. We don’t have many options to get us out of the crowd. He sends us through a tiny opening and turns us off the road, coaxing the bay forward up the hill. People are everywhere. I can barely tell where the road ends. We ease our way over the short grass that’s now been trampled by hundreds of feet. Another large group crests from the backside at the same time, and Rom slows us to a walk until we’re through the crowd’s thickest part. Restless, the horse swings his frontend to the left and pushes a man and boy deeper into the thick pulsing mob. Rom croons to the big bay and leans forward to stroke the dark hip. The gesture doesn’t calm any of us. I don’t like this. Waiting it out seems too easy. Too vulnerable. I’d rather get her out of here. “We’re almost there.” Aurelia grips the front of the bucket and leans forward. At the top of the hill, the clumps of trees make small pockets of dry ground, but if this storm gets any worse, it’s not the brightest spot to wait out a lightning storm. That would be my luck though . . . save Aurelia from a flood to kill her with regular lightning. I scan the landscape. For now, there’s no other place to run. A baby screams and the bay rears, scattering the rest of the travelers around the chariot and inching us back down the hill until I can no longer see over the top. While Rom wrestles to get the horse controlled, I glance again at the storm clouds. They’ve doubled in size, roiling like an overflowing pot of black oil. Not good. Rom curses, and I wonder if he’s reconsidering his ban on my sorcery. The slightly inconvenient mist becomes real rain, quieting the wind, but drenching us within seconds. Time to go. I’ve given Rom long enough to get us out of here. I grip the chariot’s iron scrollwork until it bites my palms. I close my eyes and breathe. This has to work. The ozone stings my nostrils, and I fight to control my racing heart and the panic of screwing this up. Constantine’s angry tirade of the last time doesn’t help, and I silence the memory. Bad enough it’s his daughter I’m saving. Lightning flares from my fingers and I make the coil swing beneath the bucket. Pedestrians closest to the chariot freak out and press away, tightening the crowd and squashing the spaces Rom was using to maneuver the horse through. Doesn’t matter. I tighten my grip, dig deep, and curl another strand around the top of the bucket to get us out of there. The lightning flares and jerks away from the bucket then slams it like a battering ram. Darkness flickers. I hold tight to the image of Constantine’s house, but something yanks it away like a paper in a storm. Images layer over the top of each other and we spin left, then right like we’re in a psychotic tornado. We crash-land at the river’s edge, behind the entire group, giving up every foot we’d gained. The horse backs up faster than I’ve ever seen him go forward, and Rom does nothing to stop him. Aurelia grabs Rom’s arm and raises her voice. “Rom!” Crap. I knew he wouldn’t be able to handle it, but Aurelia was supposed to be safe. It was supposed to be worth the risk. Not this. Not both parts wrong. I don’t understand why nothing works like it’s supposed to. Rom gives himself a hard shake, but he wobbles and sags against the side of the chariot. I lean forward and slap the horse hard enough to make my entire hand sting and my elbow ache. He jumps to a stop, snorts, and takes a tentative step forward. Aurelia puts her hands on Rom’s cheek, and her touch pulls him out of his stupor. His eyes lose their glassiness and he smothers her fingers with his own. I give him half a second to recover. “No time for this!” My terseness jerks him upright and he sweeps Aurelia behind him. “You said no more magic.” “Really?” I yell. “You pick now to chew me out?” I point at the river less than three feet from the wheels of the chariot. He glares at me and pats the horse’s quivering rump. The tight skin by his lips is still an ashy gray. Scooping the reins, he swallows and clucks softly while he rubs the horse’s coat. It seems scared. Super glad we’re tied to the damn thing with a thousand straps and buckles. At least jumping out is closer to the ground than jumping off. “Now what?” Rom yells while his head whips back and forth, eying one end of the crowd to the other. The path to the top of the hill is covered with people frantic to cross the river. We are so screwed. I completely robbed us of every gain. Overhead, thunder rumbles. Both the road and path to the top of the hill clog with travelers, and not just the group we met. That bunch is almost to the bridge, but there’s a constant stream rounding the hill, creating a massive bottleneck. Very few take the small walkway toward the town on this side of the river, choosing instead to head toward the bridge. Maybe if most of the group were able-bodied young men, this wouldn’t have disaster written all over it, but moms carry babies and parcels, men lead animals and wagons loaded with cages of goods, and clumps of elderly men and women block the passage of everyone else. Easygoing attitudes fall by the wayside as more people push and shove to get over the river. I wish I’d have taken the time to get a better view of the backside of the hill when we were on top. “Where are these people coming from?” “The city,” Rom answers with a grunt as the horse leaps forward. “They went in to trade early this morn, but know the river will trap them if they don’t cross before the storm.” I glare at him. Just “mere rain,” my ass. He knew this was coming. He scowls back, the unsaid threat clear. Do not alarm Aurelia any more than you already have. Then stop working against me. I scowl back. He breaks contact as Aurelia says, “Those people will die if she speaks the truth. We cannot let them.” Rom stiffens and glances at me. Now the unsaid is worry and a plea. I’m in agreement and grip Aurelia’s elbow. “You can’t go. I’m here to keep you safe. There’s no way I’m letting you anywhere near that water.” She leans dangerously over the edge of the chariot. “But all those poor people.” I open my mouth and close it again. Nothing I can say will make this easier. But I can’t exactly stand here and watch them die, either. “Will you stay?” I ask her. “If Rom and I go to save them, will you stay put?” She sucks her lower lip between her teeth and nods. “I promise.” A worried pallor lightens the skin around Rom’s cheekbones. “This is a bad idea. We need to worry about Aurelia.” “But those people—” she says. “Are not you,” Rom says, interrupting and lowering his intense gaze until their noses almost touch. She plants her hands on her hips, lifts her chin, and glares back, managing to look imposing. “You will obey me, Rom.” He crosses his arms and mimics her. “I obey your father.” “Fine, then I’ll tell him you killed hundreds of people today and put me in danger.” His flinch is nearly imperceptible. If anything, he increases in size. “You wouldn’t dare.” “Would, too.” “Seconds matter here, people,” I say, interrupting. “Aurelia, I agree with Rom. Your safety is paramount.” “Look.” She points toward an outcropping on the other side of the road. “Take me there and I’ll wait. I promise not to stray.” The spot isn’t as high as I’d like, but we might have plenty of time to get her out of here before the water rises much more. Unless something goes wrong. A shiver coils around my spine. This is stupid. I need to get her safe, not the rest of these people. Ilif would never let a tourist get in the way of an arc. “No.” “Please.” She grabs my arm and tugs. “All these children. Please.” The plea in her voice breaks my heart, and for no other reason than because Ilif wouldn’t, I relent. Unless Rom tells her no. Rom uncrosses his arms. “Five attempts,” he says. “After that, we go.” Dammit. She looks to me for a counter, but I nod. An uneasy nausea builds as she beams and kisses our cheeks. First mine and then Rom’s, with a lingering touch at his jawline. Even though I avoid his attention, there’s no mistaking Rom’s glare as he urges the horse toward the outcropping. “Use your magic if it will keep her safe.” I clench my jaw. This is beyond stupid. I assume his reference to five “attempts” gives me less than fifteen minutes. Barely enough time to alert everyone near the bridge and get the stragglers across it, but hopefully it’s enough for Aurelia. Rom eases us back through the swarm of people until the outcropping edges alongside the chariot. Raindrops slide down my forehead and drip from my jaw, but I’ve stopped trying to stay dry. Hordes of travelers bump against our metal basket, making it sway and rock in the wheelset. Any confidence I’ve had in its construction wanes. Every small movement grates on my nerves, and I can almost hear the second hand of an invisible clock ticking loudly beside my ear. The horse prances in time to the second hand, our own personal metronome of impending doom. Aurelia turns to Rom. “Be safe. Please come back to me. . .” He lifts a dark hand to her porcelain cheek, but halts before making contact, leaving a stretch of air between them. Aurelia presses forward, closing the inches. His caress is butterfly soft. “I must come back. Who else will keep you from trouble?” She doesn’t laugh at his weak attempt at levity, but curls her slim fingers around his, answering his unsaid feelings. A cold river of rain leaks under my collar. I force myself not to fidget. Come on, come on. He clears his throat and straightens, dropping his arm. She spins and grabs my hands. “Come back and teach me these fantastic things you know.” I bite back my antsiness. She’s a whole lot of Constantine with a sprinkle of his sister, Anna. I could like her. But first, I have to save her. Keep reading Shadow Boxer on Amazon. To download the first book in the series, Lightning Rider, for FREE.",

Alexander) (read on for a sample) Chapter One MY NAME IS EVIE PRESTON and I hang out with dead rock stars. Oh, and the occasional dead movie star or two. I’ve learned quite a bit about those who live on the other side over the past few months. For instance, they aren’t all ghostly and transparent. Oh no. The ones I see are almost always in full- color and 3-D except when they exert, ah...certain energies. Then they go a bit hazy. Oh, and they prefer to be called spirits. Yeah, I know...I sound completely insane. Like, “commit me” insane. But honestly, I am not crazy. Believe me, the first time I saw Bob Marley in my place (well, technically not my place, but I’ll get to that) in the Hollywood Hills, getting high and singing “Buffalo Soldier,” I thought I was either dreaming, hallucinating, or, yes, completely nuts. Thankfully, it was none of the above. In fact, Bob is a very real, very dead guy who likes to hang out with me, along with a handful of other deceased, famous rock musicians (and a few who never quite made the charts, one of whom I’ve recently developed feelings for—more about him later). So, not only do I hang out with dead rock stars, I also think I am in love with one, or at least in lust… which makes me totally screwed up. But I am not crazy. I swear. Before I go any further, though, I need to take you back a few months to the day after my twenty-eighth birthday. Welcome to Brady, Texas—population 5,500—and, according to the sign on the main road into town, “The Heart of Texas.” Truth be told, the signs were everywhere. Signs, that is, telling me to get the hell out of Brady. I was at Mrs. Betty LaRue’s place. Her house smelled of Tide, home cooking, and mothballs. Betty was comforting me over the dismal turnout of my Mary Kay presentation—my latest attempt at becoming an entrepreneur—which she’d kindly hosted. We were drinking apple-cranberry tea, with her Lhasa Apso, Princess, curled in a ball under Betty’s chair, and my dog (of indeterminate breed...possibly part-coyote and part-lab, with a dash of border collie in there), Mama Cass, across my feet. I loved how Betty always let me bring Cass in the house. My dog went everywhere with me, but not everyone was as gracious about her presence as Betty. “I really thought this would go much better,” I said, bringing the warm cup of tea to my lips. Betty smiled sympathetically, the fine lines in her eighty- something face creasing deeper into her skin, “Oh, honey, I don’t know what happened to my girls today. I am so sorry. I thought there’d be at least ten of us. They all love my snickerdoodles. But you know how some of us old gals are; we forget things.” She twirled a yellow-white wisp of curled hair around her finger. The rest of it was pulled up into a loose bun (or chignon as Mama calls it). She’d obviously been in to see my mother that morning for her weekly hair appointment. I nodded. “It’s okay, Betty. Thanks for hosting anyway, and the cookies were delicious. Three isn’t such a bad turnout.” Thing was, only Betty bought anything. Her friends, Margaret and Hazel, came for the cookies and samples. “And I made about ten dollars, so that will buy me a couple of meals. You’ll love that anti-wrinkle cream, by the way.” Betty ran a hand over her face and laughed sweetly. “Child, ain’t nothing gonna work on this face now. And I’m proud of these lines. I earned them.” I laughed back. “So you only bought the cream because you felt sorry for me?” Cass’s ears perked up and she lifted her head to peer at me. Betty sighed. “Evie Preston, I have known you since you started kicking up a fuss in your mama’s belly.” She winked at me. “I’ve watched you try so hard to be exactly what your mama and daddy wanted, especially after all that bad business. And there was that unfortunate situation with—” She paused. “What was his name?” She brought her cup to her lips, her hand shaking ever so slightly. I sighed, knowing exactly what bad business she was referring to. As for the unfortunate situation, he was the star quarterback my senior year and the lucky recipient of my virginity. Sadly, he was also the jerk who then decided to share the news with the entire town. Thank God my mother was able to intercept that little tidbit before it reached my father’s ears. Betty waved her free hand in the air as if to brush the painful thoughts away. “I know you were hoping to be a good Texas girl and marry a good Texas boy and have babies and run a family like your folks did, not because you really wanted it,” she said, shaking a finger at me. “But because your parents wanted it for you. And now, my dear,” Betty leaned over and gave me one of her rare, stern looks. “It’s high time you stopped pretending and started living!” “What do you mean?” “You got a God-given talent. You need to get out there and do something with it.” She tried to set the tea cup down on the side table and almost missed. I grabbed it and set it down for her. Betty beamed at me. “Thank you, honey! Always so polite.” I looked down at my dog, licking the unpolished toes peeking out of the only pair of high-heeled sandals I owned. “Fact is, Betty, I know I’m good, but there are a lot of good musicians out there.” I dejectedly twirled the ends of my long, baby-fine hair. Mama always said God hadn’t been paying close attention when it came time to give me hair. It was stick straight, dark brown, and silky. I couldn’t do a darn thing with it, except put it into ponytails. Betty waved her hand again. “Nonsense!” Placing her hands on the sides of her chair, she slowly pushed herself up to a stand and ambled over to the white brick mantle. She grabbed an envelope and handed it to me. “What’s this?” I asked. “Your birthday was yesterday, wasn’t it?” “You remembered?” She frowned. “I may be old, Evie, but I don’t forget birthdays. Especially when they’re for people I care about.” “That is so sweet of you.” I was flattered and grateful someone seemed happy to have me around. “Oh honey, you know you’re one of my favorite people. You got spunk! Had it since you came out ass-backward, showing the world what you thought of it.” “Thank you, I think.” I couldn’t help smiling. Betty was the only one I knew who spoke the truth without holding back. She didn’t tiptoe around stuff like my family. Tiptoeing was what we did best. “Open it! I don’t have all day. It’s about time for my nap.” I tore open the envelope and found a check inside for five thousand dollars, made out to me. I gasped. “Betty! What...” Cass jumped up, her huge ears pricked forward, tail wagging, watching me like a hawk. “It’s okay, girl.” She lay back down but still alert. “I was twenty-eight once too, you know, and I had dreams...big dreams.” Betty’s blue eyes glazed over for a moment. “I wanted to be a movie star, and I could have, too. I was damn good, like you are at what you do, and, believe it or not, I used to be good looking.” She winked at me again, but there were tears in her eyes. I knew about Betty’s dreams from long ago. I also knew there was a part of her life that hadn’t been so good. “But then my folks, like yours, had other ideas and I decided to play by their rules. I don’t regret it...well, maybe I do a little. Thing is, young lady, you can sing like a nightingale and you can play the guitar like nobody’s business. You need to get the hell out of this town before you wind up like every other girl here—knocked up, changing dirty diapers, and cleaning up after some idiot male who spends his nights with a beer in one hand and a TV remote in the other.” I frowned. I’d already seen almost every girl from my high school graduating class living the life Betty had just described. The lucky ones skipped town and went to college. I hadn’t been quite that lucky for a variety of reasons. I had the grades and the desire, but life had other ideas. On the positive side, which is where I like to go, I’d at least not had the misfortune of marrying some guy who didn’t appreciate me, expected his dinner on the table when he got home from his shift at Walmart, and wanted his wife and children to obey, just because he said so. “Betty, I really do appreciate your vote of confidence but still, I can’t accept this.” I held the check towards her. “Yes, you can, and you will. Go live your life, Evie Preston. Pack up that van of yours, your guitar, and Mama Cass, and head west. You sing your heart out in every bar, every café, every church—I don’t care where you go, but go and sing. I know one thing: you have what it takes to be a star. Forget all about them cosmetics you’re trying to pawn . . .” “Mary Kay,” I interrupted. “It is a really good line. Mama swears by it.” She frowned and waved that hand at me. “Just forget all that, because you and I both know it won’t get you nowhere. That kind of thing is for people like Shirley Swan up the road trying to make an extra buck to take care of those four kids of hers. Take the money, cut your losses, and run. You gotta stop living for your mama and daddy. You didn’t cause what happened and you can’t never change it.” She shook her head vehemently. “Go on and live life. Do it for me. Humor an old woman, please?” Her blue eyes watered, the creases crinkling as she choked back emotion. How could I refuse after a plea like that? I tried one last time, for the sake of courtesy. “But my daddy—” Betty dabbed at her eyes with a kerchief. “He’ll get over it. And your mama is gonna secretly be cheering you on. It’ll be hard on them, but this’ll be the best thing for all of you.” She sighed heavily. “Especially you, Evie. Trust me.” So I did. I trusted Betty LaRue. The next day I packed up my 1974 VW bus, a suitcase of clothes, my Rosewood Gibson acoustic guitar, and Mama Cass. I pulled out of my parents’ driveway while Daddy waved his arms wildly in the air, yelling, “You’re gonna ruin your life out there, Evangeline!” (He’s the only one who ever calls me by my full name.) “Los Angeles isn’t the city of angels. It’s a city of heathens and devils!” I knew he was just scared. I’m pretty sure if I looked closer, I’d see tears in his eyes. But Betty was right. This was something I had to do. I could see tears for sure in my mother’s big hazel eyes, the same color as my own, as she mouthed, “I love you.” I rolled down the window, choking back my own sobs. “I love you, too! I’ll call. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.” With blurred eyes, Mama Cass’s head in my lap, a Patsy Cline cassette in the tape deck (thank God for eBay—you have no idea how hard it is to find cassette tapes these days), I headed west to the City of Angels. For the first time in sixteen years, I felt like I could finally breathe again. I was leaving behind the only two people I knew who I had never been able to heal even a little bit, and I didn’t think I ever could. Chapter Two I AM NOT A REBEL by nature. Or who knows...maybe I am. Regardless, it’s never really been an option for me. Not after what my parents went through. I could never yell, lie, sneak out of the house, or talk back. None of that. And those weren’t their rules; they were my own. So leaving my mother and father behind on that late April afternoon was by far the most rebellious thing I had ever done in my twenty-eight years, and honestly, it left me feeling cold. Poor Cass with her thick coat must have hated me on that fifteen hundred mile trip, because I was freezing the whole way and cranked up the heater in my van, even as we drove through Arizona’s hot, desert climate. It was the kind of cold you can feel on the inside—that only a real hot bath combined with a hot drink and a tuck between the covers can cure. I wasn’t sick. No sore throat. No aching body. Nothing like that. I was just cold. And then, after three days of driving and staying in cheap motels, I took the 10 West all the way to L.A., and the chill left as suddenly and mysteriously as it had arrived. The first thing I did was head to the ocean—Venice Beach to be exact. Yes, Los Angeles has plenty of tan, beautiful people and then some, but let me just say for the record, there are also a ton of freaks here, especially in Venice Beach. I saw one guy with hair the color of mashed peas that hung down to his rear in twisted, greasy ropes. He wasn’t wearing a shirt and the waistband of his shorts sat well beneath his boxers. Not an attractive look, especially considering the live iguana wrapped around his neck. Never seen that before. Cass went totally berserk, yapping at him and the lizard. I had to yank pretty hard on her leash to get her to move while the guy snarled, “Get your mangy piece of shit mutt outta my face, dude!” Um, excuse me? At least my dog takes regular baths, which is certainly more than I could say about Mr. Mange and his lizard sidekick. I decided to keep my mouth shut and move along, tugging on Cass the entire way. I made an effort to give him as wide a berth as possible, not wanting to accidentally brush against him and deal with the onslaught of negative emotions that would happen as a result. Okay. I guess it’s probably time I let this particular cat out of the bag. See the thing is, when I turned twelve, my parents and I went through some tough times. And ever since, I’ve been able to get information about people through touch. But not just any information—traumatic, painful information. Caught your husband of thirty years sleeping with your best friend? Lost your mom in a car accident when you were a teen? Well, if you and I have come into contact before, chances are, I already know all about it. But that’s not all. I can also help ease the pain...give people a permanent Band-Aid to slap on that painful memory. I can’t make the pain disappear, but I sure can help you to cope with it, minus years of therapy or self-medication. Sounds great, right? Well, have you ever paid attention to just how many times a day you touch someone? At the supermarket, at the salon, at a restaurant...it happens all the time, and you’re mostly not aware of it at all. I’ve had to train myself to be extra focused on where I am and who’s around me in order to cope. Truth be told, I’m pretty cautious who I touch these days, and I also make a conscious effort to put some kind of barrier in place (gloves, mittens, napkins, whatever’s handy) if I know there’s a chance my hands might brush up against another person, because it is my hands that tend to be the main conductor of this gift. If my hands touch someone else, particularly their hands, that is when I get the clearest visions. I’d receive some information if someone were to bump against me, but the touching of hands is what I am most aware of. Betty LaRue was one of the first people I “read.” It happened at Easter, sixteen years ago, when I took her hand to show her the new kitten Mama brought home for me (another gift meant to help me deal with our recent loss). All I got were glimpses—of a much younger Betty and the baby she lost when she was only seventeen, courtesy of a pregnancy caused by a boyfriend who didn’t take no for an answer one night—and they scared the hell out of me. In any case, touching people like Cranky Dreadlock Man was simply not an option for me. No telling what sorts of nasty images I’d pick up from him. Once we got past him, we reached the ocean. Color—silvery blue. Smell—fresh and salty—minus the cigarette smoke and sickly sweet scent of tanning oil that occasionally wafted its way toward us. The crashing waves and sandy beach were like something from a postcard. Cass and I people-watched for some time. Cheapest entertainment in the world. Bring a lawn chair, a bag of Tostitos, and a six-pack of soda, and you’ll find the movies have nothing on Venice Beach. When I need to get away from anyone famous—dead or alive—I head there. And I figure, the best way to beat crazy is to go and see even more crazy. Cass and I shared a couple slices of pizza and a Coke (yes, Cass drinks Coke, too, but none of that diet stuff), and I decided we needed to find a place to stay for the night. And then I needed to find a job. I knew five thousand dollars was probably not going to get us very far in the land of glitz and glamour. I found a motel a few blocks from the beach. It was fifty-five bucks for the night, which seemed like a lot. But we were tired, and I thought being close to the ocean might be cool, because I could take Cass for a walk in the morning. Problem was, they had a “no pets” policy. “You gotta stay in the bus, girl,” I told her. She thumped her tail slightly and looked at me with her big, dark eyes. I whispered in her ear, “Only for a little bit. Soon as the coast is clear, I’ll come get you.” She thumped her tail even harder. I may sound a bit biased here, but Cass is the smartest dog ever. “You be a good girl, and I’ll be back.” And I was, after a shower and a change of clothes. I snuck my half-coyote, half-lab, possibly some border collie pooch into the dingy motel room that smelled of stale cigarettes, bug spray, and mildew. She jumped on the bed with me and we fell fast asleep. The Dead Celeb is available at: Amazon Kindle and Amazon UK Paperback * Audio Book Also available: Shadow Boxer Alterations, Book 2 By Jen Greyson (read on for a sample) Chapter One Based on the last two, I’m getting an increasingly bad taste for Tuesdays. “Damn.” I grind my teeth as the needle stitches color onto my right shoulder blade. Brin rakes a paper towel across the bloody area and slathers Vaseline over my new tattoo. “Wanna see?” I press my shirt over my boobs and hop off the chair. The ache in my back radiates through my entire arm, but I peer over my shoulder at my reflection and his impromptu handiwork. High on my right shoulder blade, he’s painted a vibrant orange-yellow sun with a crescent moon piercing the bottom, and eight long strands of lightning radiating outward in feathery bolts. Day blurs into night and back again, held together by nothing more than lightning. A perfect illustration of time’s chaotic movement for me. I gingerly pull my shirt on. “Nice.” One-word answers are enough here. I’m not capable of much else. “Eighty bucks work?” I dig in my front pocket for a crumpled hundred. My waistband slides over my hip and I grimace at how much weight I’ve lost. I don’t like being this skinny. I want my curves back. Brin takes the cash, enveloping my hands between both of his. “Merry Christmas, Evy. You have plans?” I force my gaze to stay steady, though I wince inside. “Dinner with the folks.” “Cool.” He lets me go and taps the cash register, popping open the drawer. I wave away his money. “Keep it.” He jams the bill into the drawer and hums “Jingle Bells.” “Thanks, babe. Don’t be such a stranger.” I test a smile and fight the burn stinging my eyes. “Thanks for fitting me in. Tell Tasha we need to go out for a drink.” He walks me to the door and holds it open. “She’d like that.” Back in Papi’s truck, I roll my shoulders. Even though some of the tension is gone, I still fight to stay above water. Please let this get easier. I’m going to run out of skin if this is how I have to unload the stress of an arc every time. A snow-covered Accord slides toward my bumper and I brace for the impact, but the driver gains control at the last second and waves in apology. She grins, buoyed by the Christmas packages piled high in the back of her car. I manage to lift my hand in forgiveness. If only the rest of my problems were that easy. I shift Papi’s truck into drive and pull out of the snowy parking lot, grateful he didn’t let me take my bike. I know he’s worried about me, but I don’t know how to reassure him—or if I even can. Not that he’s faring much better than I am, but at least he’s had a couple months to come to grips with what we are. Lightning leaps from my fingertips and rings the gearshift. Another bolt races around the steering wheel. My heartbeat steadies and my chest expands with a calming fullness. I need to play with it again. Nothing else can get me balanced and centered like my lightning. My throat tightens and I fight the flood of memories. Empty streets guide me home, but as I pass each driveway overflowing with visitors settling in for the long holiday weekend, the stiffness returns to my shoulders. I suppose I need to decide where I’m going to spend it as well. Someone’s shoveled my driveway, and I park between the small mounds of snow. It’s weird to be back here in my own house. I’ve spent what feels like months between Papi’s house and ancient Spain. Everything here is so . . . normal. Bamboo floors gleam, the stainless-steel kitchen is unused as ever, and the couch and gadgets remain untouched. I pace the length of my living room. The plan Papi and I formed earlier disintegrates as quickly as I try to recall the details. It seemed so easy and simple while we talked through saving Aurelia and then rescuing Penya. I pull a blue strand of lightning from my middle finger and twist it around my hand, covering and uncovering my fingers. That’s not the right order. Penya’s abduction weighs on me, but not just because I failed to save her in the forest. That whole situation doesn’t feel right. The longer I wait to save her, the more chances of something going wrong. She thinks Aurelia is important—and I completely agree—but leaving Penya to Ilif’s mercy until I save Aurelia makes me uneasy. The lightning jumps and pops around my hand. I close my eyes and inhale, drawing the cord of light out and back in a slow rhythm. When my mind empties and the unease quiets, I snuff the lightning and return to my living room. Badly as I want to leave this decision up to someone else, I need to decide between the two. Time travel should not be this hard. In a perfect world, I could stop time and do both. Ilif is both the wild card and the ultimate pain in my ass. My shoulders sag and I run a hand over my braid. It’s crusted and beyond grunge. I have no idea the last time I washed it—a week ago, a month? Time holds no meaning for me anymore. I growl and shake my arms. “Snap out of this, Evy! Do something. Anything!” A shower will help me sort things out. Right now any movement is progress. I toe my boots off and pad across the floor to the bathroom. Even the opulence of my simple place is jarring. I twist the knob on the shower and peel my T-shirt off, wincing at the new soreness on my back and the days-old scrape on my forearm. The one Constantine gave me. Tears burn the back of my eyes, and I swallow and scramble to get myself under control. We knew it was an impossible situation. We knew a relationship wouldn’t work. As I shimmy out of my pants, my fingers brush the bruise on my hip where he had me pressed against the rock wall of his bedroom while my naked limbs entwined with his. I can’t hold the sob anymore. It bursts free in a tortured wail. My hand flies to my lips and I bite my fist. No falling apart. Even though I gave myself permission to do it once I was alone, this is no time for a meltdown. Only a few hours until Christmas dinner, and I need days to purge all this. I grip the edge of the sink and lean over the marble countertop, avoiding my image in the mirror. My braid slithers over my shoulder like his fingers across my skin. I squeeze my eyes shut and block everything. Bolts absentmindedly extend from my hands. They skitter across the counter and retract like an electric yo-yo. I force a breath into my lungs and hold it then let it seep out. The exhale shakes as it leaves my lips, but I calm, even if just a small amount. On trembling legs, I turn toward the shower and check the water temperature. I slip my fingers beneath the waistband of my boy shorts— Thunk. Something hits the closed door. I freeze. It can’t be Ilif. Not yet. Not here. I hold my breath. Straining for any sound, any indication of which stranger prowls my hallway. Ilif doesn’t know where I live. He’s never been here, but who knows what kind of tracking software he uses to monitor me now. If he’s using Penya to compensate for his shortcomings, he could go anywhere . . . even here. I force air from my lungs before I hyperventilate. I’m a warrior and need to effing act like one. Down the hallway, the floor creaks, but the silence stretches too long for a footstep. I press myself against the door and listen again. Nothing. Steam curls above my head and against the ceiling, swirling and billowing in white clouds. I flick the light off and let my eyes adjust then curl my fingers around the doorknob and twist, concentrating on silence, drawing on all the warrior stealth Constantine taught me. The steam sneaks out before me, my lookout. Tendrils of lightning crisscross my palms. Tensed for battle, I take one big breath and sweep into the hall, silent on bare feet. Something hard strikes my foot and I stumble. Instinctively, I tuck and lean into the momentum. With a roll and twist so I can see my attacker, I come up on one knee, hands splayed with thick bolts of lightning leaping from my palms. Snapping white bolts extend all the way past the bathroom door. The hallway looms empty except for a strange, small book propped against the doorframe. I ease toward it, ready for whoever left it. My ragged breathing and the crackle of electricity are the only noises. Standing, I retract my lightning. I like that my reaction time is getting better. I suppose attacking a book isn’t exactly the right response, but I’d rather be ready than dead. Not that Ilif would kill me . . . but then again, I’m not one hundred percent positive he wouldn’t. I march to the stairs and peer over the railing. Nothing moves. Returning to the book, I crouch and poke at it, but as far as I can tell, it’s exactly what it seems. A leather thong holds the worn cover closed. Deep grooves carve the front, and the edges are worn with what I imagine must have been constant use to make the leather so light. I rub my hand over the smooth surface to wipe away a fine layer of dust then turn it over and examine the back. There’s no writing or anything. No one sneaks into a house, drops off an old book, and leaves. Whoever left this is coming back. Cold fingers of ice trace my spine. Coming to harm or to help. With my luck lately, my money isn’t on help. I tuck the book beneath my arm and turn off the shower. Silence. Still half-naked, I creep upstairs, but all the rooms are empty. Downstairs is the same. I don’t get it. Taking a breath, I relax. It’s no good for me to stay wound this tight. I need to chill until they face me. Nothing I can do until then. I retrace my steps and burrow into the corner of the couch, tucking my feet beneath me. I undo the book’s strap and ease the cover open. Hard slashes of script mark the page, punching me in the gut and yanking me instantly to another place. My fingers trace the letters, recognizing the handwriting from a map drawn nearly two thousand years ago while I stood next to him. If this is someone’s idea of a joke, it’s beyond brutal. I see him bent over this book, pouring out thoughts, dreams, plans . . . A sob wrenches from my throat, but I choke it down before it breaks completely free. My lips tremble and I bite them hard until my breathing slows. I try again. On the page, the words shift from Latin to English. Aurelia mortuus est hodie. They blur, and I wipe my eyes and spread the tears on my bare thigh in a long, wet streak. When I begin again, the rich timbre of Constantine’s voice carries the words to my heart. Aurelia died today. Without me there to save her. She died alone while I busied away the day on trifles of war. A mystery flood carried her away from me forever. Such pain. I am without breath. My grief threatens to consume me. To kill me. Oh, I wish it could. I would die in a flame of grief if it could take away this pain. My sweet Aurelia is gone. Gone, not to a husband I could choose, but to a lover who stole her from me without warning or apology. My heart twists until I can’t breathe, but I force myself to keep reading. I flip a chunk of pages to another entry, months later... I relive the morning of her journey again and again. I search my memory for some indicator of the storm, but I find nothing. I remember her face that morning, her jubilation to visit her friends . . . her laughter. I hear it, chasing me through the halls. She calls to me from the grave, beckons me to come and play. This life needs me for something, though I know not what. I can feel it like an abrasion under my finger, for it is the only other feeling I have beyond my pain. I tire of this grief. Would that I could take my sword to it. I miss her. I miss her so. My hands drop and the pages fan closed in a cascade of sorrow. There’s more, but I can’t bear another word. Every page is full. When we were together, he brushed the edge of his misery with me, but not like this. I didn’t know . . . “Oh, Constantine.” I close my eyes and relive the aching horror when we saw a glimpse of her. In that split second I got a clue about how losing her devastated him, but somehow, seeing such emotion in his own hand . . . It kills me. Our time together was so short. My chest constricts. Even if we’d had the time, he wouldn’t have shared this. To expose this much vulnerability would have been a weakness. And now Penya wants me to find Aurelia and save her before he has to go through this. Eradicate all of this sorrow and pain from his life. And change the man I know . . . I correct myself, the man I thought I knew. My fingers hover above the pages then curl into a fist. To prevent this, I’d do anything. With a sigh, I let my head drop back against the couch. My fingers drift to the pages and across each indentation of his words. There has to be more to Aurelia’s story. Either Penya isn’t telling me the whole story or she doesn’t know. Ancestor to a famous scientist, sure, but who will she be? A mother, a wife . . . I can’t accept that she’s nothing more than an incubator for greatness. My thoughts drift, bouncing and floating from one to another. Drowsy from the emotional beating, it takes me a minute to realize the bright column of light shining in the middle of the room isn’t coming from a window. Silvery and cylindrical, it slowly rotates counterclockwise—I jerk upright—like last time she visited after the kidnapping. “Penya!” I dive off the couch and kneel beside the emerging shape. It morphs and shifts into her short, earthy silhouette. Though she’s transparent and some sort of projection, I can make out all her features, but nothing about where she is. I lean closer. “Where are you? You still haven’t told me how you’re projecting your image here.” Her face falls and she glances over her shoulder, waving my question away with a violent swat. My hands fly to cover my mouth. I didn’t think about someone hearing me on her side. After listening for something I can’t see, she turns back then spots the journal on the couch behind me and clasps her hands together. “Good, good.” Her voice sounds far away, like she’s standing at the end of a tunnel. “I was not certain the journal would travel without me.” “You left it?” “Who else? Ilif will not help you. He has almost figured out Aurelia’s connection. You must complete the alteration now.” “Her connection? What does that mean? Like her connection to Constantine? And it’s Christmas. I have a family dinner in four hours.” “I have no time to explain, and you will return in time.” I bristle. “You don’t know that. Last time cost me six months.” “You must risk it. If Ilif gets to her first . . .” She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. “Go now. There is no time to lose.” I grind my teeth and point at her chest. “Not this time. You’re not leaving me in the dark again. Where are you? How do I get to you?” “Ilif’s new lab is all I know—” I cross my arms. “Okay, about that. You guys worked together? Didn’t you think that was worth mentioning?” She glances behind her again and lowers her voice until I can hardly hear her. “It was long ago. We have no time for this, Evy.” “No. Not a long time ago. In my future!” I don’t know when I’m going to see her again, and I need this information. She sighs. “Yes, your future.” “How are you traveling? You’re here, but you’re not, just like in the forest. What did he do to you?” “This is why you must hurry. He is developing new methods of travel. Aurelia’s sudden death wiped out an entire line of scientists. Ones he needed.” So much information . . . I squeeze my eyes shut. Think, Evy. Ask the right questions. “What is Ilif working on?” Her image leans closer. “I do not know. I promise I do not. But you are strong enough to handle the answers this time. I promise you will know everything as I do.” My lightning flickers at her praise. “I will learn more. He leaves me for days at a time—but there may be stretches when I cannot get to you. I must go.” “Wait!” I press forward, grinding my knees into the bamboo floorboards. “What time are you in right now—when are you?” “I have not pinpointed an exact date. Same with our location. To say Ilif put a good deal of thought into this lab is an understatement. When I do get to wander, it is fully contained and he does not permit me beyond the building.” “Then how are you traveling?” “I used the tracking software to locate you and project this image, but otherwise, my physical form is captive. I also think he found a way to block certain places from arcs, starting with this one.” “I’ll find you.” My heart tightens at the thought of losing her. She’s the only one who ever seems to be on my side. “I am your smallest problem. Worry for Aurelia. You must save her before Ilif interferes. Your alterations are different enough that he cannot manipulate them, but it is only a matter of time. And his determination is endless. Aurelia is too important. Whatever he is working on centers around her. You must get to her first.” My empty gut clenches. “No pressure.” Her head jerks to the right and she watches something in her time that I can’t see. “Save Aurelia. Now.” A dangerous undertone in her whisper snakes a chill up my spine. She vanishes. “Penya!” My hand grasps air, and I press my fist against my forehead. Dammit. There are so many reasons I don’t want to go right now. A night in my own bed would be nice . . . I’m at least taking a shower before I go. Dread seeps through my bones and I stand. While I’d love to join in her optimism, my arcs don’t work like that. I’ll be lucky to get back here today, let alone before dinner. The soles of my feet stick to the wood floor, smacking loudly as I return to the bathroom and start the shower. After dropping my panties, I step under the spray and unbraid my hair. Dark strands cling to my fingers. As I rinse them down the drain, my mind is consumed with what’s coming. This time will be different. This time I’m knowingly trying to alter history. There is so much uncertainty at the beginning of an alteration. I never know what intersection of someone’s life is the perfect point for me to change things . . . where we’ll meet . . . who will be there. Or in this case, if a certain someone will be there. Vanilla infuses the steam as I squirt bodywash into my palm and lather up. My shoulders are fuller and there’s muscle beneath my curves. I ignore what the new shape of my arms means and quickly soap my chest—no danger of those getting muscley—then race across my flatter stomach and over my full hips. I’m surprised that the training with Constantine would have such an effect on me so soon, and I definitely don’t want to look like he does. I liked my soft curves. I miss them. Shampoo slides in soapy tracks down my face, and I turn into the hot water and refocus. Ilif is still the biggest uncertainty, precariously balanced between bad guy and worst co-worker on the face of Earth. No chance he’s lightened up on his feelings about females, and since I’m still wearing a set of boobs, we’re at an impasse. No way I trust his recent crazy-train flip-flop—he wanted to use me. I towel off and head upstairs to my bedroom. A pair of chocolate-brown leather pants are still folded on the end of my bed, but as I slip my fingers beneath the buttery softness, I pause. Finding Aurelia while she’s still alive puts me pre-149 BC, and I know she died in Rome. I toss my pants back on the bed and scout the closet for something less barbaric. The only skirt I have is from someone’s funeral, a pinstriped black number with a slit up the back, not exactly something I can traipse about in ancient Rome. I finger the top rack, letting my hand travel across my long-sleeved tees, my cashmere sweaters . . . at least now the juxtaposition of my wardrobe makes more sense. I’m not meant to live in one time period. Time traveler or no, nothing here will work. Last time, Constantine’s sister, Anna, made me the greatest wardrobe ever. I miss those clothes. Maybe if I get better at arcing I’ll figure out how to bring stuff home with me. For now, it’s incredibly annoying, so I resort to the leather pants, a matched set of baby-blue bra and panties, and a seaweed-green tee. With leather motorcycle boots and wet, braided hair, I stride back to the living room and stand in Penya’s empty spot. The journal mocks me. I pick it up and close it tightly then tuck it in the back of my pants. I inhale and quit stalling. Arms relaxed, palms open, I let go of everything else and let the lightning come. White bolts spark from my fingertips, writhing and crackling against each other, slipping backward over my elbow and stretching toward the floor. With deliberate slowness, I bring my hands together until they’re eight inches apart. Attraction pulls the bolts together into an electric ball. I picture Aurelia, her spirit, her love of life and of friends, and her willfulness. Black arms of nothingness open wide and embrace me in an all-consuming possession. I am deaf, blind, and mute. And for once, my heart doesn’t hurt. Chapter Two I arrive in Rome on the wings of sunrise. Wisps of an orange and pink sky bleed into morning blue, and the sun shines bright from the east, already warming the dry air. Over rooftops, grand buildings rise in the distance, oddly pristine and unfamiliar. My shoulders relax and I take the first deep breath of the week. This is going to be a cinch—no rain, no flood. Hopefully I can get in and out without a single issue. Pride puffs up my chest. I’m getting good at this. In front of me, tall box elms create an impenetrable wall around a home’s garden and repeat again near what looks like a rear entry into the house. Hand-painted and etched pots overflow with bright blossoms. Clusters of them dot the space and cuddle up to several benches scattered throughout the garden. Beyond the lazy floating butterflies and working bees, the garden is silent and empty. Everyone must still be inside this morning. I hesitate and scan the entire back wall of the house, not sure I can sneak in without being seen—especially if my plan is to keep Aurelia from leaving. I step forward and a familiar blonde steps through the doorway, making me duck back behind a hedge. I’ve only seen Aurelia once before, but it must have been last week, because she looks the same. Curls held back by a gold braid frame a heart-shaped face, round with youthful pudginess. I slip behind a tall container bursting with tall, fluffy-headed grass so I can study her in secret. She’s barely as tall as I am and dressed in a simple tunic pinned at the shoulders with matching brooches. Turning to respond to a question, the curls spill down her back, stopping just short of the matching gold braid around her teeny waist. She skirts a narrow table and sits, smiling up at a servant as he sets a fruit plate and bread in front of her. “Aurelia?” I jerk toward the voice that haunts my dreams and try to dislodge my heart from my throat while I press deeper into the foliage. Greenery leans across my face, but I can still make out every single one of Constantine’s features as he comes outside. Golden eyes assess every possible threat and a youthful bunching of freckles dust his cheekbones. His demeanor changes and he scans the garden, pausing on my location. Aurelia looks up, but I can’t shift my attention off Constantine. While he stares intently at my etched clay planter, I curl my fingers around the lip and try to suck breath into my collapsed windpipe. Whenever I am, however long it will be until he touches me, his raw handsomeness makes all the wrong parts of my body take notice. Impossibly tall, Constantine is somewhere between the thick, wide warrior I first met, and the lean death machine who trained me to be the same. His dark blond curls are cut close to his head and his fingers twitch constantly. I wonder when he got that nervous tic under control. “Papa.” He snaps back to Aurelia and rubs the edge of his eyebrow. “Me paenitet. Ego vidi.” Sorry. I thought I saw something. Their Latin shifts in my head. I’m still not sure how that works, but I’ve stopped questioning. She lifts a small hand to his forearm. “You worry too much.” He smiles, and the sheer joy of it illuminates his entire face. I press my lips together and my heart finds a regular rhythm. “You don’t worry enough.” He sits on the adjacent bench. She nibbles a slice of fruit ad he plucks a slice of pear off the plate. “What time are you leaving?” “Rom is bringing the chariot this afternoon.” I sigh, and the gust makes the grass wave. About time I had an easy one. I loosen my grip on the planter and straighten. As soon as Constantine leaves, I’ll figure out how to stop her. He stands and rubs the back of his neck. He’s made that gesture a thousand times with me . . . something is bothering him, but he’s trying to hide it. I narrow my eyes and study each nuance of his body language, but even now he’s a master at secrecy. Unaware, Aurelia wipes her fingers, jumps up, and throws her arms around his waist. His eyes squeeze closed. I lean closer. He drops a quick kiss on her head and tucks his emotion away before she lets go. “I’ll be home in a week, Papa.” He straightens and clears his throat. “I’ll talk to Rom and ensure he’s readied everything. Though I don’t know why I bother. He worries about you more than I.” She bites her lip and a blush reddens her cheeks. If he notices, he doesn’t say anything but squeezes her shoulder, then returns to the house. Aurelia fidgets, straightens her belt, and trails in his wake. I want to run after him, make him remember me, tell him not to be such a jackass from the get-go so we can have more good moments. But I don’t because it won’t matter, because that time is over for me, even if it hasn’t yet come for him. Biting my lower lip, I step from behind the planter and creep toward the table, skirting a splashing fountain. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and I cringe. Constantine’s journal is warm against my back, and I pull it out. Keeping it will only make this harder after I’m gone. I lift it, press the leather against my lips in a silent goodbye, and set it next to Aurelia’s plate, fingers lingering for one last second. “Read this,” I whisper, and my throat tightens. “Remember me. Remember us.” Straightening my shoulders, I step toward the door. Light flashes to my left and I spin. Ilif’s image materializes next to the fountain and I leap behind the hedge near the door. Shit. Shit. Shit. That’s what I get for having a sentimental moment about Constantine. I should have grabbed Aurelia the second I could. If Ilif’s here, he’s obviously not into playing nice. He’s out to win. No chance. I separate the branches of the hedge and glare across the small yard. Dressed in a dark-brown suit today, that superfuck straightens his tie, aligning the blue and brown stripes with the horizon. The light-brown pattern on his shirt does nothing to enhance his translucent skin. Spindly fingers smooth the gray hair at his temples, making me smile at the amount now peppering his shiny black pompadour. When he’s artfully arranged his entire countenance enough to make me gag, he moves around the back of the fountain. Not a chance he’s going to get any closer to screwing this up. I burst through the hedge and splash through the basin, drawing a long rope of lightning between my outstretched arms as I race toward him. Errant strands leap from my hands and ricochet off the water. He jerks away, but not before his features contort with betrayal, quickly covering a trace of awe. Fueled by his rage, I flex my knees and lunge. He flickers and ducks, but I catch him in the side of the face with my right hand. He solidifies, and a triple fork of lightning erupts from the fountain as I flare my own. I wrap my arm around his neck, and a sharp pain spears the base of my spine as we disappear. Blackness rips him from my grasp and tumbles me backward. The pain ebbs as a high afternoon sun blinds me. I crouch and search the flat white landscape for that scuttling cockroach, Ilif, but there’s only me. In the distance, mountains rise from the glaring expanse of nothing. I pinch the white dirt. It’s crusty and coarse. Straightening, I study the horizon again and frown. I’m on either the Salt Flats near home in Utah or an alien planet. Okay, so this is new. Like I need more things to figure out. I prod the muscles of my back, trying to recreate the pain, but fail. I twist and lift my shirt. No wound, not even a red mark. Whatever that weirdness was in Rome, the arc healed it. Even so, something made my lightning go haywire. All that should have happened was that my lightning created interference so it was impossible for Ilif to stay. At least that’s how it worked last time. So where is he? And where am I? This is a disaster. Just when I have a small grasp on my lightning and how it works—or at least the arcing part, I find another new component. This is such bullshit. I rub my forehead and focus on the Ilif part for now. When we were in Spain and I used my lightning, I never bothered to figure out where the interference caused him to go. All I cared was that he wasn’t with me anymore. I’m not sure if he goes back to the same place every time, or if I’ve screwed up his life enough to keep him busy. That would be too handy . . . so, no. I need to expect him back at Aurelia’s side any moment. With another quick look around at the barren plains, I open my hands and fill them with twin balls of lightning. Blackness holds me only briefly, and the silence of the salt morphs into the roar of water. Color and the pungency of wetlands surround me as heat and sunlight become misting droplets of rain beneath a gray sky that I recognize instantly. The river is louder than when Constantine and I arced here after Aurelia’s death. I’m at the same narrow section, flanked on either side by thick trees that make it impossible to see upstream past the sharp bend to the right. Easy to see how people could get lured into a false sense of security. The river looks peaceful, especially since the changing landscape works as a distraction. An uneasy lump forms in my stomach, and I pull a strand of lightning from my fingertips and slowly tease it longer then let it snap back and repeat the motion while I scan for something sinister. Downstream, the trees fade quickly into reeds as the ground becomes smooth clay. The bank is sloping and beachy. A nice contrast to the cliffs and rocks at the bend beneath the tree roots, enough to make someone forget they’re basically standing in a tight canyon. People die like that every year back home, trapped in narrow canyons when the rainwater comes. Though nothing looks obviously out of place or deadly, the tall walls will make escape impossible—just like home. I snuff my lightning. Twenty feet farther downriver stands an arched bridge. Thick with a short railing, it spans the water in a wide curve with massive supports of stone rising from the water. Roman architecture doesn’t skimp, and even here their brilliance shines through. There’s a dirt road leading up to it, but the reeds obscure parts from where I am. The cramping is back in my stomach. I tug at my collar as raindrops slip beneath the cotton fabric of my shirt. No time to whine about the weather, I push through the reeds and stop at the edge of the road. Travelers wander along, warily skirting me and averting their gazes. Long, deserted silences stretch between the large groups as they hurry through the light rain. If I’ve landed here now, that can only mean Aurelia’s chariot will come around the corner within the next few minutes. I need to quit with the sightseeing and make a plan that will convince her she can’t cross the river. I wince and bite my lip. If her driver is more protective than Constantine, he’s not going to be an easy sell. As the road twists away from the river, wide expanses of barren soil flank both sides. The reeds are confined to a few feet next to the river, but otherwise, short, brittle grass grows in patches. Hugging the road’s left side, a wide hill slopes gently upward a good twenty feet, at least enough to get us out of immediate harm. It’s topped with a group of trees that flow down the side, hop the road, and continue on a parallel path to the river. Though there isn’t an actual road to the top, the grass won’t be tough to navigate. When I was here with Constantine, I realized horses are just ancient four-wheelers, so a half-decent charioteer shouldn’t have an issue, and I’m positive Constantine wouldn’t entrust Aurelia to a novice. I jam my fists into my hips and scowl at the horizon. There has to be a reasonable way to get Aurelia and her driver off the main road and climbing up a random hill. An occasional shrub dots the landscape, but nothing that can help me divert the chariot’s path. The most obvious plan is to use my lightning to scare everyone away, but I don’t trust the reaction. If I stand in the middle of the road and play the sorceress, odds are good the charioteer will just drive around me, probably with spit and well-deserved curse—most definitely a sword aimed at my head—all while inciting a complete panic and speeding Aurelia to her death. Saving that option for last. Thunder rumbles in the distance and the edges of the clouds darken. More pedestrians hurry along the road, and I study their paths to see if that helps me at all. They stay to the confines of the road for the most part, but big groups spread into wide swaths and overflow the road into the short grass. I glance over my shoulder at the racing water. I swear it’s moving faster. A few more inches of reeds are beneath the surface now. Penya’s flickering light spears the dirt next to me and I jump sideways. “Where have you been?” I wipe my hands on my pants. “Ilif was at Aurelia’s. I tried to flare my lightning to get him out, but it flung me to the Salt Flats. What’s that all about?” “Possibly his attempts to tamper with the arc. I told you he was close, and that is why we cannot waste time trying to get me out of here. Not yet. Save Aurelia. What have you figured out?” I rub the end of my braid across my lips. “Nothing yet. It’s not like I can flag her down and ask her to please wait by the side of the road.” “Why not?” I flounder, opening and closing my mouth while my brain tries to compute a snappy retort. A raindrop slips off my lip and onto my tongue. “Stop making life so difficult. Simplicity is key.” She moves closer. “Life is the same, Evy. Yet you doubt.” She sighs and reaches for me. Her face softens and her eyes betray a pride she hasn’t revealed before now. “Life is not this complicated series of tests and struggles you seem to imagine. It is meant to be lived, not endured. How many of the struggles in your life have you created? Stop inventing obstacles. Stop making arcing harder than it has to be. Your alterations will continue to be massive complications if you do not start looking past the impossible.” I shudder and my heartbeat hammers against my breastbone. Easy for her to say. Thunder cracks, and the center of a storm cloud to the west starts a clockwise rotation. My shirt is soaked through at the shoulders now. I inhale and consider all the possibilities. Behind my lids I envision my goal. There has to be a way to get Aurelia safe. A simple way. “I can arc her.” Penya’s swift inhale isn’t encouraging. “Simple, I said.” “Work with me here.” “Not without preparation,” she says. “I spent months with Constantine working on it, and then you prepared him well for the actual moment he traveled. Even with your disaster in the glen, he had been readied.” “But it worked. I just need to get her out of here. I’m not teaching her to travel, so I can just grab her like I did in the glen, right? I even arced the horse, so surely I can arc a girl. I’m talking about when I arced him with my lightning—not when he traveled on his own. If she uses mine, won’t it work the same way?” In what I’d come to know as her you’re-going-to-be-the-death-of-me gesture, Penya taps her index finger against her lips. I cross my arms. “You said anyone could time travel.” “Yes, but under reasonable circumstances. By trying it here, you risk much. Arcing a virgin traveler must be your last resort. And you must move with her, like Constantine.” “How much prep does she need?” “She is Constantine’s, which leads me to believe she will need less than most, but still . . .” “I’ll try to get them to stop, but—” She jerks toward something over my shoulder and disappears. I spin. A chariot crests the small hill with Aurelia in it beside a towering black man. Behind me, Penya’s voice carries down a long tunnel. “Think of all possibilities. Do not disregard what seems impossible. There is no impossible. Not for you.” I flinch. Splashes of water spray behind Aurelia’s chariot. At this pace, I have minutes. Don’t disregard what seems impossible, Penya said. Well, that’s about everything. Not a lot of ways to stop a chariot. All I have is a lot of lightning, and maybe a little luck. They’re forced to slow behind a large group clogging the road. I glance behind me. The river has risen to cover at least another foot of reeds. They would have been up and over the bridge without this latest delay. Less than a mile separates me from the chariot. Impossible. Unless I arc there. “Too reckless,” I say to the damp air. Any arc I try between now and the alteration costs me. Each one will jump time forward and pull me closer to her death. And considering I’ve only managed to hit my target once out of all the times I’ve arced, this is not my best idea. Never mind that this time I’m trying to hit a moving one and not kill or maim anybody. My heart pounds, nearly deafening me to every other sound. Thunder rumbles, and a blanket of humidity drops from the sky. I can taste the moisture. I have to try, even if the next one leaves me only seconds. At the hint of request, twin snakes of lightning tumble from my palms and darkness blinds me. I land ten feet behind the chariot and scare an old woman carrying a basket of greens. She screams and runs away, cursing about gods and their storm. I arc back to my starting point, jumping me forward ten seconds. Now I have less than a quarter mile to get this right, and my aim is worse than usual. I compress another ball, keeping it tight against my belly. This time when I land, the chariot wheel skims my shin and Aurelia’s startled face whips backward as she goes by. The driver flicks the reins, and the horse surges through the crowd then slows hard in a bottleneck. Last chance. No more errors. I focus every particle of thought on the horse, on feeling its warm skin beneath my hands, short slick bay coat beneath my palms. I picture weaving the wiry mane through my fingers, feeling the harness bounce beneath me. Lightning flares into an egg shape and stretches into a jagged square. I scowl and force it into a normal ball and arc before it changes again. My feet slip on the sweaty leather as I land on the horse’s back. Crap. Too much movement. I yelp like a sissy and fall forward onto the horse’s neck. Frantic, I grab a handful of mane, push up into a half crouch, and squint through the pelting rain. Since I can barely ride a horse with a saddle, I’m not sure why I thought this was a doable idea. I dig the toes of my boots under the wet harness across the base of its neck and situate myself. The horse surges ahead and bucks, not happy about me, I’m sure. I crouch lower, drop a knee to the middle of the horse’s bouncing back, and twist around. The reins hang loose in the driver’s hand, and his mouth is frozen in shock. Aurelia peeks under his outstretched arm, more curious than scared. Taking advantage of the slack, the horse lengthens his stride, making me lose my precious balance. I slip sideways and roll, but manage to hang on through the biting leather twisting my fingers. One boot sails over my head and through the air then smacks hard against the packed road. My legs are stretched enough to win the lead in a ballet competition, but I push my foot deeper into the harness and press my heel against the horse. Every muscle from my ankle to my hip is on fire. I bear down and force my legs together, pulling myself back on. The driver regains his senses and yanks the horse to a stop. I pat the bay’s neck, and damp hairs stick to my hand. I wipe it on the bottom of my shirt but don’t slide off, wary of giving them any opportunity to flee. Aurelia pokes her head around the giant driver. “Why, it’s just a girl.” I smile back. Been a while since I’ve been called that. “Es in periculo, Aurelia.” You’re in danger, Aurelia. “There’s a flood coming. I know this is drastic. Showing up on your horse—” “How did you appear like that? Will you teach me?” A smile sweetens Aurelia’s face. My own widens into a grin. I can’t help it. It shouldn’t surprise me that Aurelia can take my arrival in stride. After all, Constantine did. “Let’s worry about you first.” Beneath me, the horse fidgets, and I swing my leg over his rump and slide to the ground. A ball of nerves quivers in my stomach and I step quickly away from his fidgeting hooves. For now, Aurelia’s curiosity will keep her from bolting, so I ease my way around the back of the chariot. I smile at her again and avoid eye contact with the seething driver. “I need you to turn around. There’s a flood coming.” The driver sweeps Aurelia behind him and puts his big body between us. “Who are you? The river appears fine. This is mere rain. We can make it if we hurry. Your intrusion is our only delay.” His tone lowers. “Any threat against Aurelia will cost you more than your magic, sorceress.” Great, here we go again with the sorceress thing. I force a smile and hold up my hands. “I’m not here to harm her. That’s the last time you’ll see my magic.” I hope. Aurelia turns back to me. “How do you know who I am?” This might get tricky. “I know your father. He sent me to save you.” From another time. “Why didn’t he tell me not to go today?” I slowly lower my hands. “There’s a lot I don’t have time to tell you. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me. If I’m wrong, you can go in an hour.” Aurelia lays a hand on the driver’s arm. “Rom? What if she speaks truth? We could use a break. I wouldn’t mind setting a small meal.” He dips his chin, and in the depth of his gaze something else mixes with his duty to obey her. I bite back the smile. Wears his heart on his sleeve where Aurelia’s concerned . . . Pretty sure I can use that against him if I need it. His head lowers in a silent bow of acquiescence. “We can return to the small copse of trees before the hill if you wish.” When he turns his attention to me, all softness is gone, replaced by hard features that immediately convey the threat. “Will that suffice?” “I don’t know,” I answer honestly. “Stay alert. We might need to move quickly.” Aurelia presses to the far side of the chariot and gestures to the extra space. “Come.” I step onto the woven leather floor and reach around Aurelia to grab a handhold. Pretty sure Rom won’t make any effort to keep me in the vehicle. As I settle myself, Aurelia’s fingertips brush my pants. I stiffen, but she gives me a shy smile as she faces forward. Rom turns the chariot around with a flick of the reins, and as the wheels pivot, it’s impossible to miss the black sky to the north. The short hairs rising on my nape have nothing to do with the drenching rain, and I shiver as icy tentacles tighten around my limbs. Rom pulls us to a halt again and we stare openmouthed at the utter blackness. He glances over his shoulder and studies me. He’s still not happy about the added delay, but his resentment slips away as the sky darkens. I check the swirler of a cloud. A huge circle is turning and the eye has a definite cone shape forming toward the earth. Thunder rumbles and the breeze picks up, pushing debris across the road and whipping at nearby pedestrians’ clothes and possessions. The horse fidgets and jerks Rom’s arms and upper body forward. He searches the traffic pattern of the people, his head on a swivel. I track his movements and bite my lip. We don’t have many options to get us out of the crowd. He sends us through a tiny opening and turns us off the road, coaxing the bay forward up the hill. People are everywhere. I can barely tell where the road ends. We ease our way over the short grass that’s now been trampled by hundreds of feet. Another large group crests from the backside at the same time, and Rom slows us to a walk until we’re through the crowd’s thickest part. Restless, the horse swings his frontend to the left and pushes a man and boy deeper into the thick pulsing mob. Rom croons to the big bay and leans forward to stroke the dark hip. The gesture doesn’t calm any of us. I don’t like this. Waiting it out seems too easy. Too vulnerable. I’d rather get her out of here. “We’re almost there.” Aurelia grips the front of the bucket and leans forward. At the top of the hill, the clumps of trees make small pockets of dry ground, but if this storm gets any worse, it’s not the brightest spot to wait out a lightning storm. That would be my luck though . . . save Aurelia from a flood to kill her with regular lightning. I scan the landscape. For now, there’s no other place to run. A baby screams and the bay rears, scattering the rest of the travelers around the chariot and inching us back down the hill until I can no longer see over the top. While Rom wrestles to get the horse controlled, I glance again at the storm clouds. They’ve doubled in size, roiling like an overflowing pot of black oil. Not good. Rom curses, and I wonder if he’s reconsidering his ban on my sorcery. The slightly inconvenient mist becomes real rain, quieting the wind, but drenching us within seconds. Time to go. I’ve given Rom long enough to get us out of here. I grip the chariot’s iron scrollwork until it bites my palms. I close my eyes and breathe. This has to work. The ozone stings my nostrils, and I fight to control my racing heart and the panic of screwing this up. Constantine’s angry tirade of the last time doesn’t help, and I silence the memory. Bad enough it’s his daughter I’m saving. Lightning flares from my fingers and I make the coil swing beneath the bucket. Pedestrians closest to the chariot freak out and press away, tightening the crowd and squashing the spaces Rom was using to maneuver the horse through. Doesn’t matter. I tighten my grip, dig deep, and curl another strand around the top of the bucket to get us out of there. The lightning flares and jerks away from the bucket then slams it like a battering ram. Darkness flickers. I hold tight to the image of Constantine’s house, but something yanks it away like a paper in a storm. Images layer over the top of each other and we spin left, then right like we’re in a psychotic tornado. We crash-land at the river’s edge, behind the entire group, giving up every foot we’d gained. The horse backs up faster than I’ve ever seen him go forward, and Rom does nothing to stop him. Aurelia grabs Rom’s arm and raises her voice. “Rom!” Crap. I knew he wouldn’t be able to handle it, but Aurelia was supposed to be safe. It was supposed to be worth the risk. Not this. Not both parts wrong. I don’t understand why nothing works like it’s supposed to. Rom gives himself a hard shake, but he wobbles and sags against the side of the chariot. I lean forward and slap the horse hard enough to make my entire hand sting and my elbow ache. He jumps to a stop, snorts, and takes a tentative step forward. Aurelia puts her hands on Rom’s cheek, and her touch pulls him out of his stupor. His eyes lose their glassiness and he smothers her fingers with his own. I give him half a second to recover. “No time for this!” My terseness jerks him upright and he sweeps Aurelia behind him. “You said no more magic.” “Really?” I yell. “You pick now to chew me out?” I point at the river less than three feet from the wheels of the chariot. He glares at me and pats the horse’s quivering rump. The tight skin by his lips is still an ashy gray. Scooping the reins, he swallows and clucks softly while he rubs the horse’s coat. It seems scared. Super glad we’re tied to the damn thing with a thousand straps and buckles. At least jumping out is closer to the ground than jumping off. “Now what?” Rom yells while his head whips back and forth, eying one end of the crowd to the other. The path to the top of the hill is covered with people frantic to cross the river. We are so screwed. I completely robbed us of every gain. Overhead, thunder rumbles. Both the road and path to the top of the hill clog with travelers, and not just the group we met. That bunch is almost to the bridge, but there’s a constant stream rounding the hill, creating a massive bottleneck. Very few take the small walkway toward the town on this side of the river, choosing instead to head toward the bridge. Maybe if most of the group were able-bodied young men, this wouldn’t have disaster written all over it, but moms carry babies and parcels, men lead animals and wagons loaded with cages of goods, and clumps of elderly men and women block the passage of everyone else. Easygoing attitudes fall by the wayside as more people push and shove to get over the river. I wish I’d have taken the time to get a better view of the backside of the hill when we were on top. “Where are these people coming from?” “The city,” Rom answers with a grunt as the horse leaps forward. “They went in to trade early this morn, but know the river will trap them if they don’t cross before the storm.” I glare at him. Just “mere rain,” my ass. He knew this was coming. He scowls back, the unsaid threat clear. Do not alarm Aurelia any more than you already have. Then stop working against me. I scowl back. He breaks contact as Aurelia says, “Those people will die if she speaks the truth. We cannot let them.” Rom stiffens and glances at me. Now the unsaid is worry and a plea. I’m in agreement and grip Aurelia’s elbow. “You can’t go. I’m here to keep you safe. There’s no way I’m letting you anywhere near that water.” She leans dangerously over the edge of the chariot. “But all those poor people.” I open my mouth and close it again. Nothing I can say will make this easier. But I can’t exactly stand here and watch them die, either. “Will you stay?” I ask her. “If Rom and I go to save them, will you stay put?” She sucks her lower lip between her teeth and nods. “I promise.” A worried pallor lightens the skin around Rom’s cheekbones. “This is a bad idea. We need to worry about Aurelia.” “But those people—” she says. “Are not you,” Rom says, interrupting and lowering his intense gaze until their noses almost touch. She plants her hands on her hips, lifts her chin, and glares back, managing to look imposing. “You will obey me, Rom.” He crosses his arms and mimics her. “I obey your father.” “Fine, then I’ll tell him you killed hundreds of people today and put me in danger.” His flinch is nearly imperceptible. If anything, he increases in size. “You wouldn’t dare.” “Would, too.” “Seconds matter here, people,” I say, interrupting. “Aurelia, I agree with Rom. Your safety is paramount.” “Look.” She points toward an outcropping on the other side of the road. “Take me there and I’ll wait. I promise not to stray.” The spot isn’t as high as I’d like, but we might have plenty of time to get her out of here before the water rises much more. Unless something goes wrong. A shiver coils around my spine. This is stupid. I need to get her safe, not the rest of these people. Ilif would never let a tourist get in the way of an arc. “No.” “Please.” She grabs my arm and tugs. “All these children. Please.” The plea in her voice breaks my heart, and for no other reason than because Ilif wouldn’t, I relent. Unless Rom tells her no. Rom uncrosses his arms. “Five attempts,” he says. “After that, we go.” Dammit. She looks to me for a counter, but I nod. An uneasy nausea builds as she beams and kisses our cheeks. First mine and then Rom’s, with a lingering touch at his jawline. Even though I avoid his attention, there’s no mistaking Rom’s glare as he urges the horse toward the outcropping. “Use your magic if it will keep her safe.” I clench my jaw. This is beyond stupid. I assume his reference to five “attempts” gives me less than fifteen minutes. Barely enough time to alert everyone near the bridge and get the stragglers across it, but hopefully it’s enough for Aurelia. Rom eases us back through the swarm of people until the outcropping edges alongside the chariot. Raindrops slide down my forehead and drip from my jaw, but I’ve stopped trying to stay dry. Hordes of travelers bump against our metal basket, making it sway and rock in the wheelset. Any confidence I’ve had in its construction wanes. Every small movement grates on my nerves, and I can almost hear the second hand of an invisible clock ticking loudly beside my ear. The horse prances in time to the second hand, our own personal metronome of impending doom. Aurelia turns to Rom. “Be safe. Please come back to me. . .” He lifts a dark hand to her porcelain cheek, but halts before making contact, leaving a stretch of air between them. Aurelia presses forward, closing the inches. His caress is butterfly soft. “I must come back. Who else will keep you from trouble?” She doesn’t laugh at his weak attempt at levity, but curls her slim fingers around his, answering his unsaid feelings. A cold river of rain leaks under my collar. I force myself not to fidget. Come on, come on. He clears his throat and straightens, dropping his arm. She spins and grabs my hands. “Come back and teach me these fantastic things you know.” I bite back my antsiness. She’s a whole lot of Constantine with a sprinkle of his sister, Anna. I could like her. But first, I have to save her. Keep reading Shadow Boxer on Amazon. To download the first book in the series, Lightning Rider, for FREE.",

      "content": "Extras Also available: The Dead Celeb An Evie Preston/Grey Tier Book 1 by Michele Scott (AKA—A.K. Alexander) (read on for a sample) Chapter One MY NAME IS EVIE PRESTON and I hang out with dead rock stars. Oh, and the occasional dead movie star or two. I’ve learned quite a bit about those who live on the other side over the past few months. For instance, they aren’t all ghostly and transparent. Oh no. The ones I see are almost always in full- color and 3-D except when they exert, ah...certain energies. Then they go a bit hazy. Oh, and they prefer to be called spirits. Yeah, I know...I sound completely insane. Like, “commit me” insane. But honestly, I am not crazy. Believe me, the first time I saw Bob Marley in my place (well, technically not my place, but I’ll get to that) in the Hollywood Hills, getting high and singing “Buffalo Soldier,” I thought I was either dreaming, hallucinating, or, yes, completely nuts. Thankfully, it was none of the above. In fact, Bob is a very real, very dead guy who likes to hang out with me, along with a handful of other deceased, famous rock musicians (and a few who never quite made the charts, one of whom I’ve recently developed feelings for—more about him later). So, not only do I hang out with dead rock stars, I also think I am in love with one, or at least in lust… which makes me totally screwed up. But I am not crazy. I swear. Before I go any further, though, I need to take you back a few months to the day after my twenty-eighth birthday. Welcome to Brady, Texas—population 5,500—and, according to the sign on the main road into town, “The Heart of Texas.” Truth be told, the signs were everywhere. Signs, that is, telling me to get the hell out of Brady. I was at Mrs. Betty LaRue’s place. Her house smelled of Tide, home cooking, and mothballs. Betty was comforting me over the dismal turnout of my Mary Kay presentation—my latest attempt at becoming an entrepreneur—which she’d kindly hosted. We were drinking apple-cranberry tea, with her Lhasa Apso, Princess, curled in a ball under Betty’s chair, and my dog (of indeterminate breed...possibly part-coyote and part-lab, with a dash of border collie in there), Mama Cass, across my feet. I loved how Betty always let me bring Cass in the house. My dog went everywhere with me, but not everyone was as gracious about her presence as Betty. “I really thought this would go much better,” I said, bringing the warm cup of tea to my lips. Betty smiled sympathetically, the fine lines in her eighty- something face creasing deeper into her skin, “Oh, honey, I don’t know what happened to my girls today. I am so sorry. I thought there’d be at least ten of us. They all love my snickerdoodles. But you know how some of us old gals are; we forget things.” She twirled a yellow-white wisp of curled hair around her finger. The rest of it was pulled up into a loose bun (or chignon as Mama calls it). She’d obviously been in to see my mother that morning for her weekly hair appointment. I nodded. “It’s okay, Betty. Thanks for hosting anyway, and the cookies were delicious. Three isn’t such a bad turnout.” Thing was, only Betty bought anything. Her friends, Margaret and Hazel, came for the cookies and samples. “And I made about ten dollars, so that will buy me a couple of meals. You’ll love that anti-wrinkle cream, by the way.” Betty ran a hand over her face and laughed sweetly. “Child, ain’t nothing gonna work on this face now. And I’m proud of these lines. I earned them.” I laughed back. “So you only bought the cream because you felt sorry for me?” Cass’s ears perked up and she lifted her head to peer at me. Betty sighed. “Evie Preston, I have known you since you started kicking up a fuss in your mama’s belly.” She winked at me. “I’ve watched you try so hard to be exactly what your mama and daddy wanted, especially after all that bad business. And there was that unfortunate situation with—” She paused. “What was his name?” She brought her cup to her lips, her hand shaking ever so slightly. I sighed, knowing exactly what bad business she was referring to. As for the unfortunate situation, he was the star quarterback my senior year and the lucky recipient of my virginity. Sadly, he was also the jerk who then decided to share the news with the entire town. Thank God my mother was able to intercept that little tidbit before it reached my father’s ears. Betty waved her free hand in the air as if to brush the painful thoughts away. “I know you were hoping to be a good Texas girl and marry a good Texas boy and have babies and run a family like your folks did, not because you really wanted it,” she said, shaking a finger at me. “But because your parents wanted it for you. And now, my dear,” Betty leaned over and gave me one of her rare, stern looks. “It’s high time you stopped pretending and started living!” “What do you mean?” “You got a God-given talent. You need to get out there and do something with it.” She tried to set the tea cup down on the side table and almost missed. I grabbed it and set it down for her. Betty beamed at me. “Thank you, honey! Always so polite.” I looked down at my dog, licking the unpolished toes peeking out of the only pair of high-heeled sandals I owned. “Fact is, Betty, I know I’m good, but there are a lot of good musicians out there.” I dejectedly twirled the ends of my long, baby-fine hair. Mama always said God hadn’t been paying close attention when it came time to give me hair. It was stick straight, dark brown, and silky. I couldn’t do a darn thing with it, except put it into ponytails. Betty waved her hand again. “Nonsense!” Placing her hands on the sides of her chair, she slowly pushed herself up to a stand and ambled over to the white brick mantle. She grabbed an envelope and handed it to me. “What’s this?” I asked. “Your birthday was yesterday, wasn’t it?” “You remembered?” She frowned. “I may be old, Evie, but I don’t forget birthdays. Especially when they’re for people I care about.” “That is so sweet of you.” I was flattered and grateful someone seemed happy to have me around. “Oh honey, you know you’re one of my favorite people. You got spunk! Had it since you came out ass-backward, showing the world what you thought of it.” “Thank you, I think.” I couldn’t help smiling. Betty was the only one I knew who spoke the truth without holding back. She didn’t tiptoe around stuff like my family. Tiptoeing was what we did best. “Open it! I don’t have all day. It’s about time for my nap.” I tore open the envelope and found a check inside for five thousand dollars, made out to me. I gasped. “Betty! What...” Cass jumped up, her huge ears pricked forward, tail wagging, watching me like a hawk. “It’s okay, girl.” She lay back down but still alert. “I was twenty-eight once too, you know, and I had dreams...big dreams.” Betty’s blue eyes glazed over for a moment. “I wanted to be a movie star, and I could have, too. I was damn good, like you are at what you do, and, believe it or not, I used to be good looking.” She winked at me again, but there were tears in her eyes. I knew about Betty’s dreams from long ago. I also knew there was a part of her life that hadn’t been so good. “But then my folks, like yours, had other ideas and I decided to play by their rules. I don’t regret it...well, maybe I do a little. Thing is, young lady, you can sing like a nightingale and you can play the guitar like nobody’s business. You need to get the hell out of this town before you wind up like every other girl here—knocked up, changing dirty diapers, and cleaning up after some idiot male who spends his nights with a beer in one hand and a TV remote in the other.” I frowned. I’d already seen almost every girl from my high school graduating class living the life Betty had just described. The lucky ones skipped town and went to college. I hadn’t been quite that lucky for a variety of reasons. I had the grades and the desire, but life had other ideas. On the positive side, which is where I like to go, I’d at least not had the misfortune of marrying some guy who didn’t appreciate me, expected his dinner on the table when he got home from his shift at Walmart, and wanted his wife and children to obey, just because he said so. “Betty, I really do appreciate your vote of confidence but still, I can’t accept this.” I held the check towards her. “Yes, you can, and you will. Go live your life, Evie Preston. Pack up that van of yours, your guitar, and Mama Cass, and head west. You sing your heart out in every bar, every café, every church—I don’t care where you go, but go and sing. I know one thing: you have what it takes to be a star. Forget all about them cosmetics you’re trying to pawn . . .” “Mary Kay,” I interrupted. “It is a really good line. Mama swears by it.” She frowned and waved that hand at me. “Just forget all that, because you and I both know it won’t get you nowhere. That kind of thing is for people like Shirley Swan up the road trying to make an extra buck to take care of those four kids of hers. Take the money, cut your losses, and run. You gotta stop living for your mama and daddy. You didn’t cause what happened and you can’t never change it.” She shook her head vehemently. “Go on and live life. Do it for me. Humor an old woman, please?” Her blue eyes watered, the creases crinkling as she choked back emotion. How could I refuse after a plea like that? I tried one last time, for the sake of courtesy. “But my daddy—” Betty dabbed at her eyes with a kerchief. “He’ll get over it. And your mama is gonna secretly be cheering you on. It’ll be hard on them, but this’ll be the best thing for all of you.” She sighed heavily. “Especially you, Evie. Trust me.” So I did. I trusted Betty LaRue. The next day I packed up my 1974 VW bus, a suitcase of clothes, my Rosewood Gibson acoustic guitar, and Mama Cass. I pulled out of my parents’ driveway while Daddy waved his arms wildly in the air, yelling, “You’re gonna ruin your life out there, Evangeline!” (He’s the only one who ever calls me by my full name.) “Los Angeles isn’t the city of angels. It’s a city of heathens and devils!” I knew he was just scared. I’m pretty sure if I looked closer, I’d see tears in his eyes. But Betty was right. This was something I had to do. I could see tears for sure in my mother’s big hazel eyes, the same color as my own, as she mouthed, “I love you.” I rolled down the window, choking back my own sobs. “I love you, too! I’ll call. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.” With blurred eyes, Mama Cass’s head in my lap, a Patsy Cline cassette in the tape deck (thank God for eBay—you have no idea how hard it is to find cassette tapes these days), I headed west to the City of Angels. For the first time in sixteen years, I felt like I could finally breathe again. I was leaving behind the only two people I knew who I had never been able to heal even a little bit, and I didn’t think I ever could. Chapter Two I AM NOT A REBEL by nature. Or who knows...maybe I am. Regardless, it’s never really been an option for me. Not after what my parents went through. I could never yell, lie, sneak out of the house, or talk back. None of that. And those weren’t their rules; they were my own. So leaving my mother and father behind on that late April afternoon was by far the most rebellious thing I had ever done in my twenty-eight years, and honestly, it left me feeling cold. Poor Cass with her thick coat must have hated me on that fifteen hundred mile trip, because I was freezing the whole way and cranked up the heater in my van, even as we drove through Arizona’s hot, desert climate. It was the kind of cold you can feel on the inside—that only a real hot bath combined with a hot drink and a tuck between the covers can cure. I wasn’t sick. No sore throat. No aching body. Nothing like that. I was just cold. And then, after three days of driving and staying in cheap motels, I took the 10 West all the way to L.A., and the chill left as suddenly and mysteriously as it had arrived. The first thing I did was head to the ocean—Venice Beach to be exact. Yes, Los Angeles has plenty of tan, beautiful people and then some, but let me just say for the record, there are also a ton of freaks here, especially in Venice Beach. I saw one guy with hair the color of mashed peas that hung down to his rear in twisted, greasy ropes. He wasn’t wearing a shirt and the waistband of his shorts sat well beneath his boxers. Not an attractive look, especially considering the live iguana wrapped around his neck. Never seen that before. Cass went totally berserk, yapping at him and the lizard. I had to yank pretty hard on her leash to get her to move while the guy snarled, “Get your mangy piece of shit mutt outta my face, dude!” Um, excuse me? At least my dog takes regular baths, which is certainly more than I could say about Mr. Mange and his lizard sidekick. I decided to keep my mouth shut and move along, tugging on Cass the entire way. I made an effort to give him as wide a berth as possible, not wanting to accidentally brush against him and deal with the onslaught of negative emotions that would happen as a result. Okay. I guess it’s probably time I let this particular cat out of the bag. See the thing is, when I turned twelve, my parents and I went through some tough times. And ever since, I’ve been able to get information about people through touch. But not just any information—traumatic, painful information. Caught your husband of thirty years sleeping with your best friend? Lost your mom in a car accident when you were a teen? Well, if you and I have come into contact before, chances are, I already know all about it. But that’s not all. I can also help ease the pain...give people a permanent Band-Aid to slap on that painful memory. I can’t make the pain disappear, but I sure can help you to cope with it, minus years of therapy or self-medication. Sounds great, right? Well, have you ever paid attention to just how many times a day you touch someone? At the supermarket, at the salon, at a restaurant...it happens all the time, and you’re mostly not aware of it at all. I’ve had to train myself to be extra focused on where I am and who’s around me in order to cope. Truth be told, I’m pretty cautious who I touch these days, and I also make a conscious effort to put some kind of barrier in place (gloves, mittens, napkins, whatever’s handy) if I know there’s a chance my hands might brush up against another person, because it is my hands that tend to be the main conductor of this gift. If my hands touch someone else, particularly their hands, that is when I get the clearest visions. I’d receive some information if someone were to bump against me, but the touching of hands is what I am most aware of. Betty LaRue was one of the first people I “read.” It happened at Easter, sixteen years ago, when I took her hand to show her the new kitten Mama brought home for me (another gift meant to help me deal with our recent loss). All I got were glimpses—of a much younger Betty and the baby she lost when she was only seventeen, courtesy of a pregnancy caused by a boyfriend who didn’t take no for an answer one night—and they scared the hell out of me. In any case, touching people like Cranky Dreadlock Man was simply not an option for me. No telling what sorts of nasty images I’d pick up from him. Once we got past him, we reached the ocean. Color—silvery blue. Smell—fresh and salty—minus the cigarette smoke and sickly sweet scent of tanning oil that occasionally wafted its way toward us. The crashing waves and sandy beach were like something from a postcard. Cass and I people-watched for some time. Cheapest entertainment in the world. Bring a lawn chair, a bag of Tostitos, and a six-pack of soda, and you’ll find the movies have nothing on Venice Beach. When I need to get away from anyone famous—dead or alive—I head there. And I figure, the best way to beat crazy is to go and see even more crazy. Cass and I shared a couple slices of pizza and a Coke (yes, Cass drinks Coke, too, but none of that diet stuff), and I decided we needed to find a place to stay for the night. And then I needed to find a job. I knew five thousand dollars was probably not going to get us very far in the land of glitz and glamour. I found a motel a few blocks from the beach. It was fifty-five bucks for the night, which seemed like a lot. But we were tired, and I thought being close to the ocean might be cool, because I could take Cass for a walk in the morning. Problem was, they had a “no pets” policy. “You gotta stay in the bus, girl,” I told her. She thumped her tail slightly and looked at me with her big, dark eyes. I whispered in her ear, “Only for a little bit. Soon as the coast is clear, I’ll come get you.” She thumped her tail even harder. I may sound a bit biased here, but Cass is the smartest dog ever. “You be a good girl, and I’ll be back.” And I was, after a shower and a change of clothes. I snuck my half-coyote, half-lab, possibly some border collie pooch into the dingy motel room that smelled of stale cigarettes, bug spray, and mildew. She jumped on the bed with me and we fell fast asleep. The Dead Celeb is available at: Amazon Kindle and Amazon UK Paperback * Audio Book Also available: Shadow Boxer Alterations, Book 2 By Jen Greyson (read on for a sample) Chapter One Based on the last two, I’m getting an increasingly bad taste for Tuesdays. “Damn.” I grind my teeth as the needle stitches color onto my right shoulder blade. Brin rakes a paper towel across the bloody area and slathers Vaseline over my new tattoo. “Wanna see?” I press my shirt over my boobs and hop off the chair. The ache in my back radiates through my entire arm, but I peer over my shoulder at my reflection and his impromptu handiwork. High on my right shoulder blade, he’s painted a vibrant orange-yellow sun with a crescent moon piercing the bottom, and eight long strands of lightning radiating outward in feathery bolts. Day blurs into night and back again, held together by nothing more than lightning. A perfect illustration of time’s chaotic movement for me. I gingerly pull my shirt on. “Nice.” One-word answers are enough here. I’m not capable of much else. “Eighty bucks work?” I dig in my front pocket for a crumpled hundred. My waistband slides over my hip and I grimace at how much weight I’ve lost. I don’t like being this skinny. I want my curves back. Brin takes the cash, enveloping my hands between both of his. “Merry Christmas, Evy. You have plans?” I force my gaze to stay steady, though I wince inside. “Dinner with the folks.” “Cool.” He lets me go and taps the cash register, popping open the drawer. I wave away his money. “Keep it.” He jams the bill into the drawer and hums “Jingle Bells.” “Thanks, babe. Don’t be such a stranger.” I test a smile and fight the burn stinging my eyes. “Thanks for fitting me in. Tell Tasha we need to go out for a drink.” He walks me to the door and holds it open. “She’d like that.” Back in Papi’s truck, I roll my shoulders. Even though some of the tension is gone, I still fight to stay above water. Please let this get easier. I’m going to run out of skin if this is how I have to unload the stress of an arc every time. A snow-covered Accord slides toward my bumper and I brace for the impact, but the driver gains control at the last second and waves in apology. She grins, buoyed by the Christmas packages piled high in the back of her car. I manage to lift my hand in forgiveness. If only the rest of my problems were that easy. I shift Papi’s truck into drive and pull out of the snowy parking lot, grateful he didn’t let me take my bike. I know he’s worried about me, but I don’t know how to reassure him—or if I even can. Not that he’s faring much better than I am, but at least he’s had a couple months to come to grips with what we are. Lightning leaps from my fingertips and rings the gearshift. Another bolt races around the steering wheel. My heartbeat steadies and my chest expands with a calming fullness. I need to play with it again. Nothing else can get me balanced and centered like my lightning. My throat tightens and I fight the flood of memories. Empty streets guide me home, but as I pass each driveway overflowing with visitors settling in for the long holiday weekend, the stiffness returns to my shoulders. I suppose I need to decide where I’m going to spend it as well. Someone’s shoveled my driveway, and I park between the small mounds of snow. It’s weird to be back here in my own house. I’ve spent what feels like months between Papi’s house and ancient Spain. Everything here is so . . . normal. Bamboo floors gleam, the stainless-steel kitchen is unused as ever, and the couch and gadgets remain untouched. I pace the length of my living room. The plan Papi and I formed earlier disintegrates as quickly as I try to recall the details. It seemed so easy and simple while we talked through saving Aurelia and then rescuing Penya. I pull a blue strand of lightning from my middle finger and twist it around my hand, covering and uncovering my fingers. That’s not the right order. Penya’s abduction weighs on me, but not just because I failed to save her in the forest. That whole situation doesn’t feel right. The longer I wait to save her, the more chances of something going wrong. She thinks Aurelia is important—and I completely agree—but leaving Penya to Ilif’s mercy until I save Aurelia makes me uneasy. The lightning jumps and pops around my hand. I close my eyes and inhale, drawing the cord of light out and back in a slow rhythm. When my mind empties and the unease quiets, I snuff the lightning and return to my living room. Badly as I want to leave this decision up to someone else, I need to decide between the two. Time travel should not be this hard. In a perfect world, I could stop time and do both. Ilif is both the wild card and the ultimate pain in my ass. My shoulders sag and I run a hand over my braid. It’s crusted and beyond grunge. I have no idea the last time I washed it—a week ago, a month? Time holds no meaning for me anymore. I growl and shake my arms. “Snap out of this, Evy! Do something. Anything!” A shower will help me sort things out. Right now any movement is progress. I toe my boots off and pad across the floor to the bathroom. Even the opulence of my simple place is jarring. I twist the knob on the shower and peel my T-shirt off, wincing at the new soreness on my back and the days-old scrape on my forearm. The one Constantine gave me. Tears burn the back of my eyes, and I swallow and scramble to get myself under control. We knew it was an impossible situation. We knew a relationship wouldn’t work. As I shimmy out of my pants, my fingers brush the bruise on my hip where he had me pressed against the rock wall of his bedroom while my naked limbs entwined with his. I can’t hold the sob anymore. It bursts free in a tortured wail. My hand flies to my lips and I bite my fist. No falling apart. Even though I gave myself permission to do it once I was alone, this is no time for a meltdown. Only a few hours until Christmas dinner, and I need days to purge all this. I grip the edge of the sink and lean over the marble countertop, avoiding my image in the mirror. My braid slithers over my shoulder like his fingers across my skin. I squeeze my eyes shut and block everything. Bolts absentmindedly extend from my hands. They skitter across the counter and retract like an electric yo-yo. I force a breath into my lungs and hold it then let it seep out. The exhale shakes as it leaves my lips, but I calm, even if just a small amount. On trembling legs, I turn toward the shower and check the water temperature. I slip my fingers beneath the waistband of my boy shorts— Thunk. Something hits the closed door. I freeze. It can’t be Ilif. Not yet. Not here. I hold my breath. Straining for any sound, any indication of which stranger prowls my hallway. Ilif doesn’t know where I live. He’s never been here, but who knows what kind of tracking software he uses to monitor me now. If he’s using Penya to compensate for his shortcomings, he could go anywhere . . . even here. I force air from my lungs before I hyperventilate. I’m a warrior and need to effing act like one. Down the hallway, the floor creaks, but the silence stretches too long for a footstep. I press myself against the door and listen again. Nothing. Steam curls above my head and against the ceiling, swirling and billowing in white clouds. I flick the light off and let my eyes adjust then curl my fingers around the doorknob and twist, concentrating on silence, drawing on all the warrior stealth Constantine taught me. The steam sneaks out before me, my lookout. Tendrils of lightning crisscross my palms. Tensed for battle, I take one big breath and sweep into the hall, silent on bare feet. Something hard strikes my foot and I stumble. Instinctively, I tuck and lean into the momentum. With a roll and twist so I can see my attacker, I come up on one knee, hands splayed with thick bolts of lightning leaping from my palms. Snapping white bolts extend all the way past the bathroom door. The hallway looms empty except for a strange, small book propped against the doorframe. I ease toward it, ready for whoever left it. My ragged breathing and the crackle of electricity are the only noises. Standing, I retract my lightning. I like that my reaction time is getting better. I suppose attacking a book isn’t exactly the right response, but I’d rather be ready than dead. Not that Ilif would kill me . . . but then again, I’m not one hundred percent positive he wouldn’t. I march to the stairs and peer over the railing. Nothing moves. Returning to the book, I crouch and poke at it, but as far as I can tell, it’s exactly what it seems. A leather thong holds the worn cover closed. Deep grooves carve the front, and the edges are worn with what I imagine must have been constant use to make the leather so light. I rub my hand over the smooth surface to wipe away a fine layer of dust then turn it over and examine the back. There’s no writing or anything. No one sneaks into a house, drops off an old book, and leaves. Whoever left this is coming back. Cold fingers of ice trace my spine. Coming to harm or to help. With my luck lately, my money isn’t on help. I tuck the book beneath my arm and turn off the shower. Silence. Still half-naked, I creep upstairs, but all the rooms are empty. Downstairs is the same. I don’t get it. Taking a breath, I relax. It’s no good for me to stay wound this tight. I need to chill until they face me. Nothing I can do until then. I retrace my steps and burrow into the corner of the couch, tucking my feet beneath me. I undo the book’s strap and ease the cover open. Hard slashes of script mark the page, punching me in the gut and yanking me instantly to another place. My fingers trace the letters, recognizing the handwriting from a map drawn nearly two thousand years ago while I stood next to him. If this is someone’s idea of a joke, it’s beyond brutal. I see him bent over this book, pouring out thoughts, dreams, plans . . . A sob wrenches from my throat, but I choke it down before it breaks completely free. My lips tremble and I bite them hard until my breathing slows. I try again. On the page, the words shift from Latin to English. Aurelia mortuus est hodie. They blur, and I wipe my eyes and spread the tears on my bare thigh in a long, wet streak. When I begin again, the rich timbre of Constantine’s voice carries the words to my heart. Aurelia died today. Without me there to save her. She died alone while I busied away the day on trifles of war. A mystery flood carried her away from me forever. Such pain. I am without breath. My grief threatens to consume me. To kill me. Oh, I wish it could. I would die in a flame of grief if it could take away this pain. My sweet Aurelia is gone. Gone, not to a husband I could choose, but to a lover who stole her from me without warning or apology. My heart twists until I can’t breathe, but I force myself to keep reading. I flip a chunk of pages to another entry, months later... I relive the morning of her journey again and again. I search my memory for some indicator of the storm, but I find nothing. I remember her face that morning, her jubilation to visit her friends . . . her laughter. I hear it, chasing me through the halls. She calls to me from the grave, beckons me to come and play. This life needs me for something, though I know not what. I can feel it like an abrasion under my finger, for it is the only other feeling I have beyond my pain. I tire of this grief. Would that I could take my sword to it. I miss her. I miss her so. My hands drop and the pages fan closed in a cascade of sorrow. There’s more, but I can’t bear another word. Every page is full. When we were together, he brushed the edge of his misery with me, but not like this. I didn’t know . . . “Oh, Constantine.” I close my eyes and relive the aching horror when we saw a glimpse of her. In that split second I got a clue about how losing her devastated him, but somehow, seeing such emotion in his own hand . . . It kills me. Our time together was so short. My chest constricts. Even if we’d had the time, he wouldn’t have shared this. To expose this much vulnerability would have been a weakness. And now Penya wants me to find Aurelia and save her before he has to go through this. Eradicate all of this sorrow and pain from his life. And change the man I know . . . I correct myself, the man I thought I knew. My fingers hover above the pages then curl into a fist. To prevent this, I’d do anything. With a sigh, I let my head drop back against the couch. My fingers drift to the pages and across each indentation of his words. There has to be more to Aurelia’s story. Either Penya isn’t telling me the whole story or she doesn’t know. Ancestor to a famous scientist, sure, but who will she be? A mother, a wife . . . I can’t accept that she’s nothing more than an incubator for greatness. My thoughts drift, bouncing and floating from one to another. Drowsy from the emotional beating, it takes me a minute to realize the bright column of light shining in the middle of the room isn’t coming from a window. Silvery and cylindrical, it slowly rotates counterclockwise—I jerk upright—like last time she visited after the kidnapping. “Penya!” I dive off the couch and kneel beside the emerging shape. It morphs and shifts into her short, earthy silhouette. Though she’s transparent and some sort of projection, I can make out all her features, but nothing about where she is. I lean closer. “Where are you? You still haven’t told me how you’re projecting your image here.” Her face falls and she glances over her shoulder, waving my question away with a violent swat. My hands fly to cover my mouth. I didn’t think about someone hearing me on her side. After listening for something I can’t see, she turns back then spots the journal on the couch behind me and clasps her hands together. “Good, good.” Her voice sounds far away, like she’s standing at the end of a tunnel. “I was not certain the journal would travel without me.” “You left it?” “Who else? Ilif will not help you. He has almost figured out Aurelia’s connection. You must complete the alteration now.” “Her connection? What does that mean? Like her connection to Constantine? And it’s Christmas. I have a family dinner in four hours.” “I have no time to explain, and you will return in time.” I bristle. “You don’t know that. Last time cost me six months.” “You must risk it. If Ilif gets to her first . . .” She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. “Go now. There is no time to lose.” I grind my teeth and point at her chest. “Not this time. You’re not leaving me in the dark again. Where are you? How do I get to you?” “Ilif’s new lab is all I know—” I cross my arms. “Okay, about that. You guys worked together? Didn’t you think that was worth mentioning?” She glances behind her again and lowers her voice until I can hardly hear her. “It was long ago. We have no time for this, Evy.” “No. Not a long time ago. In my future!” I don’t know when I’m going to see her again, and I need this information. She sighs. “Yes, your future.” “How are you traveling? You’re here, but you’re not, just like in the forest. What did he do to you?” “This is why you must hurry. He is developing new methods of travel. Aurelia’s sudden death wiped out an entire line of scientists. Ones he needed.” So much information . . . I squeeze my eyes shut. Think, Evy. Ask the right questions. “What is Ilif working on?” Her image leans closer. “I do not know. I promise I do not. But you are strong enough to handle the answers this time. I promise you will know everything as I do.” My lightning flickers at her praise. “I will learn more. He leaves me for days at a time—but there may be stretches when I cannot get to you. I must go.” “Wait!” I press forward, grinding my knees into the bamboo floorboards. “What time are you in right now—when are you?” “I have not pinpointed an exact date. Same with our location. To say Ilif put a good deal of thought into this lab is an understatement. When I do get to wander, it is fully contained and he does not permit me beyond the building.” “Then how are you traveling?” “I used the tracking software to locate you and project this image, but otherwise, my physical form is captive. I also think he found a way to block certain places from arcs, starting with this one.” “I’ll find you.” My heart tightens at the thought of losing her. She’s the only one who ever seems to be on my side. “I am your smallest problem. Worry for Aurelia. You must save her before Ilif interferes. Your alterations are different enough that he cannot manipulate them, but it is only a matter of time. And his determination is endless. Aurelia is too important. Whatever he is working on centers around her. You must get to her first.” My empty gut clenches. “No pressure.” Her head jerks to the right and she watches something in her time that I can’t see. “Save Aurelia. Now.” A dangerous undertone in her whisper snakes a chill up my spine. She vanishes. “Penya!” My hand grasps air, and I press my fist against my forehead. Dammit. There are so many reasons I don’t want to go right now. A night in my own bed would be nice . . . I’m at least taking a shower before I go. Dread seeps through my bones and I stand. While I’d love to join in her optimism, my arcs don’t work like that. I’ll be lucky to get back here today, let alone before dinner. The soles of my feet stick to the wood floor, smacking loudly as I return to the bathroom and start the shower. After dropping my panties, I step under the spray and unbraid my hair. Dark strands cling to my fingers. As I rinse them down the drain, my mind is consumed with what’s coming. This time will be different. This time I’m knowingly trying to alter history. There is so much uncertainty at the beginning of an alteration. I never know what intersection of someone’s life is the perfect point for me to change things . . . where we’ll meet . . . who will be there. Or in this case, if a certain someone will be there. Vanilla infuses the steam as I squirt bodywash into my palm and lather up. My shoulders are fuller and there’s muscle beneath my curves. I ignore what the new shape of my arms means and quickly soap my chest—no danger of those getting muscley—then race across my flatter stomach and over my full hips. I’m surprised that the training with Constantine would have such an effect on me so soon, and I definitely don’t want to look like he does. I liked my soft curves. I miss them. Shampoo slides in soapy tracks down my face, and I turn into the hot water and refocus. Ilif is still the biggest uncertainty, precariously balanced between bad guy and worst co-worker on the face of Earth. No chance he’s lightened up on his feelings about females, and since I’m still wearing a set of boobs, we’re at an impasse. No way I trust his recent crazy-train flip-flop—he wanted to use me. I towel off and head upstairs to my bedroom. A pair of chocolate-brown leather pants are still folded on the end of my bed, but as I slip my fingers beneath the buttery softness, I pause. Finding Aurelia while she’s still alive puts me pre-149 BC, and I know she died in Rome. I toss my pants back on the bed and scout the closet for something less barbaric. The only skirt I have is from someone’s funeral, a pinstriped black number with a slit up the back, not exactly something I can traipse about in ancient Rome. I finger the top rack, letting my hand travel across my long-sleeved tees, my cashmere sweaters . . . at least now the juxtaposition of my wardrobe makes more sense. I’m not meant to live in one time period. Time traveler or no, nothing here will work. Last time, Constantine’s sister, Anna, made me the greatest wardrobe ever. I miss those clothes. Maybe if I get better at arcing I’ll figure out how to bring stuff home with me. For now, it’s incredibly annoying, so I resort to the leather pants, a matched set of baby-blue bra and panties, and a seaweed-green tee. With leather motorcycle boots and wet, braided hair, I stride back to the living room and stand in Penya’s empty spot. The journal mocks me. I pick it up and close it tightly then tuck it in the back of my pants. I inhale and quit stalling. Arms relaxed, palms open, I let go of everything else and let the lightning come. White bolts spark from my fingertips, writhing and crackling against each other, slipping backward over my elbow and stretching toward the floor. With deliberate slowness, I bring my hands together until they’re eight inches apart. Attraction pulls the bolts together into an electric ball. I picture Aurelia, her spirit, her love of life and of friends, and her willfulness. Black arms of nothingness open wide and embrace me in an all-consuming possession. I am deaf, blind, and mute. And for once, my heart doesn’t hurt. Chapter Two I arrive in Rome on the wings of sunrise. Wisps of an orange and pink sky bleed into morning blue, and the sun shines bright from the east, already warming the dry air. Over rooftops, grand buildings rise in the distance, oddly pristine and unfamiliar. My shoulders relax and I take the first deep breath of the week. This is going to be a cinch—no rain, no flood. Hopefully I can get in and out without a single issue. Pride puffs up my chest. I’m getting good at this. In front of me, tall box elms create an impenetrable wall around a home’s garden and repeat again near what looks like a rear entry into the house. Hand-painted and etched pots overflow with bright blossoms. Clusters of them dot the space and cuddle up to several benches scattered throughout the garden. Beyond the lazy floating butterflies and working bees, the garden is silent and empty. Everyone must still be inside this morning. I hesitate and scan the entire back wall of the house, not sure I can sneak in without being seen—especially if my plan is to keep Aurelia from leaving. I step forward and a familiar blonde steps through the doorway, making me duck back behind a hedge. I’ve only seen Aurelia once before, but it must have been last week, because she looks the same. Curls held back by a gold braid frame a heart-shaped face, round with youthful pudginess. I slip behind a tall container bursting with tall, fluffy-headed grass so I can study her in secret. She’s barely as tall as I am and dressed in a simple tunic pinned at the shoulders with matching brooches. Turning to respond to a question, the curls spill down her back, stopping just short of the matching gold braid around her teeny waist. She skirts a narrow table and sits, smiling up at a servant as he sets a fruit plate and bread in front of her. “Aurelia?” I jerk toward the voice that haunts my dreams and try to dislodge my heart from my throat while I press deeper into the foliage. Greenery leans across my face, but I can still make out every single one of Constantine’s features as he comes outside. Golden eyes assess every possible threat and a youthful bunching of freckles dust his cheekbones. His demeanor changes and he scans the garden, pausing on my location. Aurelia looks up, but I can’t shift my attention off Constantine. While he stares intently at my etched clay planter, I curl my fingers around the lip and try to suck breath into my collapsed windpipe. Whenever I am, however long it will be until he touches me, his raw handsomeness makes all the wrong parts of my body take notice. Impossibly tall, Constantine is somewhere between the thick, wide warrior I first met, and the lean death machine who trained me to be the same. His dark blond curls are cut close to his head and his fingers twitch constantly. I wonder when he got that nervous tic under control. “Papa.” He snaps back to Aurelia and rubs the edge of his eyebrow. “Me paenitet. Ego vidi.” Sorry. I thought I saw something. Their Latin shifts in my head. I’m still not sure how that works, but I’ve stopped questioning. She lifts a small hand to his forearm. “You worry too much.” He smiles, and the sheer joy of it illuminates his entire face. I press my lips together and my heart finds a regular rhythm. “You don’t worry enough.” He sits on the adjacent bench. She nibbles a slice of fruit ad he plucks a slice of pear off the plate. “What time are you leaving?” “Rom is bringing the chariot this afternoon.” I sigh, and the gust makes the grass wave. About time I had an easy one. I loosen my grip on the planter and straighten. As soon as Constantine leaves, I’ll figure out how to stop her. He stands and rubs the back of his neck. He’s made that gesture a thousand times with me . . . something is bothering him, but he’s trying to hide it. I narrow my eyes and study each nuance of his body language, but even now he’s a master at secrecy. Unaware, Aurelia wipes her fingers, jumps up, and throws her arms around his waist. His eyes squeeze closed. I lean closer. He drops a quick kiss on her head and tucks his emotion away before she lets go. “I’ll be home in a week, Papa.” He straightens and clears his throat. “I’ll talk to Rom and ensure he’s readied everything. Though I don’t know why I bother. He worries about you more than I.” She bites her lip and a blush reddens her cheeks. If he notices, he doesn’t say anything but squeezes her shoulder, then returns to the house. Aurelia fidgets, straightens her belt, and trails in his wake. I want to run after him, make him remember me, tell him not to be such a jackass from the get-go so we can have more good moments. But I don’t because it won’t matter, because that time is over for me, even if it hasn’t yet come for him. Biting my lower lip, I step from behind the planter and creep toward the table, skirting a splashing fountain. Thunder rumbles in the distance, and I cringe. Constantine’s journal is warm against my back, and I pull it out. Keeping it will only make this harder after I’m gone. I lift it, press the leather against my lips in a silent goodbye, and set it next to Aurelia’s plate, fingers lingering for one last second. “Read this,” I whisper, and my throat tightens. “Remember me. Remember us.” Straightening my shoulders, I step toward the door. Light flashes to my left and I spin. Ilif’s image materializes next to the fountain and I leap behind the hedge near the door. Shit. Shit. Shit. That’s what I get for having a sentimental moment about Constantine. I should have grabbed Aurelia the second I could. If Ilif’s here, he’s obviously not into playing nice. He’s out to win. No chance. I separate the branches of the hedge and glare across the small yard. Dressed in a dark-brown suit today, that superfuck straightens his tie, aligning the blue and brown stripes with the horizon. The light-brown pattern on his shirt does nothing to enhance his translucent skin. Spindly fingers smooth the gray hair at his temples, making me smile at the amount now peppering his shiny black pompadour. When he’s artfully arranged his entire countenance enough to make me gag, he moves around the back of the fountain. Not a chance he’s going to get any closer to screwing this up. I burst through the hedge and splash through the basin, drawing a long rope of lightning between my outstretched arms as I race toward him. Errant strands leap from my hands and ricochet off the water. He jerks away, but not before his features contort with betrayal, quickly covering a trace of awe. Fueled by his rage, I flex my knees and lunge. He flickers and ducks, but I catch him in the side of the face with my right hand. He solidifies, and a triple fork of lightning erupts from the fountain as I flare my own. I wrap my arm around his neck, and a sharp pain spears the base of my spine as we disappear. Blackness rips him from my grasp and tumbles me backward. The pain ebbs as a high afternoon sun blinds me. I crouch and search the flat white landscape for that scuttling cockroach, Ilif, but there’s only me. In the distance, mountains rise from the glaring expanse of nothing. I pinch the white dirt. It’s crusty and coarse. Straightening, I study the horizon again and frown. I’m on either the Salt Flats near home in Utah or an alien planet. Okay, so this is new. Like I need more things to figure out. I prod the muscles of my back, trying to recreate the pain, but fail. I twist and lift my shirt. No wound, not even a red mark. Whatever that weirdness was in Rome, the arc healed it. Even so, something made my lightning go haywire. All that should have happened was that my lightning created interference so it was impossible for Ilif to stay. At least that’s how it worked last time. So where is he? And where am I? This is a disaster. Just when I have a small grasp on my lightning and how it works—or at least the arcing part, I find another new component. This is such bullshit. I rub my forehead and focus on the Ilif part for now. When we were in Spain and I used my lightning, I never bothered to figure out where the interference caused him to go. All I cared was that he wasn’t with me anymore. I’m not sure if he goes back to the same place every time, or if I’ve screwed up his life enough to keep him busy. That would be too handy . . . so, no. I need to expect him back at Aurelia’s side any moment. With another quick look around at the barren plains, I open my hands and fill them with twin balls of lightning. Blackness holds me only briefly, and the silence of the salt morphs into the roar of water. Color and the pungency of wetlands surround me as heat and sunlight become misting droplets of rain beneath a gray sky that I recognize instantly. The river is louder than when Constantine and I arced here after Aurelia’s death. I’m at the same narrow section, flanked on either side by thick trees that make it impossible to see upstream past the sharp bend to the right. Easy to see how people could get lured into a false sense of security. The river looks peaceful, especially since the changing landscape works as a distraction. An uneasy lump forms in my stomach, and I pull a strand of lightning from my fingertips and slowly tease it longer then let it snap back and repeat the motion while I scan for something sinister. Downstream, the trees fade quickly into reeds as the ground becomes smooth clay. The bank is sloping and beachy. A nice contrast to the cliffs and rocks at the bend beneath the tree roots, enough to make someone forget they’re basically standing in a tight canyon. People die like that every year back home, trapped in narrow canyons when the rainwater comes. Though nothing looks obviously out of place or deadly, the tall walls will make escape impossible—just like home. I snuff my lightning. Twenty feet farther downriver stands an arched bridge. Thick with a short railing, it spans the water in a wide curve with massive supports of stone rising from the water. Roman architecture doesn’t skimp, and even here their brilliance shines through. There’s a dirt road leading up to it, but the reeds obscure parts from where I am. The cramping is back in my stomach. I tug at my collar as raindrops slip beneath the cotton fabric of my shirt. No time to whine about the weather, I push through the reeds and stop at the edge of the road. Travelers wander along, warily skirting me and averting their gazes. Long, deserted silences stretch between the large groups as they hurry through the light rain. If I’ve landed here now, that can only mean Aurelia’s chariot will come around the corner within the next few minutes. I need to quit with the sightseeing and make a plan that will convince her she can’t cross the river. I wince and bite my lip. If her driver is more protective than Constantine, he’s not going to be an easy sell. As the road twists away from the river, wide expanses of barren soil flank both sides. The reeds are confined to a few feet next to the river, but otherwise, short, brittle grass grows in patches. Hugging the road’s left side, a wide hill slopes gently upward a good twenty feet, at least enough to get us out of immediate harm. It’s topped with a group of trees that flow down the side, hop the road, and continue on a parallel path to the river. Though there isn’t an actual road to the top, the grass won’t be tough to navigate. When I was here with Constantine, I realized horses are just ancient four-wheelers, so a half-decent charioteer shouldn’t have an issue, and I’m positive Constantine wouldn’t entrust Aurelia to a novice. I jam my fists into my hips and scowl at the horizon. There has to be a reasonable way to get Aurelia and her driver off the main road and climbing up a random hill. An occasional shrub dots the landscape, but nothing that can help me divert the chariot’s path. The most obvious plan is to use my lightning to scare everyone away, but I don’t trust the reaction. If I stand in the middle of the road and play the sorceress, odds are good the charioteer will just drive around me, probably with spit and well-deserved curse—most definitely a sword aimed at my head—all while inciting a complete panic and speeding Aurelia to her death. Saving that option for last. Thunder rumbles in the distance and the edges of the clouds darken. More pedestrians hurry along the road, and I study their paths to see if that helps me at all. They stay to the confines of the road for the most part, but big groups spread into wide swaths and overflow the road into the short grass. I glance over my shoulder at the racing water. I swear it’s moving faster. A few more inches of reeds are beneath the surface now. Penya’s flickering light spears the dirt next to me and I jump sideways. “Where have you been?” I wipe my hands on my pants. “Ilif was at Aurelia’s. I tried to flare my lightning to get him out, but it flung me to the Salt Flats. What’s that all about?” “Possibly his attempts to tamper with the arc. I told you he was close, and that is why we cannot waste time trying to get me out of here. Not yet. Save Aurelia. What have you figured out?” I rub the end of my braid across my lips. “Nothing yet. It’s not like I can flag her down and ask her to please wait by the side of the road.” “Why not?” I flounder, opening and closing my mouth while my brain tries to compute a snappy retort. A raindrop slips off my lip and onto my tongue. “Stop making life so difficult. Simplicity is key.” She moves closer. “Life is the same, Evy. Yet you doubt.” She sighs and reaches for me. Her face softens and her eyes betray a pride she hasn’t revealed before now. “Life is not this complicated series of tests and struggles you seem to imagine. It is meant to be lived, not endured. How many of the struggles in your life have you created? Stop inventing obstacles. Stop making arcing harder than it has to be. Your alterations will continue to be massive complications if you do not start looking past the impossible.” I shudder and my heartbeat hammers against my breastbone. Easy for her to say. Thunder cracks, and the center of a storm cloud to the west starts a clockwise rotation. My shirt is soaked through at the shoulders now. I inhale and consider all the possibilities. Behind my lids I envision my goal. There has to be a way to get Aurelia safe. A simple way. “I can arc her.” Penya’s swift inhale isn’t encouraging. “Simple, I said.” “Work with me here.” “Not without preparation,” she says. “I spent months with Constantine working on it, and then you prepared him well for the actual moment he traveled. Even with your disaster in the glen, he had been readied.” “But it worked. I just need to get her out of here. I’m not teaching her to travel, so I can just grab her like I did in the glen, right? I even arced the horse, so surely I can arc a girl. I’m talking about when I arced him with my lightning—not when he traveled on his own. If she uses mine, won’t it work the same way?” In what I’d come to know as her you’re-going-to-be-the-death-of-me gesture, Penya taps her index finger against her lips. I cross my arms. “You said anyone could time travel.” “Yes, but under reasonable circumstances. By trying it here, you risk much. Arcing a virgin traveler must be your last resort. And you must move with her, like Constantine.” “How much prep does she need?” “She is Constantine’s, which leads me to believe she will need less than most, but still . . .” “I’ll try to get them to stop, but—” She jerks toward something over my shoulder and disappears. I spin. A chariot crests the small hill with Aurelia in it beside a towering black man. Behind me, Penya’s voice carries down a long tunnel. “Think of all possibilities. Do not disregard what seems impossible. There is no impossible. Not for you.” I flinch. Splashes of water spray behind Aurelia’s chariot. At this pace, I have minutes. Don’t disregard what seems impossible, Penya said. Well, that’s about everything. Not a lot of ways to stop a chariot. All I have is a lot of lightning, and maybe a little luck. They’re forced to slow behind a large group clogging the road. I glance behind me. The river has risen to cover at least another foot of reeds. They would have been up and over the bridge without this latest delay. Less than a mile separates me from the chariot. Impossible. Unless I arc there. “Too reckless,” I say to the damp air. Any arc I try between now and the alteration costs me. Each one will jump time forward and pull me closer to her death. And considering I’ve only managed to hit my target once out of all the times I’ve arced, this is not my best idea. Never mind that this time I’m trying to hit a moving one and not kill or maim anybody. My heart pounds, nearly deafening me to every other sound. Thunder rumbles, and a blanket of humidity drops from the sky. I can taste the moisture. I have to try, even if the next one leaves me only seconds. At the hint of request, twin snakes of lightning tumble from my palms and darkness blinds me. I land ten feet behind the chariot and scare an old woman carrying a basket of greens. She screams and runs away, cursing about gods and their storm. I arc back to my starting point, jumping me forward ten seconds. Now I have less than a quarter mile to get this right, and my aim is worse than usual. I compress another ball, keeping it tight against my belly. This time when I land, the chariot wheel skims my shin and Aurelia’s startled face whips backward as she goes by. The driver flicks the reins, and the horse surges through the crowd then slows hard in a bottleneck. Last chance. No more errors. I focus every particle of thought on the horse, on feeling its warm skin beneath my hands, short slick bay coat beneath my palms. I picture weaving the wiry mane through my fingers, feeling the harness bounce beneath me. Lightning flares into an egg shape and stretches into a jagged square. I scowl and force it into a normal ball and arc before it changes again. My feet slip on the sweaty leather as I land on the horse’s back. Crap. Too much movement. I yelp like a sissy and fall forward onto the horse’s neck. Frantic, I grab a handful of mane, push up into a half crouch, and squint through the pelting rain. Since I can barely ride a horse with a saddle, I’m not sure why I thought this was a doable idea. I dig the toes of my boots under the wet harness across the base of its neck and situate myself. The horse surges ahead and bucks, not happy about me, I’m sure. I crouch lower, drop a knee to the middle of the horse’s bouncing back, and twist around. The reins hang loose in the driver’s hand, and his mouth is frozen in shock. Aurelia peeks under his outstretched arm, more curious than scared. Taking advantage of the slack, the horse lengthens his stride, making me lose my precious balance. I slip sideways and roll, but manage to hang on through the biting leather twisting my fingers. One boot sails over my head and through the air then smacks hard against the packed road. My legs are stretched enough to win the lead in a ballet competition, but I push my foot deeper into the harness and press my heel against the horse. Every muscle from my ankle to my hip is on fire. I bear down and force my legs together, pulling myself back on. The driver regains his senses and yanks the horse to a stop. I pat the bay’s neck, and damp hairs stick to my hand. I wipe it on the bottom of my shirt but don’t slide off, wary of giving them any opportunity to flee. Aurelia pokes her head around the giant driver. “Why, it’s just a girl.” I smile back. Been a while since I’ve been called that. “Es in periculo, Aurelia.” You’re in danger, Aurelia. “There’s a flood coming. I know this is drastic. Showing up on your horse—” “How did you appear like that? Will you teach me?” A smile sweetens Aurelia’s face. My own widens into a grin. I can’t help it. It shouldn’t surprise me that Aurelia can take my arrival in stride. After all, Constantine did. “Let’s worry about you first.” Beneath me, the horse fidgets, and I swing my leg over his rump and slide to the ground. A ball of nerves quivers in my stomach and I step quickly away from his fidgeting hooves. For now, Aurelia’s curiosity will keep her from bolting, so I ease my way around the back of the chariot. I smile at her again and avoid eye contact with the seething driver. “I need you to turn around. There’s a flood coming.” The driver sweeps Aurelia behind him and puts his big body between us. “Who are you? The river appears fine. This is mere rain. We can make it if we hurry. Your intrusion is our only delay.” His tone lowers. “Any threat against Aurelia will cost you more than your magic, sorceress.” Great, here we go again with the sorceress thing. I force a smile and hold up my hands. “I’m not here to harm her. That’s the last time you’ll see my magic.” I hope. Aurelia turns back to me. “How do you know who I am?” This might get tricky. “I know your father. He sent me to save you.” From another time. “Why didn’t he tell me not to go today?” I slowly lower my hands. “There’s a lot I don’t have time to tell you. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me. If I’m wrong, you can go in an hour.” Aurelia lays a hand on the driver’s arm. “Rom? What if she speaks truth? We could use a break. I wouldn’t mind setting a small meal.” He dips his chin, and in the depth of his gaze something else mixes with his duty to obey her. I bite back the smile. Wears his heart on his sleeve where Aurelia’s concerned . . . Pretty sure I can use that against him if I need it. His head lowers in a silent bow of acquiescence. “We can return to the small copse of trees before the hill if you wish.” When he turns his attention to me, all softness is gone, replaced by hard features that immediately convey the threat. “Will that suffice?” “I don’t know,” I answer honestly. “Stay alert. We might need to move quickly.” Aurelia presses to the far side of the chariot and gestures to the extra space. “Come.” I step onto the woven leather floor and reach around Aurelia to grab a handhold. Pretty sure Rom won’t make any effort to keep me in the vehicle. As I settle myself, Aurelia’s fingertips brush my pants. I stiffen, but she gives me a shy smile as she faces forward. Rom turns the chariot around with a flick of the reins, and as the wheels pivot, it’s impossible to miss the black sky to the north. The short hairs rising on my nape have nothing to do with the drenching rain, and I shiver as icy tentacles tighten around my limbs. Rom pulls us to a halt again and we stare openmouthed at the utter blackness. He glances over his shoulder and studies me. He’s still not happy about the added delay, but his resentment slips away as the sky darkens. I check the swirler of a cloud. A huge circle is turning and the eye has a definite cone shape forming toward the earth. Thunder rumbles and the breeze picks up, pushing debris across the road and whipping at nearby pedestrians’ clothes and possessions. The horse fidgets and jerks Rom’s arms and upper body forward. He searches the traffic pattern of the people, his head on a swivel. I track his movements and bite my lip. We don’t have many options to get us out of the crowd. He sends us through a tiny opening and turns us off the road, coaxing the bay forward up the hill. People are everywhere. I can barely tell where the road ends. We ease our way over the short grass that’s now been trampled by hundreds of feet. Another large group crests from the backside at the same time, and Rom slows us to a walk until we’re through the crowd’s thickest part. Restless, the horse swings his frontend to the left and pushes a man and boy deeper into the thick pulsing mob. Rom croons to the big bay and leans forward to stroke the dark hip. The gesture doesn’t calm any of us. I don’t like this. Waiting it out seems too easy. Too vulnerable. I’d rather get her out of here. “We’re almost there.” Aurelia grips the front of the bucket and leans forward. At the top of the hill, the clumps of trees make small pockets of dry ground, but if this storm gets any worse, it’s not the brightest spot to wait out a lightning storm. That would be my luck though . . . save Aurelia from a flood to kill her with regular lightning. I scan the landscape. For now, there’s no other place to run. A baby screams and the bay rears, scattering the rest of the travelers around the chariot and inching us back down the hill until I can no longer see over the top. While Rom wrestles to get the horse controlled, I glance again at the storm clouds. They’ve doubled in size, roiling like an overflowing pot of black oil. Not good. Rom curses, and I wonder if he’s reconsidering his ban on my sorcery. The slightly inconvenient mist becomes real rain, quieting the wind, but drenching us within seconds. Time to go. I’ve given Rom long enough to get us out of here. I grip the chariot’s iron scrollwork until it bites my palms. I close my eyes and breathe. This has to work. The ozone stings my nostrils, and I fight to control my racing heart and the panic of screwing this up. Constantine’s angry tirade of the last time doesn’t help, and I silence the memory. Bad enough it’s his daughter I’m saving. Lightning flares from my fingers and I make the coil swing beneath the bucket. Pedestrians closest to the chariot freak out and press away, tightening the crowd and squashing the spaces Rom was using to maneuver the horse through. Doesn’t matter. I tighten my grip, dig deep, and curl another strand around the top of the bucket to get us out of there. The lightning flares and jerks away from the bucket then slams it like a battering ram. Darkness flickers. I hold tight to the image of Constantine’s house, but something yanks it away like a paper in a storm. Images layer over the top of each other and we spin left, then right like we’re in a psychotic tornado. We crash-land at the river’s edge, behind the entire group, giving up every foot we’d gained. The horse backs up faster than I’ve ever seen him go forward, and Rom does nothing to stop him. Aurelia grabs Rom’s arm and raises her voice. “Rom!” Crap. I knew he wouldn’t be able to handle it, but Aurelia was supposed to be safe. It was supposed to be worth the risk. Not this. Not both parts wrong. I don’t understand why nothing works like it’s supposed to. Rom gives himself a hard shake, but he wobbles and sags against the side of the chariot. I lean forward and slap the horse hard enough to make my entire hand sting and my elbow ache. He jumps to a stop, snorts, and takes a tentative step forward. Aurelia puts her hands on Rom’s cheek, and her touch pulls him out of his stupor. His eyes lose their glassiness and he smothers her fingers with his own. I give him half a second to recover. “No time for this!” My terseness jerks him upright and he sweeps Aurelia behind him. “You said no more magic.” “Really?” I yell. “You pick now to chew me out?” I point at the river less than three feet from the wheels of the chariot. He glares at me and pats the horse’s quivering rump. The tight skin by his lips is still an ashy gray. Scooping the reins, he swallows and clucks softly while he rubs the horse’s coat. It seems scared. Super glad we’re tied to the damn thing with a thousand straps and buckles. At least jumping out is closer to the ground than jumping off. “Now what?” Rom yells while his head whips back and forth, eying one end of the crowd to the other. The path to the top of the hill is covered with people frantic to cross the river. We are so screwed. I completely robbed us of every gain. Overhead, thunder rumbles. Both the road and path to the top of the hill clog with travelers, and not just the group we met. That bunch is almost to the bridge, but there’s a constant stream rounding the hill, creating a massive bottleneck. Very few take the small walkway toward the town on this side of the river, choosing instead to head toward the bridge. Maybe if most of the group were able-bodied young men, this wouldn’t have disaster written all over it, but moms carry babies and parcels, men lead animals and wagons loaded with cages of goods, and clumps of elderly men and women block the passage of everyone else. Easygoing attitudes fall by the wayside as more people push and shove to get over the river. I wish I’d have taken the time to get a better view of the backside of the hill when we were on top. “Where are these people coming from?” “The city,” Rom answers with a grunt as the horse leaps forward. “They went in to trade early this morn, but know the river will trap them if they don’t cross before the storm.” I glare at him. Just “mere rain,” my ass. He knew this was coming. He scowls back, the unsaid threat clear. Do not alarm Aurelia any more than you already have. Then stop working against me. I scowl back. He breaks contact as Aurelia says, “Those people will die if she speaks the truth. We cannot let them.” Rom stiffens and glances at me. Now the unsaid is worry and a plea. I’m in agreement and grip Aurelia’s elbow. “You can’t go. I’m here to keep you safe. There’s no way I’m letting you anywhere near that water.” She leans dangerously over the edge of the chariot. “But all those poor people.” I open my mouth and close it again. Nothing I can say will make this easier. But I can’t exactly stand here and watch them die, either. “Will you stay?” I ask her. “If Rom and I go to save them, will you stay put?” She sucks her lower lip between her teeth and nods. “I promise.” A worried pallor lightens the skin around Rom’s cheekbones. “This is a bad idea. We need to worry about Aurelia.” “But those people—” she says. “Are not you,” Rom says, interrupting and lowering his intense gaze until their noses almost touch. She plants her hands on her hips, lifts her chin, and glares back, managing to look imposing. “You will obey me, Rom.” He crosses his arms and mimics her. “I obey your father.” “Fine, then I’ll tell him you killed hundreds of people today and put me in danger.” His flinch is nearly imperceptible. If anything, he increases in size. “You wouldn’t dare.” “Would, too.” “Seconds matter here, people,” I say, interrupting. “Aurelia, I agree with Rom. Your safety is paramount.” “Look.” She points toward an outcropping on the other side of the road. “Take me there and I’ll wait. I promise not to stray.” The spot isn’t as high as I’d like, but we might have plenty of time to get her out of here before the water rises much more. Unless something goes wrong. A shiver coils around my spine. This is stupid. I need to get her safe, not the rest of these people. Ilif would never let a tourist get in the way of an arc. “No.” “Please.” She grabs my arm and tugs. “All these children. Please.” The plea in her voice breaks my heart, and for no other reason than because Ilif wouldn’t, I relent. Unless Rom tells her no. Rom uncrosses his arms. “Five attempts,” he says. “After that, we go.” Dammit. She looks to me for a counter, but I nod. An uneasy nausea builds as she beams and kisses our cheeks. First mine and then Rom’s, with a lingering touch at his jawline. Even though I avoid his attention, there’s no mistaking Rom’s glare as he urges the horse toward the outcropping. “Use your magic if it will keep her safe.” I clench my jaw. This is beyond stupid. I assume his reference to five “attempts” gives me less than fifteen minutes. Barely enough time to alert everyone near the bridge and get the stragglers across it, but hopefully it’s enough for Aurelia. Rom eases us back through the swarm of people until the outcropping edges alongside the chariot. Raindrops slide down my forehead and drip from my jaw, but I’ve stopped trying to stay dry. Hordes of travelers bump against our metal basket, making it sway and rock in the wheelset. Any confidence I’ve had in its construction wanes. Every small movement grates on my nerves, and I can almost hear the second hand of an invisible clock ticking loudly beside my ear. The horse prances in time to the second hand, our own personal metronome of impending doom. Aurelia turns to Rom. “Be safe. Please come back to me. . .” He lifts a dark hand to her porcelain cheek, but halts before making contact, leaving a stretch of air between them. Aurelia presses forward, closing the inches. His caress is butterfly soft. “I must come back. Who else will keep you from trouble?” She doesn’t laugh at his weak attempt at levity, but curls her slim fingers around his, answering his unsaid feelings. A cold river of rain leaks under my collar. I force myself not to fidget. Come on, come on. He clears his throat and straightens, dropping his arm. She spins and grabs my hands. “Come back and teach me these fantastic things you know.” I bite back my antsiness. She’s a whole lot of Constantine with a sprinkle of his sister, Anna. I could like her. But first, I have to save her. Keep reading Shadow Boxer on Amazon. To download the first book in the series, Lightning Rider, for FREE.",
