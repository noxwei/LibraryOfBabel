      "content": "Prologue: Flopping into the window sill seat, Andrea stares out at the trees. Her Grand-dad started Westwood Orchards over thirty-five years ago, and business has never been better. The small store her Grams sells baked goods, jellies and produce out of is busy this time of year, which means while Grams and Andrea's Momma run the store, 'Drea helps Grand-dad with the apples in the orchard. She watches as her Grand-dad kisses her Grams under the pre-dusk stars, even after putting in a full day harvesting he still walks her through the orchard every night. \"'Drea?\" A voice calls from the bathroom. Smiling she sighs, \"Oh Momma, isn't it so romantic?\" Climbing into the seat, Cassandra Westwood pulls her daughter into her lap. \"You know my precious one, the orchard is magical. It brought your Grand-dad and Grams together; they put all of their love into this place.\" Misty eyed she continues, \"It brought your father to me, even if for just a time.\" \"Oh Momma, I could never leave here. Not ever.\" 'Drea says as she watches her grandparents disappear into the trees arm and arm. Knowing her Momma's heart never fully mended after that summer. Andrea's father, a drifter that her Grand-dad hired for the summer harvest. Cass and Paul had loved fast and hard beneath the trees that summer. Fall came and Paul left for parts unknown. Soon after Cass learned of her pregnancy, but was never able to find Paul. To this day she aches for him. \"Andrea Ruth.\" Cassandra says as she brushes out 'Drea's tangled black hair. \"You are only eleven years old, of course you will grow up and leave here, go to college, have a career. I want so much for you, my precious one.\" \"I want love Momma, I want magic.\" 'Drea says with a pout as she climbs into bed. \"You shall have it in time, 'Drea. You have plenty of time to do it all, with us all cheering you on. I love you 'Drea.\" She soothes as she kisses her on the cheek. 'Drea jerks awake in a cold sweat, checking her surroundings. \"Oh it was so real.\" She murmurs to herself as she checks her phone for the time, as unwelcome tears stream down her face. In the years since her Momma had died she had plenty of nightmares; gory flashes of the crash, of her Momma dying there in front of her before help came. She could smell the gas leaking or see the broken guard rail. Never had she dreamed of the happy times at Westwood Orchards, those were forgotten. Her Momma had died ten years ago, her Grand-dad nearly three. Thriving in New York as a chef, 'Drea was engaged to be married. Until two days ago she thought the new life she had built was perfect. After her fiancé. Phillip had been caught giving a waitress the hands on approach, she couldn't continue to work there or marry him for that matter. Still she wondered which she'd miss more... After walking out amidst the dinner rush, she came home to a message from Grams. She couldn't say no to Grams, so after packing everything 'Drea jumps into her car without even a word to Phillip. \"Saving the orchard is all that matters.\" She tells herself as she left the city for good. Done with thinking and deciding to give up on sleep, 'Drea dresses and checks out of the hotel. \"Won't be long now 'Drea.\" She sighs. Just two hundred more miles and she would be face to face with the very thing she had run from ten years ago... The past. Grams needs her, and she will do anything to save Westwood Orchards. \"I know this will work, I can make it work. Just please, let the magic still be there... let it be real.\" Chapter One: Small towns and lingering memories. As Andrea Westwood pulls up in front of her family's fruit orchard she sighs. It has been ten years since she set foot in her childhood home, when her Momma died in a car crash, she had to get out of here and she never looked back. Until now. The crisp, cool Virginia air blows through her long black hair as she walks up to the house. It is nothing like New York, after being there as a high paid head chef of one of the city's biggest restaurants 'Drea is in shock of how nothing here has changed. The yard, the house, the fences all the same as when she left. Things change in New York every day, sometimes hourly. Here, it is like time stands still, and with only about three-hundred people in this town, they all know everything about everyone and there are no secrets. There is no fast food, no Wal-mart, and no Starbucks. She had lost cell service in and out on the way here, so surely Wi-Fi is out of the question. \"People need a passport to come here; it is like a whole nother planet.\" She says out loud to herself. \"Well not if you were born here, Missy. It tends to linger in the blood.\" \"Grams!\" 'Drea says smiling as she walks up the old wooden porch steps and hugs her grandmother, joining her on the old swing. \"Oh Sugar, it is so good to have you home. I have missed having someone around here call me something other than Ms. Ruthie. How was your trip?\" \"Long... but it gave me time to think so it was so good. I am having my things shipped down here. Since New York is over for me, I thought I would stay here for a while anyway, at least until I figure out what I want to do.\" \"Of course, Sugar. This is your home, it always has been. Come on let's get on inside, I am sure you are starved.\" \"The orchard looks like it needs some TLC Grams, the store too. When does the handy man come in?\" 'Drea asks as she nibbles at her turkey sandwich. \"Don't have one, no need.\" Ruthie says handing 'Drea a glass of iced tea. \"Grams...\" 'Drea says with a regretful sigh. \"Neither of us can do the heavy lifting around here. We need a man to do it, possibly a few. I put an ad in the paper, before I left New York. I am sure they will start calling and showing up in no time.\" Ruthie looks over her coffee mug, \"If you are sure Sugar.\" \"I am. Also, I need to see the books. I will get the bills squared away and start getting things ready for the store to open as soon as possible.\" \"OK. You're old room is ready for you Sugar, so you can get settled in.\" \"Alright Grams, thank you.\" 'Drea says as she finishes her sandwich. The kitchen is in perfect condition. No one in town would argue that Ms. Ruthie's pies and jams aren't the best in the county. She keeps an immaculate kitchen and that was one thing 'Drea was counting on. Baking and cooking have always been 'Drea's constants, they never change. It is her safe place, her one way to relax and just be. Oh how proud Grams would have been to have seen her in her element in New York... No! That's over now, 'Drea reminds herself. She needs to let it go and find her dream, open her own little shop, bake and sell her own recipes. First, she has to save the orchard and her Grams, which is long enough for her to lick her wounds and re-calculate after Phillip. Surely he will have trashed her reputation in New York, so a new start in a new place is exactly what she needs. \"It is so good to have you home, 'Drea. I have missed you Sugar.\" 'Drea smiles, \"Me too Grams, everything is going to be good now.\" Kissing her Grams on the cheek, 'Drea heads out to unpack the car. Once she is settled in her old room, she changes into a pair of jeans and a green hooded pullover. She whisks her hair up into a pony-tail and heads out to the store to see how much she can get done. The old log cabin store is covered in over-grown brush and shrubs. The dust and cobwebs look like they have been there since 'Drea left. \"Well, I am not above hard labor.\" She says to herself as she takes a small axe from the porch and shoves up her sleeves. After over thirty minutes, she has a good sized pile in the middle of the yard. Since her Grams is busy in the kitchen making apple pies, 'Drea sprawls out in the grass. Dirty and sweaty, she stares up at the sky, like she did as a child. Back then, her Momma and she would stare at the clouds and 'Drea would dream. All those wonderful things she wanted in life; the shop she would have, the man she would marry, a family. Always ever present in those dreams was Westwood Orchards. Never did she want to leave here, but when her Momma died just after 'Drea's graduation from high school, the sight of anything here was much too painful. \"Well Momma, I am back. I am home.\" Choking back a sob, she squeezes her eyes shut, letting her fingers spread wide in the grass. \"When I left, it hurt so much to be here, I miss you so much. Jesus, Momma. I was an idiot. Phillip! Oh how I wish you were here to have told me he was no good for me. I nearly let him destroy me. I sacrificed parts of me, my dreams. I gave up parts of me for a man I didn't love, and who didn't love me. That's over now. It is all about Grams, me and Westwood Orchards now and to hell with any damned thing else.\" \"Andrea Ruth, that mouth!\" 'Drea opens her eyes and winces, \"Sorry Grams, I was talking to Momma.\" \"I have half a mind to wash that mouth out young lady. Now get up, we have company.\" Ruthie says in a huff. 'Drea jerks up and blushes full on red, although through all the sweat and dirt it was hard to see much of it. \"Oh sorry.\" She shrieks jumping to her feet, coming toe to toe with her Grams and a man...a man who is smirking at her. \"This is Nathan Kyle. He has been in town a couple of months now, and I trust him. He will do whatever you need done, Sugar. I will leave you two; supper will be ready at 5:00.\" \"Yes Ma'am, Ms. Ruthie.\" He says as she turns and leaves them together. 'Drea looks him over, as he sizes her up. \"Nice to meet you Mr. Kyle.\" He chuckles and smiles, \"Nate. Mr. Kyle was my father.\" She smiles as she takes him in. At well over six foot tall, Nate was built like a machine. Brown eyes that look like perfectly melted chocolate and golden shaggy waves that drop over his eye brows. His jeans are worn and tore at the thigh, and his white pull-over is tight across his chest and shoulders. Shaking her head absentmindedly she takes a breath, \"Oh, OK. Nate, I was clearing the brush and debris from the store-front. I want it ready to open as soon as possible.\" \"Forgive me for speaking out of turn Miss Westwood, but Ms. Ruthie isn't able to keep up with the demands of all the baking the shop needs.\" Nate says protectively. \"It's Andrea... 'Drea. Also, I am well aware of my Grams' condition. Which is why I am here. I am a capable chef and I will open the store and handle it myself. Of course whatever help Grams wants to give is great. When the time comes I will hire out for more help.\" \"Oh, your Grams hadn't really told me much about your plans 'Drea.\" \"That's because she doesn't know them. I only arrived this morning after her call not even 48 hours ago. There has been little discussion, but this place is magical and I won't let it go under because it means too much to her and me.\" \"What do you need me to do?\" Nate says with a smile. Nate never thought that Ms. Ruthie's grand-daughter would come in and plan to save the day. He assumed her every intention was to fix it up and sell it off. Boy was he wrong. She was pretty, strikingly. She was curvy in all the right places, and her beautiful black hair and emerald green eyes made his heart beat a little harder. She was a Westwood, beautiful, passionate, and giving. All this and just knowing her five minutes... Jesus Nate get a grip! Women don't mix with your plan man... A warm body every now and then and again...sure that's great, but nothing like 'Drea. You don't get mixed up with a girl like her when all you want to do is be able to outrun the past. Andrea Westwood was a keeper. She could see into his eyes all the way down to his soul and that could shatter them both. Andrea Westwood had 'keeper' written all over her face. After the better part of the afternoon of following 'Drea around like a puppy Nate has a list of things to get done: fences to mend, rooms to paint, a roof to repair, not to mention a kitchen to update in the store and display cases to build. She knew what she wanted and how she wanted it, she was totally in control and Nate was speechless in awe of her plans. \"Electrical and plumbing should be checked too, but I would think you would want a bonded professional for that. I can find someone for you.\" Nate says as they lock up the store. \"OK, that would be great. I haven't been home in ten years, so I wouldn't even know who to call.\" \"This place is stranded in time.\" Nate says with a chuckle. His brown eyes sparkle with flecks of gold and 'Drea is lost in them. \"Nothing much ever changes around here.\" \"Yeah, tell me about it.\" 'Drea smiles as they walk through the orchard back up to the house. \"So Nate, where are you from and how did you end up here?\" \"Born and raised in Iowa. Then I got out of there when I was nineteen, traveled with work. Now I just sort of landed here.\" \"Oh sounds like fun. I have only been here and New York. I never thought I would leave here...'Drea says as her voice trails off. \"Really?\" Nate asks eyeing her. He swears he can hear her trying to hide pain in her voice. \"Why did you leave then 'Drea? It is obvious you love it here.\" She stops and turns as their eyes meet, his eyes seem to study her trying to delve into her and search for all the answers. She shivers and shakes it off, \"Oh after high school graduation... you know stupid teenage girl.\" She replies shrugging it off. Nate realizes as he nods a simple reply that there is much more to this story, but decides it best to let it lie as she has laid it... for now. What business is it of his anyway? Giving her a smile, letting her know that the discussion is over they turn and walk to the house. As the front door opens, the smell of pot roast and fresh cornbread hit them both right away. \"If she would marry me, I wouldn't want for another thing in my life.\" Nate says with a sigh. \"God, is that apple pie too?\" 'Drea smiles, \"Yes it is, and sorry no one would ever measure up to Grand-dad. You will have to settle with a food affair, like everyone else.\" \"This is what she tells me. I was hoping to sway her with diamonds and flowers, a man can dream can't he?\" He teases nudging her with his elbow. \"Get in here you two, supper is done. Don't make me come a huntin' for ya!\" \"Yes, Ma'am.\" 'Drea and Nate both say in unison. \"She loses her 'gs' when she gets irritated or impatient. Just a tip.\" 'Drea says to him with a giggle. \"I'll do well to remember that, especially when she has a skillet in her hand.\" He snickers making 'Drea toss her head back and laugh. They way her green eyes sparkle when she laughed...like emeralds in sunshine...made his knees go weak. Later that night as she lay in bed, 'Drea's mind wanders. She thinks back to the store and how much she wants to do with it. To the orchards and all the fruit that will be ready soon to use in the kitchen. To her Grams, who is not admitting how bad off she is but 'Drea is determined to deal with it all accordingly. Then finally and lingering to Nate. He will be a hard worker to get everything done, so she can open the store, do big things with the orchard and maybe even fix up the house to make Grams' life easier. It doesn't hurt that he is scorch-the-sheets-hot. How will she ever get any work done around him? She may have to learn to cook wearing a blindfold. He could be a welcomed distraction... She quickly dismisses the thought. No 'Drea men are off limits! This is just about Grams and you fixing up the orchard and bringing it back to its glory days. She repeats the thoughts over and over in her head, as a mantra as she drifts. And damnit all if she doesn't dream of melted chocolate and ripped Levi's. In town Nate tosses and turns in his small bed at his apartment above Vanover’s Grocery. Why is it that every time he closes his eyes he sees her? He promised Ms. Ruthie he would help do whatever was needed. She was the only one who accepted him here at first. When he showed up in town, people were skittish. She gave him work, which with a flush bank account he didn’t really need the money. Hard work took his mind off things. She cooked for him, made him pies and treated him like family, something he never really had. Now there is ‘Drea, she is so much like her Grams. Which makes this all the more important for him to help them. As sleep takes him, he doesn’t have nightmares tonight. For the first time since he can remember he sleeps peacefully. Tonight Nate’s dreams are of a raven haired, green-eyed goddess and he knows now he is in trouble, big trouble. Chapter Two: Change in the Wind ‘Drea spends most of the next few days, cleaning the kitchen in the store, she has ordered her updated kitchen appliances and both the plumber and electrician gave them a clean bill of health. Nothing could have been more perfect, all her things had been delivered and she unpacked and organized everything with glee. The kitchen inside the store would rival all kitchens, she thought as she turned to throw a box to the pile by the door she slams into Nate. “Oh! Shit, sorry you snuck up on me.” She says with a squeal. He was warm and all man, ‘Drea thought. Shaking her head, she pulls away. Bad idea, she scolds herself. Nate felt a pang of disappointment as she turned from him and frowned unsure why. “You have been busy ‘Drea. The new appliances will be here tomorrow right?” His question made those emerald eyes sparkle with excitement. “Yes, and then I will be baking away in here. Grams was able to talk the grocer into delivering all I needed tomorrow as well.” Her eyes brighten and dance with excitement making Nate pants become uncomfortable. He was staring at a woman who put his sanity and his dick in a vise…and he was enjoying it. How sick was he? “Nate! I can bake in here tomorrow, I can’t wait!” ‘Drea’s excitement makes him smile, “What do you bake ‘Drea?” He asks scratching his chin. Wiping the sweat from her forehead she smiles, “You come in here tomorrow afternoon, and you can see for yourself.” “Well you have a deal, I am more than happy to play taste tester. I fixed the fences in the orchard; I will start on the roof now. Tomorrow I can paint the front room and get measurements for the display cases.” “That would be great; it seems you have been busy yourself. I sure hope you’re hungry, Grams is making fried chicken and will not take no for an answer.” “Well I can’t say no to a beautiful woman, who cooks.” Nate says teasing. “I had better get to the roof and earn that supper.” He nudges her playfully and walks outside. After ‘Drea is done in the kitchen, she walks out to the grass and sprawls out with a bottle of water: Nate is up on the roof, shirtless repairing the busted shingles. ‘Drea watches as his muscles bunch as he nails each shingle into place, those torn Levi’s stretch as he bends. Wow. ‘Drea wonders what his strong arms would feel like around her, making her shiver with want. Suddenly his eyes meet hers and she freezes. Damn, busted! “Enjoying the view?” He asks playfully raising a brow. ‘Drea takes a drink of her water, her mouth suddenly dry, “Um…what?” She asks innocently. “Oh, you heard me Sugar.” He teases bending to pick up another shingle, giving her another heat flash. “I am just cooling off.” She says shakily. Nate chuckles, “That’s the last thing on your mind ‘Drea.” “Oh honestly!” ‘Drea sighs. “Anytime you want a closer look Sugar, just ask.” Nate teases as ‘Drea goes into the kitchen to get another water. Pacing around the kitchen island ‘Drea scolds herself. “Idiot! What were you thinking? It’s one thing to oogle; it is another thing entirely to get caught, Jesus ‘Drea!” “So you were oogling me?” ‘Drea jumps and jerks into the island. “Damn it, what are you a ninja?” Pulling his shirt on Nate laughs, “So was it one thing in particular you were oogling or just the whole package in general?” Taking her water from her hand he gulps it down. “Oh my God! Don’t say package!” ‘Drea shrieks as she blushes crimson. Nate roars with laughter. “Don’t sweat it ‘Drea, you are worth the oogle yourself.” “Let’s go eat.” She stutters. As they walk out toward the orchard, his arm brushes hers making her shudder. Nate notices and smiles at her, his heart racing. Jesus Nate! Over a touch! Are you a horny teenager or what? He knew he shouldn’t have teased her over watching him but, he liked getting her all worked up, those green eyes of hers dance with fire. After dinner ‘Drea sits on the porch swing staring out at the orchard. Nate strolls out and sits beside her. “Hey.” He says nudging her with his knee. “Penny for your thoughts?” “Hey.” She replies sighing, “I missed the quiet and the trees. I could stare at it all night.” “Me too ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly. ‘Drea peaks over at him watching her and blushes. “Sorry to bail but I have an early morning…deliveries and all.” ‘Drea says nervously standing. “Yeah, I’ll see you ‘Drea.” Nate says as he walks down to his truck and then he is gone. Shaking her head, trying to figure out what the hell what was all about, ‘Drea goes to bed. From the window, Ms. Ruthie shakes her head with a chuckle, holding the photo from her wedding day. “Well Frank our ‘Drea is finally home. It seems to be getting interesting around here. Seems to me, love may be in the air again darling. She is broken right now but, I think being home and Nathan Kyle are just what she needs.” The next morning ‘Drea practically dances up to the store. Shortly after 8:00 am, two delivery men set up the new kitchen appliances. Just as she signs the slips and old black truck pulls up with ‘Vanover Grocery’ printed on the side. “Well Andrea Ruth, as I live and breathe. Look at you all grown up.” A white haired man says as he unloads bags with Nate. “Mr. Vanover, how are you?” ‘Drea replies with a smile. “Just look at me honey, I am doing well.” He says with a chuckle. “Yes, Sir. Thank you for the delivery.” “You just make my day, bake an old man somethin’ good.” Mr. Vanover says as ‘Drea pays him and he kisses her cheek. “It is good to see you home again ‘Drea.” “It is good to be home, see you.” She replies as he climbs into the truck and pulls out. “Drea walks into the store kitchen and starts putting away groceries. “Did I get replaced as taste tester?” Nate teases as he sits the last of the bags on the bar. “No of course not. This afternoon?” ‘Drea answers with a smile. Nate smiles making ‘Drea’s knees go weak, and then leaves. Shaking it off ‘Drea cranks her IPod in her stereo deck. As REO Speedwagon blares on about Ridin’ the storm out “Drea is rolling dough and filling cake pans. Nate peeks in watching her; she is maxing icing swaying to the music. Shaking his head he chuckles to himself and starts measuring the room for the display cases he is going to build. Later that afternoon, Nate’s stomach forces him to notice the smells coming from the kitchen. Peaking around the door he shouts, “Is it safe?” No answer… He walks in and sees ‘Drea shimmying to the music, as she adds meringue to a butterscotch pie. He stands in awe as the smells hit him; she is baking pies, cakes and he swears he can smell donuts. “’Drea?” He shouts again. This time she turns and smiles, “You caught me. I couldn’t stop once I started. Nate lets out the breath he didn’t realize he had been holding, making ‘Drea laugh. “Why Nate…” She says arching a brow, “Were you oogling?” Laughing he just nods, yes he was staring watching her ass shake to the music as she danced around the island made him hard. He was hard and laughing… that isn’t normal. Changing the subject he glances around the room, “It smells amazing. I got the room ready to paint and the measurements for the cases… Um, do I smell donuts ‘Drea?” Nate says sniffing. “Yes, just out of the fryer.” She replies gesturing to the granite island where the baked goods lie cooling. “Sit, I’ll get you a plate and some coffee.” “Who am I to turn down a woman who can cook?” He teases as he sits at the small table in the kitchen and ‘Drea places a plate with donuts on it and hands him a cup of coffee. He bites into a still hot donut and groans, “Damn ‘Drea these are amazing. You will be a millionaire.” “Thanks.” She says as she pulls a cobbler out of the oven and replaces it with a cake. Sitting the cobbler down to cool, she pours herself a coffee and sits next to Nate. He reaches over and strokes her cheek, making her shudder. “You had some meringue.” Nate says as he licks his finger, his brown eyes flickering with heat. “Oh thanks I…um.” She stops as Nate stands to his feet and pulls her up so that they are toe to toe. “’Drea, I…” He starts, then curses, “Oh I am going to go to hell for this.” Cupping her jaw, he crushes his lips to hers. She sighs and pulls her hands through his hair. After a moment of weakness she pulls back. “Nate, we can’t ah…I can’t… I’m sorry.” She says as she goes lax in his arms. “I should be apologizing. I would if I could remember my name. Wow! I mean I… um sorry ‘Drea. I am going to get back to painting, thanks for the donuts.” As he turns and walks to the door she calls to him. “Nate…” As he turns she continues, “I said I can’t, I didn’t say that I didn’t want to. I am just out of a bad break-up and well…” “It’s OK, ‘Drea, we all have our pasts.” He says and then he is gone. Hours later ‘Drea finishes baking, boxes everything up and stores it in the cooler, except for the butterscotch pie. She boxes it up to take to the house for dessert hoping to clear the air with Nate. As the thunder explodes, the rain starts pelting down in sheets. Oh this walk ought to be fantastic! Glancing out the window, she sighs as she watches the rain pour down and lightning flash across the sky. Nate had finished painting hours ago, and left to go out and put things into the shed in the orchard. (Not that she was watching him or anything.) ‘Drea looks out through the trees as the lightning stretches across the sky, and squints looking to see if she can see Nate. Surely he is at the house waiting on his supper with Grams. Telling herself she is silly for worrying, she pours herself a mug of coffee and sits at the table picking at a donut. Suddenly, the door flies open and ‘Drea jumps knocking her chair over, jerking around she sees Nate standing at the door trying to shake out of a raincoat. “Nate, are you alright? You should be up at the house waiting on supper, not out here in this weather.” ‘Drea says as she pulls up the chair she knocked over and pours him a cup of coffee. “Ms. Ruthie went into town to play Bingo at the fire house. She packed up dinner for us and said I should come down here and make sure you eat, since you have been down here since early this morning.” He explains as he sits the bag on the island and begins unpacking the tubs of food. “There are pork chops, fried potatoes, biscuits and honey. Your Grams sure can put together a meal. You two should add on to this store and open up a restaurant.” “Don’t think I haven’t thought about it. I just don’t want her over doing it. She hasn’t really told me much of what the doctor says about her arthritis. I know she is supposed to ease up. So, baby steps you know.” ‘Drea says as she makes plates and places one in front of Nate and sits down at the table with him. “So what else did you bake today? The smells coming outta this place today were heaven. I was almost sad that I was finished painting because I couldn’t linger to enjoy them.” Nate says as he spreads honey on a biscuit and sips his coffee. “I made a blackberry cobbler, cakes, cookies, and a butterscotch pie with meringue that I made from scratch. I had so much fun in here today!” “That meringue was amazing, I tasted a bit.” He says with a wink as he bites into his pork chop. ‘Drea flushes, “Yeah, we should talk about that. I left New York to help Grams Nate, but it was convenient timing.” She starts. Nate stops and watches her eyes for a moment and smiles, “Well that’s a good thing right?” ‘Drea nods, “I worked in a high-end restaurant as head chef, and my fiancé was the owner.” “Was?” Nate eyes her with curiosity. “I walked in on him and a waitress, well one of his many waitresses. Needless to say, it is over. Far passed over and I was glad to have a reason to leave.” ‘Drea says sighing into her coffee. Nate shakes his head, “’Drea I am sorry, but he doesn’t deserve you. No one should be treated like that.” ‘Drea blushes at the protective tone in Nate’s voice. “Well, it doesn’t matter now, I am home and I am actually enjoying it. Do you want dessert?” ‘Drea asks as she stands up and gets a pie server and small plates. Nate tops off their coffees as ‘Drea places two pieces of butterscotch pie on the table. Nate bites into the pie and his eyes glaze over and close. “Oh ‘Drea, this is amazing!” He groans. “Thanks. It is Grams’ recipe, my Grand-dad’s favorite. I was feeling sentimental.” She replies as she takes a bite. “Wow, yeah I have missed this.” Nate smiles at how ‘Drea’s face softens at the mention of her grandparents. “She is an amazing lady. I didn’t know your Grand-dad but, he had to be one hell of a man to deserve her and this pie.” Nate says with a wink. “Yes.” ‘Drea starts and her eyes go misty. “She made this for them on their first date. Grand-dad said he knew right that very night that there was no one else for him. He walked her through the orchard every night for months and proposed to her out there. Even opened the store for her to bake in, they had something special.” “Yeah, go all their lives without finding anyone. No wonder she won’t run off and marry me, she already had it all.” Nate says as he touches her hand. “Can I ask you something about the ex ‘Drea?” ‘Drea tenses, “Um, yeah and his name was Phillip.” Nate secretly wishing a man in New York named Phillip would rot in the seventh circle of hell with a flesh eating crotch disease smiles at his own private joke and continues, “OK. Phillip? Were you in love with him? I mean honestly you had to be shooting for the whole she-bang after watching your grandparents all these years.” ‘Drea sighs, she felt things for Phillip. They were comfortable with each other, shared interests, they had the business, shared a condo, but did she ever really love him? “No, I guess I didn’t. I never really thought about that, we looked good together, I mean there was the restaurant and it was comfortable. No, it was nothing like Grams and Grand-dad.” Nate sighs, unexpectedly relieved, “Well, good thing you got out while you still could.” “You know I never really thought about it. I wasn’t into planning the wedding, we were engaged for over a year and I hadn’t even started looking. When I caught him I was hurt.” “Of course you were, you trusted him.” ‘Drea holds her hand up and exhales, “Wait you didn’t let me finish. I was hurt of course because everyone knew it was going on but me. I was embarrassed. The biggest part of me though was relieved. I think I knew it was over and I was a coward and needed a reason to leave. It was comfortable and I didn’t know how to just walk away. Seeing him with her, and the fact that it was over came so easily to me. He didn’t really try to fight for me. So I packed up, emptied my bank account and here I am.” Nate reaches over and intertwines her hand in his, “I am glad you are here ‘Drea.” ‘Drea swallows the lump in her throat, as her eyes meet his. Those deep brown eyes burning into hers making her blush…and want…and need. Pulling her hand from his she smiles, “Well I better clean up the dishes.” Standing she turns to the sink and washes the plates stacking them in the rack to dry, as Nate turns the music up. “You have Boston on your IPod playlist?” He asks with a smirk. “Guilty. I am a classic rock junkie. My Momma wouldn’t listen to anything else.” “Oh Sugar, you were raised right.” Nate teases. “We would take these longs drives through the mountains on the weekends, crank the stereo and sing along. She couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket but we didn’t care.” ‘Drea says, her voice cracking. “Jesus why am I talking to you like this? I have never told anyone this stuff, not even Grams.” Nate walks over and wraps his arms around her waist and kisses her hair. “Maybe you need to get this out ‘Drea, maybe you feel like you can trust me.” Nate squeezes her to him and lowers his voice to a whisper, “You know you can, Sugar. You can trust me.” She whips around, facing him tears streaming down her face. His face falls as he looks into her green eyes full of pain. “’Drea?” “The night after my graduation we went up into the mountains and we were singing along with Styx. She was going on and on about how proud she was of me. I was going to do such big things and she couldn’t wait. I told her I wasn’t going away to school, that I wanted to stay here. She exploded and I didn’t let down either, we were arguing and we didn’t see the truck. We went through the guard rail…” Nate pulls her into his arms and she cries softly. “We were in the car over the cliff for hours. I kept talking, about everything…anything… Finally help came, but it was too late. Momma was already gone, internal bleeding.” Nate’s chest tightens, his heart breaking for her. “Oh Sugar. I am so sorry, so damned sorry.” He says stroking up and down her back. “After the funeral, I packed up and left. Grams and Grand-dad begged me to stay. I didn’t even come home when he passed; it hurt too much to even be here. Everything reminded me of her. It is different now, I want to remember. I want to be here.” ‘Drea says as she sniffles and pulls back. “Oh Nate I’m sorry…I didn’t mean to…” “Hey it’s OK.” He says soothing her. “You can unload on me anytime.” He says sweetly as he strokes her cheek with his thumb. ‘Drea’s breath hitches, every inch of skin Nate touches comes alive and she gasps, “Nate…” “Still can’t?” Nate asks as his thumb brushes her bottom lip. “We shouldn’t you know it will complicate things…” She says shakily as her eyes flutter closed, “We should think about it first.” “Well, you think about it Sugar, and I will…” Nate starts as he brushes his lips over hers. Soft and warm, the kiss was tender. ‘Drea melts into Nate, her hands run up his arms and around his neck. Nate pulls her chin up and deepens the kiss, running his tongue along her bottom lip, a silent plea for her to open up to him. As his tongue meets hers desire explodes like fire. ‘Drea moans softly as she tugs at his hair. Finally, Nate pulls away breathless, looking into those emerald eyes he has been careful not to drown in. Yet. “’Drea?” “Yeah?” She replies, her body still humming from his hands and mouth. “Still thinking?” He asks as he tucks her hair behind her ear. “Um…” She starts but he pushes his lips to hers again. “You keep thinking Sugar, and I will be waiting.” Nate says turning and walking out the door, leaving ‘Drea nearly in a puddle. Chapter Three: Taking Chances Over the rest of the week, ‘Drea say little of Nate. He had been busy in the workshop in the orchard, building the display cases. She had baked and cooked until her cooler was full, even sending Mr. Vanover a weeks worth of suppers and desserts. In return he had been making deliveries so she didn’t need to leave the store to go into town. ‘Drea was in the middle of mixing up frosting when her Grams walks in and sits at the table in the kitchen. “Sugar, you have been a busy bee.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea says as Ruthie pours coffee and helps herself to cookies cooling on the rack. Ruthie watches smiling at her one and only granddaughter as she ices a black forest cake and places it in the cooler. “Dessert tonight Sugar?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, what are you planning to have tonight Grams?” “I have chicken and dumplins going on the stove and will ask Nathan to join us.” “Oh?” ‘Drea asks unable to hide the flush that steals across her face. Ruthie smiles and sighs, “Sugar, he is a good man. He comes from a hard past, but he is a good man. He thinks very highly of you.” “Does he? Well we don’t really know each other very well do we? He has been very helpful and is working very hard. We will be ready to open the store in the next week or so at this rate.” ‘Drea pops a cookie in her mouth and continues, “I have ordered more from the grocery, which should be here tomorrow. I also paid up all the bills until next month.” Ruthie slams her mug down on the table making ‘Drea jump, “Andrea Ruth Westwood, I am not talkin’ about the store, or the bills, or when the groceries are bein’ delivered by Old man Vanover.” “Grams…” ‘Drea starts but the glare from her Grams shuts her mouth right back. “I am talkin’ about the fact that you were a mess when you got here; bakin’ or Nathan Kyle or a combination of the two had changed that. Judgin’ by the look on your face when I say his name Missy I can see it is both, maybe more him.” Ruthie says scolding ‘Drea. ‘Drea knowing looks at her Grams, this woman may be her grandmother and use a walker, but if she doesn’t tread lightly here she will take ‘Drea over her knee with a wooden spoon like she used to when she would misbehave as a child. “Grams, I really love what I’m doing. Focusing on you and me getting the store opened. The trees will be ready for a harvest soon and we will be baking and canning. Oh Grams I love being home.” ‘Drea says teary. Ruthie’s eyes soften, “Oh Sugar I have missed so much, but that doesn’t change the subject though. Now I know there is somethin’ goin’ on with Nathan. Neither one of you want to talk about it with me, oh that is just fine. I am just an old woman, what do I know?” ‘Drea starts to answer but Ruthie continues, “Well I will tell you what I know Missy. I met your Grand-daddy and nearly fell for him at first sight. I made him a pie and that night I knew he was it for me. I didn’t go lookin’ for it Andrea Ruth, I didn’t. I was seventeen years old for pity’s sake. I wasn’t ready for that, but when I saw the way that ol’ teddy bear looked at me, oh that man. He looked at me like Nathan looks at you, and I know what I am sayin’ that look makes a woman go weak in the knees. You made him a butterscotch pie didn’t you Sugar?” “Yes, Ma’am I guess I kinda did. The night you went to Bingo. Grams, do you realize that when you are angry you lose your ‘gs’?” ‘Drea says stifling a giggle. “You aren’t too old to go across my knee Andrea Ruth. He is a good man. ‘Drea don’t go messin’ with his head. I just came from the workshop, gave him the same talkin’ to about you. Either you two attack this thing head on or leave it alone. No secrets and no games.” “Yes, Ma’am. Did you threaten to take him across you knee too Grams?” ‘Drea asks with a wink. Ruthie sighs, “Get outta here Andrea Ruth, I would like to try out the new kitchen and make a pie of my own.” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea replies as Ms. Ruthie kicks her out of the kitchen and into the yard. ‘Drea walks through the orchard looking up at the sky through the branches. The fruit is starting to fill the trees and the smells are heavenly. ‘Drea picks an apple and bites into it, closing her eyes to savor the taste, no apple had ever come close to tasting as good as the ones she would pick here as child. Nate told her to keep thinking…and she had been doing little else… Thinking of how good his arms felt around her, how his lips felt warm and tender on hers, and the explosion between them. She wanted him badly. ‘Drea didn’t know how she ended up outside the workshop, she didn’t intend on coming here did she? As she walked up to it, she was stopped dead in her tracks. Nate was shirtless, sanding the edges of the display cases with an electric sander. He had on low slung carpenter jeans and a tool belt that had belonged to her Grand-dad. He was drenched in sweat and unaware of her watching him. So ‘Drea decided to oogle, she decided to stand there and oogle…and want…and need…a lot. Nate wasn’t unaware of her. He had missed her, more times than he could count he wanted to go to her and tell her just that. To hell with her needing to think about them, he wanted her and hell she wanted him just as much. The moment she stepped out of the trees he knew she was there watching, but he kept sanding, making sure the edges were perfect. Moving and bending, knowing she was watching like when he was on the roof. Turning the sander off, he turns and smiles at her. “Well, ‘Drea what a pleasant surprise. Have you come to oogle me?” “Those look good.” ‘Drea replies her mouth suddenly dry. “Thank you, come take a closer look. I won’t bite Sugar.” He says with a chuckle. She walks into the workshop and smiles arching a brow, “Sound a bit like the big bad wolf don’t you?” Nate waggles a brow as she leans down looking at the cabinets. “Wow these look amazing Nate.” He walks up beside her, “They will look even better stained and filled with all those amazing things you ladies bake. When are you planning on opening?” “Hopefully next weekend, I know Grand-dad used to make a big deal of the weekends. Big displays of fruit, baked goods, and lots of people; Grams would can for days and it would be wall to wall people. Everyone knew us and it was like family, I want that back.” ‘Drea says as she smiles, standing now toe to toe with Nate… How did that happen? “It will be a good turn- out; the gossip mill is already going full blast. Start advertising, make flyers and we can harvest what is ready in the orchard and have everything set up. Ms. Ruthie has been canning like mad, and your coolers are full aren’t they?” Nate says as he strokes ‘Drea’s arm. “Yes, it is all falling into place.” ‘Drea reaches up and touches Nate’s cheek as her green eyes meet his searching. “Nate…” “Don’t ‘Drea, don’t ruin it, don’t think anymore.” Nate says crushing his lips to hers. The warm, tender kiss making her knees weak. ‘Drea could taste the salty sweat on his lip. He pulls her into him; he sighs at the smell of vanilla and meringue. He had grown needy of the smell of her and the taste of her lips. It made him nervous, he never needed someone before; he was realizing a little too late that he needed ‘Drea and the hell with everything else. ‘Drea had spent the past few days denying everything she had felt, everything her Grams had said was true. She had felt something when Nate touched her, when he kissed her. She trusted him, she told him things she had never told anyone, she cried in front of him unashamed. She couldn’t believe it but Nathan Kyle had snuck right in and made her trust, made her relax. As Nate pulled back slightly, he smiled down at her as she relaxed into his arms. “So, are we done thinking ‘Drea?” ‘Drea opens her eyes and smiles at him. “I think that whatever is going on between us is a huge mistake. One of us is going to get hurt, I am not even sure if I am going to stay here.” “’Drea…” He starts but she silences him with a kiss. “It may be a mistake…” She says as she pulls away letting him catch his breath. “But Nate, right now I don’t care. If Grams has the guts to kick me in the ass about it then maybe I should listen.” He smiles a purely sexy, wicked smile. “Sugar, I love that woman.” Nate says with a groan and kisses her again. “Grams made chicken and dumplins, I made a black forest cake, and we figured we need you to stay for supper so we don’t waste food.” ‘Drea says kissing his jaw. “Black forest cake?” Nate asks grinning against her neck. “Yes, ever had one?” “It is my favorite. I have one on every birthday; these were just store bought though. I am sure I will never be the same after yours.” ‘Drea’s breath hitches as Nate’s hands run down her back and run along the waist band of her jeans, stroking her bare back under her shirt. “W-well, I have to get back, Grams is baking in the store and I want to taste test. I will see you at supper time.” ‘Drea kisses him sweetly on the lips and heads back to the store. Nate sags against the display case and sighs, that woman will be the death of him, but what a way to go. Snapping out of it, he turns and starts staining the first case for the store. ‘Drea told Nate so much about her past, things she had told no one. Although she can tell there are things he is not saying. Things she hasn’t really asked about though either. He had such pain in his eyes when she talked about watching her Momma die in the car beside her. Was that all for her? Shaking her head to dismiss the thought, ‘Drea makes a deal with herself that she is going to enjoy this, have fun with it. When he leaves town or she does, it will be a clean break no strings and no regrets. As ‘Drea walks back into the kitchen her Grams chuckles looking up from her meringue and smiles. “Well Sugar, you didn’t waste any time did you?” “Grams! I went to invite him to supper, and the cases look great” ‘Drea says as the blush runs across her cheeks, she grabs a water from the fridge and sits at the table to drink. “Well of course you did. Did you enjoy the view Sugar? That man was grown better than a June Apple.” “Grams!” ‘Drea says spitting her water. “Now Missy, I know good and well how to appreciate a hard workin’ man. I may be old but I ain’t dead.” “Grams, you will never be old, you are timeless. You know Nate would marry you tomorrow if only you would say yes.” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “Yes, he would. He isn’t your Grand-dad though Andrea. No man will ever measure up to Frank Westwood in my eyes, though Nathan Kyle is a close second. That man is all about you Sugar.” Ruthie says with a smile as she washes up and kisses ‘Drea on the cheek. “Now you make sure you are at that table, washed up and six or I will come a huntin’ Missy.” “Yes, Ma’am, and I will bring dessert.” ‘Drea says as her Grams walks out of the store slowly steadying her walker, climbs into her car, and drives up to the house. After cleaning the kitchen ‘Drea boxes up the cakes and locks up the store, making the trip through the orchard to the house. At six on the dot, ‘Drea is washed up in a green sundress at the table as Nate walks in. “Well don’t you clean up nice Nathan?” Ruthie says as she sets the table. “Thank you Ms Ruthie, you two look lovely and everything smells so good.” Nate says kissing Ruthie’s cheek and sitting across from ‘Drea. “’Drea pour the tea will you?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, Grams.” ‘Drea replies, pouring three glasses of sweet tea and then adding lemon. The three sit chatting about the orchard and eating supper. Ruthie is delighted to see the smiles on their faces, knowing where this is heading even if neither of them does. She smiles to herself knowing these two don’t stand a chance, just like Frank and her were, they are goners. “Well, Nathan ‘Drea says the display cases are nearly done and that look real good.” She pipes up tired of the comfortable silence as they eat dessert. Nate looks up at them both with a shy grin, “Yes, ma’am, all sanded and I started staining them today. Once that’s done I will put in the glass. They will look great filled with all those goodies.” “Very good then. Early tomorrow, you two can start pickin’ apples and such, before the heat rises. I’ll call it a night after I clean up here. You two should walk through the orchard, it is beautiful in the twilight.” “Grams, I can…” ‘Drea starts. “No, Andrea Ruth, I am kickin’ you two out, now go on.” Nate smiles, standing he takes ‘Drea’s hand, “She’s lost her ‘gs’, we better go.” “At least someone listens. Now shoo.” Ruthie says as she shoos them both out the door. “Well that is twice today that she has kicked me out of a kitchen.” ‘Drea giggles. “Come one Sugar, let’s go see some trees.” Nate says taking her arm in his. They walk arm in arm through the trees, and ‘Drea sighs, “They walked here every night, arm in arm, and stealing kisses under the stars, oh Nate they sure had it all. Even after they married they walked here every night. I used to sit in my window and watch them walk off together. It was so romantic.” Nate pushes her up against an apple tree and kisses her warm and passionately. ‘Drea returns his kiss, fisting her hands in his brown pullover. Tilting her chin up to him he deepens the kiss, as his thigh slides between hers. Nate never believed in grand romantic gestures, but when ‘Drea was talking about her grandparents all he wanted to do was kiss her senseless. If it was romantic, then so be it but if he didn’t kiss her soon he would explode. He gently pulls back and puts his hands on her hips to steady them both. “’Drea are you OK?” Her eyes flutter open and she sighs, “You kissed me. You kissed me here in the orchard under the stars.” Nate chuckles, “Yeah, I suppose I did.” He strokes a hand up her arm and cups her jaw. “I think I will do it again.” Before she can react, he brushes his mouth over hers, and as her lips part for him he caresses his tongue with hers. She moans into his mouth as his hands cup her behind urging her into him. “Nate…” She whispers against her jaw. “What is it Sugar?” He asks kissing down her throat. “Why do you call me that?” She whispers. His eyes meet hers, searching. “Ms. Ruthie does, it just stuck and you are so sweet… I don’t know it just fits, why?” “Grand-dad used to call Grams that.” “Oh, do you mind ‘Drea?” “No, I don’t mind it. Nate?” She asks as she looks into his eyes. “Yeah?” He asks as his hands travel up and down her back as if he can’t get enough of her in his hands. “Kiss me again.” She whispers inches from his lips. “Oh Sugar, you only have to ask.” He growls and ‘Drea melts into Nate’s kiss, swept away by the romance in the moment. Chapter Four: Apple Pickin’ The alarm sounds at 5am jolting ‘Drea out of her dream-land recap of twilight walks in the orchard with Nate. Last night couldn’t have been more perfect. Throwing on jeans and a gray pull-over, ‘Drea grabs her sneakers and heads to the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Sugar.” Grams calls as ‘Drea pours a mug of coffee. “Morning Grams, sleep well?” “Yes, I did. How was the orchard?” ‘Drea sighs and sits at the table, nibbling at a piece of toast. “Oh Grams, it was nice.” “It looked really nice to me, Sugar.” Grams says with a wink. “Were you watchin’?” ‘Drea says blushing. “Andrea Ruth! As if you didn’t watch Grand-dad and me walkin’ every night. Nathan reminds me of him, strong but sweet.” “It was lovely Grams, I always thought the orchard was magical. Momma used to say it too. Last night it was, it was perfect.” “I don’t know about magic, Sugar. All I do know is your Grand-dad and I put all our love into this place; into your Momma and you, we never wanted anything else.” “I miss her Grams, so much.” ‘Drea chokes back a sob. “Oh Sugar, not a day goes by that I don’t miss you Momma. Now that you are home it does ease the pain.” ‘Drea hugs her hard, “Me too, I guess you are stuck with me then.” “Good, now go pick some apples, I hear Nate’s truck pullin’ up.” Grabbing the basket her Grams has packed ‘Drea heads out and hops up into the truck with Nate. “Morning Sugar.” He says kissing her sweetly on the cheek. “Ms. Ruthie send breakfast?” “And coffee.” ‘Drea says with a nod. “Love of my life.” He winks taking the mug. “I loaded the bins already, so we are ready to go.” “Let’s hit it.” Nate pulls into the orchard driving down the worn trail. As he comes to a set of trees nearly bursting with ripe green apples he pulls over and stops the truck. ‘Drea looks over her green eyes dancing with the flecks of gold and Nate’s heart races. Before he can say a word, ‘Drea hops out of the truck and leaps up a tree effortlessly. “Careful Sugar, no broken bones.” Nate calls as he pulls the ladder out of the back of the truck. “My Grand-dad used to say that I could swing in one of these all day. He would tease me that my Daddy was part monkey.” ‘Drea says as she tosses apples into the first bin. “Ha. I seem to forget sometimes that you are a Westwood.” He says as he climbs the ladder and starts on the tree next to her. She peeks around a branch her green eyes blazing at him through that black hair framing her face. “What exactly does that mean?” “That you are determined and tough as hell. I keep underestimating you ‘Drea.” Nate says his eyes full of heat. “Oh.” ‘Drea says, smiles then moves to a higher branch. By noon, they have loaded all the bins full of apples into the back of Nate’s truck and are sitting in the grass against a tree resting. Nibbling on the sandwiches and odds and ends that Ms Ruthie packed picnic style and sipping on waters. “Looks like the rain missed us.” Nate says squeezing ‘Drea’s hand. “Yeah. I could stay here all day, it is so peaceful here.” Nate tugs her hand pulling her into his lap, pulling the clip from her hair so her long black strands fall around them. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly as he kisses her softly running his fingers through her freed hair. “Grams will come looking for us Nate, and without her ‘gs’.” ‘Drea says teasingly. “Nah, she hasn’t been in the orchard since I have been in town.” Nate says kissing her jaw line and nips at her ear. His thumbs rubbing circles into her back. ‘Drea kisses him gently tugging at his bottom lip as her hands twist and tug in his shaggy blonde hair. “’Drea?” He groans, as she nips at his stubbled jaw. “Hmm?” She purrs. “You drive me crazy… Mmm… ‘Drea, we can’t…not here.” ‘Drea pulls back and laughs, “No we can’t, can we?” She stands and walks back to the truck and Nate yells, “’Drea, I said we can’t, I didn’t say I didn’t want to.” Turning back to him as he repeats her words back at her, she leaps into his arms. “Oh Nate.” She whispers kissing him hard. “Grams is going to Bingo tonight right?” “Mmhmm, hasn’t missed one as far as I know.” “Let me cook for you, come to the store tonight and I’ll have dinner and dessert.” ‘Drea says as she strokes his jaw. “I can’t say no to you lovely Westwood women. See you later then Sugar?” “Yeah, I gotta get to the store; you gotta get the apples up to Grams. Will you tell her about dinner?” “Sure it will be my pleasure to give Ms. Ruthie the night off.” ‘Drea kisses him once more and heads through the orchard to the store. “Yep, she will be a hell of a way to go.” Nate says to himself as he drives his truck up to unload the apples for Ms. Ruthie to clean, and separate. ‘Drea paces around the island as she decides what to make for tonight. She decides on lasagna and a salad, and rolls out dough for herb bread. After mixing the salad and prepping the lasagna she places them both in the fridge. Locking up the store, she heads to the house where Grams is on the porch peeling apples. “I hear I get the night off huh Missy?” “Yes, Ma’am.” ‘Drea says with a smile. “That’s a girl. You two have some fun tonight, Sugar.” ‘Drea kisses her cheek and goes into the house. After a long bath, ‘Drea has lotioned herself and is wearing a silky pink sundress and while ballet flats. She leaves her hair down; he likes it down, and checks her make-up. She whistles on her walk through the orchard as she heads back to the store. As the lasagna and bread cook in the oven she sets the table. Using a white silk table cloth and lighting candles, once she is happy with it she walks to the cooler to get something for dessert and is stopped in her tracks. Sitting on the shelf is a pie and a note: If you think I wouldn’t have my hands in this Missy, you were wrong. Enjoy your night-Grams. Taking the pie and the note ‘Drea smiles. Just as she puts the plates on the table there is a knock at the door. “Come on in Nate, its open.” Nate strolls in handing ‘Drea a single red rose. “Thank you.” She says as she takes him in: he has shaved, and is in a blue dress shirt and black jeans. “You look nice Sugar.” He says pulling her into an embrace. “You clean up nice yourself, hungry?” “Always.” He says with a wink. “I was going to bring wine, but I didn’t know…” Nate starts as he sits down. “I’d rather have a beer anyway.” ‘Drea says handing Nate a bottle. “You are an amazing woman Sugar.” Nate says taking a sip. As they eat they sit together smiling, laughing, and talking about the store. “So in just a few days we will know if this will all work out?” Nate asks as he finishes his plate. “Not exactly, I see it as worth it all regardless if anyone shows up. Grams is the only family I have left and I am happy here.” ‘Drea replies as she slices the pie, as she cuts through the meringue she gasps. Nate brows shoot up, “What is it ‘Drea?” “Grams, she… Oh it is my favorite!” She stammers out. “What…huh?” Nate asks again confused. She carries the pie over and hands him a plate, “When I was a little girl Grand-dad used to buy me Mounds candy bars at the grocer. Grams made me a pie for my birthday one year. I can’t believe she remembered.” ‘Drea says as she bites into the chocolate crème pie with meringue and coconut shavings and sighs. “Sugar you would be surprised at how much she remembers. All she talks about it you and how proud she is of you.” “She is too good to me; Lord what would I do without her.” “Let’s hope we never find out Sugar.” Nate replies as he finishes his pie and clears the table. ‘Drea starts running water in the sink as Nate grabs her arm, spinning her into him. “Dance with me ‘Drea.” “There is no music Nate.” She says shutting off the faucet. “So.” He says matter of fact, and twirls her across the kitchen. The whole world stands still as Nate holds ‘Drea in his arms and he brings his lips to hers. As her arms wrap around his neck he groans against her mouth. Nate’s knees nearly give out, so he locks them in place as he pulls back. “Come with me ‘Drea.” Nate leads ‘Drea through the orchard to a clearing; there is a blanket on the ground, and flameless candles, and cushions set up against a tree. It takes ‘Drea a moment to take it all in as Nate wraps his arms around her waist pulling her into him. “Nate…” ‘She finally gasps, as he squeezes her hand. “I may have had some free time this afternoon, sit.” He says as he sits pulling her into his lap. “Tonight couldn’t get much better, this is beautiful.” She whispers as she kisses him sweetly. “’Drea…” Nate moans as he turns them, laying her on her back on the cushions and blanket, his eyes searching hers. ‘Drea’s hands fist in his shirt and he crushes his mouth to hers. As his hands run up her thighs, ‘Drea starts unbuttoning his shirt, ripping most of the buttons off making her giggle. “Oh, I’m sorry.” “It’s OK. I didn’t like that shirt anyway.” Nate says with a chuckle, as he tosses it off and trails kisses down her throat. Slowly he unbuttons the buttons on the front of her dress kissing every inch of exposed skin, as she arches up to him. “Nate…” She pleads. “Ssh, right here Sugar.” He whispers as he slides her panties down her legs. “I am going to take my time with you Andrea. I have been desperate to touch you for like this for days.” As he pushes her dress off, he takes her mouth with his again, wrapping her legs around him. ‘Drea has never felt like this. Nate had spent his afternoon turning the clearing into a romantic wonderland, and he was worshipping her body like time stood still. Phillip never gave her butterflies, she never saw sparks when he kissed her. Nathan Kyle could make all those things happen and then some. As Nate slowly sank into her, he thought his brain would explode. It was better than anything he could have ever imagined…and he had spent a lot of time imagining… The feel of her soft skin, her heart racing, the smell of vanilla and sugar that came from her was nothing compared to the sweet taste of her. As her sweet pants turned to moans and soft whispers of his name; Nate lost himself and went right over the edge with her. Pulling the extra blanket over them, Nate pulls her against him and kisses her hair. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” As he disposes of the condom in his jeans pocket, he hears ‘Drea sniffle. Concern filling his face, he turns her chin up to look at him, wiping a stray tear from her cheek with his thumb. “Jesus, Sugar did I hurt you?” ‘Drea chuckles out a sob, “No, Nate. No one has ever made me feel so special. No one in a long time, not since…” She trails off. “Since you left here? Oh Sugar, you’ve been with the wrong people. You are amazing, ‘Drea. It’s there loss and my gain.” He says sweetly as he tucks her beneath him and brings his lips to hers. “I plan to spend the night showing you just how amazing I think you are ‘Drea.” ‘Drea stretches as she feels the arms tighten around her. Relaxing back into Nate’s arms, she relives last night and it hits her… We are STILL in the orchard, jerking up she laughs out loud. “We stayed out here all night, and we are naked.” She says as Nate’s eyes flutter open. “Looks like we did, better get up to the house before Ms. Ruthie comes huntin’” Nate teases as he grabs her dress and hands it to her with a wink. Once they are dressed, they walk up to the house where Ms. Ruthie is waiting on the porch swing peeling apples. “Mornin’ you two.” She says with a conspiratorial grin. “Grams, we were um…” ‘Drea starts. “Andrea Ruth, do you think you could possible spin a tale and make be believe anything other than what happened between you two in the orchard? Do you think Grand-dad wasn’t so smooth himself?” Ruthie says with a laugh. “Grams!” ‘Drea says blushing. Ruthie’s eyes dart to Nate lovingly, “Nathan.” She says sweetly. “Morning Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as ‘Drea pulls him into the house. “Pancakes and bacon are on the stove.” Ruthie shouts. As Nate sits digging into the pancakes and bacon, ‘Drea pours the coffee. Sitting beside him she sighs as she bites into a piece of bacon. “So are we…I mean…Um…” She starts. Nate laughs, “Yes, ‘Drea you’re my girl, that is if you want to be.” ‘Drea blushes, and then smiles. “Um, well, just like that huh?” “Guess so.” Nate says finishing his plate, he stands pulling her into him. “I like the sound of that, you ‘Drea…My girl…mine…” Crushing his lips to hers, he turns and lifts her to the counter behind her and her legs wrap around his hips. After surrendering to needing to kiss her senseless he remembers where they are… In Ms. Ruthie’s kitchen, her only grand-daughter on her counter… Jesus man you are a goner. Pulling back he smiles, “OK. I am going back to my place to change; I’ll be back in an hour to put in the display cases.” He adds as he kisses her again, and then he saunters out of the house saying goodbye to Ms. Ruthie on his way to his truck. After gathering her wits, and cleaning up the breakfast dishes, ‘Drea showers and dresses quickly. Ruthie is cooking apples when she comes into the kitchen. “Oh Sugar, you seem lighter this mornin’” “Grams, really…” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “We have calls about tomorrow all mornin’, should have a good turn-out Sugar.” Ruthie says as she starts preparing jars to can apples. “That’s great. Nate and I are going to put in the display cases today.” “Oh, so how are you and Nate, Andrea?” ‘Drea smiles, “Good Grams. He is so sweet, and makes me feel…special.” “Well, good Missy. Now, you get on, I’ve got things to get done. I’ll bring jars down later, once they have cooled.” “Grams, Nate and I will come and load up after supper.” “Alright then Sugar.” Ruthie nods as ‘Drea heads out the door and into the orchard. By the time ‘Drea walks to the store, Nate is backing the truck up to the front doors to unload the display cases. She stops, admiring the view of him stretching across the truck removing the straps holding down the cases. Will she ever tire of oogling this man and his backside? Get a grip ‘Drea, you are gawking like a pervert! Turning just in time to catch her, Nate smiles. “Hey, Sugar.” “Hey yourself.” She calls back as she turns to unlock the doors. “Need some help?” “Nope, they are lighter than they look. You should get in there and bake, Sugar.” Nate says with a grin. “Oh so one night under the stars and I am destined to be the ‘little woman in the kitchen…” She says teasing. Nate laughs, “Well hell, maybe.” He winks. “I would do anything with a donut.” ‘Drea waggles a brow, “Then I had better get to it then. I fully intend to make you work for every bite.” She winks back at him as she turns and saunters into the kitchen. Nate lays his head against the cool metal of his truck and sighs… Yep killing him…killing him… ‘Drea cranks Bon Jovi on her IPod and hooks it into the sound system; she starts mixing flour, eggs and adding all the other ingredients to the mixer. As her dough rises she starts mixing up her glaze. Singing along with ‘Always’ as she rolls out her dough, she feels arms around her waist and smiles. Nate... “They aren’t ready yet.” She teases as he nuzzles her hair. “I got the cases in, and bolted into place. You are ready to open Sugar.” “Nearly. Grams has apples at the house, jars of jelly and some other stuff.” “I’ll go get it now.” Nate says sweetly as he nuzzles her ear pulling her tight against him. Whipping around to face him he hoists her up on the counter and kisses her hard and demanding, her hands roaming up and into his hair and tugging. A cough from the front door startles them both, making ‘Drea nearly jump off the counter. “Well Andrea, I see you changed your recipe. Exactly which part of the process is this?” A man from the door says, adjusting his suit. Part Five: Sometimes you have to face the Past, in the Present, to have a Future. ‘Drea’s face falls as she takes in the man she never thought she would see again... “Phillip. How did you know where to find me? Why are you here?” She asks appalled that he has the guts to show his face now. Nate takes her hand in his and she swears she heard a growl low in his throat. Phillip stands his whole 5’10 in the door way in his expensive black tailored suit and eyes the place. His perfectly styled black hair, not one strand out of place, his brown eyes assessing his distaste for the situation. “Andrea, I was curious as to where my fiancé ran off to, I have missed you pet.” Nate eyes ‘Drea? Pet? What the hell, she isn’t a pet. “Um Nate, this is Phillip my old boss. I would say it is a pleasure Phillip but it isn’t.” ‘Drea scowls. Nate sighs, “Phillip.” Nodding icily. “Nate would you mind seeing to Grams? I will see to this and be ready to set up when you get back.” She says not taking her eyes off of Nate. “Are you sure, Sugar?” Nate asks sweetly, clearly marking his territory. “Yes Baby. It won’t take long.” “Ok.” Nate replies kissing her cheek sweetly, turns and strides out like a man on a mission. After ‘Drea shakes her head to steady herself she turns to deal with this mess. “Phillip what do you want?” She asks him as he strides over to her. “I have missed you My Pet. Why did you leave?” Phillip says as he touches her cheek. “Why? Why! I guess you and the waitress didn’t think I would mind? You could have cared less that I left you Phillip. You don’t love me and I don’t love you.” She snaps as she jerks away from him. He chuckles, “Ah Pet you are so much smarter than I give you credit for. I am a bit disappointed in the whole ‘kissing the handy man thing’ but I can forgive you.” ‘Drea closes her eyes mentally counting to ten, “Don’t call me pet. I hate than Phillip, I am not your damn pet. Why would I want your forgiveness, we are over.” Phillip laughs. He laughs! “We are far from over my pet. My father has decided that since you left, the restaurant is no longer high-priority. He is threatening to boot me and close if you don’t come back. I booked us a flight and we...” ‘Drea slams a pan across the room, “Now you listen to me, Phillip. Very carefully, I am not going back to New York, I am not working for you and I am not putting back on your ring. Now leave before I make you.” She turns to her dough and starts to roll it out and he grabs her spinning her into him pinning her against the island. “Phillip, I am warning you.” Phillip smiles, “Andrea, you have no idea what you are saying and who you are messing with. You will go back to the way things were and that is that.” He pushes against her and nuzzles her neck. “Never, Phillip I mean it. Back the hell up and NOW!” ‘Drea pushes at him and he jolts back. Not because of her force, but Nate’s. He grabs Phillip by the throat and jerks him to the door. Choking off his airway, making Phillip gasp and beg. “Nate! What are you doing?” ‘Drea gasps fearing Nate will kill him. “I am just taking out the trash Sugar, won’t be but a minute.” Nate says dragging him out the door and jerking it closed. Nate is bubbling with fury, standing outside during the conversation was nearly impossible. This egocentric ass caged her in, put his hands on her. He throws him into his car and he crumbles to the ground. Gasping for air Phillip is cursing Nate with every breath. “I will sue you. I will own you. She is my fiancé and belongs to me.” Nate growls grabbing him by the jacket and hauls him up against his shiny little BMV rental. “Now you are going to listen to me, real good. I am going to speak nice and clear, as to not confuse you.” Phillip starts to talk but Nate shakes him furiously, shutting him up. Nate continues, “You are not welcome here. She doesn’t want you here. If you decide to show up here again, I will be waiting and you will see just how handy I am asshole. Andrea is no longer your fiancée, employee, or whatever else she may have been. So get in your car and have you a real nice day.” Nate growls letting him slide down the car. Phillip gasps for breath as he climbs into his car and drives away. Nate turns and walks back into the kitchen where ‘Drea stands at the sink. “’Drea are you alright?” Nate asks as he wraps his arms around her from behind. She blows out a breath and closes her eyes, “Yes, he just tried to get his point across. He wanted me to come back and make his life easier.” ‘Drea says as she turns in his arms and he pulls her in tight. “I know Sugar.” Nate says. “You were listening?” ‘Drea asks surprised. Nate nods, “He looked like a classic douche and I wasn’t leaving you alone with him. When he got too close, I decided to remove him.” He says drawing a giggle from her. “Thank you, Nate. So...is he still alive?” ‘Drea asks as she nuzzles into the crook of his neck. “Yeah, but if he comes back we will need to plan on where to hide the body. I won’t be so polite next time.” Nate says sweetly. “He won’t be back. Phillip doesn’t love me Nate, he never did. I won’t live that way and now he knows that.” “OK, so now that you are alright. I will leave you to my donuts and I will see to Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as he kisses her sweetly then he is gone. ‘Drea turns and starts punching out donuts and cranks up the fryer. Placing six on a plate, she boxes up the rest and sits the plate on the table just as Nate walks in. “Grams load you down?” ‘Drea asks as she pours coffee. “She sure has been busy. Sit with me...” He says pulling her into his lap, “We will set up everything up and then I am going to cook you dinner, tonight.” ‘Drea bites her lip to stifle her laugh. “You want to cook for me?” Nate kisses the tip of her nose, “Oh ye of little faith. Yes, I can cook.” “Well Nathan Kyle, there are still many things I do not know about you.” ‘Drea purrs as she watches Nate eat his donuts. Nate frowns, “It’s all hype Sugar... not much to tell.” ‘Drea new better than that, but she would let it go for now, at least. It is important for her to know him, but it isn’t like he is telling these things to everyone else. He really won’t open up to anyone and yet he is to her, little by little. Picking at her donuts she arches a brow at him, “So what are you cooking?” “Homemade pizza. Does that work for you?” He asks as he swallows the last donut in one bite. “Absolutely, one thing I loved about New York was the pizza.” After an hour of setting up the apples, jars and displays, Nate excuses himself to go into town for groceries and to change. After ‘Drea cleans the kitchen up for him, she sets the table similar to the night before, with candles. Needing to change and get ready, she leaves the door unlocked and a note: Gone to shower and change. The kitchen is all yours, see you shortly. ‘Drea She nearly skips through the orchard on her way to house. After changing into a green camisole and a jean skirt, she brushes her hair out into long black waves. Once she retouches her make-up ‘Drea slips into flip-flops and heads back to the store to meet Nate. The door to the kitchen is open and she over hears Nate and...is that Grams talking? “Ms. Ruthie you know I do...” Nate says. Does what? ‘Drea wonders, as she stands still out of view, listening. “If so, she should know about your past Nathan. She would understand. How would you expect her to share a bed with you and not know about your nightmares?” “’Drea has been through enough.” Nate snaps. “Yes she has been through a lot, but don’t use that hogwash on me Nathan. It is about give and take, she told you things I am sure.” Ruthie says back shaky. “And that’s why I can’t, why... I want to protect her Ms. Ruthie. I couldn’t bear to hurt her.” He says sounding broken. “You can’t protect and shelter her, she runs from that. I lost her for ten years. Nathan, I won’t lose her again.” Ruthie says choking on a sob. Damn it! It is a conspiracy. It wasn’t as hard for her knowing Nate wasn’t letting her in yet, but he talked to Grams... What the hell! Pissed beyond all points, she stops up into the kitchen. First, Phillip and his completely idiotic ass comes walking back into her life begging for her to come back to soothe his Daddy, then you have these two Judases! Her life is out of control and she is putting her flip-flopped foot down right now! Nate whips around and his face pales, clearly knowing she heard everything. “Well don’t stop on my account, you were only talkin’ about me.” ‘Drea says scowling at them both. “I think I will leave you two, I’ll leave the door unlocked Andrea Ruth.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea replies, not taking her eyes off Nate. Nate frowns down at his hands. “Sure you can manage Ms Ruthie?” “Nate...” ‘Drea starts, interrupting whatever answer her Grams was going to give by shutting the door behind her. “What is this?” Nate meets her gaze and sighs. “Listen ‘Drea there are things about me, things that I don’t discuss.” “Obviously.” She scowls, “Unless you count Grams.” ‘Drea grabs a beer and takes a long draw. “No problem talkin’ to her huh?” “Only just because I needed to be sure you could handle it.” He starts. Throwing her hands up in exasperation ‘Drea groans, “You didn’t feel that you could trust me to handle it? Damn you Nate, no secrets, no games. Remember?” Closing the distance between them, Nate grabs her wrists. “Don’t!” She yells, jerking away, infuriated. He kept things from her and she knew it, but because he saw her as weak? She left here years ago for similar reasons; to escape the pain of losing her Momma and the pity everyone felt for her. It was etched on all their faces and it made her sick to meet anyone’s eyes. She would be damned if he would treat her as a child, as she was weak! “’Drea, please just let me explain.” Nate pleads as he reaches for her again, “You owe me that at least.” If looks could kill he knew he would be dead already. She paces around the island, “I don’t owe you anything.” ‘Drea says as she stalks out of the kitchen and into the orchard away from him. Nate’s body is shaking, he can’t lose her. He knew tonight was the night he was going to tell her everything and she was going to understand. She was going to know he loved her and that he would beg her never to leave. He never thought he would fall in love, but the moment he saw her, he was a goner. Turning off the oven he bolts from the kitchen and into the orchard after her. ‘Drea is running she lost her flip-flops in the trees somewhere and she could care less, just slowed her down. How could he keep things from her but tell Grams? How could he think he could hide from her? Swatting the angry tears from her face, she stops at the tree in the center of the orchard dropping to her knees. To the two stones she has never seen, two grave markers. ‘Drea traces the name: Franklin Westwood. “Grand-dad, what was I thinking coming back here? I can’t do this.” She sobs. “I came here to lick my wounds of my unhappy life, not gut myself again and again.” Scooting over she traces the name: Cassandra Westwood. Flopping onto her side she runs her hands in the grass of the space between the graves and cries. Nate stands just outside the clearing, as he hears ‘Drea cry into the night. His heart nearly ripping from his chest. She wants to leave. Suddenly, his chest is too tight he can’t breathe. He knows if she leaves she will take his heart and his only shot at happiness with her forever. He had been a selfish bastard to shelter her, to think she was breakable. She was the strongest, bravest woman he had ever known. She had been through so much and watched her own mother die, helpless to stop it. He coddled her like a child and he was wrong, she held him together, she made him want to be better, stronger, she made him want to be hers. He ached to be hers. Walking over to her he curls up behind her on the grass, she lay silently sobbing as he pulls her into his chest. “Ssh Sugar, I am sorry. I am so sorry.”He whispers running a hand down her hair soothing her. “’Drea look at me baby please.” He pleads. ‘Drea look up at him, her green eyes tear stained and dark. He swipes at the tears with his thumbs and sits them both up. “’Drea, I left home at nineteen, things were not great at home. My Mom was struggling financially and I knew I needed to go. My dad had died of a heart attack and she had never worked so she had a rough go finding work. So I enlisted.” “Yes, I-“‘Drea starts but Nate puts his finger to her lip. “Please let me get this out Sugar.” He says looking pained. She nods as he takes her hands, “I went into the National Guard, I specialized in Search and Rescue...and well Recovery. I watched people die ‘Drea, so many more than I could count. My team said that I would get used to it, after time it wouldn’t bother me anymore. Can you believe it ‘Drea...get used to it...” He says with a pained chuckle. “After a while though, the lives I did save, couldn’t even erase the faces of those I watched die. I got out, but I live with it every day. It haunts me ‘Drea every damn day.” Tears fill ‘Drea’s eyes again, “Oh Nate.” Shaking his head he continues, “When I came here, no one accepted me ‘Drea, except Ruthie. Then you came and turned me inside out. I wanted to tell you, ‘Drea I did. I watched strangers die Sugar, but you watched your Momma die. It was selfish of me to think you wouldn’t be able to handle it. That you couldn’t understand.” ‘Drea cups his face in her hands and kisses him. “Oh Nate, I am so sorry. Of course I understand, it took me ten years to even talk about Momma. I am sorry, I overreacted.” Everything in Nate’s body relaxes, “Oh Sugar I thought I lost you.” ‘Drea shakes her head and smiles shyly. Nate kisses her over and over again, “No secrets and no games, ‘Drea never again.” Hoisting her up in his arms, ‘Drea curls into his chest as he carries her back to the kitchen in the store. The next morning, ‘Drea wakes to her alarm at 4:45am. After dressing in jeans and an old sweatshirt of her Grand-dad’s that says ‘Westwood Orchards’ on it, she wanders into the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Grams.” She murmurs into her mug as she sits at the table. “Andrea Ruth.” Ruthie nods. “Is everything settled between Nathan and you?” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea sighs, “I over-reacted Grams.” Ruthie chuckles, “Love will make you do that, Sugar.” ‘Drea gasps, sputtering coffee, “I never said I-“ “You don’t have to, it is all over your face, and his as well.” Ruthie says with a knowing wink. “I went to see Momma and Grand-dad last night Grams.” ‘Drea says changing the subject. “Oh, did you?” Ruthie asks, knowing that ‘Drea had never been there since her Cassandra’s funeral. ‘Drea nods. “I should have done it long ago, Grams. I was being selfish and cowardly. I blamed myself for so long and I-“‘Drea says on a sob. Ruthie jerks her eyes up. “Andrea Ruth! How dare you take the blame for something that was in God’s design. You shouldn’t have lived with all that built up in you all these years Sugar.” “I know that now Grams. Now come on we have a store to open.” “Yes, we do Sugar.” Ruthie says as they walk out the door and head up to the orchard in ‘Drea’s car. Part Six: Phillip’s Last Stand. ‘Drea loads the display cases with cakes, pies, donuts, and cobblers. Displays of Ms. Ruthie’s canning and jellies are set out, along with baskets of fruit from the orchard. A knock on the door, startles them all. “We aren’t open yet.” ‘Nate yells as he hauls a box in, turning he nearly drops it as there in the doorway stands Phillip. “I see you wanted to see how handy I am.” Nate growls sitting the box down. “Actually,” He starts as he holds his hands up in silent surrender. “I came here to talk to Andrea.” He says looking at her, “Pet, can we...” He starts then jumps as the laugh roars out of Ms. Ruthie’s throat. “Pet? Oh I know you didn’t call my Grand-daughter, your damn pet.” She roars. “Grams, I can handle this.” ‘Drea says ushering Phillip out the door, to his car.” “Listen, Phillip you have exactly ten seconds to say whatever it is you have to say and get the hell out of here before those two...” She gestures to the door where Nate and Ruthie stand watching like hawks. “Well, they know how to hide the bodies...if you understand.” He nods, “Listen Pet, Um I mean Andrea. I am sorry. I never knew what I had until you were gone. I need you, I want you. Please come back, run the restaurant, be mine.” “Phillip. I can’t, I want more.” She whispers. He gawks at her like she has grown two heads, “More? God Pet I would give you the world, anything, everything.” He pulls her into his arms and crushes his lips to hers. Nate and Ruthie are yelling and cursing from the doorway, as ‘Drea pushes Phillip away. “Phillip, I’m not in love with you. My Grandparents had love, passion and...magic. God Phillip that is what I want... I want to love, I want to ache for the man I love... and that’s-“ Phillip sighs, “That’s not me.” ‘Drea nods smiling sweetly. “So it is the handy man then. You are in love with him?” ‘Drea nods, “Yes, Nate...his name is Nate and yes Phillip I love him.” Phillip sighs, “I guess that’s that then. I can’t fight for your heart when you already gave it away, Pet. I am so sorry for the way I treated you Andrea, I took you for granted. I didn’t value you for the amazing person you are and that is my loss. I am so glad you didn’t let my mistakes damage you. I will always love you Andrea and just know that if he better be good to you Andrea.” “Phillip, I forgive you. You were no happier than I and well I have let it all go.” She says and he smiles at her fondly, kisses her again and gets into his car and leaves. Nate stands in bewilderment... He kissed her twice...Twice... She nodded and smiled at him sweetly. What the hell? Was she going back with him? Shaking it off he goes back to hauling the boxes and stocking shelves. The store was opening and there were already people looking around. He would deal with his broken heart later. There was not a second to spare, between serving customers, boxing up items and carrying to the cars, they were all busy. It seemed like the whole town maybe the whole county had showed up to see the Orchard back and thriving. Nate caught gazes of ‘Drea, she looked blissfully happy. He couldn’t help but be a little sad at that. He gave this woman his heart and she didn’t even know it yet. She could leave without knowing it. Would it change her mind if she did know? By noon, the entire store is cleared out, Nate switches the sign to closed and ‘Drea sinks to the floor. “We did it Grams!” “Oh Sugar, your Grand-dad would be so proud of you.” Ruthie says as she sits in a chair. “Of us, Grams.” ‘Drea says as she stands dusting off her jeans. “Grams, can you get back up to the house alright? There is something I want to do...” “Even an old woman can take a hint. I will see you both for supper?” “Yes, Ma’am.” They reply in unison. Part Seven: Finality. Nate sits in the passenger seat of ‘Drea’s car as they wind up the old mountain road. What was he thinking? After Grams had left, ‘Drea had said they needed to talk and that needed to drive so he all but agreed. He knew what was coming, bracing for the heartache he blows out a breath. “Where are we going? You haven’t left the orchard since you have been home.” “That’s right.” ‘Drea says glancing at him with a smile, “We are going somewhere special, Nate.” ‘Drea drives up the old road methodically, her head spinning. It hadn’t taken so long for her to realize that she had fallen in love with Nate. Phillip’s visit just made her sure. She wanted to desperately to tell him before, last night in fact. Nate had secrets though, deep secrets that haunted him just as hers did. Now that they were all out in the open, she wouldn’t run anymore. ‘Drea had to tell him, had to know for sure and if he ran ‘Drea might crumble. Pulling up on a shoulder, Nate’s eyes grow wide; there is nothing but a broken guard rail. ‘Drea shuts off the engine, walks over and sits on the edge of the broken rail. As Nate sits next to her, she leans on his shoulder. “After ten years, you would think they would just fix the damn rail.” She says shaking her head in disbelief. “Jesus, ‘Drea this is where—“ She nods as he pulls her into his arms. “I wanted a new beginning; I had to come here to close this chapter first.” She says, tears filling her voice. Nate’s heart breaks for her as he runs a hand up and down her back. “I miss her so much Nate, damn it I miss her so much.” “Oh Baby.” Nate whispers, kissing her hair. “I didn’t let myself remember. It hurt too much. This whole time it was holding me back. I’m ready to move on now Nate.” All of a sudden his gut tightened. She is leaving. Nate feels sick, oh after all he had hoped for she was moving on. Without him. ‘Drea kisses him, stopping his thoughts. “Yeah.” He says shaking his head to clear his thoughts. “Well, I guess now that the orchard is making money again you will be—“ ‘Drea looks up at him wide-eyed, “You think I am leaving?” Nate’s eyes widen to match hers and she continues, “Nate, I brought you here because this is where my world stopped ten years ago. It is time to let it start turning again. Today, was the best day of my life. This is what I was meant to do.” Nate shakes his head...confused, “What about Phillip?” ‘Drea laughs, “Oh Nate, Grams and you should learn to eavesdrop better. We talked and there is nothing there. We said our goodbyes and that is that. I am not in love with him I told him that. The orchard is magical Nate, I have always thought so. It may sound dumb...” “No it doesn’t ‘Drea. There is so much love there.” Nate says stroking her hair away from her face. “I found myself again Nate. For ten years I ran from who I was. I am a Westwood. I am bossy, determined, I dream, believe in magical orchard, that dessert can solve all problems, and in anger I lose my ‘gs’.” Nate smiles. Taking a deep breath, she blurts “And, I love you Nate.” Nate’s eyes fly open wide. “What was that?” ‘Drea giggles, “I love you Nathan Kyle. I never expected to find all the missing pieces of my heart, but you put them all back in place.” Nate takes in all she has said and smiles, “Oh Sugar, you surprise me every day. I need you ‘Drea, I love you. You push the darkness back with your beauty Andrea. From the moment I saw you lying in the grass looking up at the clouds, hell I may have loved you even then.” He stands pulling her into his arms, spinning her. “You know we will have it all, don’t you Sugar? We can marry in the orchard, walk there every night, raise a family, and keep Ms. Ruthie on her toes.” Eyes teary, ‘Drea smiles at him. “Yes Nate we will.” ‘Drea says as she kisses Nate, knowing in her heart that she found her magic.",

      "content": "Prologue: Flopping into the window sill seat, Andrea stares out at the trees. Her Grand-dad started Westwood Orchards over thirty-five years ago, and business has never been better. The small store her Grams sells baked goods, jellies and produce out of is busy this time of year, which means while Grams and Andrea's Momma run the store, 'Drea helps Grand-dad with the apples in the orchard. She watches as her Grand-dad kisses her Grams under the pre-dusk stars, even after putting in a full day harvesting he still walks her through the orchard every night. \"'Drea?\" A voice calls from the bathroom. Smiling she sighs, \"Oh Momma, isn't it so romantic?\" Climbing into the seat, Cassandra Westwood pulls her daughter into her lap. \"You know my precious one, the orchard is magical. It brought your Grand-dad and Grams together; they put all of their love into this place.\" Misty eyed she continues, \"It brought your father to me, even if for just a time.\" \"Oh Momma, I could never leave here. Not ever.\" 'Drea says as she watches her grandparents disappear into the trees arm and arm. Knowing her Momma's heart never fully mended after that summer. Andrea's father, a drifter that her Grand-dad hired for the summer harvest. Cass and Paul had loved fast and hard beneath the trees that summer. Fall came and Paul left for parts unknown. Soon after Cass learned of her pregnancy, but was never able to find Paul. To this day she aches for him. \"Andrea Ruth.\" Cassandra says as she brushes out 'Drea's tangled black hair. \"You are only eleven years old, of course you will grow up and leave here, go to college, have a career. I want so much for you, my precious one.\" \"I want love Momma, I want magic.\" 'Drea says with a pout as she climbs into bed. \"You shall have it in time, 'Drea. You have plenty of time to do it all, with us all cheering you on. I love you 'Drea.\" She soothes as she kisses her on the cheek. 'Drea jerks awake in a cold sweat, checking her surroundings. \"Oh it was so real.\" She murmurs to herself as she checks her phone for the time, as unwelcome tears stream down her face. In the years since her Momma had died she had plenty of nightmares; gory flashes of the crash, of her Momma dying there in front of her before help came. She could smell the gas leaking or see the broken guard rail. Never had she dreamed of the happy times at Westwood Orchards, those were forgotten. Her Momma had died ten years ago, her Grand-dad nearly three. Thriving in New York as a chef, 'Drea was engaged to be married. Until two days ago she thought the new life she had built was perfect. After her fiancé. Phillip had been caught giving a waitress the hands on approach, she couldn't continue to work there or marry him for that matter. Still she wondered which she'd miss more... After walking out amidst the dinner rush, she came home to a message from Grams. She couldn't say no to Grams, so after packing everything 'Drea jumps into her car without even a word to Phillip. \"Saving the orchard is all that matters.\" She tells herself as she left the city for good. Done with thinking and deciding to give up on sleep, 'Drea dresses and checks out of the hotel. \"Won't be long now 'Drea.\" She sighs. Just two hundred more miles and she would be face to face with the very thing she had run from ten years ago... The past. Grams needs her, and she will do anything to save Westwood Orchards. \"I know this will work, I can make it work. Just please, let the magic still be there... let it be real.\" Chapter One: Small towns and lingering memories. As Andrea Westwood pulls up in front of her family's fruit orchard she sighs. It has been ten years since she set foot in her childhood home, when her Momma died in a car crash, she had to get out of here and she never looked back. Until now. The crisp, cool Virginia air blows through her long black hair as she walks up to the house. It is nothing like New York, after being there as a high paid head chef of one of the city's biggest restaurants 'Drea is in shock of how nothing here has changed. The yard, the house, the fences all the same as when she left. Things change in New York every day, sometimes hourly. Here, it is like time stands still, and with only about three-hundred people in this town, they all know everything about everyone and there are no secrets. There is no fast food, no Wal-mart, and no Starbucks. She had lost cell service in and out on the way here, so surely Wi-Fi is out of the question. \"People need a passport to come here; it is like a whole nother planet.\" She says out loud to herself. \"Well not if you were born here, Missy. It tends to linger in the blood.\" \"Grams!\" 'Drea says smiling as she walks up the old wooden porch steps and hugs her grandmother, joining her on the old swing. \"Oh Sugar, it is so good to have you home. I have missed having someone around here call me something other than Ms. Ruthie. How was your trip?\" \"Long... but it gave me time to think so it was so good. I am having my things shipped down here. Since New York is over for me, I thought I would stay here for a while anyway, at least until I figure out what I want to do.\" \"Of course, Sugar. This is your home, it always has been. Come on let's get on inside, I am sure you are starved.\" \"The orchard looks like it needs some TLC Grams, the store too. When does the handy man come in?\" 'Drea asks as she nibbles at her turkey sandwich. \"Don't have one, no need.\" Ruthie says handing 'Drea a glass of iced tea. \"Grams...\" 'Drea says with a regretful sigh. \"Neither of us can do the heavy lifting around here. We need a man to do it, possibly a few. I put an ad in the paper, before I left New York. I am sure they will start calling and showing up in no time.\" Ruthie looks over her coffee mug, \"If you are sure Sugar.\" \"I am. Also, I need to see the books. I will get the bills squared away and start getting things ready for the store to open as soon as possible.\" \"OK. You're old room is ready for you Sugar, so you can get settled in.\" \"Alright Grams, thank you.\" 'Drea says as she finishes her sandwich. The kitchen is in perfect condition. No one in town would argue that Ms. Ruthie's pies and jams aren't the best in the county. She keeps an immaculate kitchen and that was one thing 'Drea was counting on. Baking and cooking have always been 'Drea's constants, they never change. It is her safe place, her one way to relax and just be. Oh how proud Grams would have been to have seen her in her element in New York... No! That's over now, 'Drea reminds herself. She needs to let it go and find her dream, open her own little shop, bake and sell her own recipes. First, she has to save the orchard and her Grams, which is long enough for her to lick her wounds and re-calculate after Phillip. Surely he will have trashed her reputation in New York, so a new start in a new place is exactly what she needs. \"It is so good to have you home, 'Drea. I have missed you Sugar.\" 'Drea smiles, \"Me too Grams, everything is going to be good now.\" Kissing her Grams on the cheek, 'Drea heads out to unpack the car. Once she is settled in her old room, she changes into a pair of jeans and a green hooded pullover. She whisks her hair up into a pony-tail and heads out to the store to see how much she can get done. The old log cabin store is covered in over-grown brush and shrubs. The dust and cobwebs look like they have been there since 'Drea left. \"Well, I am not above hard labor.\" She says to herself as she takes a small axe from the porch and shoves up her sleeves. After over thirty minutes, she has a good sized pile in the middle of the yard. Since her Grams is busy in the kitchen making apple pies, 'Drea sprawls out in the grass. Dirty and sweaty, she stares up at the sky, like she did as a child. Back then, her Momma and she would stare at the clouds and 'Drea would dream. All those wonderful things she wanted in life; the shop she would have, the man she would marry, a family. Always ever present in those dreams was Westwood Orchards. Never did she want to leave here, but when her Momma died just after 'Drea's graduation from high school, the sight of anything here was much too painful. \"Well Momma, I am back. I am home.\" Choking back a sob, she squeezes her eyes shut, letting her fingers spread wide in the grass. \"When I left, it hurt so much to be here, I miss you so much. Jesus, Momma. I was an idiot. Phillip! Oh how I wish you were here to have told me he was no good for me. I nearly let him destroy me. I sacrificed parts of me, my dreams. I gave up parts of me for a man I didn't love, and who didn't love me. That's over now. It is all about Grams, me and Westwood Orchards now and to hell with any damned thing else.\" \"Andrea Ruth, that mouth!\" 'Drea opens her eyes and winces, \"Sorry Grams, I was talking to Momma.\" \"I have half a mind to wash that mouth out young lady. Now get up, we have company.\" Ruthie says in a huff. 'Drea jerks up and blushes full on red, although through all the sweat and dirt it was hard to see much of it. \"Oh sorry.\" She shrieks jumping to her feet, coming toe to toe with her Grams and a man...a man who is smirking at her. \"This is Nathan Kyle. He has been in town a couple of months now, and I trust him. He will do whatever you need done, Sugar. I will leave you two; supper will be ready at 5:00.\" \"Yes Ma'am, Ms. Ruthie.\" He says as she turns and leaves them together. 'Drea looks him over, as he sizes her up. \"Nice to meet you Mr. Kyle.\" He chuckles and smiles, \"Nate. Mr. Kyle was my father.\" She smiles as she takes him in. At well over six foot tall, Nate was built like a machine. Brown eyes that look like perfectly melted chocolate and golden shaggy waves that drop over his eye brows. His jeans are worn and tore at the thigh, and his white pull-over is tight across his chest and shoulders. Shaking her head absentmindedly she takes a breath, \"Oh, OK. Nate, I was clearing the brush and debris from the store-front. I want it ready to open as soon as possible.\" \"Forgive me for speaking out of turn Miss Westwood, but Ms. Ruthie isn't able to keep up with the demands of all the baking the shop needs.\" Nate says protectively. \"It's Andrea... 'Drea. Also, I am well aware of my Grams' condition. Which is why I am here. I am a capable chef and I will open the store and handle it myself. Of course whatever help Grams wants to give is great. When the time comes I will hire out for more help.\" \"Oh, your Grams hadn't really told me much about your plans 'Drea.\" \"That's because she doesn't know them. I only arrived this morning after her call not even 48 hours ago. There has been little discussion, but this place is magical and I won't let it go under because it means too much to her and me.\" \"What do you need me to do?\" Nate says with a smile. Nate never thought that Ms. Ruthie's grand-daughter would come in and plan to save the day. He assumed her every intention was to fix it up and sell it off. Boy was he wrong. She was pretty, strikingly. She was curvy in all the right places, and her beautiful black hair and emerald green eyes made his heart beat a little harder. She was a Westwood, beautiful, passionate, and giving. All this and just knowing her five minutes... Jesus Nate get a grip! Women don't mix with your plan man... A warm body every now and then and again...sure that's great, but nothing like 'Drea. You don't get mixed up with a girl like her when all you want to do is be able to outrun the past. Andrea Westwood was a keeper. She could see into his eyes all the way down to his soul and that could shatter them both. Andrea Westwood had 'keeper' written all over her face. After the better part of the afternoon of following 'Drea around like a puppy Nate has a list of things to get done: fences to mend, rooms to paint, a roof to repair, not to mention a kitchen to update in the store and display cases to build. She knew what she wanted and how she wanted it, she was totally in control and Nate was speechless in awe of her plans. \"Electrical and plumbing should be checked too, but I would think you would want a bonded professional for that. I can find someone for you.\" Nate says as they lock up the store. \"OK, that would be great. I haven't been home in ten years, so I wouldn't even know who to call.\" \"This place is stranded in time.\" Nate says with a chuckle. His brown eyes sparkle with flecks of gold and 'Drea is lost in them. \"Nothing much ever changes around here.\" \"Yeah, tell me about it.\" 'Drea smiles as they walk through the orchard back up to the house. \"So Nate, where are you from and how did you end up here?\" \"Born and raised in Iowa. Then I got out of there when I was nineteen, traveled with work. Now I just sort of landed here.\" \"Oh sounds like fun. I have only been here and New York. I never thought I would leave here...'Drea says as her voice trails off. \"Really?\" Nate asks eyeing her. He swears he can hear her trying to hide pain in her voice. \"Why did you leave then 'Drea? It is obvious you love it here.\" She stops and turns as their eyes meet, his eyes seem to study her trying to delve into her and search for all the answers. She shivers and shakes it off, \"Oh after high school graduation... you know stupid teenage girl.\" She replies shrugging it off. Nate realizes as he nods a simple reply that there is much more to this story, but decides it best to let it lie as she has laid it... for now. What business is it of his anyway? Giving her a smile, letting her know that the discussion is over they turn and walk to the house. As the front door opens, the smell of pot roast and fresh cornbread hit them both right away. \"If she would marry me, I wouldn't want for another thing in my life.\" Nate says with a sigh. \"God, is that apple pie too?\" 'Drea smiles, \"Yes it is, and sorry no one would ever measure up to Grand-dad. You will have to settle with a food affair, like everyone else.\" \"This is what she tells me. I was hoping to sway her with diamonds and flowers, a man can dream can't he?\" He teases nudging her with his elbow. \"Get in here you two, supper is done. Don't make me come a huntin' for ya!\" \"Yes, Ma'am.\" 'Drea and Nate both say in unison. \"She loses her 'gs' when she gets irritated or impatient. Just a tip.\" 'Drea says to him with a giggle. \"I'll do well to remember that, especially when she has a skillet in her hand.\" He snickers making 'Drea toss her head back and laugh. They way her green eyes sparkle when she laughed...like emeralds in sunshine...made his knees go weak. Later that night as she lay in bed, 'Drea's mind wanders. She thinks back to the store and how much she wants to do with it. To the orchards and all the fruit that will be ready soon to use in the kitchen. To her Grams, who is not admitting how bad off she is but 'Drea is determined to deal with it all accordingly. Then finally and lingering to Nate. He will be a hard worker to get everything done, so she can open the store, do big things with the orchard and maybe even fix up the house to make Grams' life easier. It doesn't hurt that he is scorch-the-sheets-hot. How will she ever get any work done around him? She may have to learn to cook wearing a blindfold. He could be a welcomed distraction... She quickly dismisses the thought. No 'Drea men are off limits! This is just about Grams and you fixing up the orchard and bringing it back to its glory days. She repeats the thoughts over and over in her head, as a mantra as she drifts. And damnit all if she doesn't dream of melted chocolate and ripped Levi's. In town Nate tosses and turns in his small bed at his apartment above Vanover’s Grocery. Why is it that every time he closes his eyes he sees her? He promised Ms. Ruthie he would help do whatever was needed. She was the only one who accepted him here at first. When he showed up in town, people were skittish. She gave him work, which with a flush bank account he didn’t really need the money. Hard work took his mind off things. She cooked for him, made him pies and treated him like family, something he never really had. Now there is ‘Drea, she is so much like her Grams. Which makes this all the more important for him to help them. As sleep takes him, he doesn’t have nightmares tonight. For the first time since he can remember he sleeps peacefully. Tonight Nate’s dreams are of a raven haired, green-eyed goddess and he knows now he is in trouble, big trouble. Chapter Two: Change in the Wind ‘Drea spends most of the next few days, cleaning the kitchen in the store, she has ordered her updated kitchen appliances and both the plumber and electrician gave them a clean bill of health. Nothing could have been more perfect, all her things had been delivered and she unpacked and organized everything with glee. The kitchen inside the store would rival all kitchens, she thought as she turned to throw a box to the pile by the door she slams into Nate. “Oh! Shit, sorry you snuck up on me.” She says with a squeal. He was warm and all man, ‘Drea thought. Shaking her head, she pulls away. Bad idea, she scolds herself. Nate felt a pang of disappointment as she turned from him and frowned unsure why. “You have been busy ‘Drea. The new appliances will be here tomorrow right?” His question made those emerald eyes sparkle with excitement. “Yes, and then I will be baking away in here. Grams was able to talk the grocer into delivering all I needed tomorrow as well.” Her eyes brighten and dance with excitement making Nate pants become uncomfortable. He was staring at a woman who put his sanity and his dick in a vise…and he was enjoying it. How sick was he? “Nate! I can bake in here tomorrow, I can’t wait!” ‘Drea’s excitement makes him smile, “What do you bake ‘Drea?” He asks scratching his chin. Wiping the sweat from her forehead she smiles, “You come in here tomorrow afternoon, and you can see for yourself.” “Well you have a deal, I am more than happy to play taste tester. I fixed the fences in the orchard; I will start on the roof now. Tomorrow I can paint the front room and get measurements for the display cases.” “That would be great; it seems you have been busy yourself. I sure hope you’re hungry, Grams is making fried chicken and will not take no for an answer.” “Well I can’t say no to a beautiful woman, who cooks.” Nate says teasing. “I had better get to the roof and earn that supper.” He nudges her playfully and walks outside. After ‘Drea is done in the kitchen, she walks out to the grass and sprawls out with a bottle of water: Nate is up on the roof, shirtless repairing the busted shingles. ‘Drea watches as his muscles bunch as he nails each shingle into place, those torn Levi’s stretch as he bends. Wow. ‘Drea wonders what his strong arms would feel like around her, making her shiver with want. Suddenly his eyes meet hers and she freezes. Damn, busted! “Enjoying the view?” He asks playfully raising a brow. ‘Drea takes a drink of her water, her mouth suddenly dry, “Um…what?” She asks innocently. “Oh, you heard me Sugar.” He teases bending to pick up another shingle, giving her another heat flash. “I am just cooling off.” She says shakily. Nate chuckles, “That’s the last thing on your mind ‘Drea.” “Oh honestly!” ‘Drea sighs. “Anytime you want a closer look Sugar, just ask.” Nate teases as ‘Drea goes into the kitchen to get another water. Pacing around the kitchen island ‘Drea scolds herself. “Idiot! What were you thinking? It’s one thing to oogle; it is another thing entirely to get caught, Jesus ‘Drea!” “So you were oogling me?” ‘Drea jumps and jerks into the island. “Damn it, what are you a ninja?” Pulling his shirt on Nate laughs, “So was it one thing in particular you were oogling or just the whole package in general?” Taking her water from her hand he gulps it down. “Oh my God! Don’t say package!” ‘Drea shrieks as she blushes crimson. Nate roars with laughter. “Don’t sweat it ‘Drea, you are worth the oogle yourself.” “Let’s go eat.” She stutters. As they walk out toward the orchard, his arm brushes hers making her shudder. Nate notices and smiles at her, his heart racing. Jesus Nate! Over a touch! Are you a horny teenager or what? He knew he shouldn’t have teased her over watching him but, he liked getting her all worked up, those green eyes of hers dance with fire. After dinner ‘Drea sits on the porch swing staring out at the orchard. Nate strolls out and sits beside her. “Hey.” He says nudging her with his knee. “Penny for your thoughts?” “Hey.” She replies sighing, “I missed the quiet and the trees. I could stare at it all night.” “Me too ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly. ‘Drea peaks over at him watching her and blushes. “Sorry to bail but I have an early morning…deliveries and all.” ‘Drea says nervously standing. “Yeah, I’ll see you ‘Drea.” Nate says as he walks down to his truck and then he is gone. Shaking her head, trying to figure out what the hell what was all about, ‘Drea goes to bed. From the window, Ms. Ruthie shakes her head with a chuckle, holding the photo from her wedding day. “Well Frank our ‘Drea is finally home. It seems to be getting interesting around here. Seems to me, love may be in the air again darling. She is broken right now but, I think being home and Nathan Kyle are just what she needs.” The next morning ‘Drea practically dances up to the store. Shortly after 8:00 am, two delivery men set up the new kitchen appliances. Just as she signs the slips and old black truck pulls up with ‘Vanover Grocery’ printed on the side. “Well Andrea Ruth, as I live and breathe. Look at you all grown up.” A white haired man says as he unloads bags with Nate. “Mr. Vanover, how are you?” ‘Drea replies with a smile. “Just look at me honey, I am doing well.” He says with a chuckle. “Yes, Sir. Thank you for the delivery.” “You just make my day, bake an old man somethin’ good.” Mr. Vanover says as ‘Drea pays him and he kisses her cheek. “It is good to see you home again ‘Drea.” “It is good to be home, see you.” She replies as he climbs into the truck and pulls out. “Drea walks into the store kitchen and starts putting away groceries. “Did I get replaced as taste tester?” Nate teases as he sits the last of the bags on the bar. “No of course not. This afternoon?” ‘Drea answers with a smile. Nate smiles making ‘Drea’s knees go weak, and then leaves. Shaking it off ‘Drea cranks her IPod in her stereo deck. As REO Speedwagon blares on about Ridin’ the storm out “Drea is rolling dough and filling cake pans. Nate peeks in watching her; she is maxing icing swaying to the music. Shaking his head he chuckles to himself and starts measuring the room for the display cases he is going to build. Later that afternoon, Nate’s stomach forces him to notice the smells coming from the kitchen. Peaking around the door he shouts, “Is it safe?” No answer… He walks in and sees ‘Drea shimmying to the music, as she adds meringue to a butterscotch pie. He stands in awe as the smells hit him; she is baking pies, cakes and he swears he can smell donuts. “’Drea?” He shouts again. This time she turns and smiles, “You caught me. I couldn’t stop once I started. Nate lets out the breath he didn’t realize he had been holding, making ‘Drea laugh. “Why Nate…” She says arching a brow, “Were you oogling?” Laughing he just nods, yes he was staring watching her ass shake to the music as she danced around the island made him hard. He was hard and laughing… that isn’t normal. Changing the subject he glances around the room, “It smells amazing. I got the room ready to paint and the measurements for the cases… Um, do I smell donuts ‘Drea?” Nate says sniffing. “Yes, just out of the fryer.” She replies gesturing to the granite island where the baked goods lie cooling. “Sit, I’ll get you a plate and some coffee.” “Who am I to turn down a woman who can cook?” He teases as he sits at the small table in the kitchen and ‘Drea places a plate with donuts on it and hands him a cup of coffee. He bites into a still hot donut and groans, “Damn ‘Drea these are amazing. You will be a millionaire.” “Thanks.” She says as she pulls a cobbler out of the oven and replaces it with a cake. Sitting the cobbler down to cool, she pours herself a coffee and sits next to Nate. He reaches over and strokes her cheek, making her shudder. “You had some meringue.” Nate says as he licks his finger, his brown eyes flickering with heat. “Oh thanks I…um.” She stops as Nate stands to his feet and pulls her up so that they are toe to toe. “’Drea, I…” He starts, then curses, “Oh I am going to go to hell for this.” Cupping her jaw, he crushes his lips to hers. She sighs and pulls her hands through his hair. After a moment of weakness she pulls back. “Nate, we can’t ah…I can’t… I’m sorry.” She says as she goes lax in his arms. “I should be apologizing. I would if I could remember my name. Wow! I mean I… um sorry ‘Drea. I am going to get back to painting, thanks for the donuts.” As he turns and walks to the door she calls to him. “Nate…” As he turns she continues, “I said I can’t, I didn’t say that I didn’t want to. I am just out of a bad break-up and well…” “It’s OK, ‘Drea, we all have our pasts.” He says and then he is gone. Hours later ‘Drea finishes baking, boxes everything up and stores it in the cooler, except for the butterscotch pie. She boxes it up to take to the house for dessert hoping to clear the air with Nate. As the thunder explodes, the rain starts pelting down in sheets. Oh this walk ought to be fantastic! Glancing out the window, she sighs as she watches the rain pour down and lightning flash across the sky. Nate had finished painting hours ago, and left to go out and put things into the shed in the orchard. (Not that she was watching him or anything.) ‘Drea looks out through the trees as the lightning stretches across the sky, and squints looking to see if she can see Nate. Surely he is at the house waiting on his supper with Grams. Telling herself she is silly for worrying, she pours herself a mug of coffee and sits at the table picking at a donut. Suddenly, the door flies open and ‘Drea jumps knocking her chair over, jerking around she sees Nate standing at the door trying to shake out of a raincoat. “Nate, are you alright? You should be up at the house waiting on supper, not out here in this weather.” ‘Drea says as she pulls up the chair she knocked over and pours him a cup of coffee. “Ms. Ruthie went into town to play Bingo at the fire house. She packed up dinner for us and said I should come down here and make sure you eat, since you have been down here since early this morning.” He explains as he sits the bag on the island and begins unpacking the tubs of food. “There are pork chops, fried potatoes, biscuits and honey. Your Grams sure can put together a meal. You two should add on to this store and open up a restaurant.” “Don’t think I haven’t thought about it. I just don’t want her over doing it. She hasn’t really told me much of what the doctor says about her arthritis. I know she is supposed to ease up. So, baby steps you know.” ‘Drea says as she makes plates and places one in front of Nate and sits down at the table with him. “So what else did you bake today? The smells coming outta this place today were heaven. I was almost sad that I was finished painting because I couldn’t linger to enjoy them.” Nate says as he spreads honey on a biscuit and sips his coffee. “I made a blackberry cobbler, cakes, cookies, and a butterscotch pie with meringue that I made from scratch. I had so much fun in here today!” “That meringue was amazing, I tasted a bit.” He says with a wink as he bites into his pork chop. ‘Drea flushes, “Yeah, we should talk about that. I left New York to help Grams Nate, but it was convenient timing.” She starts. Nate stops and watches her eyes for a moment and smiles, “Well that’s a good thing right?” ‘Drea nods, “I worked in a high-end restaurant as head chef, and my fiancé was the owner.” “Was?” Nate eyes her with curiosity. “I walked in on him and a waitress, well one of his many waitresses. Needless to say, it is over. Far passed over and I was glad to have a reason to leave.” ‘Drea says sighing into her coffee. Nate shakes his head, “’Drea I am sorry, but he doesn’t deserve you. No one should be treated like that.” ‘Drea blushes at the protective tone in Nate’s voice. “Well, it doesn’t matter now, I am home and I am actually enjoying it. Do you want dessert?” ‘Drea asks as she stands up and gets a pie server and small plates. Nate tops off their coffees as ‘Drea places two pieces of butterscotch pie on the table. Nate bites into the pie and his eyes glaze over and close. “Oh ‘Drea, this is amazing!” He groans. “Thanks. It is Grams’ recipe, my Grand-dad’s favorite. I was feeling sentimental.” She replies as she takes a bite. “Wow, yeah I have missed this.” Nate smiles at how ‘Drea’s face softens at the mention of her grandparents. “She is an amazing lady. I didn’t know your Grand-dad but, he had to be one hell of a man to deserve her and this pie.” Nate says with a wink. “Yes.” ‘Drea starts and her eyes go misty. “She made this for them on their first date. Grand-dad said he knew right that very night that there was no one else for him. He walked her through the orchard every night for months and proposed to her out there. Even opened the store for her to bake in, they had something special.” “Yeah, go all their lives without finding anyone. No wonder she won’t run off and marry me, she already had it all.” Nate says as he touches her hand. “Can I ask you something about the ex ‘Drea?” ‘Drea tenses, “Um, yeah and his name was Phillip.” Nate secretly wishing a man in New York named Phillip would rot in the seventh circle of hell with a flesh eating crotch disease smiles at his own private joke and continues, “OK. Phillip? Were you in love with him? I mean honestly you had to be shooting for the whole she-bang after watching your grandparents all these years.” ‘Drea sighs, she felt things for Phillip. They were comfortable with each other, shared interests, they had the business, shared a condo, but did she ever really love him? “No, I guess I didn’t. I never really thought about that, we looked good together, I mean there was the restaurant and it was comfortable. No, it was nothing like Grams and Grand-dad.” Nate sighs, unexpectedly relieved, “Well, good thing you got out while you still could.” “You know I never really thought about it. I wasn’t into planning the wedding, we were engaged for over a year and I hadn’t even started looking. When I caught him I was hurt.” “Of course you were, you trusted him.” ‘Drea holds her hand up and exhales, “Wait you didn’t let me finish. I was hurt of course because everyone knew it was going on but me. I was embarrassed. The biggest part of me though was relieved. I think I knew it was over and I was a coward and needed a reason to leave. It was comfortable and I didn’t know how to just walk away. Seeing him with her, and the fact that it was over came so easily to me. He didn’t really try to fight for me. So I packed up, emptied my bank account and here I am.” Nate reaches over and intertwines her hand in his, “I am glad you are here ‘Drea.” ‘Drea swallows the lump in her throat, as her eyes meet his. Those deep brown eyes burning into hers making her blush…and want…and need. Pulling her hand from his she smiles, “Well I better clean up the dishes.” Standing she turns to the sink and washes the plates stacking them in the rack to dry, as Nate turns the music up. “You have Boston on your IPod playlist?” He asks with a smirk. “Guilty. I am a classic rock junkie. My Momma wouldn’t listen to anything else.” “Oh Sugar, you were raised right.” Nate teases. “We would take these longs drives through the mountains on the weekends, crank the stereo and sing along. She couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket but we didn’t care.” ‘Drea says, her voice cracking. “Jesus why am I talking to you like this? I have never told anyone this stuff, not even Grams.” Nate walks over and wraps his arms around her waist and kisses her hair. “Maybe you need to get this out ‘Drea, maybe you feel like you can trust me.” Nate squeezes her to him and lowers his voice to a whisper, “You know you can, Sugar. You can trust me.” She whips around, facing him tears streaming down her face. His face falls as he looks into her green eyes full of pain. “’Drea?” “The night after my graduation we went up into the mountains and we were singing along with Styx. She was going on and on about how proud she was of me. I was going to do such big things and she couldn’t wait. I told her I wasn’t going away to school, that I wanted to stay here. She exploded and I didn’t let down either, we were arguing and we didn’t see the truck. We went through the guard rail…” Nate pulls her into his arms and she cries softly. “We were in the car over the cliff for hours. I kept talking, about everything…anything… Finally help came, but it was too late. Momma was already gone, internal bleeding.” Nate’s chest tightens, his heart breaking for her. “Oh Sugar. I am so sorry, so damned sorry.” He says stroking up and down her back. “After the funeral, I packed up and left. Grams and Grand-dad begged me to stay. I didn’t even come home when he passed; it hurt too much to even be here. Everything reminded me of her. It is different now, I want to remember. I want to be here.” ‘Drea says as she sniffles and pulls back. “Oh Nate I’m sorry…I didn’t mean to…” “Hey it’s OK.” He says soothing her. “You can unload on me anytime.” He says sweetly as he strokes her cheek with his thumb. ‘Drea’s breath hitches, every inch of skin Nate touches comes alive and she gasps, “Nate…” “Still can’t?” Nate asks as his thumb brushes her bottom lip. “We shouldn’t you know it will complicate things…” She says shakily as her eyes flutter closed, “We should think about it first.” “Well, you think about it Sugar, and I will…” Nate starts as he brushes his lips over hers. Soft and warm, the kiss was tender. ‘Drea melts into Nate, her hands run up his arms and around his neck. Nate pulls her chin up and deepens the kiss, running his tongue along her bottom lip, a silent plea for her to open up to him. As his tongue meets hers desire explodes like fire. ‘Drea moans softly as she tugs at his hair. Finally, Nate pulls away breathless, looking into those emerald eyes he has been careful not to drown in. Yet. “’Drea?” “Yeah?” She replies, her body still humming from his hands and mouth. “Still thinking?” He asks as he tucks her hair behind her ear. “Um…” She starts but he pushes his lips to hers again. “You keep thinking Sugar, and I will be waiting.” Nate says turning and walking out the door, leaving ‘Drea nearly in a puddle. Chapter Three: Taking Chances Over the rest of the week, ‘Drea say little of Nate. He had been busy in the workshop in the orchard, building the display cases. She had baked and cooked until her cooler was full, even sending Mr. Vanover a weeks worth of suppers and desserts. In return he had been making deliveries so she didn’t need to leave the store to go into town. ‘Drea was in the middle of mixing up frosting when her Grams walks in and sits at the table in the kitchen. “Sugar, you have been a busy bee.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea says as Ruthie pours coffee and helps herself to cookies cooling on the rack. Ruthie watches smiling at her one and only granddaughter as she ices a black forest cake and places it in the cooler. “Dessert tonight Sugar?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, what are you planning to have tonight Grams?” “I have chicken and dumplins going on the stove and will ask Nathan to join us.” “Oh?” ‘Drea asks unable to hide the flush that steals across her face. Ruthie smiles and sighs, “Sugar, he is a good man. He comes from a hard past, but he is a good man. He thinks very highly of you.” “Does he? Well we don’t really know each other very well do we? He has been very helpful and is working very hard. We will be ready to open the store in the next week or so at this rate.” ‘Drea pops a cookie in her mouth and continues, “I have ordered more from the grocery, which should be here tomorrow. I also paid up all the bills until next month.” Ruthie slams her mug down on the table making ‘Drea jump, “Andrea Ruth Westwood, I am not talkin’ about the store, or the bills, or when the groceries are bein’ delivered by Old man Vanover.” “Grams…” ‘Drea starts but the glare from her Grams shuts her mouth right back. “I am talkin’ about the fact that you were a mess when you got here; bakin’ or Nathan Kyle or a combination of the two had changed that. Judgin’ by the look on your face when I say his name Missy I can see it is both, maybe more him.” Ruthie says scolding ‘Drea. ‘Drea knowing looks at her Grams, this woman may be her grandmother and use a walker, but if she doesn’t tread lightly here she will take ‘Drea over her knee with a wooden spoon like she used to when she would misbehave as a child. “Grams, I really love what I’m doing. Focusing on you and me getting the store opened. The trees will be ready for a harvest soon and we will be baking and canning. Oh Grams I love being home.” ‘Drea says teary. Ruthie’s eyes soften, “Oh Sugar I have missed so much, but that doesn’t change the subject though. Now I know there is somethin’ goin’ on with Nathan. Neither one of you want to talk about it with me, oh that is just fine. I am just an old woman, what do I know?” ‘Drea starts to answer but Ruthie continues, “Well I will tell you what I know Missy. I met your Grand-daddy and nearly fell for him at first sight. I made him a pie and that night I knew he was it for me. I didn’t go lookin’ for it Andrea Ruth, I didn’t. I was seventeen years old for pity’s sake. I wasn’t ready for that, but when I saw the way that ol’ teddy bear looked at me, oh that man. He looked at me like Nathan looks at you, and I know what I am sayin’ that look makes a woman go weak in the knees. You made him a butterscotch pie didn’t you Sugar?” “Yes, Ma’am I guess I kinda did. The night you went to Bingo. Grams, do you realize that when you are angry you lose your ‘gs’?” ‘Drea says stifling a giggle. “You aren’t too old to go across my knee Andrea Ruth. He is a good man. ‘Drea don’t go messin’ with his head. I just came from the workshop, gave him the same talkin’ to about you. Either you two attack this thing head on or leave it alone. No secrets and no games.” “Yes, Ma’am. Did you threaten to take him across you knee too Grams?” ‘Drea asks with a wink. Ruthie sighs, “Get outta here Andrea Ruth, I would like to try out the new kitchen and make a pie of my own.” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea replies as Ms. Ruthie kicks her out of the kitchen and into the yard. ‘Drea walks through the orchard looking up at the sky through the branches. The fruit is starting to fill the trees and the smells are heavenly. ‘Drea picks an apple and bites into it, closing her eyes to savor the taste, no apple had ever come close to tasting as good as the ones she would pick here as child. Nate told her to keep thinking…and she had been doing little else… Thinking of how good his arms felt around her, how his lips felt warm and tender on hers, and the explosion between them. She wanted him badly. ‘Drea didn’t know how she ended up outside the workshop, she didn’t intend on coming here did she? As she walked up to it, she was stopped dead in her tracks. Nate was shirtless, sanding the edges of the display cases with an electric sander. He had on low slung carpenter jeans and a tool belt that had belonged to her Grand-dad. He was drenched in sweat and unaware of her watching him. So ‘Drea decided to oogle, she decided to stand there and oogle…and want…and need…a lot. Nate wasn’t unaware of her. He had missed her, more times than he could count he wanted to go to her and tell her just that. To hell with her needing to think about them, he wanted her and hell she wanted him just as much. The moment she stepped out of the trees he knew she was there watching, but he kept sanding, making sure the edges were perfect. Moving and bending, knowing she was watching like when he was on the roof. Turning the sander off, he turns and smiles at her. “Well, ‘Drea what a pleasant surprise. Have you come to oogle me?” “Those look good.” ‘Drea replies her mouth suddenly dry. “Thank you, come take a closer look. I won’t bite Sugar.” He says with a chuckle. She walks into the workshop and smiles arching a brow, “Sound a bit like the big bad wolf don’t you?” Nate waggles a brow as she leans down looking at the cabinets. “Wow these look amazing Nate.” He walks up beside her, “They will look even better stained and filled with all those amazing things you ladies bake. When are you planning on opening?” “Hopefully next weekend, I know Grand-dad used to make a big deal of the weekends. Big displays of fruit, baked goods, and lots of people; Grams would can for days and it would be wall to wall people. Everyone knew us and it was like family, I want that back.” ‘Drea says as she smiles, standing now toe to toe with Nate… How did that happen? “It will be a good turn- out; the gossip mill is already going full blast. Start advertising, make flyers and we can harvest what is ready in the orchard and have everything set up. Ms. Ruthie has been canning like mad, and your coolers are full aren’t they?” Nate says as he strokes ‘Drea’s arm. “Yes, it is all falling into place.” ‘Drea reaches up and touches Nate’s cheek as her green eyes meet his searching. “Nate…” “Don’t ‘Drea, don’t ruin it, don’t think anymore.” Nate says crushing his lips to hers. The warm, tender kiss making her knees weak. ‘Drea could taste the salty sweat on his lip. He pulls her into him; he sighs at the smell of vanilla and meringue. He had grown needy of the smell of her and the taste of her lips. It made him nervous, he never needed someone before; he was realizing a little too late that he needed ‘Drea and the hell with everything else. ‘Drea had spent the past few days denying everything she had felt, everything her Grams had said was true. She had felt something when Nate touched her, when he kissed her. She trusted him, she told him things she had never told anyone, she cried in front of him unashamed. She couldn’t believe it but Nathan Kyle had snuck right in and made her trust, made her relax. As Nate pulled back slightly, he smiled down at her as she relaxed into his arms. “So, are we done thinking ‘Drea?” ‘Drea opens her eyes and smiles at him. “I think that whatever is going on between us is a huge mistake. One of us is going to get hurt, I am not even sure if I am going to stay here.” “’Drea…” He starts but she silences him with a kiss. “It may be a mistake…” She says as she pulls away letting him catch his breath. “But Nate, right now I don’t care. If Grams has the guts to kick me in the ass about it then maybe I should listen.” He smiles a purely sexy, wicked smile. “Sugar, I love that woman.” Nate says with a groan and kisses her again. “Grams made chicken and dumplins, I made a black forest cake, and we figured we need you to stay for supper so we don’t waste food.” ‘Drea says kissing his jaw. “Black forest cake?” Nate asks grinning against her neck. “Yes, ever had one?” “It is my favorite. I have one on every birthday; these were just store bought though. I am sure I will never be the same after yours.” ‘Drea’s breath hitches as Nate’s hands run down her back and run along the waist band of her jeans, stroking her bare back under her shirt. “W-well, I have to get back, Grams is baking in the store and I want to taste test. I will see you at supper time.” ‘Drea kisses him sweetly on the lips and heads back to the store. Nate sags against the display case and sighs, that woman will be the death of him, but what a way to go. Snapping out of it, he turns and starts staining the first case for the store. ‘Drea told Nate so much about her past, things she had told no one. Although she can tell there are things he is not saying. Things she hasn’t really asked about though either. He had such pain in his eyes when she talked about watching her Momma die in the car beside her. Was that all for her? Shaking her head to dismiss the thought, ‘Drea makes a deal with herself that she is going to enjoy this, have fun with it. When he leaves town or she does, it will be a clean break no strings and no regrets. As ‘Drea walks back into the kitchen her Grams chuckles looking up from her meringue and smiles. “Well Sugar, you didn’t waste any time did you?” “Grams! I went to invite him to supper, and the cases look great” ‘Drea says as the blush runs across her cheeks, she grabs a water from the fridge and sits at the table to drink. “Well of course you did. Did you enjoy the view Sugar? That man was grown better than a June Apple.” “Grams!” ‘Drea says spitting her water. “Now Missy, I know good and well how to appreciate a hard workin’ man. I may be old but I ain’t dead.” “Grams, you will never be old, you are timeless. You know Nate would marry you tomorrow if only you would say yes.” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “Yes, he would. He isn’t your Grand-dad though Andrea. No man will ever measure up to Frank Westwood in my eyes, though Nathan Kyle is a close second. That man is all about you Sugar.” Ruthie says with a smile as she washes up and kisses ‘Drea on the cheek. “Now you make sure you are at that table, washed up and six or I will come a huntin’ Missy.” “Yes, Ma’am, and I will bring dessert.” ‘Drea says as her Grams walks out of the store slowly steadying her walker, climbs into her car, and drives up to the house. After cleaning the kitchen ‘Drea boxes up the cakes and locks up the store, making the trip through the orchard to the house. At six on the dot, ‘Drea is washed up in a green sundress at the table as Nate walks in. “Well don’t you clean up nice Nathan?” Ruthie says as she sets the table. “Thank you Ms Ruthie, you two look lovely and everything smells so good.” Nate says kissing Ruthie’s cheek and sitting across from ‘Drea. “’Drea pour the tea will you?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, Grams.” ‘Drea replies, pouring three glasses of sweet tea and then adding lemon. The three sit chatting about the orchard and eating supper. Ruthie is delighted to see the smiles on their faces, knowing where this is heading even if neither of them does. She smiles to herself knowing these two don’t stand a chance, just like Frank and her were, they are goners. “Well, Nathan ‘Drea says the display cases are nearly done and that look real good.” She pipes up tired of the comfortable silence as they eat dessert. Nate looks up at them both with a shy grin, “Yes, ma’am, all sanded and I started staining them today. Once that’s done I will put in the glass. They will look great filled with all those goodies.” “Very good then. Early tomorrow, you two can start pickin’ apples and such, before the heat rises. I’ll call it a night after I clean up here. You two should walk through the orchard, it is beautiful in the twilight.” “Grams, I can…” ‘Drea starts. “No, Andrea Ruth, I am kickin’ you two out, now go on.” Nate smiles, standing he takes ‘Drea’s hand, “She’s lost her ‘gs’, we better go.” “At least someone listens. Now shoo.” Ruthie says as she shoos them both out the door. “Well that is twice today that she has kicked me out of a kitchen.” ‘Drea giggles. “Come one Sugar, let’s go see some trees.” Nate says taking her arm in his. They walk arm in arm through the trees, and ‘Drea sighs, “They walked here every night, arm in arm, and stealing kisses under the stars, oh Nate they sure had it all. Even after they married they walked here every night. I used to sit in my window and watch them walk off together. It was so romantic.” Nate pushes her up against an apple tree and kisses her warm and passionately. ‘Drea returns his kiss, fisting her hands in his brown pullover. Tilting her chin up to him he deepens the kiss, as his thigh slides between hers. Nate never believed in grand romantic gestures, but when ‘Drea was talking about her grandparents all he wanted to do was kiss her senseless. If it was romantic, then so be it but if he didn’t kiss her soon he would explode. He gently pulls back and puts his hands on her hips to steady them both. “’Drea are you OK?” Her eyes flutter open and she sighs, “You kissed me. You kissed me here in the orchard under the stars.” Nate chuckles, “Yeah, I suppose I did.” He strokes a hand up her arm and cups her jaw. “I think I will do it again.” Before she can react, he brushes his mouth over hers, and as her lips part for him he caresses his tongue with hers. She moans into his mouth as his hands cup her behind urging her into him. “Nate…” She whispers against her jaw. “What is it Sugar?” He asks kissing down her throat. “Why do you call me that?” She whispers. His eyes meet hers, searching. “Ms. Ruthie does, it just stuck and you are so sweet… I don’t know it just fits, why?” “Grand-dad used to call Grams that.” “Oh, do you mind ‘Drea?” “No, I don’t mind it. Nate?” She asks as she looks into his eyes. “Yeah?” He asks as his hands travel up and down her back as if he can’t get enough of her in his hands. “Kiss me again.” She whispers inches from his lips. “Oh Sugar, you only have to ask.” He growls and ‘Drea melts into Nate’s kiss, swept away by the romance in the moment. Chapter Four: Apple Pickin’ The alarm sounds at 5am jolting ‘Drea out of her dream-land recap of twilight walks in the orchard with Nate. Last night couldn’t have been more perfect. Throwing on jeans and a gray pull-over, ‘Drea grabs her sneakers and heads to the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Sugar.” Grams calls as ‘Drea pours a mug of coffee. “Morning Grams, sleep well?” “Yes, I did. How was the orchard?” ‘Drea sighs and sits at the table, nibbling at a piece of toast. “Oh Grams, it was nice.” “It looked really nice to me, Sugar.” Grams says with a wink. “Were you watchin’?” ‘Drea says blushing. “Andrea Ruth! As if you didn’t watch Grand-dad and me walkin’ every night. Nathan reminds me of him, strong but sweet.” “It was lovely Grams, I always thought the orchard was magical. Momma used to say it too. Last night it was, it was perfect.” “I don’t know about magic, Sugar. All I do know is your Grand-dad and I put all our love into this place; into your Momma and you, we never wanted anything else.” “I miss her Grams, so much.” ‘Drea chokes back a sob. “Oh Sugar, not a day goes by that I don’t miss you Momma. Now that you are home it does ease the pain.” ‘Drea hugs her hard, “Me too, I guess you are stuck with me then.” “Good, now go pick some apples, I hear Nate’s truck pullin’ up.” Grabbing the basket her Grams has packed ‘Drea heads out and hops up into the truck with Nate. “Morning Sugar.” He says kissing her sweetly on the cheek. “Ms. Ruthie send breakfast?” “And coffee.” ‘Drea says with a nod. “Love of my life.” He winks taking the mug. “I loaded the bins already, so we are ready to go.” “Let’s hit it.” Nate pulls into the orchard driving down the worn trail. As he comes to a set of trees nearly bursting with ripe green apples he pulls over and stops the truck. ‘Drea looks over her green eyes dancing with the flecks of gold and Nate’s heart races. Before he can say a word, ‘Drea hops out of the truck and leaps up a tree effortlessly. “Careful Sugar, no broken bones.” Nate calls as he pulls the ladder out of the back of the truck. “My Grand-dad used to say that I could swing in one of these all day. He would tease me that my Daddy was part monkey.” ‘Drea says as she tosses apples into the first bin. “Ha. I seem to forget sometimes that you are a Westwood.” He says as he climbs the ladder and starts on the tree next to her. She peeks around a branch her green eyes blazing at him through that black hair framing her face. “What exactly does that mean?” “That you are determined and tough as hell. I keep underestimating you ‘Drea.” Nate says his eyes full of heat. “Oh.” ‘Drea says, smiles then moves to a higher branch. By noon, they have loaded all the bins full of apples into the back of Nate’s truck and are sitting in the grass against a tree resting. Nibbling on the sandwiches and odds and ends that Ms Ruthie packed picnic style and sipping on waters. “Looks like the rain missed us.” Nate says squeezing ‘Drea’s hand. “Yeah. I could stay here all day, it is so peaceful here.” Nate tugs her hand pulling her into his lap, pulling the clip from her hair so her long black strands fall around them. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly as he kisses her softly running his fingers through her freed hair. “Grams will come looking for us Nate, and without her ‘gs’.” ‘Drea says teasingly. “Nah, she hasn’t been in the orchard since I have been in town.” Nate says kissing her jaw line and nips at her ear. His thumbs rubbing circles into her back. ‘Drea kisses him gently tugging at his bottom lip as her hands twist and tug in his shaggy blonde hair. “’Drea?” He groans, as she nips at his stubbled jaw. “Hmm?” She purrs. “You drive me crazy… Mmm… ‘Drea, we can’t…not here.” ‘Drea pulls back and laughs, “No we can’t, can we?” She stands and walks back to the truck and Nate yells, “’Drea, I said we can’t, I didn’t say I didn’t want to.” Turning back to him as he repeats her words back at her, she leaps into his arms. “Oh Nate.” She whispers kissing him hard. “Grams is going to Bingo tonight right?” “Mmhmm, hasn’t missed one as far as I know.” “Let me cook for you, come to the store tonight and I’ll have dinner and dessert.” ‘Drea says as she strokes his jaw. “I can’t say no to you lovely Westwood women. See you later then Sugar?” “Yeah, I gotta get to the store; you gotta get the apples up to Grams. Will you tell her about dinner?” “Sure it will be my pleasure to give Ms. Ruthie the night off.” ‘Drea kisses him once more and heads through the orchard to the store. “Yep, she will be a hell of a way to go.” Nate says to himself as he drives his truck up to unload the apples for Ms. Ruthie to clean, and separate. ‘Drea paces around the island as she decides what to make for tonight. She decides on lasagna and a salad, and rolls out dough for herb bread. After mixing the salad and prepping the lasagna she places them both in the fridge. Locking up the store, she heads to the house where Grams is on the porch peeling apples. “I hear I get the night off huh Missy?” “Yes, Ma’am.” ‘Drea says with a smile. “That’s a girl. You two have some fun tonight, Sugar.” ‘Drea kisses her cheek and goes into the house. After a long bath, ‘Drea has lotioned herself and is wearing a silky pink sundress and while ballet flats. She leaves her hair down; he likes it down, and checks her make-up. She whistles on her walk through the orchard as she heads back to the store. As the lasagna and bread cook in the oven she sets the table. Using a white silk table cloth and lighting candles, once she is happy with it she walks to the cooler to get something for dessert and is stopped in her tracks. Sitting on the shelf is a pie and a note: If you think I wouldn’t have my hands in this Missy, you were wrong. Enjoy your night-Grams. Taking the pie and the note ‘Drea smiles. Just as she puts the plates on the table there is a knock at the door. “Come on in Nate, its open.” Nate strolls in handing ‘Drea a single red rose. “Thank you.” She says as she takes him in: he has shaved, and is in a blue dress shirt and black jeans. “You look nice Sugar.” He says pulling her into an embrace. “You clean up nice yourself, hungry?” “Always.” He says with a wink. “I was going to bring wine, but I didn’t know…” Nate starts as he sits down. “I’d rather have a beer anyway.” ‘Drea says handing Nate a bottle. “You are an amazing woman Sugar.” Nate says taking a sip. As they eat they sit together smiling, laughing, and talking about the store. “So in just a few days we will know if this will all work out?” Nate asks as he finishes his plate. “Not exactly, I see it as worth it all regardless if anyone shows up. Grams is the only family I have left and I am happy here.” ‘Drea replies as she slices the pie, as she cuts through the meringue she gasps. Nate brows shoot up, “What is it ‘Drea?” “Grams, she… Oh it is my favorite!” She stammers out. “What…huh?” Nate asks again confused. She carries the pie over and hands him a plate, “When I was a little girl Grand-dad used to buy me Mounds candy bars at the grocer. Grams made me a pie for my birthday one year. I can’t believe she remembered.” ‘Drea says as she bites into the chocolate crème pie with meringue and coconut shavings and sighs. “Sugar you would be surprised at how much she remembers. All she talks about it you and how proud she is of you.” “She is too good to me; Lord what would I do without her.” “Let’s hope we never find out Sugar.” Nate replies as he finishes his pie and clears the table. ‘Drea starts running water in the sink as Nate grabs her arm, spinning her into him. “Dance with me ‘Drea.” “There is no music Nate.” She says shutting off the faucet. “So.” He says matter of fact, and twirls her across the kitchen. The whole world stands still as Nate holds ‘Drea in his arms and he brings his lips to hers. As her arms wrap around his neck he groans against her mouth. Nate’s knees nearly give out, so he locks them in place as he pulls back. “Come with me ‘Drea.” Nate leads ‘Drea through the orchard to a clearing; there is a blanket on the ground, and flameless candles, and cushions set up against a tree. It takes ‘Drea a moment to take it all in as Nate wraps his arms around her waist pulling her into him. “Nate…” ‘She finally gasps, as he squeezes her hand. “I may have had some free time this afternoon, sit.” He says as he sits pulling her into his lap. “Tonight couldn’t get much better, this is beautiful.” She whispers as she kisses him sweetly. “’Drea…” Nate moans as he turns them, laying her on her back on the cushions and blanket, his eyes searching hers. ‘Drea’s hands fist in his shirt and he crushes his mouth to hers. As his hands run up her thighs, ‘Drea starts unbuttoning his shirt, ripping most of the buttons off making her giggle. “Oh, I’m sorry.” “It’s OK. I didn’t like that shirt anyway.” Nate says with a chuckle, as he tosses it off and trails kisses down her throat. Slowly he unbuttons the buttons on the front of her dress kissing every inch of exposed skin, as she arches up to him. “Nate…” She pleads. “Ssh, right here Sugar.” He whispers as he slides her panties down her legs. “I am going to take my time with you Andrea. I have been desperate to touch you for like this for days.” As he pushes her dress off, he takes her mouth with his again, wrapping her legs around him. ‘Drea has never felt like this. Nate had spent his afternoon turning the clearing into a romantic wonderland, and he was worshipping her body like time stood still. Phillip never gave her butterflies, she never saw sparks when he kissed her. Nathan Kyle could make all those things happen and then some. As Nate slowly sank into her, he thought his brain would explode. It was better than anything he could have ever imagined…and he had spent a lot of time imagining… The feel of her soft skin, her heart racing, the smell of vanilla and sugar that came from her was nothing compared to the sweet taste of her. As her sweet pants turned to moans and soft whispers of his name; Nate lost himself and went right over the edge with her. Pulling the extra blanket over them, Nate pulls her against him and kisses her hair. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” As he disposes of the condom in his jeans pocket, he hears ‘Drea sniffle. Concern filling his face, he turns her chin up to look at him, wiping a stray tear from her cheek with his thumb. “Jesus, Sugar did I hurt you?” ‘Drea chuckles out a sob, “No, Nate. No one has ever made me feel so special. No one in a long time, not since…” She trails off. “Since you left here? Oh Sugar, you’ve been with the wrong people. You are amazing, ‘Drea. It’s there loss and my gain.” He says sweetly as he tucks her beneath him and brings his lips to hers. “I plan to spend the night showing you just how amazing I think you are ‘Drea.” ‘Drea stretches as she feels the arms tighten around her. Relaxing back into Nate’s arms, she relives last night and it hits her… We are STILL in the orchard, jerking up she laughs out loud. “We stayed out here all night, and we are naked.” She says as Nate’s eyes flutter open. “Looks like we did, better get up to the house before Ms. Ruthie comes huntin’” Nate teases as he grabs her dress and hands it to her with a wink. Once they are dressed, they walk up to the house where Ms. Ruthie is waiting on the porch swing peeling apples. “Mornin’ you two.” She says with a conspiratorial grin. “Grams, we were um…” ‘Drea starts. “Andrea Ruth, do you think you could possible spin a tale and make be believe anything other than what happened between you two in the orchard? Do you think Grand-dad wasn’t so smooth himself?” Ruthie says with a laugh. “Grams!” ‘Drea says blushing. Ruthie’s eyes dart to Nate lovingly, “Nathan.” She says sweetly. “Morning Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as ‘Drea pulls him into the house. “Pancakes and bacon are on the stove.” Ruthie shouts. As Nate sits digging into the pancakes and bacon, ‘Drea pours the coffee. Sitting beside him she sighs as she bites into a piece of bacon. “So are we…I mean…Um…” She starts. Nate laughs, “Yes, ‘Drea you’re my girl, that is if you want to be.” ‘Drea blushes, and then smiles. “Um, well, just like that huh?” “Guess so.” Nate says finishing his plate, he stands pulling her into him. “I like the sound of that, you ‘Drea…My girl…mine…” Crushing his lips to hers, he turns and lifts her to the counter behind her and her legs wrap around his hips. After surrendering to needing to kiss her senseless he remembers where they are… In Ms. Ruthie’s kitchen, her only grand-daughter on her counter… Jesus man you are a goner. Pulling back he smiles, “OK. I am going back to my place to change; I’ll be back in an hour to put in the display cases.” He adds as he kisses her again, and then he saunters out of the house saying goodbye to Ms. Ruthie on his way to his truck. After gathering her wits, and cleaning up the breakfast dishes, ‘Drea showers and dresses quickly. Ruthie is cooking apples when she comes into the kitchen. “Oh Sugar, you seem lighter this mornin’” “Grams, really…” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “We have calls about tomorrow all mornin’, should have a good turn-out Sugar.” Ruthie says as she starts preparing jars to can apples. “That’s great. Nate and I are going to put in the display cases today.” “Oh, so how are you and Nate, Andrea?” ‘Drea smiles, “Good Grams. He is so sweet, and makes me feel…special.” “Well, good Missy. Now, you get on, I’ve got things to get done. I’ll bring jars down later, once they have cooled.” “Grams, Nate and I will come and load up after supper.” “Alright then Sugar.” Ruthie nods as ‘Drea heads out the door and into the orchard. By the time ‘Drea walks to the store, Nate is backing the truck up to the front doors to unload the display cases. She stops, admiring the view of him stretching across the truck removing the straps holding down the cases. Will she ever tire of oogling this man and his backside? Get a grip ‘Drea, you are gawking like a pervert! Turning just in time to catch her, Nate smiles. “Hey, Sugar.” “Hey yourself.” She calls back as she turns to unlock the doors. “Need some help?” “Nope, they are lighter than they look. You should get in there and bake, Sugar.” Nate says with a grin. “Oh so one night under the stars and I am destined to be the ‘little woman in the kitchen…” She says teasing. Nate laughs, “Well hell, maybe.” He winks. “I would do anything with a donut.” ‘Drea waggles a brow, “Then I had better get to it then. I fully intend to make you work for every bite.” She winks back at him as she turns and saunters into the kitchen. Nate lays his head against the cool metal of his truck and sighs… Yep killing him…killing him… ‘Drea cranks Bon Jovi on her IPod and hooks it into the sound system; she starts mixing flour, eggs and adding all the other ingredients to the mixer. As her dough rises she starts mixing up her glaze. Singing along with ‘Always’ as she rolls out her dough, she feels arms around her waist and smiles. Nate... “They aren’t ready yet.” She teases as he nuzzles her hair. “I got the cases in, and bolted into place. You are ready to open Sugar.” “Nearly. Grams has apples at the house, jars of jelly and some other stuff.” “I’ll go get it now.” Nate says sweetly as he nuzzles her ear pulling her tight against him. Whipping around to face him he hoists her up on the counter and kisses her hard and demanding, her hands roaming up and into his hair and tugging. A cough from the front door startles them both, making ‘Drea nearly jump off the counter. “Well Andrea, I see you changed your recipe. Exactly which part of the process is this?” A man from the door says, adjusting his suit. Part Five: Sometimes you have to face the Past, in the Present, to have a Future. ‘Drea’s face falls as she takes in the man she never thought she would see again... “Phillip. How did you know where to find me? Why are you here?” She asks appalled that he has the guts to show his face now. Nate takes her hand in his and she swears she heard a growl low in his throat. Phillip stands his whole 5’10 in the door way in his expensive black tailored suit and eyes the place. His perfectly styled black hair, not one strand out of place, his brown eyes assessing his distaste for the situation. “Andrea, I was curious as to where my fiancé ran off to, I have missed you pet.” Nate eyes ‘Drea? Pet? What the hell, she isn’t a pet. “Um Nate, this is Phillip my old boss. I would say it is a pleasure Phillip but it isn’t.” ‘Drea scowls. Nate sighs, “Phillip.” Nodding icily. “Nate would you mind seeing to Grams? I will see to this and be ready to set up when you get back.” She says not taking her eyes off of Nate. “Are you sure, Sugar?” Nate asks sweetly, clearly marking his territory. “Yes Baby. It won’t take long.” “Ok.” Nate replies kissing her cheek sweetly, turns and strides out like a man on a mission. After ‘Drea shakes her head to steady herself she turns to deal with this mess. “Phillip what do you want?” She asks him as he strides over to her. “I have missed you My Pet. Why did you leave?” Phillip says as he touches her cheek. “Why? Why! I guess you and the waitress didn’t think I would mind? You could have cared less that I left you Phillip. You don’t love me and I don’t love you.” She snaps as she jerks away from him. He chuckles, “Ah Pet you are so much smarter than I give you credit for. I am a bit disappointed in the whole ‘kissing the handy man thing’ but I can forgive you.” ‘Drea closes her eyes mentally counting to ten, “Don’t call me pet. I hate than Phillip, I am not your damn pet. Why would I want your forgiveness, we are over.” Phillip laughs. He laughs! “We are far from over my pet. My father has decided that since you left, the restaurant is no longer high-priority. He is threatening to boot me and close if you don’t come back. I booked us a flight and we...” ‘Drea slams a pan across the room, “Now you listen to me, Phillip. Very carefully, I am not going back to New York, I am not working for you and I am not putting back on your ring. Now leave before I make you.” She turns to her dough and starts to roll it out and he grabs her spinning her into him pinning her against the island. “Phillip, I am warning you.” Phillip smiles, “Andrea, you have no idea what you are saying and who you are messing with. You will go back to the way things were and that is that.” He pushes against her and nuzzles her neck. “Never, Phillip I mean it. Back the hell up and NOW!” ‘Drea pushes at him and he jolts back. Not because of her force, but Nate’s. He grabs Phillip by the throat and jerks him to the door. Choking off his airway, making Phillip gasp and beg. “Nate! What are you doing?” ‘Drea gasps fearing Nate will kill him. “I am just taking out the trash Sugar, won’t be but a minute.” Nate says dragging him out the door and jerking it closed. Nate is bubbling with fury, standing outside during the conversation was nearly impossible. This egocentric ass caged her in, put his hands on her. He throws him into his car and he crumbles to the ground. Gasping for air Phillip is cursing Nate with every breath. “I will sue you. I will own you. She is my fiancé and belongs to me.” Nate growls grabbing him by the jacket and hauls him up against his shiny little BMV rental. “Now you are going to listen to me, real good. I am going to speak nice and clear, as to not confuse you.” Phillip starts to talk but Nate shakes him furiously, shutting him up. Nate continues, “You are not welcome here. She doesn’t want you here. If you decide to show up here again, I will be waiting and you will see just how handy I am asshole. Andrea is no longer your fiancée, employee, or whatever else she may have been. So get in your car and have you a real nice day.” Nate growls letting him slide down the car. Phillip gasps for breath as he climbs into his car and drives away. Nate turns and walks back into the kitchen where ‘Drea stands at the sink. “’Drea are you alright?” Nate asks as he wraps his arms around her from behind. She blows out a breath and closes her eyes, “Yes, he just tried to get his point across. He wanted me to come back and make his life easier.” ‘Drea says as she turns in his arms and he pulls her in tight. “I know Sugar.” Nate says. “You were listening?” ‘Drea asks surprised. Nate nods, “He looked like a classic douche and I wasn’t leaving you alone with him. When he got too close, I decided to remove him.” He says drawing a giggle from her. “Thank you, Nate. So...is he still alive?” ‘Drea asks as she nuzzles into the crook of his neck. “Yeah, but if he comes back we will need to plan on where to hide the body. I won’t be so polite next time.” Nate says sweetly. “He won’t be back. Phillip doesn’t love me Nate, he never did. I won’t live that way and now he knows that.” “OK, so now that you are alright. I will leave you to my donuts and I will see to Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as he kisses her sweetly then he is gone. ‘Drea turns and starts punching out donuts and cranks up the fryer. Placing six on a plate, she boxes up the rest and sits the plate on the table just as Nate walks in. “Grams load you down?” ‘Drea asks as she pours coffee. “She sure has been busy. Sit with me...” He says pulling her into his lap, “We will set up everything up and then I am going to cook you dinner, tonight.” ‘Drea bites her lip to stifle her laugh. “You want to cook for me?” Nate kisses the tip of her nose, “Oh ye of little faith. Yes, I can cook.” “Well Nathan Kyle, there are still many things I do not know about you.” ‘Drea purrs as she watches Nate eat his donuts. Nate frowns, “It’s all hype Sugar... not much to tell.” ‘Drea new better than that, but she would let it go for now, at least. It is important for her to know him, but it isn’t like he is telling these things to everyone else. He really won’t open up to anyone and yet he is to her, little by little. Picking at her donuts she arches a brow at him, “So what are you cooking?” “Homemade pizza. Does that work for you?” He asks as he swallows the last donut in one bite. “Absolutely, one thing I loved about New York was the pizza.” After an hour of setting up the apples, jars and displays, Nate excuses himself to go into town for groceries and to change. After ‘Drea cleans the kitchen up for him, she sets the table similar to the night before, with candles. Needing to change and get ready, she leaves the door unlocked and a note: Gone to shower and change. The kitchen is all yours, see you shortly. ‘Drea She nearly skips through the orchard on her way to house. After changing into a green camisole and a jean skirt, she brushes her hair out into long black waves. Once she retouches her make-up ‘Drea slips into flip-flops and heads back to the store to meet Nate. The door to the kitchen is open and she over hears Nate and...is that Grams talking? “Ms. Ruthie you know I do...” Nate says. Does what? ‘Drea wonders, as she stands still out of view, listening. “If so, she should know about your past Nathan. She would understand. How would you expect her to share a bed with you and not know about your nightmares?” “’Drea has been through enough.” Nate snaps. “Yes she has been through a lot, but don’t use that hogwash on me Nathan. It is about give and take, she told you things I am sure.” Ruthie says back shaky. “And that’s why I can’t, why... I want to protect her Ms. Ruthie. I couldn’t bear to hurt her.” He says sounding broken. “You can’t protect and shelter her, she runs from that. I lost her for ten years. Nathan, I won’t lose her again.” Ruthie says choking on a sob. Damn it! It is a conspiracy. It wasn’t as hard for her knowing Nate wasn’t letting her in yet, but he talked to Grams... What the hell! Pissed beyond all points, she stops up into the kitchen. First, Phillip and his completely idiotic ass comes walking back into her life begging for her to come back to soothe his Daddy, then you have these two Judases! Her life is out of control and she is putting her flip-flopped foot down right now! Nate whips around and his face pales, clearly knowing she heard everything. “Well don’t stop on my account, you were only talkin’ about me.” ‘Drea says scowling at them both. “I think I will leave you two, I’ll leave the door unlocked Andrea Ruth.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea replies, not taking her eyes off Nate. Nate frowns down at his hands. “Sure you can manage Ms Ruthie?” “Nate...” ‘Drea starts, interrupting whatever answer her Grams was going to give by shutting the door behind her. “What is this?” Nate meets her gaze and sighs. “Listen ‘Drea there are things about me, things that I don’t discuss.” “Obviously.” She scowls, “Unless you count Grams.” ‘Drea grabs a beer and takes a long draw. “No problem talkin’ to her huh?” “Only just because I needed to be sure you could handle it.” He starts. Throwing her hands up in exasperation ‘Drea groans, “You didn’t feel that you could trust me to handle it? Damn you Nate, no secrets, no games. Remember?” Closing the distance between them, Nate grabs her wrists. “Don’t!” She yells, jerking away, infuriated. He kept things from her and she knew it, but because he saw her as weak? She left here years ago for similar reasons; to escape the pain of losing her Momma and the pity everyone felt for her. It was etched on all their faces and it made her sick to meet anyone’s eyes. She would be damned if he would treat her as a child, as she was weak! “’Drea, please just let me explain.” Nate pleads as he reaches for her again, “You owe me that at least.” If looks could kill he knew he would be dead already. She paces around the island, “I don’t owe you anything.” ‘Drea says as she stalks out of the kitchen and into the orchard away from him. Nate’s body is shaking, he can’t lose her. He knew tonight was the night he was going to tell her everything and she was going to understand. She was going to know he loved her and that he would beg her never to leave. He never thought he would fall in love, but the moment he saw her, he was a goner. Turning off the oven he bolts from the kitchen and into the orchard after her. ‘Drea is running she lost her flip-flops in the trees somewhere and she could care less, just slowed her down. How could he keep things from her but tell Grams? How could he think he could hide from her? Swatting the angry tears from her face, she stops at the tree in the center of the orchard dropping to her knees. To the two stones she has never seen, two grave markers. ‘Drea traces the name: Franklin Westwood. “Grand-dad, what was I thinking coming back here? I can’t do this.” She sobs. “I came here to lick my wounds of my unhappy life, not gut myself again and again.” Scooting over she traces the name: Cassandra Westwood. Flopping onto her side she runs her hands in the grass of the space between the graves and cries. Nate stands just outside the clearing, as he hears ‘Drea cry into the night. His heart nearly ripping from his chest. She wants to leave. Suddenly, his chest is too tight he can’t breathe. He knows if she leaves she will take his heart and his only shot at happiness with her forever. He had been a selfish bastard to shelter her, to think she was breakable. She was the strongest, bravest woman he had ever known. She had been through so much and watched her own mother die, helpless to stop it. He coddled her like a child and he was wrong, she held him together, she made him want to be better, stronger, she made him want to be hers. He ached to be hers. Walking over to her he curls up behind her on the grass, she lay silently sobbing as he pulls her into his chest. “Ssh Sugar, I am sorry. I am so sorry.”He whispers running a hand down her hair soothing her. “’Drea look at me baby please.” He pleads. ‘Drea look up at him, her green eyes tear stained and dark. He swipes at the tears with his thumbs and sits them both up. “’Drea, I left home at nineteen, things were not great at home. My Mom was struggling financially and I knew I needed to go. My dad had died of a heart attack and she had never worked so she had a rough go finding work. So I enlisted.” “Yes, I-“‘Drea starts but Nate puts his finger to her lip. “Please let me get this out Sugar.” He says looking pained. She nods as he takes her hands, “I went into the National Guard, I specialized in Search and Rescue...and well Recovery. I watched people die ‘Drea, so many more than I could count. My team said that I would get used to it, after time it wouldn’t bother me anymore. Can you believe it ‘Drea...get used to it...” He says with a pained chuckle. “After a while though, the lives I did save, couldn’t even erase the faces of those I watched die. I got out, but I live with it every day. It haunts me ‘Drea every damn day.” Tears fill ‘Drea’s eyes again, “Oh Nate.” Shaking his head he continues, “When I came here, no one accepted me ‘Drea, except Ruthie. Then you came and turned me inside out. I wanted to tell you, ‘Drea I did. I watched strangers die Sugar, but you watched your Momma die. It was selfish of me to think you wouldn’t be able to handle it. That you couldn’t understand.” ‘Drea cups his face in her hands and kisses him. “Oh Nate, I am so sorry. Of course I understand, it took me ten years to even talk about Momma. I am sorry, I overreacted.” Everything in Nate’s body relaxes, “Oh Sugar I thought I lost you.” ‘Drea shakes her head and smiles shyly. Nate kisses her over and over again, “No secrets and no games, ‘Drea never again.” Hoisting her up in his arms, ‘Drea curls into his chest as he carries her back to the kitchen in the store. The next morning, ‘Drea wakes to her alarm at 4:45am. After dressing in jeans and an old sweatshirt of her Grand-dad’s that says ‘Westwood Orchards’ on it, she wanders into the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Grams.” She murmurs into her mug as she sits at the table. “Andrea Ruth.” Ruthie nods. “Is everything settled between Nathan and you?” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea sighs, “I over-reacted Grams.” Ruthie chuckles, “Love will make you do that, Sugar.” ‘Drea gasps, sputtering coffee, “I never said I-“ “You don’t have to, it is all over your face, and his as well.” Ruthie says with a knowing wink. “I went to see Momma and Grand-dad last night Grams.” ‘Drea says changing the subject. “Oh, did you?” Ruthie asks, knowing that ‘Drea had never been there since her Cassandra’s funeral. ‘Drea nods. “I should have done it long ago, Grams. I was being selfish and cowardly. I blamed myself for so long and I-“‘Drea says on a sob. Ruthie jerks her eyes up. “Andrea Ruth! How dare you take the blame for something that was in God’s design. You shouldn’t have lived with all that built up in you all these years Sugar.” “I know that now Grams. Now come on we have a store to open.” “Yes, we do Sugar.” Ruthie says as they walk out the door and head up to the orchard in ‘Drea’s car. Part Six: Phillip’s Last Stand. ‘Drea loads the display cases with cakes, pies, donuts, and cobblers. Displays of Ms. Ruthie’s canning and jellies are set out, along with baskets of fruit from the orchard. A knock on the door, startles them all. “We aren’t open yet.” ‘Nate yells as he hauls a box in, turning he nearly drops it as there in the doorway stands Phillip. “I see you wanted to see how handy I am.” Nate growls sitting the box down. “Actually,” He starts as he holds his hands up in silent surrender. “I came here to talk to Andrea.” He says looking at her, “Pet, can we...” He starts then jumps as the laugh roars out of Ms. Ruthie’s throat. “Pet? Oh I know you didn’t call my Grand-daughter, your damn pet.” She roars. “Grams, I can handle this.” ‘Drea says ushering Phillip out the door, to his car.” “Listen, Phillip you have exactly ten seconds to say whatever it is you have to say and get the hell out of here before those two...” She gestures to the door where Nate and Ruthie stand watching like hawks. “Well, they know how to hide the bodies...if you understand.” He nods, “Listen Pet, Um I mean Andrea. I am sorry. I never knew what I had until you were gone. I need you, I want you. Please come back, run the restaurant, be mine.” “Phillip. I can’t, I want more.” She whispers. He gawks at her like she has grown two heads, “More? God Pet I would give you the world, anything, everything.” He pulls her into his arms and crushes his lips to hers. Nate and Ruthie are yelling and cursing from the doorway, as ‘Drea pushes Phillip away. “Phillip, I’m not in love with you. My Grandparents had love, passion and...magic. God Phillip that is what I want... I want to love, I want to ache for the man I love... and that’s-“ Phillip sighs, “That’s not me.” ‘Drea nods smiling sweetly. “So it is the handy man then. You are in love with him?” ‘Drea nods, “Yes, Nate...his name is Nate and yes Phillip I love him.” Phillip sighs, “I guess that’s that then. I can’t fight for your heart when you already gave it away, Pet. I am so sorry for the way I treated you Andrea, I took you for granted. I didn’t value you for the amazing person you are and that is my loss. I am so glad you didn’t let my mistakes damage you. I will always love you Andrea and just know that if he better be good to you Andrea.” “Phillip, I forgive you. You were no happier than I and well I have let it all go.” She says and he smiles at her fondly, kisses her again and gets into his car and leaves. Nate stands in bewilderment... He kissed her twice...Twice... She nodded and smiled at him sweetly. What the hell? Was she going back with him? Shaking it off he goes back to hauling the boxes and stocking shelves. The store was opening and there were already people looking around. He would deal with his broken heart later. There was not a second to spare, between serving customers, boxing up items and carrying to the cars, they were all busy. It seemed like the whole town maybe the whole county had showed up to see the Orchard back and thriving. Nate caught gazes of ‘Drea, she looked blissfully happy. He couldn’t help but be a little sad at that. He gave this woman his heart and she didn’t even know it yet. She could leave without knowing it. Would it change her mind if she did know? By noon, the entire store is cleared out, Nate switches the sign to closed and ‘Drea sinks to the floor. “We did it Grams!” “Oh Sugar, your Grand-dad would be so proud of you.” Ruthie says as she sits in a chair. “Of us, Grams.” ‘Drea says as she stands dusting off her jeans. “Grams, can you get back up to the house alright? There is something I want to do...” “Even an old woman can take a hint. I will see you both for supper?” “Yes, Ma’am.” They reply in unison. Part Seven: Finality. Nate sits in the passenger seat of ‘Drea’s car as they wind up the old mountain road. What was he thinking? After Grams had left, ‘Drea had said they needed to talk and that needed to drive so he all but agreed. He knew what was coming, bracing for the heartache he blows out a breath. “Where are we going? You haven’t left the orchard since you have been home.” “That’s right.” ‘Drea says glancing at him with a smile, “We are going somewhere special, Nate.” ‘Drea drives up the old road methodically, her head spinning. It hadn’t taken so long for her to realize that she had fallen in love with Nate. Phillip’s visit just made her sure. She wanted to desperately to tell him before, last night in fact. Nate had secrets though, deep secrets that haunted him just as hers did. Now that they were all out in the open, she wouldn’t run anymore. ‘Drea had to tell him, had to know for sure and if he ran ‘Drea might crumble. Pulling up on a shoulder, Nate’s eyes grow wide; there is nothing but a broken guard rail. ‘Drea shuts off the engine, walks over and sits on the edge of the broken rail. As Nate sits next to her, she leans on his shoulder. “After ten years, you would think they would just fix the damn rail.” She says shaking her head in disbelief. “Jesus, ‘Drea this is where—“ She nods as he pulls her into his arms. “I wanted a new beginning; I had to come here to close this chapter first.” She says, tears filling her voice. Nate’s heart breaks for her as he runs a hand up and down her back. “I miss her so much Nate, damn it I miss her so much.” “Oh Baby.” Nate whispers, kissing her hair. “I didn’t let myself remember. It hurt too much. This whole time it was holding me back. I’m ready to move on now Nate.” All of a sudden his gut tightened. She is leaving. Nate feels sick, oh after all he had hoped for she was moving on. Without him. ‘Drea kisses him, stopping his thoughts. “Yeah.” He says shaking his head to clear his thoughts. “Well, I guess now that the orchard is making money again you will be—“ ‘Drea looks up at him wide-eyed, “You think I am leaving?” Nate’s eyes widen to match hers and she continues, “Nate, I brought you here because this is where my world stopped ten years ago. It is time to let it start turning again. Today, was the best day of my life. This is what I was meant to do.” Nate shakes his head...confused, “What about Phillip?” ‘Drea laughs, “Oh Nate, Grams and you should learn to eavesdrop better. We talked and there is nothing there. We said our goodbyes and that is that. I am not in love with him I told him that. The orchard is magical Nate, I have always thought so. It may sound dumb...” “No it doesn’t ‘Drea. There is so much love there.” Nate says stroking her hair away from her face. “I found myself again Nate. For ten years I ran from who I was. I am a Westwood. I am bossy, determined, I dream, believe in magical orchard, that dessert can solve all problems, and in anger I lose my ‘gs’.” Nate smiles. Taking a deep breath, she blurts “And, I love you Nate.” Nate’s eyes fly open wide. “What was that?” ‘Drea giggles, “I love you Nathan Kyle. I never expected to find all the missing pieces of my heart, but you put them all back in place.” Nate takes in all she has said and smiles, “Oh Sugar, you surprise me every day. I need you ‘Drea, I love you. You push the darkness back with your beauty Andrea. From the moment I saw you lying in the grass looking up at the clouds, hell I may have loved you even then.” He stands pulling her into his arms, spinning her. “You know we will have it all, don’t you Sugar? We can marry in the orchard, walk there every night, raise a family, and keep Ms. Ruthie on her toes.” Eyes teary, ‘Drea smiles at him. “Yes Nate we will.” ‘Drea says as she kisses Nate, knowing in her heart that she found her magic.",

      "content": "Prologue: Flopping into the window sill seat, Andrea stares out at the trees. Her Grand-dad started Westwood Orchards over thirty-five years ago, and business has never been better. The small store her Grams sells baked goods, jellies and produce out of is busy this time of year, which means while Grams and Andrea's Momma run the store, 'Drea helps Grand-dad with the apples in the orchard. She watches as her Grand-dad kisses her Grams under the pre-dusk stars, even after putting in a full day harvesting he still walks her through the orchard every night. \"'Drea?\" A voice calls from the bathroom. Smiling she sighs, \"Oh Momma, isn't it so romantic?\" Climbing into the seat, Cassandra Westwood pulls her daughter into her lap. \"You know my precious one, the orchard is magical. It brought your Grand-dad and Grams together; they put all of their love into this place.\" Misty eyed she continues, \"It brought your father to me, even if for just a time.\" \"Oh Momma, I could never leave here. Not ever.\" 'Drea says as she watches her grandparents disappear into the trees arm and arm. Knowing her Momma's heart never fully mended after that summer. Andrea's father, a drifter that her Grand-dad hired for the summer harvest. Cass and Paul had loved fast and hard beneath the trees that summer. Fall came and Paul left for parts unknown. Soon after Cass learned of her pregnancy, but was never able to find Paul. To this day she aches for him. \"Andrea Ruth.\" Cassandra says as she brushes out 'Drea's tangled black hair. \"You are only eleven years old, of course you will grow up and leave here, go to college, have a career. I want so much for you, my precious one.\" \"I want love Momma, I want magic.\" 'Drea says with a pout as she climbs into bed. \"You shall have it in time, 'Drea. You have plenty of time to do it all, with us all cheering you on. I love you 'Drea.\" She soothes as she kisses her on the cheek. 'Drea jerks awake in a cold sweat, checking her surroundings. \"Oh it was so real.\" She murmurs to herself as she checks her phone for the time, as unwelcome tears stream down her face. In the years since her Momma had died she had plenty of nightmares; gory flashes of the crash, of her Momma dying there in front of her before help came. She could smell the gas leaking or see the broken guard rail. Never had she dreamed of the happy times at Westwood Orchards, those were forgotten. Her Momma had died ten years ago, her Grand-dad nearly three. Thriving in New York as a chef, 'Drea was engaged to be married. Until two days ago she thought the new life she had built was perfect. After her fiancé. Phillip had been caught giving a waitress the hands on approach, she couldn't continue to work there or marry him for that matter. Still she wondered which she'd miss more... After walking out amidst the dinner rush, she came home to a message from Grams. She couldn't say no to Grams, so after packing everything 'Drea jumps into her car without even a word to Phillip. \"Saving the orchard is all that matters.\" She tells herself as she left the city for good. Done with thinking and deciding to give up on sleep, 'Drea dresses and checks out of the hotel. \"Won't be long now 'Drea.\" She sighs. Just two hundred more miles and she would be face to face with the very thing she had run from ten years ago... The past. Grams needs her, and she will do anything to save Westwood Orchards. \"I know this will work, I can make it work. Just please, let the magic still be there... let it be real.\" Chapter One: Small towns and lingering memories. As Andrea Westwood pulls up in front of her family's fruit orchard she sighs. It has been ten years since she set foot in her childhood home, when her Momma died in a car crash, she had to get out of here and she never looked back. Until now. The crisp, cool Virginia air blows through her long black hair as she walks up to the house. It is nothing like New York, after being there as a high paid head chef of one of the city's biggest restaurants 'Drea is in shock of how nothing here has changed. The yard, the house, the fences all the same as when she left. Things change in New York every day, sometimes hourly. Here, it is like time stands still, and with only about three-hundred people in this town, they all know everything about everyone and there are no secrets. There is no fast food, no Wal-mart, and no Starbucks. She had lost cell service in and out on the way here, so surely Wi-Fi is out of the question. \"People need a passport to come here; it is like a whole nother planet.\" She says out loud to herself. \"Well not if you were born here, Missy. It tends to linger in the blood.\" \"Grams!\" 'Drea says smiling as she walks up the old wooden porch steps and hugs her grandmother, joining her on the old swing. \"Oh Sugar, it is so good to have you home. I have missed having someone around here call me something other than Ms. Ruthie. How was your trip?\" \"Long... but it gave me time to think so it was so good. I am having my things shipped down here. Since New York is over for me, I thought I would stay here for a while anyway, at least until I figure out what I want to do.\" \"Of course, Sugar. This is your home, it always has been. Come on let's get on inside, I am sure you are starved.\" \"The orchard looks like it needs some TLC Grams, the store too. When does the handy man come in?\" 'Drea asks as she nibbles at her turkey sandwich. \"Don't have one, no need.\" Ruthie says handing 'Drea a glass of iced tea. \"Grams...\" 'Drea says with a regretful sigh. \"Neither of us can do the heavy lifting around here. We need a man to do it, possibly a few. I put an ad in the paper, before I left New York. I am sure they will start calling and showing up in no time.\" Ruthie looks over her coffee mug, \"If you are sure Sugar.\" \"I am. Also, I need to see the books. I will get the bills squared away and start getting things ready for the store to open as soon as possible.\" \"OK. You're old room is ready for you Sugar, so you can get settled in.\" \"Alright Grams, thank you.\" 'Drea says as she finishes her sandwich. The kitchen is in perfect condition. No one in town would argue that Ms. Ruthie's pies and jams aren't the best in the county. She keeps an immaculate kitchen and that was one thing 'Drea was counting on. Baking and cooking have always been 'Drea's constants, they never change. It is her safe place, her one way to relax and just be. Oh how proud Grams would have been to have seen her in her element in New York... No! That's over now, 'Drea reminds herself. She needs to let it go and find her dream, open her own little shop, bake and sell her own recipes. First, she has to save the orchard and her Grams, which is long enough for her to lick her wounds and re-calculate after Phillip. Surely he will have trashed her reputation in New York, so a new start in a new place is exactly what she needs. \"It is so good to have you home, 'Drea. I have missed you Sugar.\" 'Drea smiles, \"Me too Grams, everything is going to be good now.\" Kissing her Grams on the cheek, 'Drea heads out to unpack the car. Once she is settled in her old room, she changes into a pair of jeans and a green hooded pullover. She whisks her hair up into a pony-tail and heads out to the store to see how much she can get done. The old log cabin store is covered in over-grown brush and shrubs. The dust and cobwebs look like they have been there since 'Drea left. \"Well, I am not above hard labor.\" She says to herself as she takes a small axe from the porch and shoves up her sleeves. After over thirty minutes, she has a good sized pile in the middle of the yard. Since her Grams is busy in the kitchen making apple pies, 'Drea sprawls out in the grass. Dirty and sweaty, she stares up at the sky, like she did as a child. Back then, her Momma and she would stare at the clouds and 'Drea would dream. All those wonderful things she wanted in life; the shop she would have, the man she would marry, a family. Always ever present in those dreams was Westwood Orchards. Never did she want to leave here, but when her Momma died just after 'Drea's graduation from high school, the sight of anything here was much too painful. \"Well Momma, I am back. I am home.\" Choking back a sob, she squeezes her eyes shut, letting her fingers spread wide in the grass. \"When I left, it hurt so much to be here, I miss you so much. Jesus, Momma. I was an idiot. Phillip! Oh how I wish you were here to have told me he was no good for me. I nearly let him destroy me. I sacrificed parts of me, my dreams. I gave up parts of me for a man I didn't love, and who didn't love me. That's over now. It is all about Grams, me and Westwood Orchards now and to hell with any damned thing else.\" \"Andrea Ruth, that mouth!\" 'Drea opens her eyes and winces, \"Sorry Grams, I was talking to Momma.\" \"I have half a mind to wash that mouth out young lady. Now get up, we have company.\" Ruthie says in a huff. 'Drea jerks up and blushes full on red, although through all the sweat and dirt it was hard to see much of it. \"Oh sorry.\" She shrieks jumping to her feet, coming toe to toe with her Grams and a man...a man who is smirking at her. \"This is Nathan Kyle. He has been in town a couple of months now, and I trust him. He will do whatever you need done, Sugar. I will leave you two; supper will be ready at 5:00.\" \"Yes Ma'am, Ms. Ruthie.\" He says as she turns and leaves them together. 'Drea looks him over, as he sizes her up. \"Nice to meet you Mr. Kyle.\" He chuckles and smiles, \"Nate. Mr. Kyle was my father.\" She smiles as she takes him in. At well over six foot tall, Nate was built like a machine. Brown eyes that look like perfectly melted chocolate and golden shaggy waves that drop over his eye brows. His jeans are worn and tore at the thigh, and his white pull-over is tight across his chest and shoulders. Shaking her head absentmindedly she takes a breath, \"Oh, OK. Nate, I was clearing the brush and debris from the store-front. I want it ready to open as soon as possible.\" \"Forgive me for speaking out of turn Miss Westwood, but Ms. Ruthie isn't able to keep up with the demands of all the baking the shop needs.\" Nate says protectively. \"It's Andrea... 'Drea. Also, I am well aware of my Grams' condition. Which is why I am here. I am a capable chef and I will open the store and handle it myself. Of course whatever help Grams wants to give is great. When the time comes I will hire out for more help.\" \"Oh, your Grams hadn't really told me much about your plans 'Drea.\" \"That's because she doesn't know them. I only arrived this morning after her call not even 48 hours ago. There has been little discussion, but this place is magical and I won't let it go under because it means too much to her and me.\" \"What do you need me to do?\" Nate says with a smile. Nate never thought that Ms. Ruthie's grand-daughter would come in and plan to save the day. He assumed her every intention was to fix it up and sell it off. Boy was he wrong. She was pretty, strikingly. She was curvy in all the right places, and her beautiful black hair and emerald green eyes made his heart beat a little harder. She was a Westwood, beautiful, passionate, and giving. All this and just knowing her five minutes... Jesus Nate get a grip! Women don't mix with your plan man... A warm body every now and then and again...sure that's great, but nothing like 'Drea. You don't get mixed up with a girl like her when all you want to do is be able to outrun the past. Andrea Westwood was a keeper. She could see into his eyes all the way down to his soul and that could shatter them both. Andrea Westwood had 'keeper' written all over her face. After the better part of the afternoon of following 'Drea around like a puppy Nate has a list of things to get done: fences to mend, rooms to paint, a roof to repair, not to mention a kitchen to update in the store and display cases to build. She knew what she wanted and how she wanted it, she was totally in control and Nate was speechless in awe of her plans. \"Electrical and plumbing should be checked too, but I would think you would want a bonded professional for that. I can find someone for you.\" Nate says as they lock up the store. \"OK, that would be great. I haven't been home in ten years, so I wouldn't even know who to call.\" \"This place is stranded in time.\" Nate says with a chuckle. His brown eyes sparkle with flecks of gold and 'Drea is lost in them. \"Nothing much ever changes around here.\" \"Yeah, tell me about it.\" 'Drea smiles as they walk through the orchard back up to the house. \"So Nate, where are you from and how did you end up here?\" \"Born and raised in Iowa. Then I got out of there when I was nineteen, traveled with work. Now I just sort of landed here.\" \"Oh sounds like fun. I have only been here and New York. I never thought I would leave here...'Drea says as her voice trails off. \"Really?\" Nate asks eyeing her. He swears he can hear her trying to hide pain in her voice. \"Why did you leave then 'Drea? It is obvious you love it here.\" She stops and turns as their eyes meet, his eyes seem to study her trying to delve into her and search for all the answers. She shivers and shakes it off, \"Oh after high school graduation... you know stupid teenage girl.\" She replies shrugging it off. Nate realizes as he nods a simple reply that there is much more to this story, but decides it best to let it lie as she has laid it... for now. What business is it of his anyway? Giving her a smile, letting her know that the discussion is over they turn and walk to the house. As the front door opens, the smell of pot roast and fresh cornbread hit them both right away. \"If she would marry me, I wouldn't want for another thing in my life.\" Nate says with a sigh. \"God, is that apple pie too?\" 'Drea smiles, \"Yes it is, and sorry no one would ever measure up to Grand-dad. You will have to settle with a food affair, like everyone else.\" \"This is what she tells me. I was hoping to sway her with diamonds and flowers, a man can dream can't he?\" He teases nudging her with his elbow. \"Get in here you two, supper is done. Don't make me come a huntin' for ya!\" \"Yes, Ma'am.\" 'Drea and Nate both say in unison. \"She loses her 'gs' when she gets irritated or impatient. Just a tip.\" 'Drea says to him with a giggle. \"I'll do well to remember that, especially when she has a skillet in her hand.\" He snickers making 'Drea toss her head back and laugh. They way her green eyes sparkle when she laughed...like emeralds in sunshine...made his knees go weak. Later that night as she lay in bed, 'Drea's mind wanders. She thinks back to the store and how much she wants to do with it. To the orchards and all the fruit that will be ready soon to use in the kitchen. To her Grams, who is not admitting how bad off she is but 'Drea is determined to deal with it all accordingly. Then finally and lingering to Nate. He will be a hard worker to get everything done, so she can open the store, do big things with the orchard and maybe even fix up the house to make Grams' life easier. It doesn't hurt that he is scorch-the-sheets-hot. How will she ever get any work done around him? She may have to learn to cook wearing a blindfold. He could be a welcomed distraction... She quickly dismisses the thought. No 'Drea men are off limits! This is just about Grams and you fixing up the orchard and bringing it back to its glory days. She repeats the thoughts over and over in her head, as a mantra as she drifts. And damnit all if she doesn't dream of melted chocolate and ripped Levi's. In town Nate tosses and turns in his small bed at his apartment above Vanover’s Grocery. Why is it that every time he closes his eyes he sees her? He promised Ms. Ruthie he would help do whatever was needed. She was the only one who accepted him here at first. When he showed up in town, people were skittish. She gave him work, which with a flush bank account he didn’t really need the money. Hard work took his mind off things. She cooked for him, made him pies and treated him like family, something he never really had. Now there is ‘Drea, she is so much like her Grams. Which makes this all the more important for him to help them. As sleep takes him, he doesn’t have nightmares tonight. For the first time since he can remember he sleeps peacefully. Tonight Nate’s dreams are of a raven haired, green-eyed goddess and he knows now he is in trouble, big trouble. Chapter Two: Change in the Wind ‘Drea spends most of the next few days, cleaning the kitchen in the store, she has ordered her updated kitchen appliances and both the plumber and electrician gave them a clean bill of health. Nothing could have been more perfect, all her things had been delivered and she unpacked and organized everything with glee. The kitchen inside the store would rival all kitchens, she thought as she turned to throw a box to the pile by the door she slams into Nate. “Oh! Shit, sorry you snuck up on me.” She says with a squeal. He was warm and all man, ‘Drea thought. Shaking her head, she pulls away. Bad idea, she scolds herself. Nate felt a pang of disappointment as she turned from him and frowned unsure why. “You have been busy ‘Drea. The new appliances will be here tomorrow right?” His question made those emerald eyes sparkle with excitement. “Yes, and then I will be baking away in here. Grams was able to talk the grocer into delivering all I needed tomorrow as well.” Her eyes brighten and dance with excitement making Nate pants become uncomfortable. He was staring at a woman who put his sanity and his dick in a vise…and he was enjoying it. How sick was he? “Nate! I can bake in here tomorrow, I can’t wait!” ‘Drea’s excitement makes him smile, “What do you bake ‘Drea?” He asks scratching his chin. Wiping the sweat from her forehead she smiles, “You come in here tomorrow afternoon, and you can see for yourself.” “Well you have a deal, I am more than happy to play taste tester. I fixed the fences in the orchard; I will start on the roof now. Tomorrow I can paint the front room and get measurements for the display cases.” “That would be great; it seems you have been busy yourself. I sure hope you’re hungry, Grams is making fried chicken and will not take no for an answer.” “Well I can’t say no to a beautiful woman, who cooks.” Nate says teasing. “I had better get to the roof and earn that supper.” He nudges her playfully and walks outside. After ‘Drea is done in the kitchen, she walks out to the grass and sprawls out with a bottle of water: Nate is up on the roof, shirtless repairing the busted shingles. ‘Drea watches as his muscles bunch as he nails each shingle into place, those torn Levi’s stretch as he bends. Wow. ‘Drea wonders what his strong arms would feel like around her, making her shiver with want. Suddenly his eyes meet hers and she freezes. Damn, busted! “Enjoying the view?” He asks playfully raising a brow. ‘Drea takes a drink of her water, her mouth suddenly dry, “Um…what?” She asks innocently. “Oh, you heard me Sugar.” He teases bending to pick up another shingle, giving her another heat flash. “I am just cooling off.” She says shakily. Nate chuckles, “That’s the last thing on your mind ‘Drea.” “Oh honestly!” ‘Drea sighs. “Anytime you want a closer look Sugar, just ask.” Nate teases as ‘Drea goes into the kitchen to get another water. Pacing around the kitchen island ‘Drea scolds herself. “Idiot! What were you thinking? It’s one thing to oogle; it is another thing entirely to get caught, Jesus ‘Drea!” “So you were oogling me?” ‘Drea jumps and jerks into the island. “Damn it, what are you a ninja?” Pulling his shirt on Nate laughs, “So was it one thing in particular you were oogling or just the whole package in general?” Taking her water from her hand he gulps it down. “Oh my God! Don’t say package!” ‘Drea shrieks as she blushes crimson. Nate roars with laughter. “Don’t sweat it ‘Drea, you are worth the oogle yourself.” “Let’s go eat.” She stutters. As they walk out toward the orchard, his arm brushes hers making her shudder. Nate notices and smiles at her, his heart racing. Jesus Nate! Over a touch! Are you a horny teenager or what? He knew he shouldn’t have teased her over watching him but, he liked getting her all worked up, those green eyes of hers dance with fire. After dinner ‘Drea sits on the porch swing staring out at the orchard. Nate strolls out and sits beside her. “Hey.” He says nudging her with his knee. “Penny for your thoughts?” “Hey.” She replies sighing, “I missed the quiet and the trees. I could stare at it all night.” “Me too ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly. ‘Drea peaks over at him watching her and blushes. “Sorry to bail but I have an early morning…deliveries and all.” ‘Drea says nervously standing. “Yeah, I’ll see you ‘Drea.” Nate says as he walks down to his truck and then he is gone. Shaking her head, trying to figure out what the hell what was all about, ‘Drea goes to bed. From the window, Ms. Ruthie shakes her head with a chuckle, holding the photo from her wedding day. “Well Frank our ‘Drea is finally home. It seems to be getting interesting around here. Seems to me, love may be in the air again darling. She is broken right now but, I think being home and Nathan Kyle are just what she needs.” The next morning ‘Drea practically dances up to the store. Shortly after 8:00 am, two delivery men set up the new kitchen appliances. Just as she signs the slips and old black truck pulls up with ‘Vanover Grocery’ printed on the side. “Well Andrea Ruth, as I live and breathe. Look at you all grown up.” A white haired man says as he unloads bags with Nate. “Mr. Vanover, how are you?” ‘Drea replies with a smile. “Just look at me honey, I am doing well.” He says with a chuckle. “Yes, Sir. Thank you for the delivery.” “You just make my day, bake an old man somethin’ good.” Mr. Vanover says as ‘Drea pays him and he kisses her cheek. “It is good to see you home again ‘Drea.” “It is good to be home, see you.” She replies as he climbs into the truck and pulls out. “Drea walks into the store kitchen and starts putting away groceries. “Did I get replaced as taste tester?” Nate teases as he sits the last of the bags on the bar. “No of course not. This afternoon?” ‘Drea answers with a smile. Nate smiles making ‘Drea’s knees go weak, and then leaves. Shaking it off ‘Drea cranks her IPod in her stereo deck. As REO Speedwagon blares on about Ridin’ the storm out “Drea is rolling dough and filling cake pans. Nate peeks in watching her; she is maxing icing swaying to the music. Shaking his head he chuckles to himself and starts measuring the room for the display cases he is going to build. Later that afternoon, Nate’s stomach forces him to notice the smells coming from the kitchen. Peaking around the door he shouts, “Is it safe?” No answer… He walks in and sees ‘Drea shimmying to the music, as she adds meringue to a butterscotch pie. He stands in awe as the smells hit him; she is baking pies, cakes and he swears he can smell donuts. “’Drea?” He shouts again. This time she turns and smiles, “You caught me. I couldn’t stop once I started. Nate lets out the breath he didn’t realize he had been holding, making ‘Drea laugh. “Why Nate…” She says arching a brow, “Were you oogling?” Laughing he just nods, yes he was staring watching her ass shake to the music as she danced around the island made him hard. He was hard and laughing… that isn’t normal. Changing the subject he glances around the room, “It smells amazing. I got the room ready to paint and the measurements for the cases… Um, do I smell donuts ‘Drea?” Nate says sniffing. “Yes, just out of the fryer.” She replies gesturing to the granite island where the baked goods lie cooling. “Sit, I’ll get you a plate and some coffee.” “Who am I to turn down a woman who can cook?” He teases as he sits at the small table in the kitchen and ‘Drea places a plate with donuts on it and hands him a cup of coffee. He bites into a still hot donut and groans, “Damn ‘Drea these are amazing. You will be a millionaire.” “Thanks.” She says as she pulls a cobbler out of the oven and replaces it with a cake. Sitting the cobbler down to cool, she pours herself a coffee and sits next to Nate. He reaches over and strokes her cheek, making her shudder. “You had some meringue.” Nate says as he licks his finger, his brown eyes flickering with heat. “Oh thanks I…um.” She stops as Nate stands to his feet and pulls her up so that they are toe to toe. “’Drea, I…” He starts, then curses, “Oh I am going to go to hell for this.” Cupping her jaw, he crushes his lips to hers. She sighs and pulls her hands through his hair. After a moment of weakness she pulls back. “Nate, we can’t ah…I can’t… I’m sorry.” She says as she goes lax in his arms. “I should be apologizing. I would if I could remember my name. Wow! I mean I… um sorry ‘Drea. I am going to get back to painting, thanks for the donuts.” As he turns and walks to the door she calls to him. “Nate…” As he turns she continues, “I said I can’t, I didn’t say that I didn’t want to. I am just out of a bad break-up and well…” “It’s OK, ‘Drea, we all have our pasts.” He says and then he is gone. Hours later ‘Drea finishes baking, boxes everything up and stores it in the cooler, except for the butterscotch pie. She boxes it up to take to the house for dessert hoping to clear the air with Nate. As the thunder explodes, the rain starts pelting down in sheets. Oh this walk ought to be fantastic! Glancing out the window, she sighs as she watches the rain pour down and lightning flash across the sky. Nate had finished painting hours ago, and left to go out and put things into the shed in the orchard. (Not that she was watching him or anything.) ‘Drea looks out through the trees as the lightning stretches across the sky, and squints looking to see if she can see Nate. Surely he is at the house waiting on his supper with Grams. Telling herself she is silly for worrying, she pours herself a mug of coffee and sits at the table picking at a donut. Suddenly, the door flies open and ‘Drea jumps knocking her chair over, jerking around she sees Nate standing at the door trying to shake out of a raincoat. “Nate, are you alright? You should be up at the house waiting on supper, not out here in this weather.” ‘Drea says as she pulls up the chair she knocked over and pours him a cup of coffee. “Ms. Ruthie went into town to play Bingo at the fire house. She packed up dinner for us and said I should come down here and make sure you eat, since you have been down here since early this morning.” He explains as he sits the bag on the island and begins unpacking the tubs of food. “There are pork chops, fried potatoes, biscuits and honey. Your Grams sure can put together a meal. You two should add on to this store and open up a restaurant.” “Don’t think I haven’t thought about it. I just don’t want her over doing it. She hasn’t really told me much of what the doctor says about her arthritis. I know she is supposed to ease up. So, baby steps you know.” ‘Drea says as she makes plates and places one in front of Nate and sits down at the table with him. “So what else did you bake today? The smells coming outta this place today were heaven. I was almost sad that I was finished painting because I couldn’t linger to enjoy them.” Nate says as he spreads honey on a biscuit and sips his coffee. “I made a blackberry cobbler, cakes, cookies, and a butterscotch pie with meringue that I made from scratch. I had so much fun in here today!” “That meringue was amazing, I tasted a bit.” He says with a wink as he bites into his pork chop. ‘Drea flushes, “Yeah, we should talk about that. I left New York to help Grams Nate, but it was convenient timing.” She starts. Nate stops and watches her eyes for a moment and smiles, “Well that’s a good thing right?” ‘Drea nods, “I worked in a high-end restaurant as head chef, and my fiancé was the owner.” “Was?” Nate eyes her with curiosity. “I walked in on him and a waitress, well one of his many waitresses. Needless to say, it is over. Far passed over and I was glad to have a reason to leave.” ‘Drea says sighing into her coffee. Nate shakes his head, “’Drea I am sorry, but he doesn’t deserve you. No one should be treated like that.” ‘Drea blushes at the protective tone in Nate’s voice. “Well, it doesn’t matter now, I am home and I am actually enjoying it. Do you want dessert?” ‘Drea asks as she stands up and gets a pie server and small plates. Nate tops off their coffees as ‘Drea places two pieces of butterscotch pie on the table. Nate bites into the pie and his eyes glaze over and close. “Oh ‘Drea, this is amazing!” He groans. “Thanks. It is Grams’ recipe, my Grand-dad’s favorite. I was feeling sentimental.” She replies as she takes a bite. “Wow, yeah I have missed this.” Nate smiles at how ‘Drea’s face softens at the mention of her grandparents. “She is an amazing lady. I didn’t know your Grand-dad but, he had to be one hell of a man to deserve her and this pie.” Nate says with a wink. “Yes.” ‘Drea starts and her eyes go misty. “She made this for them on their first date. Grand-dad said he knew right that very night that there was no one else for him. He walked her through the orchard every night for months and proposed to her out there. Even opened the store for her to bake in, they had something special.” “Yeah, go all their lives without finding anyone. No wonder she won’t run off and marry me, she already had it all.” Nate says as he touches her hand. “Can I ask you something about the ex ‘Drea?” ‘Drea tenses, “Um, yeah and his name was Phillip.” Nate secretly wishing a man in New York named Phillip would rot in the seventh circle of hell with a flesh eating crotch disease smiles at his own private joke and continues, “OK. Phillip? Were you in love with him? I mean honestly you had to be shooting for the whole she-bang after watching your grandparents all these years.” ‘Drea sighs, she felt things for Phillip. They were comfortable with each other, shared interests, they had the business, shared a condo, but did she ever really love him? “No, I guess I didn’t. I never really thought about that, we looked good together, I mean there was the restaurant and it was comfortable. No, it was nothing like Grams and Grand-dad.” Nate sighs, unexpectedly relieved, “Well, good thing you got out while you still could.” “You know I never really thought about it. I wasn’t into planning the wedding, we were engaged for over a year and I hadn’t even started looking. When I caught him I was hurt.” “Of course you were, you trusted him.” ‘Drea holds her hand up and exhales, “Wait you didn’t let me finish. I was hurt of course because everyone knew it was going on but me. I was embarrassed. The biggest part of me though was relieved. I think I knew it was over and I was a coward and needed a reason to leave. It was comfortable and I didn’t know how to just walk away. Seeing him with her, and the fact that it was over came so easily to me. He didn’t really try to fight for me. So I packed up, emptied my bank account and here I am.” Nate reaches over and intertwines her hand in his, “I am glad you are here ‘Drea.” ‘Drea swallows the lump in her throat, as her eyes meet his. Those deep brown eyes burning into hers making her blush…and want…and need. Pulling her hand from his she smiles, “Well I better clean up the dishes.” Standing she turns to the sink and washes the plates stacking them in the rack to dry, as Nate turns the music up. “You have Boston on your IPod playlist?” He asks with a smirk. “Guilty. I am a classic rock junkie. My Momma wouldn’t listen to anything else.” “Oh Sugar, you were raised right.” Nate teases. “We would take these longs drives through the mountains on the weekends, crank the stereo and sing along. She couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket but we didn’t care.” ‘Drea says, her voice cracking. “Jesus why am I talking to you like this? I have never told anyone this stuff, not even Grams.” Nate walks over and wraps his arms around her waist and kisses her hair. “Maybe you need to get this out ‘Drea, maybe you feel like you can trust me.” Nate squeezes her to him and lowers his voice to a whisper, “You know you can, Sugar. You can trust me.” She whips around, facing him tears streaming down her face. His face falls as he looks into her green eyes full of pain. “’Drea?” “The night after my graduation we went up into the mountains and we were singing along with Styx. She was going on and on about how proud she was of me. I was going to do such big things and she couldn’t wait. I told her I wasn’t going away to school, that I wanted to stay here. She exploded and I didn’t let down either, we were arguing and we didn’t see the truck. We went through the guard rail…” Nate pulls her into his arms and she cries softly. “We were in the car over the cliff for hours. I kept talking, about everything…anything… Finally help came, but it was too late. Momma was already gone, internal bleeding.” Nate’s chest tightens, his heart breaking for her. “Oh Sugar. I am so sorry, so damned sorry.” He says stroking up and down her back. “After the funeral, I packed up and left. Grams and Grand-dad begged me to stay. I didn’t even come home when he passed; it hurt too much to even be here. Everything reminded me of her. It is different now, I want to remember. I want to be here.” ‘Drea says as she sniffles and pulls back. “Oh Nate I’m sorry…I didn’t mean to…” “Hey it’s OK.” He says soothing her. “You can unload on me anytime.” He says sweetly as he strokes her cheek with his thumb. ‘Drea’s breath hitches, every inch of skin Nate touches comes alive and she gasps, “Nate…” “Still can’t?” Nate asks as his thumb brushes her bottom lip. “We shouldn’t you know it will complicate things…” She says shakily as her eyes flutter closed, “We should think about it first.” “Well, you think about it Sugar, and I will…” Nate starts as he brushes his lips over hers. Soft and warm, the kiss was tender. ‘Drea melts into Nate, her hands run up his arms and around his neck. Nate pulls her chin up and deepens the kiss, running his tongue along her bottom lip, a silent plea for her to open up to him. As his tongue meets hers desire explodes like fire. ‘Drea moans softly as she tugs at his hair. Finally, Nate pulls away breathless, looking into those emerald eyes he has been careful not to drown in. Yet. “’Drea?” “Yeah?” She replies, her body still humming from his hands and mouth. “Still thinking?” He asks as he tucks her hair behind her ear. “Um…” She starts but he pushes his lips to hers again. “You keep thinking Sugar, and I will be waiting.” Nate says turning and walking out the door, leaving ‘Drea nearly in a puddle. Chapter Three: Taking Chances Over the rest of the week, ‘Drea say little of Nate. He had been busy in the workshop in the orchard, building the display cases. She had baked and cooked until her cooler was full, even sending Mr. Vanover a weeks worth of suppers and desserts. In return he had been making deliveries so she didn’t need to leave the store to go into town. ‘Drea was in the middle of mixing up frosting when her Grams walks in and sits at the table in the kitchen. “Sugar, you have been a busy bee.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea says as Ruthie pours coffee and helps herself to cookies cooling on the rack. Ruthie watches smiling at her one and only granddaughter as she ices a black forest cake and places it in the cooler. “Dessert tonight Sugar?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, what are you planning to have tonight Grams?” “I have chicken and dumplins going on the stove and will ask Nathan to join us.” “Oh?” ‘Drea asks unable to hide the flush that steals across her face. Ruthie smiles and sighs, “Sugar, he is a good man. He comes from a hard past, but he is a good man. He thinks very highly of you.” “Does he? Well we don’t really know each other very well do we? He has been very helpful and is working very hard. We will be ready to open the store in the next week or so at this rate.” ‘Drea pops a cookie in her mouth and continues, “I have ordered more from the grocery, which should be here tomorrow. I also paid up all the bills until next month.” Ruthie slams her mug down on the table making ‘Drea jump, “Andrea Ruth Westwood, I am not talkin’ about the store, or the bills, or when the groceries are bein’ delivered by Old man Vanover.” “Grams…” ‘Drea starts but the glare from her Grams shuts her mouth right back. “I am talkin’ about the fact that you were a mess when you got here; bakin’ or Nathan Kyle or a combination of the two had changed that. Judgin’ by the look on your face when I say his name Missy I can see it is both, maybe more him.” Ruthie says scolding ‘Drea. ‘Drea knowing looks at her Grams, this woman may be her grandmother and use a walker, but if she doesn’t tread lightly here she will take ‘Drea over her knee with a wooden spoon like she used to when she would misbehave as a child. “Grams, I really love what I’m doing. Focusing on you and me getting the store opened. The trees will be ready for a harvest soon and we will be baking and canning. Oh Grams I love being home.” ‘Drea says teary. Ruthie’s eyes soften, “Oh Sugar I have missed so much, but that doesn’t change the subject though. Now I know there is somethin’ goin’ on with Nathan. Neither one of you want to talk about it with me, oh that is just fine. I am just an old woman, what do I know?” ‘Drea starts to answer but Ruthie continues, “Well I will tell you what I know Missy. I met your Grand-daddy and nearly fell for him at first sight. I made him a pie and that night I knew he was it for me. I didn’t go lookin’ for it Andrea Ruth, I didn’t. I was seventeen years old for pity’s sake. I wasn’t ready for that, but when I saw the way that ol’ teddy bear looked at me, oh that man. He looked at me like Nathan looks at you, and I know what I am sayin’ that look makes a woman go weak in the knees. You made him a butterscotch pie didn’t you Sugar?” “Yes, Ma’am I guess I kinda did. The night you went to Bingo. Grams, do you realize that when you are angry you lose your ‘gs’?” ‘Drea says stifling a giggle. “You aren’t too old to go across my knee Andrea Ruth. He is a good man. ‘Drea don’t go messin’ with his head. I just came from the workshop, gave him the same talkin’ to about you. Either you two attack this thing head on or leave it alone. No secrets and no games.” “Yes, Ma’am. Did you threaten to take him across you knee too Grams?” ‘Drea asks with a wink. Ruthie sighs, “Get outta here Andrea Ruth, I would like to try out the new kitchen and make a pie of my own.” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea replies as Ms. Ruthie kicks her out of the kitchen and into the yard. ‘Drea walks through the orchard looking up at the sky through the branches. The fruit is starting to fill the trees and the smells are heavenly. ‘Drea picks an apple and bites into it, closing her eyes to savor the taste, no apple had ever come close to tasting as good as the ones she would pick here as child. Nate told her to keep thinking…and she had been doing little else… Thinking of how good his arms felt around her, how his lips felt warm and tender on hers, and the explosion between them. She wanted him badly. ‘Drea didn’t know how she ended up outside the workshop, she didn’t intend on coming here did she? As she walked up to it, she was stopped dead in her tracks. Nate was shirtless, sanding the edges of the display cases with an electric sander. He had on low slung carpenter jeans and a tool belt that had belonged to her Grand-dad. He was drenched in sweat and unaware of her watching him. So ‘Drea decided to oogle, she decided to stand there and oogle…and want…and need…a lot. Nate wasn’t unaware of her. He had missed her, more times than he could count he wanted to go to her and tell her just that. To hell with her needing to think about them, he wanted her and hell she wanted him just as much. The moment she stepped out of the trees he knew she was there watching, but he kept sanding, making sure the edges were perfect. Moving and bending, knowing she was watching like when he was on the roof. Turning the sander off, he turns and smiles at her. “Well, ‘Drea what a pleasant surprise. Have you come to oogle me?” “Those look good.” ‘Drea replies her mouth suddenly dry. “Thank you, come take a closer look. I won’t bite Sugar.” He says with a chuckle. She walks into the workshop and smiles arching a brow, “Sound a bit like the big bad wolf don’t you?” Nate waggles a brow as she leans down looking at the cabinets. “Wow these look amazing Nate.” He walks up beside her, “They will look even better stained and filled with all those amazing things you ladies bake. When are you planning on opening?” “Hopefully next weekend, I know Grand-dad used to make a big deal of the weekends. Big displays of fruit, baked goods, and lots of people; Grams would can for days and it would be wall to wall people. Everyone knew us and it was like family, I want that back.” ‘Drea says as she smiles, standing now toe to toe with Nate… How did that happen? “It will be a good turn- out; the gossip mill is already going full blast. Start advertising, make flyers and we can harvest what is ready in the orchard and have everything set up. Ms. Ruthie has been canning like mad, and your coolers are full aren’t they?” Nate says as he strokes ‘Drea’s arm. “Yes, it is all falling into place.” ‘Drea reaches up and touches Nate’s cheek as her green eyes meet his searching. “Nate…” “Don’t ‘Drea, don’t ruin it, don’t think anymore.” Nate says crushing his lips to hers. The warm, tender kiss making her knees weak. ‘Drea could taste the salty sweat on his lip. He pulls her into him; he sighs at the smell of vanilla and meringue. He had grown needy of the smell of her and the taste of her lips. It made him nervous, he never needed someone before; he was realizing a little too late that he needed ‘Drea and the hell with everything else. ‘Drea had spent the past few days denying everything she had felt, everything her Grams had said was true. She had felt something when Nate touched her, when he kissed her. She trusted him, she told him things she had never told anyone, she cried in front of him unashamed. She couldn’t believe it but Nathan Kyle had snuck right in and made her trust, made her relax. As Nate pulled back slightly, he smiled down at her as she relaxed into his arms. “So, are we done thinking ‘Drea?” ‘Drea opens her eyes and smiles at him. “I think that whatever is going on between us is a huge mistake. One of us is going to get hurt, I am not even sure if I am going to stay here.” “’Drea…” He starts but she silences him with a kiss. “It may be a mistake…” She says as she pulls away letting him catch his breath. “But Nate, right now I don’t care. If Grams has the guts to kick me in the ass about it then maybe I should listen.” He smiles a purely sexy, wicked smile. “Sugar, I love that woman.” Nate says with a groan and kisses her again. “Grams made chicken and dumplins, I made a black forest cake, and we figured we need you to stay for supper so we don’t waste food.” ‘Drea says kissing his jaw. “Black forest cake?” Nate asks grinning against her neck. “Yes, ever had one?” “It is my favorite. I have one on every birthday; these were just store bought though. I am sure I will never be the same after yours.” ‘Drea’s breath hitches as Nate’s hands run down her back and run along the waist band of her jeans, stroking her bare back under her shirt. “W-well, I have to get back, Grams is baking in the store and I want to taste test. I will see you at supper time.” ‘Drea kisses him sweetly on the lips and heads back to the store. Nate sags against the display case and sighs, that woman will be the death of him, but what a way to go. Snapping out of it, he turns and starts staining the first case for the store. ‘Drea told Nate so much about her past, things she had told no one. Although she can tell there are things he is not saying. Things she hasn’t really asked about though either. He had such pain in his eyes when she talked about watching her Momma die in the car beside her. Was that all for her? Shaking her head to dismiss the thought, ‘Drea makes a deal with herself that she is going to enjoy this, have fun with it. When he leaves town or she does, it will be a clean break no strings and no regrets. As ‘Drea walks back into the kitchen her Grams chuckles looking up from her meringue and smiles. “Well Sugar, you didn’t waste any time did you?” “Grams! I went to invite him to supper, and the cases look great” ‘Drea says as the blush runs across her cheeks, she grabs a water from the fridge and sits at the table to drink. “Well of course you did. Did you enjoy the view Sugar? That man was grown better than a June Apple.” “Grams!” ‘Drea says spitting her water. “Now Missy, I know good and well how to appreciate a hard workin’ man. I may be old but I ain’t dead.” “Grams, you will never be old, you are timeless. You know Nate would marry you tomorrow if only you would say yes.” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “Yes, he would. He isn’t your Grand-dad though Andrea. No man will ever measure up to Frank Westwood in my eyes, though Nathan Kyle is a close second. That man is all about you Sugar.” Ruthie says with a smile as she washes up and kisses ‘Drea on the cheek. “Now you make sure you are at that table, washed up and six or I will come a huntin’ Missy.” “Yes, Ma’am, and I will bring dessert.” ‘Drea says as her Grams walks out of the store slowly steadying her walker, climbs into her car, and drives up to the house. After cleaning the kitchen ‘Drea boxes up the cakes and locks up the store, making the trip through the orchard to the house. At six on the dot, ‘Drea is washed up in a green sundress at the table as Nate walks in. “Well don’t you clean up nice Nathan?” Ruthie says as she sets the table. “Thank you Ms Ruthie, you two look lovely and everything smells so good.” Nate says kissing Ruthie’s cheek and sitting across from ‘Drea. “’Drea pour the tea will you?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, Grams.” ‘Drea replies, pouring three glasses of sweet tea and then adding lemon. The three sit chatting about the orchard and eating supper. Ruthie is delighted to see the smiles on their faces, knowing where this is heading even if neither of them does. She smiles to herself knowing these two don’t stand a chance, just like Frank and her were, they are goners. “Well, Nathan ‘Drea says the display cases are nearly done and that look real good.” She pipes up tired of the comfortable silence as they eat dessert. Nate looks up at them both with a shy grin, “Yes, ma’am, all sanded and I started staining them today. Once that’s done I will put in the glass. They will look great filled with all those goodies.” “Very good then. Early tomorrow, you two can start pickin’ apples and such, before the heat rises. I’ll call it a night after I clean up here. You two should walk through the orchard, it is beautiful in the twilight.” “Grams, I can…” ‘Drea starts. “No, Andrea Ruth, I am kickin’ you two out, now go on.” Nate smiles, standing he takes ‘Drea’s hand, “She’s lost her ‘gs’, we better go.” “At least someone listens. Now shoo.” Ruthie says as she shoos them both out the door. “Well that is twice today that she has kicked me out of a kitchen.” ‘Drea giggles. “Come one Sugar, let’s go see some trees.” Nate says taking her arm in his. They walk arm in arm through the trees, and ‘Drea sighs, “They walked here every night, arm in arm, and stealing kisses under the stars, oh Nate they sure had it all. Even after they married they walked here every night. I used to sit in my window and watch them walk off together. It was so romantic.” Nate pushes her up against an apple tree and kisses her warm and passionately. ‘Drea returns his kiss, fisting her hands in his brown pullover. Tilting her chin up to him he deepens the kiss, as his thigh slides between hers. Nate never believed in grand romantic gestures, but when ‘Drea was talking about her grandparents all he wanted to do was kiss her senseless. If it was romantic, then so be it but if he didn’t kiss her soon he would explode. He gently pulls back and puts his hands on her hips to steady them both. “’Drea are you OK?” Her eyes flutter open and she sighs, “You kissed me. You kissed me here in the orchard under the stars.” Nate chuckles, “Yeah, I suppose I did.” He strokes a hand up her arm and cups her jaw. “I think I will do it again.” Before she can react, he brushes his mouth over hers, and as her lips part for him he caresses his tongue with hers. She moans into his mouth as his hands cup her behind urging her into him. “Nate…” She whispers against her jaw. “What is it Sugar?” He asks kissing down her throat. “Why do you call me that?” She whispers. His eyes meet hers, searching. “Ms. Ruthie does, it just stuck and you are so sweet… I don’t know it just fits, why?” “Grand-dad used to call Grams that.” “Oh, do you mind ‘Drea?” “No, I don’t mind it. Nate?” She asks as she looks into his eyes. “Yeah?” He asks as his hands travel up and down her back as if he can’t get enough of her in his hands. “Kiss me again.” She whispers inches from his lips. “Oh Sugar, you only have to ask.” He growls and ‘Drea melts into Nate’s kiss, swept away by the romance in the moment. Chapter Four: Apple Pickin’ The alarm sounds at 5am jolting ‘Drea out of her dream-land recap of twilight walks in the orchard with Nate. Last night couldn’t have been more perfect. Throwing on jeans and a gray pull-over, ‘Drea grabs her sneakers and heads to the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Sugar.” Grams calls as ‘Drea pours a mug of coffee. “Morning Grams, sleep well?” “Yes, I did. How was the orchard?” ‘Drea sighs and sits at the table, nibbling at a piece of toast. “Oh Grams, it was nice.” “It looked really nice to me, Sugar.” Grams says with a wink. “Were you watchin’?” ‘Drea says blushing. “Andrea Ruth! As if you didn’t watch Grand-dad and me walkin’ every night. Nathan reminds me of him, strong but sweet.” “It was lovely Grams, I always thought the orchard was magical. Momma used to say it too. Last night it was, it was perfect.” “I don’t know about magic, Sugar. All I do know is your Grand-dad and I put all our love into this place; into your Momma and you, we never wanted anything else.” “I miss her Grams, so much.” ‘Drea chokes back a sob. “Oh Sugar, not a day goes by that I don’t miss you Momma. Now that you are home it does ease the pain.” ‘Drea hugs her hard, “Me too, I guess you are stuck with me then.” “Good, now go pick some apples, I hear Nate’s truck pullin’ up.” Grabbing the basket her Grams has packed ‘Drea heads out and hops up into the truck with Nate. “Morning Sugar.” He says kissing her sweetly on the cheek. “Ms. Ruthie send breakfast?” “And coffee.” ‘Drea says with a nod. “Love of my life.” He winks taking the mug. “I loaded the bins already, so we are ready to go.” “Let’s hit it.” Nate pulls into the orchard driving down the worn trail. As he comes to a set of trees nearly bursting with ripe green apples he pulls over and stops the truck. ‘Drea looks over her green eyes dancing with the flecks of gold and Nate’s heart races. Before he can say a word, ‘Drea hops out of the truck and leaps up a tree effortlessly. “Careful Sugar, no broken bones.” Nate calls as he pulls the ladder out of the back of the truck. “My Grand-dad used to say that I could swing in one of these all day. He would tease me that my Daddy was part monkey.” ‘Drea says as she tosses apples into the first bin. “Ha. I seem to forget sometimes that you are a Westwood.” He says as he climbs the ladder and starts on the tree next to her. She peeks around a branch her green eyes blazing at him through that black hair framing her face. “What exactly does that mean?” “That you are determined and tough as hell. I keep underestimating you ‘Drea.” Nate says his eyes full of heat. “Oh.” ‘Drea says, smiles then moves to a higher branch. By noon, they have loaded all the bins full of apples into the back of Nate’s truck and are sitting in the grass against a tree resting. Nibbling on the sandwiches and odds and ends that Ms Ruthie packed picnic style and sipping on waters. “Looks like the rain missed us.” Nate says squeezing ‘Drea’s hand. “Yeah. I could stay here all day, it is so peaceful here.” Nate tugs her hand pulling her into his lap, pulling the clip from her hair so her long black strands fall around them. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly as he kisses her softly running his fingers through her freed hair. “Grams will come looking for us Nate, and without her ‘gs’.” ‘Drea says teasingly. “Nah, she hasn’t been in the orchard since I have been in town.” Nate says kissing her jaw line and nips at her ear. His thumbs rubbing circles into her back. ‘Drea kisses him gently tugging at his bottom lip as her hands twist and tug in his shaggy blonde hair. “’Drea?” He groans, as she nips at his stubbled jaw. “Hmm?” She purrs. “You drive me crazy… Mmm… ‘Drea, we can’t…not here.” ‘Drea pulls back and laughs, “No we can’t, can we?” She stands and walks back to the truck and Nate yells, “’Drea, I said we can’t, I didn’t say I didn’t want to.” Turning back to him as he repeats her words back at her, she leaps into his arms. “Oh Nate.” She whispers kissing him hard. “Grams is going to Bingo tonight right?” “Mmhmm, hasn’t missed one as far as I know.” “Let me cook for you, come to the store tonight and I’ll have dinner and dessert.” ‘Drea says as she strokes his jaw. “I can’t say no to you lovely Westwood women. See you later then Sugar?” “Yeah, I gotta get to the store; you gotta get the apples up to Grams. Will you tell her about dinner?” “Sure it will be my pleasure to give Ms. Ruthie the night off.” ‘Drea kisses him once more and heads through the orchard to the store. “Yep, she will be a hell of a way to go.” Nate says to himself as he drives his truck up to unload the apples for Ms. Ruthie to clean, and separate. ‘Drea paces around the island as she decides what to make for tonight. She decides on lasagna and a salad, and rolls out dough for herb bread. After mixing the salad and prepping the lasagna she places them both in the fridge. Locking up the store, she heads to the house where Grams is on the porch peeling apples. “I hear I get the night off huh Missy?” “Yes, Ma’am.” ‘Drea says with a smile. “That’s a girl. You two have some fun tonight, Sugar.” ‘Drea kisses her cheek and goes into the house. After a long bath, ‘Drea has lotioned herself and is wearing a silky pink sundress and while ballet flats. She leaves her hair down; he likes it down, and checks her make-up. She whistles on her walk through the orchard as she heads back to the store. As the lasagna and bread cook in the oven she sets the table. Using a white silk table cloth and lighting candles, once she is happy with it she walks to the cooler to get something for dessert and is stopped in her tracks. Sitting on the shelf is a pie and a note: If you think I wouldn’t have my hands in this Missy, you were wrong. Enjoy your night-Grams. Taking the pie and the note ‘Drea smiles. Just as she puts the plates on the table there is a knock at the door. “Come on in Nate, its open.” Nate strolls in handing ‘Drea a single red rose. “Thank you.” She says as she takes him in: he has shaved, and is in a blue dress shirt and black jeans. “You look nice Sugar.” He says pulling her into an embrace. “You clean up nice yourself, hungry?” “Always.” He says with a wink. “I was going to bring wine, but I didn’t know…” Nate starts as he sits down. “I’d rather have a beer anyway.” ‘Drea says handing Nate a bottle. “You are an amazing woman Sugar.” Nate says taking a sip. As they eat they sit together smiling, laughing, and talking about the store. “So in just a few days we will know if this will all work out?” Nate asks as he finishes his plate. “Not exactly, I see it as worth it all regardless if anyone shows up. Grams is the only family I have left and I am happy here.” ‘Drea replies as she slices the pie, as she cuts through the meringue she gasps. Nate brows shoot up, “What is it ‘Drea?” “Grams, she… Oh it is my favorite!” She stammers out. “What…huh?” Nate asks again confused. She carries the pie over and hands him a plate, “When I was a little girl Grand-dad used to buy me Mounds candy bars at the grocer. Grams made me a pie for my birthday one year. I can’t believe she remembered.” ‘Drea says as she bites into the chocolate crème pie with meringue and coconut shavings and sighs. “Sugar you would be surprised at how much she remembers. All she talks about it you and how proud she is of you.” “She is too good to me; Lord what would I do without her.” “Let’s hope we never find out Sugar.” Nate replies as he finishes his pie and clears the table. ‘Drea starts running water in the sink as Nate grabs her arm, spinning her into him. “Dance with me ‘Drea.” “There is no music Nate.” She says shutting off the faucet. “So.” He says matter of fact, and twirls her across the kitchen. The whole world stands still as Nate holds ‘Drea in his arms and he brings his lips to hers. As her arms wrap around his neck he groans against her mouth. Nate’s knees nearly give out, so he locks them in place as he pulls back. “Come with me ‘Drea.” Nate leads ‘Drea through the orchard to a clearing; there is a blanket on the ground, and flameless candles, and cushions set up against a tree. It takes ‘Drea a moment to take it all in as Nate wraps his arms around her waist pulling her into him. “Nate…” ‘She finally gasps, as he squeezes her hand. “I may have had some free time this afternoon, sit.” He says as he sits pulling her into his lap. “Tonight couldn’t get much better, this is beautiful.” She whispers as she kisses him sweetly. “’Drea…” Nate moans as he turns them, laying her on her back on the cushions and blanket, his eyes searching hers. ‘Drea’s hands fist in his shirt and he crushes his mouth to hers. As his hands run up her thighs, ‘Drea starts unbuttoning his shirt, ripping most of the buttons off making her giggle. “Oh, I’m sorry.” “It’s OK. I didn’t like that shirt anyway.” Nate says with a chuckle, as he tosses it off and trails kisses down her throat. Slowly he unbuttons the buttons on the front of her dress kissing every inch of exposed skin, as she arches up to him. “Nate…” She pleads. “Ssh, right here Sugar.” He whispers as he slides her panties down her legs. “I am going to take my time with you Andrea. I have been desperate to touch you for like this for days.” As he pushes her dress off, he takes her mouth with his again, wrapping her legs around him. ‘Drea has never felt like this. Nate had spent his afternoon turning the clearing into a romantic wonderland, and he was worshipping her body like time stood still. Phillip never gave her butterflies, she never saw sparks when he kissed her. Nathan Kyle could make all those things happen and then some. As Nate slowly sank into her, he thought his brain would explode. It was better than anything he could have ever imagined…and he had spent a lot of time imagining… The feel of her soft skin, her heart racing, the smell of vanilla and sugar that came from her was nothing compared to the sweet taste of her. As her sweet pants turned to moans and soft whispers of his name; Nate lost himself and went right over the edge with her. Pulling the extra blanket over them, Nate pulls her against him and kisses her hair. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” As he disposes of the condom in his jeans pocket, he hears ‘Drea sniffle. Concern filling his face, he turns her chin up to look at him, wiping a stray tear from her cheek with his thumb. “Jesus, Sugar did I hurt you?” ‘Drea chuckles out a sob, “No, Nate. No one has ever made me feel so special. No one in a long time, not since…” She trails off. “Since you left here? Oh Sugar, you’ve been with the wrong people. You are amazing, ‘Drea. It’s there loss and my gain.” He says sweetly as he tucks her beneath him and brings his lips to hers. “I plan to spend the night showing you just how amazing I think you are ‘Drea.” ‘Drea stretches as she feels the arms tighten around her. Relaxing back into Nate’s arms, she relives last night and it hits her… We are STILL in the orchard, jerking up she laughs out loud. “We stayed out here all night, and we are naked.” She says as Nate’s eyes flutter open. “Looks like we did, better get up to the house before Ms. Ruthie comes huntin’” Nate teases as he grabs her dress and hands it to her with a wink. Once they are dressed, they walk up to the house where Ms. Ruthie is waiting on the porch swing peeling apples. “Mornin’ you two.” She says with a conspiratorial grin. “Grams, we were um…” ‘Drea starts. “Andrea Ruth, do you think you could possible spin a tale and make be believe anything other than what happened between you two in the orchard? Do you think Grand-dad wasn’t so smooth himself?” Ruthie says with a laugh. “Grams!” ‘Drea says blushing. Ruthie’s eyes dart to Nate lovingly, “Nathan.” She says sweetly. “Morning Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as ‘Drea pulls him into the house. “Pancakes and bacon are on the stove.” Ruthie shouts. As Nate sits digging into the pancakes and bacon, ‘Drea pours the coffee. Sitting beside him she sighs as she bites into a piece of bacon. “So are we…I mean…Um…” She starts. Nate laughs, “Yes, ‘Drea you’re my girl, that is if you want to be.” ‘Drea blushes, and then smiles. “Um, well, just like that huh?” “Guess so.” Nate says finishing his plate, he stands pulling her into him. “I like the sound of that, you ‘Drea…My girl…mine…” Crushing his lips to hers, he turns and lifts her to the counter behind her and her legs wrap around his hips. After surrendering to needing to kiss her senseless he remembers where they are… In Ms. Ruthie’s kitchen, her only grand-daughter on her counter… Jesus man you are a goner. Pulling back he smiles, “OK. I am going back to my place to change; I’ll be back in an hour to put in the display cases.” He adds as he kisses her again, and then he saunters out of the house saying goodbye to Ms. Ruthie on his way to his truck. After gathering her wits, and cleaning up the breakfast dishes, ‘Drea showers and dresses quickly. Ruthie is cooking apples when she comes into the kitchen. “Oh Sugar, you seem lighter this mornin’” “Grams, really…” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “We have calls about tomorrow all mornin’, should have a good turn-out Sugar.” Ruthie says as she starts preparing jars to can apples. “That’s great. Nate and I are going to put in the display cases today.” “Oh, so how are you and Nate, Andrea?” ‘Drea smiles, “Good Grams. He is so sweet, and makes me feel…special.” “Well, good Missy. Now, you get on, I’ve got things to get done. I’ll bring jars down later, once they have cooled.” “Grams, Nate and I will come and load up after supper.” “Alright then Sugar.” Ruthie nods as ‘Drea heads out the door and into the orchard. By the time ‘Drea walks to the store, Nate is backing the truck up to the front doors to unload the display cases. She stops, admiring the view of him stretching across the truck removing the straps holding down the cases. Will she ever tire of oogling this man and his backside? Get a grip ‘Drea, you are gawking like a pervert! Turning just in time to catch her, Nate smiles. “Hey, Sugar.” “Hey yourself.” She calls back as she turns to unlock the doors. “Need some help?” “Nope, they are lighter than they look. You should get in there and bake, Sugar.” Nate says with a grin. “Oh so one night under the stars and I am destined to be the ‘little woman in the kitchen…” She says teasing. Nate laughs, “Well hell, maybe.” He winks. “I would do anything with a donut.” ‘Drea waggles a brow, “Then I had better get to it then. I fully intend to make you work for every bite.” She winks back at him as she turns and saunters into the kitchen. Nate lays his head against the cool metal of his truck and sighs… Yep killing him…killing him… ‘Drea cranks Bon Jovi on her IPod and hooks it into the sound system; she starts mixing flour, eggs and adding all the other ingredients to the mixer. As her dough rises she starts mixing up her glaze. Singing along with ‘Always’ as she rolls out her dough, she feels arms around her waist and smiles. Nate... “They aren’t ready yet.” She teases as he nuzzles her hair. “I got the cases in, and bolted into place. You are ready to open Sugar.” “Nearly. Grams has apples at the house, jars of jelly and some other stuff.” “I’ll go get it now.” Nate says sweetly as he nuzzles her ear pulling her tight against him. Whipping around to face him he hoists her up on the counter and kisses her hard and demanding, her hands roaming up and into his hair and tugging. A cough from the front door startles them both, making ‘Drea nearly jump off the counter. “Well Andrea, I see you changed your recipe. Exactly which part of the process is this?” A man from the door says, adjusting his suit. Part Five: Sometimes you have to face the Past, in the Present, to have a Future. ‘Drea’s face falls as she takes in the man she never thought she would see again... “Phillip. How did you know where to find me? Why are you here?” She asks appalled that he has the guts to show his face now. Nate takes her hand in his and she swears she heard a growl low in his throat. Phillip stands his whole 5’10 in the door way in his expensive black tailored suit and eyes the place. His perfectly styled black hair, not one strand out of place, his brown eyes assessing his distaste for the situation. “Andrea, I was curious as to where my fiancé ran off to, I have missed you pet.” Nate eyes ‘Drea? Pet? What the hell, she isn’t a pet. “Um Nate, this is Phillip my old boss. I would say it is a pleasure Phillip but it isn’t.” ‘Drea scowls. Nate sighs, “Phillip.” Nodding icily. “Nate would you mind seeing to Grams? I will see to this and be ready to set up when you get back.” She says not taking her eyes off of Nate. “Are you sure, Sugar?” Nate asks sweetly, clearly marking his territory. “Yes Baby. It won’t take long.” “Ok.” Nate replies kissing her cheek sweetly, turns and strides out like a man on a mission. After ‘Drea shakes her head to steady herself she turns to deal with this mess. “Phillip what do you want?” She asks him as he strides over to her. “I have missed you My Pet. Why did you leave?” Phillip says as he touches her cheek. “Why? Why! I guess you and the waitress didn’t think I would mind? You could have cared less that I left you Phillip. You don’t love me and I don’t love you.” She snaps as she jerks away from him. He chuckles, “Ah Pet you are so much smarter than I give you credit for. I am a bit disappointed in the whole ‘kissing the handy man thing’ but I can forgive you.” ‘Drea closes her eyes mentally counting to ten, “Don’t call me pet. I hate than Phillip, I am not your damn pet. Why would I want your forgiveness, we are over.” Phillip laughs. He laughs! “We are far from over my pet. My father has decided that since you left, the restaurant is no longer high-priority. He is threatening to boot me and close if you don’t come back. I booked us a flight and we...” ‘Drea slams a pan across the room, “Now you listen to me, Phillip. Very carefully, I am not going back to New York, I am not working for you and I am not putting back on your ring. Now leave before I make you.” She turns to her dough and starts to roll it out and he grabs her spinning her into him pinning her against the island. “Phillip, I am warning you.” Phillip smiles, “Andrea, you have no idea what you are saying and who you are messing with. You will go back to the way things were and that is that.” He pushes against her and nuzzles her neck. “Never, Phillip I mean it. Back the hell up and NOW!” ‘Drea pushes at him and he jolts back. Not because of her force, but Nate’s. He grabs Phillip by the throat and jerks him to the door. Choking off his airway, making Phillip gasp and beg. “Nate! What are you doing?” ‘Drea gasps fearing Nate will kill him. “I am just taking out the trash Sugar, won’t be but a minute.” Nate says dragging him out the door and jerking it closed. Nate is bubbling with fury, standing outside during the conversation was nearly impossible. This egocentric ass caged her in, put his hands on her. He throws him into his car and he crumbles to the ground. Gasping for air Phillip is cursing Nate with every breath. “I will sue you. I will own you. She is my fiancé and belongs to me.” Nate growls grabbing him by the jacket and hauls him up against his shiny little BMV rental. “Now you are going to listen to me, real good. I am going to speak nice and clear, as to not confuse you.” Phillip starts to talk but Nate shakes him furiously, shutting him up. Nate continues, “You are not welcome here. She doesn’t want you here. If you decide to show up here again, I will be waiting and you will see just how handy I am asshole. Andrea is no longer your fiancée, employee, or whatever else she may have been. So get in your car and have you a real nice day.” Nate growls letting him slide down the car. Phillip gasps for breath as he climbs into his car and drives away. Nate turns and walks back into the kitchen where ‘Drea stands at the sink. “’Drea are you alright?” Nate asks as he wraps his arms around her from behind. She blows out a breath and closes her eyes, “Yes, he just tried to get his point across. He wanted me to come back and make his life easier.” ‘Drea says as she turns in his arms and he pulls her in tight. “I know Sugar.” Nate says. “You were listening?” ‘Drea asks surprised. Nate nods, “He looked like a classic douche and I wasn’t leaving you alone with him. When he got too close, I decided to remove him.” He says drawing a giggle from her. “Thank you, Nate. So...is he still alive?” ‘Drea asks as she nuzzles into the crook of his neck. “Yeah, but if he comes back we will need to plan on where to hide the body. I won’t be so polite next time.” Nate says sweetly. “He won’t be back. Phillip doesn’t love me Nate, he never did. I won’t live that way and now he knows that.” “OK, so now that you are alright. I will leave you to my donuts and I will see to Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as he kisses her sweetly then he is gone. ‘Drea turns and starts punching out donuts and cranks up the fryer. Placing six on a plate, she boxes up the rest and sits the plate on the table just as Nate walks in. “Grams load you down?” ‘Drea asks as she pours coffee. “She sure has been busy. Sit with me...” He says pulling her into his lap, “We will set up everything up and then I am going to cook you dinner, tonight.” ‘Drea bites her lip to stifle her laugh. “You want to cook for me?” Nate kisses the tip of her nose, “Oh ye of little faith. Yes, I can cook.” “Well Nathan Kyle, there are still many things I do not know about you.” ‘Drea purrs as she watches Nate eat his donuts. Nate frowns, “It’s all hype Sugar... not much to tell.” ‘Drea new better than that, but she would let it go for now, at least. It is important for her to know him, but it isn’t like he is telling these things to everyone else. He really won’t open up to anyone and yet he is to her, little by little. Picking at her donuts she arches a brow at him, “So what are you cooking?” “Homemade pizza. Does that work for you?” He asks as he swallows the last donut in one bite. “Absolutely, one thing I loved about New York was the pizza.” After an hour of setting up the apples, jars and displays, Nate excuses himself to go into town for groceries and to change. After ‘Drea cleans the kitchen up for him, she sets the table similar to the night before, with candles. Needing to change and get ready, she leaves the door unlocked and a note: Gone to shower and change. The kitchen is all yours, see you shortly. ‘Drea She nearly skips through the orchard on her way to house. After changing into a green camisole and a jean skirt, she brushes her hair out into long black waves. Once she retouches her make-up ‘Drea slips into flip-flops and heads back to the store to meet Nate. The door to the kitchen is open and she over hears Nate and...is that Grams talking? “Ms. Ruthie you know I do...” Nate says. Does what? ‘Drea wonders, as she stands still out of view, listening. “If so, she should know about your past Nathan. She would understand. How would you expect her to share a bed with you and not know about your nightmares?” “’Drea has been through enough.” Nate snaps. “Yes she has been through a lot, but don’t use that hogwash on me Nathan. It is about give and take, she told you things I am sure.” Ruthie says back shaky. “And that’s why I can’t, why... I want to protect her Ms. Ruthie. I couldn’t bear to hurt her.” He says sounding broken. “You can’t protect and shelter her, she runs from that. I lost her for ten years. Nathan, I won’t lose her again.” Ruthie says choking on a sob. Damn it! It is a conspiracy. It wasn’t as hard for her knowing Nate wasn’t letting her in yet, but he talked to Grams... What the hell! Pissed beyond all points, she stops up into the kitchen. First, Phillip and his completely idiotic ass comes walking back into her life begging for her to come back to soothe his Daddy, then you have these two Judases! Her life is out of control and she is putting her flip-flopped foot down right now! Nate whips around and his face pales, clearly knowing she heard everything. “Well don’t stop on my account, you were only talkin’ about me.” ‘Drea says scowling at them both. “I think I will leave you two, I’ll leave the door unlocked Andrea Ruth.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea replies, not taking her eyes off Nate. Nate frowns down at his hands. “Sure you can manage Ms Ruthie?” “Nate...” ‘Drea starts, interrupting whatever answer her Grams was going to give by shutting the door behind her. “What is this?” Nate meets her gaze and sighs. “Listen ‘Drea there are things about me, things that I don’t discuss.” “Obviously.” She scowls, “Unless you count Grams.” ‘Drea grabs a beer and takes a long draw. “No problem talkin’ to her huh?” “Only just because I needed to be sure you could handle it.” He starts. Throwing her hands up in exasperation ‘Drea groans, “You didn’t feel that you could trust me to handle it? Damn you Nate, no secrets, no games. Remember?” Closing the distance between them, Nate grabs her wrists. “Don’t!” She yells, jerking away, infuriated. He kept things from her and she knew it, but because he saw her as weak? She left here years ago for similar reasons; to escape the pain of losing her Momma and the pity everyone felt for her. It was etched on all their faces and it made her sick to meet anyone’s eyes. She would be damned if he would treat her as a child, as she was weak! “’Drea, please just let me explain.” Nate pleads as he reaches for her again, “You owe me that at least.” If looks could kill he knew he would be dead already. She paces around the island, “I don’t owe you anything.” ‘Drea says as she stalks out of the kitchen and into the orchard away from him. Nate’s body is shaking, he can’t lose her. He knew tonight was the night he was going to tell her everything and she was going to understand. She was going to know he loved her and that he would beg her never to leave. He never thought he would fall in love, but the moment he saw her, he was a goner. Turning off the oven he bolts from the kitchen and into the orchard after her. ‘Drea is running she lost her flip-flops in the trees somewhere and she could care less, just slowed her down. How could he keep things from her but tell Grams? How could he think he could hide from her? Swatting the angry tears from her face, she stops at the tree in the center of the orchard dropping to her knees. To the two stones she has never seen, two grave markers. ‘Drea traces the name: Franklin Westwood. “Grand-dad, what was I thinking coming back here? I can’t do this.” She sobs. “I came here to lick my wounds of my unhappy life, not gut myself again and again.” Scooting over she traces the name: Cassandra Westwood. Flopping onto her side she runs her hands in the grass of the space between the graves and cries. Nate stands just outside the clearing, as he hears ‘Drea cry into the night. His heart nearly ripping from his chest. She wants to leave. Suddenly, his chest is too tight he can’t breathe. He knows if she leaves she will take his heart and his only shot at happiness with her forever. He had been a selfish bastard to shelter her, to think she was breakable. She was the strongest, bravest woman he had ever known. She had been through so much and watched her own mother die, helpless to stop it. He coddled her like a child and he was wrong, she held him together, she made him want to be better, stronger, she made him want to be hers. He ached to be hers. Walking over to her he curls up behind her on the grass, she lay silently sobbing as he pulls her into his chest. “Ssh Sugar, I am sorry. I am so sorry.”He whispers running a hand down her hair soothing her. “’Drea look at me baby please.” He pleads. ‘Drea look up at him, her green eyes tear stained and dark. He swipes at the tears with his thumbs and sits them both up. “’Drea, I left home at nineteen, things were not great at home. My Mom was struggling financially and I knew I needed to go. My dad had died of a heart attack and she had never worked so she had a rough go finding work. So I enlisted.” “Yes, I-“‘Drea starts but Nate puts his finger to her lip. “Please let me get this out Sugar.” He says looking pained. She nods as he takes her hands, “I went into the National Guard, I specialized in Search and Rescue...and well Recovery. I watched people die ‘Drea, so many more than I could count. My team said that I would get used to it, after time it wouldn’t bother me anymore. Can you believe it ‘Drea...get used to it...” He says with a pained chuckle. “After a while though, the lives I did save, couldn’t even erase the faces of those I watched die. I got out, but I live with it every day. It haunts me ‘Drea every damn day.” Tears fill ‘Drea’s eyes again, “Oh Nate.” Shaking his head he continues, “When I came here, no one accepted me ‘Drea, except Ruthie. Then you came and turned me inside out. I wanted to tell you, ‘Drea I did. I watched strangers die Sugar, but you watched your Momma die. It was selfish of me to think you wouldn’t be able to handle it. That you couldn’t understand.” ‘Drea cups his face in her hands and kisses him. “Oh Nate, I am so sorry. Of course I understand, it took me ten years to even talk about Momma. I am sorry, I overreacted.” Everything in Nate’s body relaxes, “Oh Sugar I thought I lost you.” ‘Drea shakes her head and smiles shyly. Nate kisses her over and over again, “No secrets and no games, ‘Drea never again.” Hoisting her up in his arms, ‘Drea curls into his chest as he carries her back to the kitchen in the store. The next morning, ‘Drea wakes to her alarm at 4:45am. After dressing in jeans and an old sweatshirt of her Grand-dad’s that says ‘Westwood Orchards’ on it, she wanders into the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Grams.” She murmurs into her mug as she sits at the table. “Andrea Ruth.” Ruthie nods. “Is everything settled between Nathan and you?” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea sighs, “I over-reacted Grams.” Ruthie chuckles, “Love will make you do that, Sugar.” ‘Drea gasps, sputtering coffee, “I never said I-“ “You don’t have to, it is all over your face, and his as well.” Ruthie says with a knowing wink. “I went to see Momma and Grand-dad last night Grams.” ‘Drea says changing the subject. “Oh, did you?” Ruthie asks, knowing that ‘Drea had never been there since her Cassandra’s funeral. ‘Drea nods. “I should have done it long ago, Grams. I was being selfish and cowardly. I blamed myself for so long and I-“‘Drea says on a sob. Ruthie jerks her eyes up. “Andrea Ruth! How dare you take the blame for something that was in God’s design. You shouldn’t have lived with all that built up in you all these years Sugar.” “I know that now Grams. Now come on we have a store to open.” “Yes, we do Sugar.” Ruthie says as they walk out the door and head up to the orchard in ‘Drea’s car. Part Six: Phillip’s Last Stand. ‘Drea loads the display cases with cakes, pies, donuts, and cobblers. Displays of Ms. Ruthie’s canning and jellies are set out, along with baskets of fruit from the orchard. A knock on the door, startles them all. “We aren’t open yet.” ‘Nate yells as he hauls a box in, turning he nearly drops it as there in the doorway stands Phillip. “I see you wanted to see how handy I am.” Nate growls sitting the box down. “Actually,” He starts as he holds his hands up in silent surrender. “I came here to talk to Andrea.” He says looking at her, “Pet, can we...” He starts then jumps as the laugh roars out of Ms. Ruthie’s throat. “Pet? Oh I know you didn’t call my Grand-daughter, your damn pet.” She roars. “Grams, I can handle this.” ‘Drea says ushering Phillip out the door, to his car.” “Listen, Phillip you have exactly ten seconds to say whatever it is you have to say and get the hell out of here before those two...” She gestures to the door where Nate and Ruthie stand watching like hawks. “Well, they know how to hide the bodies...if you understand.” He nods, “Listen Pet, Um I mean Andrea. I am sorry. I never knew what I had until you were gone. I need you, I want you. Please come back, run the restaurant, be mine.” “Phillip. I can’t, I want more.” She whispers. He gawks at her like she has grown two heads, “More? God Pet I would give you the world, anything, everything.” He pulls her into his arms and crushes his lips to hers. Nate and Ruthie are yelling and cursing from the doorway, as ‘Drea pushes Phillip away. “Phillip, I’m not in love with you. My Grandparents had love, passion and...magic. God Phillip that is what I want... I want to love, I want to ache for the man I love... and that’s-“ Phillip sighs, “That’s not me.” ‘Drea nods smiling sweetly. “So it is the handy man then. You are in love with him?” ‘Drea nods, “Yes, Nate...his name is Nate and yes Phillip I love him.” Phillip sighs, “I guess that’s that then. I can’t fight for your heart when you already gave it away, Pet. I am so sorry for the way I treated you Andrea, I took you for granted. I didn’t value you for the amazing person you are and that is my loss. I am so glad you didn’t let my mistakes damage you. I will always love you Andrea and just know that if he better be good to you Andrea.” “Phillip, I forgive you. You were no happier than I and well I have let it all go.” She says and he smiles at her fondly, kisses her again and gets into his car and leaves. Nate stands in bewilderment... He kissed her twice...Twice... She nodded and smiled at him sweetly. What the hell? Was she going back with him? Shaking it off he goes back to hauling the boxes and stocking shelves. The store was opening and there were already people looking around. He would deal with his broken heart later. There was not a second to spare, between serving customers, boxing up items and carrying to the cars, they were all busy. It seemed like the whole town maybe the whole county had showed up to see the Orchard back and thriving. Nate caught gazes of ‘Drea, she looked blissfully happy. He couldn’t help but be a little sad at that. He gave this woman his heart and she didn’t even know it yet. She could leave without knowing it. Would it change her mind if she did know? By noon, the entire store is cleared out, Nate switches the sign to closed and ‘Drea sinks to the floor. “We did it Grams!” “Oh Sugar, your Grand-dad would be so proud of you.” Ruthie says as she sits in a chair. “Of us, Grams.” ‘Drea says as she stands dusting off her jeans. “Grams, can you get back up to the house alright? There is something I want to do...” “Even an old woman can take a hint. I will see you both for supper?” “Yes, Ma’am.” They reply in unison. Part Seven: Finality. Nate sits in the passenger seat of ‘Drea’s car as they wind up the old mountain road. What was he thinking? After Grams had left, ‘Drea had said they needed to talk and that needed to drive so he all but agreed. He knew what was coming, bracing for the heartache he blows out a breath. “Where are we going? You haven’t left the orchard since you have been home.” “That’s right.” ‘Drea says glancing at him with a smile, “We are going somewhere special, Nate.” ‘Drea drives up the old road methodically, her head spinning. It hadn’t taken so long for her to realize that she had fallen in love with Nate. Phillip’s visit just made her sure. She wanted to desperately to tell him before, last night in fact. Nate had secrets though, deep secrets that haunted him just as hers did. Now that they were all out in the open, she wouldn’t run anymore. ‘Drea had to tell him, had to know for sure and if he ran ‘Drea might crumble. Pulling up on a shoulder, Nate’s eyes grow wide; there is nothing but a broken guard rail. ‘Drea shuts off the engine, walks over and sits on the edge of the broken rail. As Nate sits next to her, she leans on his shoulder. “After ten years, you would think they would just fix the damn rail.” She says shaking her head in disbelief. “Jesus, ‘Drea this is where—“ She nods as he pulls her into his arms. “I wanted a new beginning; I had to come here to close this chapter first.” She says, tears filling her voice. Nate’s heart breaks for her as he runs a hand up and down her back. “I miss her so much Nate, damn it I miss her so much.” “Oh Baby.” Nate whispers, kissing her hair. “I didn’t let myself remember. It hurt too much. This whole time it was holding me back. I’m ready to move on now Nate.” All of a sudden his gut tightened. She is leaving. Nate feels sick, oh after all he had hoped for she was moving on. Without him. ‘Drea kisses him, stopping his thoughts. “Yeah.” He says shaking his head to clear his thoughts. “Well, I guess now that the orchard is making money again you will be—“ ‘Drea looks up at him wide-eyed, “You think I am leaving?” Nate’s eyes widen to match hers and she continues, “Nate, I brought you here because this is where my world stopped ten years ago. It is time to let it start turning again. Today, was the best day of my life. This is what I was meant to do.” Nate shakes his head...confused, “What about Phillip?” ‘Drea laughs, “Oh Nate, Grams and you should learn to eavesdrop better. We talked and there is nothing there. We said our goodbyes and that is that. I am not in love with him I told him that. The orchard is magical Nate, I have always thought so. It may sound dumb...” “No it doesn’t ‘Drea. There is so much love there.” Nate says stroking her hair away from her face. “I found myself again Nate. For ten years I ran from who I was. I am a Westwood. I am bossy, determined, I dream, believe in magical orchard, that dessert can solve all problems, and in anger I lose my ‘gs’.” Nate smiles. Taking a deep breath, she blurts “And, I love you Nate.” Nate’s eyes fly open wide. “What was that?” ‘Drea giggles, “I love you Nathan Kyle. I never expected to find all the missing pieces of my heart, but you put them all back in place.” Nate takes in all she has said and smiles, “Oh Sugar, you surprise me every day. I need you ‘Drea, I love you. You push the darkness back with your beauty Andrea. From the moment I saw you lying in the grass looking up at the clouds, hell I may have loved you even then.” He stands pulling her into his arms, spinning her. “You know we will have it all, don’t you Sugar? We can marry in the orchard, walk there every night, raise a family, and keep Ms. Ruthie on her toes.” Eyes teary, ‘Drea smiles at him. “Yes Nate we will.” ‘Drea says as she kisses Nate, knowing in her heart that she found her magic.",

      "content": "Prologue: Flopping into the window sill seat, Andrea stares out at the trees. Her Grand-dad started Westwood Orchards over thirty-five years ago, and business has never been better. The small store her Grams sells baked goods, jellies and produce out of is busy this time of year, which means while Grams and Andrea's Momma run the store, 'Drea helps Grand-dad with the apples in the orchard. She watches as her Grand-dad kisses her Grams under the pre-dusk stars, even after putting in a full day harvesting he still walks her through the orchard every night. \"'Drea?\" A voice calls from the bathroom. Smiling she sighs, \"Oh Momma, isn't it so romantic?\" Climbing into the seat, Cassandra Westwood pulls her daughter into her lap. \"You know my precious one, the orchard is magical. It brought your Grand-dad and Grams together; they put all of their love into this place.\" Misty eyed she continues, \"It brought your father to me, even if for just a time.\" \"Oh Momma, I could never leave here. Not ever.\" 'Drea says as she watches her grandparents disappear into the trees arm and arm. Knowing her Momma's heart never fully mended after that summer. Andrea's father, a drifter that her Grand-dad hired for the summer harvest. Cass and Paul had loved fast and hard beneath the trees that summer. Fall came and Paul left for parts unknown. Soon after Cass learned of her pregnancy, but was never able to find Paul. To this day she aches for him. \"Andrea Ruth.\" Cassandra says as she brushes out 'Drea's tangled black hair. \"You are only eleven years old, of course you will grow up and leave here, go to college, have a career. I want so much for you, my precious one.\" \"I want love Momma, I want magic.\" 'Drea says with a pout as she climbs into bed. \"You shall have it in time, 'Drea. You have plenty of time to do it all, with us all cheering you on. I love you 'Drea.\" She soothes as she kisses her on the cheek. 'Drea jerks awake in a cold sweat, checking her surroundings. \"Oh it was so real.\" She murmurs to herself as she checks her phone for the time, as unwelcome tears stream down her face. In the years since her Momma had died she had plenty of nightmares; gory flashes of the crash, of her Momma dying there in front of her before help came. She could smell the gas leaking or see the broken guard rail. Never had she dreamed of the happy times at Westwood Orchards, those were forgotten. Her Momma had died ten years ago, her Grand-dad nearly three. Thriving in New York as a chef, 'Drea was engaged to be married. Until two days ago she thought the new life she had built was perfect. After her fiancé. Phillip had been caught giving a waitress the hands on approach, she couldn't continue to work there or marry him for that matter. Still she wondered which she'd miss more... After walking out amidst the dinner rush, she came home to a message from Grams. She couldn't say no to Grams, so after packing everything 'Drea jumps into her car without even a word to Phillip. \"Saving the orchard is all that matters.\" She tells herself as she left the city for good. Done with thinking and deciding to give up on sleep, 'Drea dresses and checks out of the hotel. \"Won't be long now 'Drea.\" She sighs. Just two hundred more miles and she would be face to face with the very thing she had run from ten years ago... The past. Grams needs her, and she will do anything to save Westwood Orchards. \"I know this will work, I can make it work. Just please, let the magic still be there... let it be real.\" Chapter One: Small towns and lingering memories. As Andrea Westwood pulls up in front of her family's fruit orchard she sighs. It has been ten years since she set foot in her childhood home, when her Momma died in a car crash, she had to get out of here and she never looked back. Until now. The crisp, cool Virginia air blows through her long black hair as she walks up to the house. It is nothing like New York, after being there as a high paid head chef of one of the city's biggest restaurants 'Drea is in shock of how nothing here has changed. The yard, the house, the fences all the same as when she left. Things change in New York every day, sometimes hourly. Here, it is like time stands still, and with only about three-hundred people in this town, they all know everything about everyone and there are no secrets. There is no fast food, no Wal-mart, and no Starbucks. She had lost cell service in and out on the way here, so surely Wi-Fi is out of the question. \"People need a passport to come here; it is like a whole nother planet.\" She says out loud to herself. \"Well not if you were born here, Missy. It tends to linger in the blood.\" \"Grams!\" 'Drea says smiling as she walks up the old wooden porch steps and hugs her grandmother, joining her on the old swing. \"Oh Sugar, it is so good to have you home. I have missed having someone around here call me something other than Ms. Ruthie. How was your trip?\" \"Long... but it gave me time to think so it was so good. I am having my things shipped down here. Since New York is over for me, I thought I would stay here for a while anyway, at least until I figure out what I want to do.\" \"Of course, Sugar. This is your home, it always has been. Come on let's get on inside, I am sure you are starved.\" \"The orchard looks like it needs some TLC Grams, the store too. When does the handy man come in?\" 'Drea asks as she nibbles at her turkey sandwich. \"Don't have one, no need.\" Ruthie says handing 'Drea a glass of iced tea. \"Grams...\" 'Drea says with a regretful sigh. \"Neither of us can do the heavy lifting around here. We need a man to do it, possibly a few. I put an ad in the paper, before I left New York. I am sure they will start calling and showing up in no time.\" Ruthie looks over her coffee mug, \"If you are sure Sugar.\" \"I am. Also, I need to see the books. I will get the bills squared away and start getting things ready for the store to open as soon as possible.\" \"OK. You're old room is ready for you Sugar, so you can get settled in.\" \"Alright Grams, thank you.\" 'Drea says as she finishes her sandwich. The kitchen is in perfect condition. No one in town would argue that Ms. Ruthie's pies and jams aren't the best in the county. She keeps an immaculate kitchen and that was one thing 'Drea was counting on. Baking and cooking have always been 'Drea's constants, they never change. It is her safe place, her one way to relax and just be. Oh how proud Grams would have been to have seen her in her element in New York... No! That's over now, 'Drea reminds herself. She needs to let it go and find her dream, open her own little shop, bake and sell her own recipes. First, she has to save the orchard and her Grams, which is long enough for her to lick her wounds and re-calculate after Phillip. Surely he will have trashed her reputation in New York, so a new start in a new place is exactly what she needs. \"It is so good to have you home, 'Drea. I have missed you Sugar.\" 'Drea smiles, \"Me too Grams, everything is going to be good now.\" Kissing her Grams on the cheek, 'Drea heads out to unpack the car. Once she is settled in her old room, she changes into a pair of jeans and a green hooded pullover. She whisks her hair up into a pony-tail and heads out to the store to see how much she can get done. The old log cabin store is covered in over-grown brush and shrubs. The dust and cobwebs look like they have been there since 'Drea left. \"Well, I am not above hard labor.\" She says to herself as she takes a small axe from the porch and shoves up her sleeves. After over thirty minutes, she has a good sized pile in the middle of the yard. Since her Grams is busy in the kitchen making apple pies, 'Drea sprawls out in the grass. Dirty and sweaty, she stares up at the sky, like she did as a child. Back then, her Momma and she would stare at the clouds and 'Drea would dream. All those wonderful things she wanted in life; the shop she would have, the man she would marry, a family. Always ever present in those dreams was Westwood Orchards. Never did she want to leave here, but when her Momma died just after 'Drea's graduation from high school, the sight of anything here was much too painful. \"Well Momma, I am back. I am home.\" Choking back a sob, she squeezes her eyes shut, letting her fingers spread wide in the grass. \"When I left, it hurt so much to be here, I miss you so much. Jesus, Momma. I was an idiot. Phillip! Oh how I wish you were here to have told me he was no good for me. I nearly let him destroy me. I sacrificed parts of me, my dreams. I gave up parts of me for a man I didn't love, and who didn't love me. That's over now. It is all about Grams, me and Westwood Orchards now and to hell with any damned thing else.\" \"Andrea Ruth, that mouth!\" 'Drea opens her eyes and winces, \"Sorry Grams, I was talking to Momma.\" \"I have half a mind to wash that mouth out young lady. Now get up, we have company.\" Ruthie says in a huff. 'Drea jerks up and blushes full on red, although through all the sweat and dirt it was hard to see much of it. \"Oh sorry.\" She shrieks jumping to her feet, coming toe to toe with her Grams and a man...a man who is smirking at her. \"This is Nathan Kyle. He has been in town a couple of months now, and I trust him. He will do whatever you need done, Sugar. I will leave you two; supper will be ready at 5:00.\" \"Yes Ma'am, Ms. Ruthie.\" He says as she turns and leaves them together. 'Drea looks him over, as he sizes her up. \"Nice to meet you Mr. Kyle.\" He chuckles and smiles, \"Nate. Mr. Kyle was my father.\" She smiles as she takes him in. At well over six foot tall, Nate was built like a machine. Brown eyes that look like perfectly melted chocolate and golden shaggy waves that drop over his eye brows. His jeans are worn and tore at the thigh, and his white pull-over is tight across his chest and shoulders. Shaking her head absentmindedly she takes a breath, \"Oh, OK. Nate, I was clearing the brush and debris from the store-front. I want it ready to open as soon as possible.\" \"Forgive me for speaking out of turn Miss Westwood, but Ms. Ruthie isn't able to keep up with the demands of all the baking the shop needs.\" Nate says protectively. \"It's Andrea... 'Drea. Also, I am well aware of my Grams' condition. Which is why I am here. I am a capable chef and I will open the store and handle it myself. Of course whatever help Grams wants to give is great. When the time comes I will hire out for more help.\" \"Oh, your Grams hadn't really told me much about your plans 'Drea.\" \"That's because she doesn't know them. I only arrived this morning after her call not even 48 hours ago. There has been little discussion, but this place is magical and I won't let it go under because it means too much to her and me.\" \"What do you need me to do?\" Nate says with a smile. Nate never thought that Ms. Ruthie's grand-daughter would come in and plan to save the day. He assumed her every intention was to fix it up and sell it off. Boy was he wrong. She was pretty, strikingly. She was curvy in all the right places, and her beautiful black hair and emerald green eyes made his heart beat a little harder. She was a Westwood, beautiful, passionate, and giving. All this and just knowing her five minutes... Jesus Nate get a grip! Women don't mix with your plan man... A warm body every now and then and again...sure that's great, but nothing like 'Drea. You don't get mixed up with a girl like her when all you want to do is be able to outrun the past. Andrea Westwood was a keeper. She could see into his eyes all the way down to his soul and that could shatter them both. Andrea Westwood had 'keeper' written all over her face. After the better part of the afternoon of following 'Drea around like a puppy Nate has a list of things to get done: fences to mend, rooms to paint, a roof to repair, not to mention a kitchen to update in the store and display cases to build. She knew what she wanted and how she wanted it, she was totally in control and Nate was speechless in awe of her plans. \"Electrical and plumbing should be checked too, but I would think you would want a bonded professional for that. I can find someone for you.\" Nate says as they lock up the store. \"OK, that would be great. I haven't been home in ten years, so I wouldn't even know who to call.\" \"This place is stranded in time.\" Nate says with a chuckle. His brown eyes sparkle with flecks of gold and 'Drea is lost in them. \"Nothing much ever changes around here.\" \"Yeah, tell me about it.\" 'Drea smiles as they walk through the orchard back up to the house. \"So Nate, where are you from and how did you end up here?\" \"Born and raised in Iowa. Then I got out of there when I was nineteen, traveled with work. Now I just sort of landed here.\" \"Oh sounds like fun. I have only been here and New York. I never thought I would leave here...'Drea says as her voice trails off. \"Really?\" Nate asks eyeing her. He swears he can hear her trying to hide pain in her voice. \"Why did you leave then 'Drea? It is obvious you love it here.\" She stops and turns as their eyes meet, his eyes seem to study her trying to delve into her and search for all the answers. She shivers and shakes it off, \"Oh after high school graduation... you know stupid teenage girl.\" She replies shrugging it off. Nate realizes as he nods a simple reply that there is much more to this story, but decides it best to let it lie as she has laid it... for now. What business is it of his anyway? Giving her a smile, letting her know that the discussion is over they turn and walk to the house. As the front door opens, the smell of pot roast and fresh cornbread hit them both right away. \"If she would marry me, I wouldn't want for another thing in my life.\" Nate says with a sigh. \"God, is that apple pie too?\" 'Drea smiles, \"Yes it is, and sorry no one would ever measure up to Grand-dad. You will have to settle with a food affair, like everyone else.\" \"This is what she tells me. I was hoping to sway her with diamonds and flowers, a man can dream can't he?\" He teases nudging her with his elbow. \"Get in here you two, supper is done. Don't make me come a huntin' for ya!\" \"Yes, Ma'am.\" 'Drea and Nate both say in unison. \"She loses her 'gs' when she gets irritated or impatient. Just a tip.\" 'Drea says to him with a giggle. \"I'll do well to remember that, especially when she has a skillet in her hand.\" He snickers making 'Drea toss her head back and laugh. They way her green eyes sparkle when she laughed...like emeralds in sunshine...made his knees go weak. Later that night as she lay in bed, 'Drea's mind wanders. She thinks back to the store and how much she wants to do with it. To the orchards and all the fruit that will be ready soon to use in the kitchen. To her Grams, who is not admitting how bad off she is but 'Drea is determined to deal with it all accordingly. Then finally and lingering to Nate. He will be a hard worker to get everything done, so she can open the store, do big things with the orchard and maybe even fix up the house to make Grams' life easier. It doesn't hurt that he is scorch-the-sheets-hot. How will she ever get any work done around him? She may have to learn to cook wearing a blindfold. He could be a welcomed distraction... She quickly dismisses the thought. No 'Drea men are off limits! This is just about Grams and you fixing up the orchard and bringing it back to its glory days. She repeats the thoughts over and over in her head, as a mantra as she drifts. And damnit all if she doesn't dream of melted chocolate and ripped Levi's. In town Nate tosses and turns in his small bed at his apartment above Vanover’s Grocery. Why is it that every time he closes his eyes he sees her? He promised Ms. Ruthie he would help do whatever was needed. She was the only one who accepted him here at first. When he showed up in town, people were skittish. She gave him work, which with a flush bank account he didn’t really need the money. Hard work took his mind off things. She cooked for him, made him pies and treated him like family, something he never really had. Now there is ‘Drea, she is so much like her Grams. Which makes this all the more important for him to help them. As sleep takes him, he doesn’t have nightmares tonight. For the first time since he can remember he sleeps peacefully. Tonight Nate’s dreams are of a raven haired, green-eyed goddess and he knows now he is in trouble, big trouble. Chapter Two: Change in the Wind ‘Drea spends most of the next few days, cleaning the kitchen in the store, she has ordered her updated kitchen appliances and both the plumber and electrician gave them a clean bill of health. Nothing could have been more perfect, all her things had been delivered and she unpacked and organized everything with glee. The kitchen inside the store would rival all kitchens, she thought as she turned to throw a box to the pile by the door she slams into Nate. “Oh! Shit, sorry you snuck up on me.” She says with a squeal. He was warm and all man, ‘Drea thought. Shaking her head, she pulls away. Bad idea, she scolds herself. Nate felt a pang of disappointment as she turned from him and frowned unsure why. “You have been busy ‘Drea. The new appliances will be here tomorrow right?” His question made those emerald eyes sparkle with excitement. “Yes, and then I will be baking away in here. Grams was able to talk the grocer into delivering all I needed tomorrow as well.” Her eyes brighten and dance with excitement making Nate pants become uncomfortable. He was staring at a woman who put his sanity and his dick in a vise…and he was enjoying it. How sick was he? “Nate! I can bake in here tomorrow, I can’t wait!” ‘Drea’s excitement makes him smile, “What do you bake ‘Drea?” He asks scratching his chin. Wiping the sweat from her forehead she smiles, “You come in here tomorrow afternoon, and you can see for yourself.” “Well you have a deal, I am more than happy to play taste tester. I fixed the fences in the orchard; I will start on the roof now. Tomorrow I can paint the front room and get measurements for the display cases.” “That would be great; it seems you have been busy yourself. I sure hope you’re hungry, Grams is making fried chicken and will not take no for an answer.” “Well I can’t say no to a beautiful woman, who cooks.” Nate says teasing. “I had better get to the roof and earn that supper.” He nudges her playfully and walks outside. After ‘Drea is done in the kitchen, she walks out to the grass and sprawls out with a bottle of water: Nate is up on the roof, shirtless repairing the busted shingles. ‘Drea watches as his muscles bunch as he nails each shingle into place, those torn Levi’s stretch as he bends. Wow. ‘Drea wonders what his strong arms would feel like around her, making her shiver with want. Suddenly his eyes meet hers and she freezes. Damn, busted! “Enjoying the view?” He asks playfully raising a brow. ‘Drea takes a drink of her water, her mouth suddenly dry, “Um…what?” She asks innocently. “Oh, you heard me Sugar.” He teases bending to pick up another shingle, giving her another heat flash. “I am just cooling off.” She says shakily. Nate chuckles, “That’s the last thing on your mind ‘Drea.” “Oh honestly!” ‘Drea sighs. “Anytime you want a closer look Sugar, just ask.” Nate teases as ‘Drea goes into the kitchen to get another water. Pacing around the kitchen island ‘Drea scolds herself. “Idiot! What were you thinking? It’s one thing to oogle; it is another thing entirely to get caught, Jesus ‘Drea!” “So you were oogling me?” ‘Drea jumps and jerks into the island. “Damn it, what are you a ninja?” Pulling his shirt on Nate laughs, “So was it one thing in particular you were oogling or just the whole package in general?” Taking her water from her hand he gulps it down. “Oh my God! Don’t say package!” ‘Drea shrieks as she blushes crimson. Nate roars with laughter. “Don’t sweat it ‘Drea, you are worth the oogle yourself.” “Let’s go eat.” She stutters. As they walk out toward the orchard, his arm brushes hers making her shudder. Nate notices and smiles at her, his heart racing. Jesus Nate! Over a touch! Are you a horny teenager or what? He knew he shouldn’t have teased her over watching him but, he liked getting her all worked up, those green eyes of hers dance with fire. After dinner ‘Drea sits on the porch swing staring out at the orchard. Nate strolls out and sits beside her. “Hey.” He says nudging her with his knee. “Penny for your thoughts?” “Hey.” She replies sighing, “I missed the quiet and the trees. I could stare at it all night.” “Me too ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly. ‘Drea peaks over at him watching her and blushes. “Sorry to bail but I have an early morning…deliveries and all.” ‘Drea says nervously standing. “Yeah, I’ll see you ‘Drea.” Nate says as he walks down to his truck and then he is gone. Shaking her head, trying to figure out what the hell what was all about, ‘Drea goes to bed. From the window, Ms. Ruthie shakes her head with a chuckle, holding the photo from her wedding day. “Well Frank our ‘Drea is finally home. It seems to be getting interesting around here. Seems to me, love may be in the air again darling. She is broken right now but, I think being home and Nathan Kyle are just what she needs.” The next morning ‘Drea practically dances up to the store. Shortly after 8:00 am, two delivery men set up the new kitchen appliances. Just as she signs the slips and old black truck pulls up with ‘Vanover Grocery’ printed on the side. “Well Andrea Ruth, as I live and breathe. Look at you all grown up.” A white haired man says as he unloads bags with Nate. “Mr. Vanover, how are you?” ‘Drea replies with a smile. “Just look at me honey, I am doing well.” He says with a chuckle. “Yes, Sir. Thank you for the delivery.” “You just make my day, bake an old man somethin’ good.” Mr. Vanover says as ‘Drea pays him and he kisses her cheek. “It is good to see you home again ‘Drea.” “It is good to be home, see you.” She replies as he climbs into the truck and pulls out. “Drea walks into the store kitchen and starts putting away groceries. “Did I get replaced as taste tester?” Nate teases as he sits the last of the bags on the bar. “No of course not. This afternoon?” ‘Drea answers with a smile. Nate smiles making ‘Drea’s knees go weak, and then leaves. Shaking it off ‘Drea cranks her IPod in her stereo deck. As REO Speedwagon blares on about Ridin’ the storm out “Drea is rolling dough and filling cake pans. Nate peeks in watching her; she is maxing icing swaying to the music. Shaking his head he chuckles to himself and starts measuring the room for the display cases he is going to build. Later that afternoon, Nate’s stomach forces him to notice the smells coming from the kitchen. Peaking around the door he shouts, “Is it safe?” No answer… He walks in and sees ‘Drea shimmying to the music, as she adds meringue to a butterscotch pie. He stands in awe as the smells hit him; she is baking pies, cakes and he swears he can smell donuts. “’Drea?” He shouts again. This time she turns and smiles, “You caught me. I couldn’t stop once I started. Nate lets out the breath he didn’t realize he had been holding, making ‘Drea laugh. “Why Nate…” She says arching a brow, “Were you oogling?” Laughing he just nods, yes he was staring watching her ass shake to the music as she danced around the island made him hard. He was hard and laughing… that isn’t normal. Changing the subject he glances around the room, “It smells amazing. I got the room ready to paint and the measurements for the cases… Um, do I smell donuts ‘Drea?” Nate says sniffing. “Yes, just out of the fryer.” She replies gesturing to the granite island where the baked goods lie cooling. “Sit, I’ll get you a plate and some coffee.” “Who am I to turn down a woman who can cook?” He teases as he sits at the small table in the kitchen and ‘Drea places a plate with donuts on it and hands him a cup of coffee. He bites into a still hot donut and groans, “Damn ‘Drea these are amazing. You will be a millionaire.” “Thanks.” She says as she pulls a cobbler out of the oven and replaces it with a cake. Sitting the cobbler down to cool, she pours herself a coffee and sits next to Nate. He reaches over and strokes her cheek, making her shudder. “You had some meringue.” Nate says as he licks his finger, his brown eyes flickering with heat. “Oh thanks I…um.” She stops as Nate stands to his feet and pulls her up so that they are toe to toe. “’Drea, I…” He starts, then curses, “Oh I am going to go to hell for this.” Cupping her jaw, he crushes his lips to hers. She sighs and pulls her hands through his hair. After a moment of weakness she pulls back. “Nate, we can’t ah…I can’t… I’m sorry.” She says as she goes lax in his arms. “I should be apologizing. I would if I could remember my name. Wow! I mean I… um sorry ‘Drea. I am going to get back to painting, thanks for the donuts.” As he turns and walks to the door she calls to him. “Nate…” As he turns she continues, “I said I can’t, I didn’t say that I didn’t want to. I am just out of a bad break-up and well…” “It’s OK, ‘Drea, we all have our pasts.” He says and then he is gone. Hours later ‘Drea finishes baking, boxes everything up and stores it in the cooler, except for the butterscotch pie. She boxes it up to take to the house for dessert hoping to clear the air with Nate. As the thunder explodes, the rain starts pelting down in sheets. Oh this walk ought to be fantastic! Glancing out the window, she sighs as she watches the rain pour down and lightning flash across the sky. Nate had finished painting hours ago, and left to go out and put things into the shed in the orchard. (Not that she was watching him or anything.) ‘Drea looks out through the trees as the lightning stretches across the sky, and squints looking to see if she can see Nate. Surely he is at the house waiting on his supper with Grams. Telling herself she is silly for worrying, she pours herself a mug of coffee and sits at the table picking at a donut. Suddenly, the door flies open and ‘Drea jumps knocking her chair over, jerking around she sees Nate standing at the door trying to shake out of a raincoat. “Nate, are you alright? You should be up at the house waiting on supper, not out here in this weather.” ‘Drea says as she pulls up the chair she knocked over and pours him a cup of coffee. “Ms. Ruthie went into town to play Bingo at the fire house. She packed up dinner for us and said I should come down here and make sure you eat, since you have been down here since early this morning.” He explains as he sits the bag on the island and begins unpacking the tubs of food. “There are pork chops, fried potatoes, biscuits and honey. Your Grams sure can put together a meal. You two should add on to this store and open up a restaurant.” “Don’t think I haven’t thought about it. I just don’t want her over doing it. She hasn’t really told me much of what the doctor says about her arthritis. I know she is supposed to ease up. So, baby steps you know.” ‘Drea says as she makes plates and places one in front of Nate and sits down at the table with him. “So what else did you bake today? The smells coming outta this place today were heaven. I was almost sad that I was finished painting because I couldn’t linger to enjoy them.” Nate says as he spreads honey on a biscuit and sips his coffee. “I made a blackberry cobbler, cakes, cookies, and a butterscotch pie with meringue that I made from scratch. I had so much fun in here today!” “That meringue was amazing, I tasted a bit.” He says with a wink as he bites into his pork chop. ‘Drea flushes, “Yeah, we should talk about that. I left New York to help Grams Nate, but it was convenient timing.” She starts. Nate stops and watches her eyes for a moment and smiles, “Well that’s a good thing right?” ‘Drea nods, “I worked in a high-end restaurant as head chef, and my fiancé was the owner.” “Was?” Nate eyes her with curiosity. “I walked in on him and a waitress, well one of his many waitresses. Needless to say, it is over. Far passed over and I was glad to have a reason to leave.” ‘Drea says sighing into her coffee. Nate shakes his head, “’Drea I am sorry, but he doesn’t deserve you. No one should be treated like that.” ‘Drea blushes at the protective tone in Nate’s voice. “Well, it doesn’t matter now, I am home and I am actually enjoying it. Do you want dessert?” ‘Drea asks as she stands up and gets a pie server and small plates. Nate tops off their coffees as ‘Drea places two pieces of butterscotch pie on the table. Nate bites into the pie and his eyes glaze over and close. “Oh ‘Drea, this is amazing!” He groans. “Thanks. It is Grams’ recipe, my Grand-dad’s favorite. I was feeling sentimental.” She replies as she takes a bite. “Wow, yeah I have missed this.” Nate smiles at how ‘Drea’s face softens at the mention of her grandparents. “She is an amazing lady. I didn’t know your Grand-dad but, he had to be one hell of a man to deserve her and this pie.” Nate says with a wink. “Yes.” ‘Drea starts and her eyes go misty. “She made this for them on their first date. Grand-dad said he knew right that very night that there was no one else for him. He walked her through the orchard every night for months and proposed to her out there. Even opened the store for her to bake in, they had something special.” “Yeah, go all their lives without finding anyone. No wonder she won’t run off and marry me, she already had it all.” Nate says as he touches her hand. “Can I ask you something about the ex ‘Drea?” ‘Drea tenses, “Um, yeah and his name was Phillip.” Nate secretly wishing a man in New York named Phillip would rot in the seventh circle of hell with a flesh eating crotch disease smiles at his own private joke and continues, “OK. Phillip? Were you in love with him? I mean honestly you had to be shooting for the whole she-bang after watching your grandparents all these years.” ‘Drea sighs, she felt things for Phillip. They were comfortable with each other, shared interests, they had the business, shared a condo, but did she ever really love him? “No, I guess I didn’t. I never really thought about that, we looked good together, I mean there was the restaurant and it was comfortable. No, it was nothing like Grams and Grand-dad.” Nate sighs, unexpectedly relieved, “Well, good thing you got out while you still could.” “You know I never really thought about it. I wasn’t into planning the wedding, we were engaged for over a year and I hadn’t even started looking. When I caught him I was hurt.” “Of course you were, you trusted him.” ‘Drea holds her hand up and exhales, “Wait you didn’t let me finish. I was hurt of course because everyone knew it was going on but me. I was embarrassed. The biggest part of me though was relieved. I think I knew it was over and I was a coward and needed a reason to leave. It was comfortable and I didn’t know how to just walk away. Seeing him with her, and the fact that it was over came so easily to me. He didn’t really try to fight for me. So I packed up, emptied my bank account and here I am.” Nate reaches over and intertwines her hand in his, “I am glad you are here ‘Drea.” ‘Drea swallows the lump in her throat, as her eyes meet his. Those deep brown eyes burning into hers making her blush…and want…and need. Pulling her hand from his she smiles, “Well I better clean up the dishes.” Standing she turns to the sink and washes the plates stacking them in the rack to dry, as Nate turns the music up. “You have Boston on your IPod playlist?” He asks with a smirk. “Guilty. I am a classic rock junkie. My Momma wouldn’t listen to anything else.” “Oh Sugar, you were raised right.” Nate teases. “We would take these longs drives through the mountains on the weekends, crank the stereo and sing along. She couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket but we didn’t care.” ‘Drea says, her voice cracking. “Jesus why am I talking to you like this? I have never told anyone this stuff, not even Grams.” Nate walks over and wraps his arms around her waist and kisses her hair. “Maybe you need to get this out ‘Drea, maybe you feel like you can trust me.” Nate squeezes her to him and lowers his voice to a whisper, “You know you can, Sugar. You can trust me.” She whips around, facing him tears streaming down her face. His face falls as he looks into her green eyes full of pain. “’Drea?” “The night after my graduation we went up into the mountains and we were singing along with Styx. She was going on and on about how proud she was of me. I was going to do such big things and she couldn’t wait. I told her I wasn’t going away to school, that I wanted to stay here. She exploded and I didn’t let down either, we were arguing and we didn’t see the truck. We went through the guard rail…” Nate pulls her into his arms and she cries softly. “We were in the car over the cliff for hours. I kept talking, about everything…anything… Finally help came, but it was too late. Momma was already gone, internal bleeding.” Nate’s chest tightens, his heart breaking for her. “Oh Sugar. I am so sorry, so damned sorry.” He says stroking up and down her back. “After the funeral, I packed up and left. Grams and Grand-dad begged me to stay. I didn’t even come home when he passed; it hurt too much to even be here. Everything reminded me of her. It is different now, I want to remember. I want to be here.” ‘Drea says as she sniffles and pulls back. “Oh Nate I’m sorry…I didn’t mean to…” “Hey it’s OK.” He says soothing her. “You can unload on me anytime.” He says sweetly as he strokes her cheek with his thumb. ‘Drea’s breath hitches, every inch of skin Nate touches comes alive and she gasps, “Nate…” “Still can’t?” Nate asks as his thumb brushes her bottom lip. “We shouldn’t you know it will complicate things…” She says shakily as her eyes flutter closed, “We should think about it first.” “Well, you think about it Sugar, and I will…” Nate starts as he brushes his lips over hers. Soft and warm, the kiss was tender. ‘Drea melts into Nate, her hands run up his arms and around his neck. Nate pulls her chin up and deepens the kiss, running his tongue along her bottom lip, a silent plea for her to open up to him. As his tongue meets hers desire explodes like fire. ‘Drea moans softly as she tugs at his hair. Finally, Nate pulls away breathless, looking into those emerald eyes he has been careful not to drown in. Yet. “’Drea?” “Yeah?” She replies, her body still humming from his hands and mouth. “Still thinking?” He asks as he tucks her hair behind her ear. “Um…” She starts but he pushes his lips to hers again. “You keep thinking Sugar, and I will be waiting.” Nate says turning and walking out the door, leaving ‘Drea nearly in a puddle. Chapter Three: Taking Chances Over the rest of the week, ‘Drea say little of Nate. He had been busy in the workshop in the orchard, building the display cases. She had baked and cooked until her cooler was full, even sending Mr. Vanover a weeks worth of suppers and desserts. In return he had been making deliveries so she didn’t need to leave the store to go into town. ‘Drea was in the middle of mixing up frosting when her Grams walks in and sits at the table in the kitchen. “Sugar, you have been a busy bee.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea says as Ruthie pours coffee and helps herself to cookies cooling on the rack. Ruthie watches smiling at her one and only granddaughter as she ices a black forest cake and places it in the cooler. “Dessert tonight Sugar?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, what are you planning to have tonight Grams?” “I have chicken and dumplins going on the stove and will ask Nathan to join us.” “Oh?” ‘Drea asks unable to hide the flush that steals across her face. Ruthie smiles and sighs, “Sugar, he is a good man. He comes from a hard past, but he is a good man. He thinks very highly of you.” “Does he? Well we don’t really know each other very well do we? He has been very helpful and is working very hard. We will be ready to open the store in the next week or so at this rate.” ‘Drea pops a cookie in her mouth and continues, “I have ordered more from the grocery, which should be here tomorrow. I also paid up all the bills until next month.” Ruthie slams her mug down on the table making ‘Drea jump, “Andrea Ruth Westwood, I am not talkin’ about the store, or the bills, or when the groceries are bein’ delivered by Old man Vanover.” “Grams…” ‘Drea starts but the glare from her Grams shuts her mouth right back. “I am talkin’ about the fact that you were a mess when you got here; bakin’ or Nathan Kyle or a combination of the two had changed that. Judgin’ by the look on your face when I say his name Missy I can see it is both, maybe more him.” Ruthie says scolding ‘Drea. ‘Drea knowing looks at her Grams, this woman may be her grandmother and use a walker, but if she doesn’t tread lightly here she will take ‘Drea over her knee with a wooden spoon like she used to when she would misbehave as a child. “Grams, I really love what I’m doing. Focusing on you and me getting the store opened. The trees will be ready for a harvest soon and we will be baking and canning. Oh Grams I love being home.” ‘Drea says teary. Ruthie’s eyes soften, “Oh Sugar I have missed so much, but that doesn’t change the subject though. Now I know there is somethin’ goin’ on with Nathan. Neither one of you want to talk about it with me, oh that is just fine. I am just an old woman, what do I know?” ‘Drea starts to answer but Ruthie continues, “Well I will tell you what I know Missy. I met your Grand-daddy and nearly fell for him at first sight. I made him a pie and that night I knew he was it for me. I didn’t go lookin’ for it Andrea Ruth, I didn’t. I was seventeen years old for pity’s sake. I wasn’t ready for that, but when I saw the way that ol’ teddy bear looked at me, oh that man. He looked at me like Nathan looks at you, and I know what I am sayin’ that look makes a woman go weak in the knees. You made him a butterscotch pie didn’t you Sugar?” “Yes, Ma’am I guess I kinda did. The night you went to Bingo. Grams, do you realize that when you are angry you lose your ‘gs’?” ‘Drea says stifling a giggle. “You aren’t too old to go across my knee Andrea Ruth. He is a good man. ‘Drea don’t go messin’ with his head. I just came from the workshop, gave him the same talkin’ to about you. Either you two attack this thing head on or leave it alone. No secrets and no games.” “Yes, Ma’am. Did you threaten to take him across you knee too Grams?” ‘Drea asks with a wink. Ruthie sighs, “Get outta here Andrea Ruth, I would like to try out the new kitchen and make a pie of my own.” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea replies as Ms. Ruthie kicks her out of the kitchen and into the yard. ‘Drea walks through the orchard looking up at the sky through the branches. The fruit is starting to fill the trees and the smells are heavenly. ‘Drea picks an apple and bites into it, closing her eyes to savor the taste, no apple had ever come close to tasting as good as the ones she would pick here as child. Nate told her to keep thinking…and she had been doing little else… Thinking of how good his arms felt around her, how his lips felt warm and tender on hers, and the explosion between them. She wanted him badly. ‘Drea didn’t know how she ended up outside the workshop, she didn’t intend on coming here did she? As she walked up to it, she was stopped dead in her tracks. Nate was shirtless, sanding the edges of the display cases with an electric sander. He had on low slung carpenter jeans and a tool belt that had belonged to her Grand-dad. He was drenched in sweat and unaware of her watching him. So ‘Drea decided to oogle, she decided to stand there and oogle…and want…and need…a lot. Nate wasn’t unaware of her. He had missed her, more times than he could count he wanted to go to her and tell her just that. To hell with her needing to think about them, he wanted her and hell she wanted him just as much. The moment she stepped out of the trees he knew she was there watching, but he kept sanding, making sure the edges were perfect. Moving and bending, knowing she was watching like when he was on the roof. Turning the sander off, he turns and smiles at her. “Well, ‘Drea what a pleasant surprise. Have you come to oogle me?” “Those look good.” ‘Drea replies her mouth suddenly dry. “Thank you, come take a closer look. I won’t bite Sugar.” He says with a chuckle. She walks into the workshop and smiles arching a brow, “Sound a bit like the big bad wolf don’t you?” Nate waggles a brow as she leans down looking at the cabinets. “Wow these look amazing Nate.” He walks up beside her, “They will look even better stained and filled with all those amazing things you ladies bake. When are you planning on opening?” “Hopefully next weekend, I know Grand-dad used to make a big deal of the weekends. Big displays of fruit, baked goods, and lots of people; Grams would can for days and it would be wall to wall people. Everyone knew us and it was like family, I want that back.” ‘Drea says as she smiles, standing now toe to toe with Nate… How did that happen? “It will be a good turn- out; the gossip mill is already going full blast. Start advertising, make flyers and we can harvest what is ready in the orchard and have everything set up. Ms. Ruthie has been canning like mad, and your coolers are full aren’t they?” Nate says as he strokes ‘Drea’s arm. “Yes, it is all falling into place.” ‘Drea reaches up and touches Nate’s cheek as her green eyes meet his searching. “Nate…” “Don’t ‘Drea, don’t ruin it, don’t think anymore.” Nate says crushing his lips to hers. The warm, tender kiss making her knees weak. ‘Drea could taste the salty sweat on his lip. He pulls her into him; he sighs at the smell of vanilla and meringue. He had grown needy of the smell of her and the taste of her lips. It made him nervous, he never needed someone before; he was realizing a little too late that he needed ‘Drea and the hell with everything else. ‘Drea had spent the past few days denying everything she had felt, everything her Grams had said was true. She had felt something when Nate touched her, when he kissed her. She trusted him, she told him things she had never told anyone, she cried in front of him unashamed. She couldn’t believe it but Nathan Kyle had snuck right in and made her trust, made her relax. As Nate pulled back slightly, he smiled down at her as she relaxed into his arms. “So, are we done thinking ‘Drea?” ‘Drea opens her eyes and smiles at him. “I think that whatever is going on between us is a huge mistake. One of us is going to get hurt, I am not even sure if I am going to stay here.” “’Drea…” He starts but she silences him with a kiss. “It may be a mistake…” She says as she pulls away letting him catch his breath. “But Nate, right now I don’t care. If Grams has the guts to kick me in the ass about it then maybe I should listen.” He smiles a purely sexy, wicked smile. “Sugar, I love that woman.” Nate says with a groan and kisses her again. “Grams made chicken and dumplins, I made a black forest cake, and we figured we need you to stay for supper so we don’t waste food.” ‘Drea says kissing his jaw. “Black forest cake?” Nate asks grinning against her neck. “Yes, ever had one?” “It is my favorite. I have one on every birthday; these were just store bought though. I am sure I will never be the same after yours.” ‘Drea’s breath hitches as Nate’s hands run down her back and run along the waist band of her jeans, stroking her bare back under her shirt. “W-well, I have to get back, Grams is baking in the store and I want to taste test. I will see you at supper time.” ‘Drea kisses him sweetly on the lips and heads back to the store. Nate sags against the display case and sighs, that woman will be the death of him, but what a way to go. Snapping out of it, he turns and starts staining the first case for the store. ‘Drea told Nate so much about her past, things she had told no one. Although she can tell there are things he is not saying. Things she hasn’t really asked about though either. He had such pain in his eyes when she talked about watching her Momma die in the car beside her. Was that all for her? Shaking her head to dismiss the thought, ‘Drea makes a deal with herself that she is going to enjoy this, have fun with it. When he leaves town or she does, it will be a clean break no strings and no regrets. As ‘Drea walks back into the kitchen her Grams chuckles looking up from her meringue and smiles. “Well Sugar, you didn’t waste any time did you?” “Grams! I went to invite him to supper, and the cases look great” ‘Drea says as the blush runs across her cheeks, she grabs a water from the fridge and sits at the table to drink. “Well of course you did. Did you enjoy the view Sugar? That man was grown better than a June Apple.” “Grams!” ‘Drea says spitting her water. “Now Missy, I know good and well how to appreciate a hard workin’ man. I may be old but I ain’t dead.” “Grams, you will never be old, you are timeless. You know Nate would marry you tomorrow if only you would say yes.” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “Yes, he would. He isn’t your Grand-dad though Andrea. No man will ever measure up to Frank Westwood in my eyes, though Nathan Kyle is a close second. That man is all about you Sugar.” Ruthie says with a smile as she washes up and kisses ‘Drea on the cheek. “Now you make sure you are at that table, washed up and six or I will come a huntin’ Missy.” “Yes, Ma’am, and I will bring dessert.” ‘Drea says as her Grams walks out of the store slowly steadying her walker, climbs into her car, and drives up to the house. After cleaning the kitchen ‘Drea boxes up the cakes and locks up the store, making the trip through the orchard to the house. At six on the dot, ‘Drea is washed up in a green sundress at the table as Nate walks in. “Well don’t you clean up nice Nathan?” Ruthie says as she sets the table. “Thank you Ms Ruthie, you two look lovely and everything smells so good.” Nate says kissing Ruthie’s cheek and sitting across from ‘Drea. “’Drea pour the tea will you?” Ruthie asks. “Yes, Grams.” ‘Drea replies, pouring three glasses of sweet tea and then adding lemon. The three sit chatting about the orchard and eating supper. Ruthie is delighted to see the smiles on their faces, knowing where this is heading even if neither of them does. She smiles to herself knowing these two don’t stand a chance, just like Frank and her were, they are goners. “Well, Nathan ‘Drea says the display cases are nearly done and that look real good.” She pipes up tired of the comfortable silence as they eat dessert. Nate looks up at them both with a shy grin, “Yes, ma’am, all sanded and I started staining them today. Once that’s done I will put in the glass. They will look great filled with all those goodies.” “Very good then. Early tomorrow, you two can start pickin’ apples and such, before the heat rises. I’ll call it a night after I clean up here. You two should walk through the orchard, it is beautiful in the twilight.” “Grams, I can…” ‘Drea starts. “No, Andrea Ruth, I am kickin’ you two out, now go on.” Nate smiles, standing he takes ‘Drea’s hand, “She’s lost her ‘gs’, we better go.” “At least someone listens. Now shoo.” Ruthie says as she shoos them both out the door. “Well that is twice today that she has kicked me out of a kitchen.” ‘Drea giggles. “Come one Sugar, let’s go see some trees.” Nate says taking her arm in his. They walk arm in arm through the trees, and ‘Drea sighs, “They walked here every night, arm in arm, and stealing kisses under the stars, oh Nate they sure had it all. Even after they married they walked here every night. I used to sit in my window and watch them walk off together. It was so romantic.” Nate pushes her up against an apple tree and kisses her warm and passionately. ‘Drea returns his kiss, fisting her hands in his brown pullover. Tilting her chin up to him he deepens the kiss, as his thigh slides between hers. Nate never believed in grand romantic gestures, but when ‘Drea was talking about her grandparents all he wanted to do was kiss her senseless. If it was romantic, then so be it but if he didn’t kiss her soon he would explode. He gently pulls back and puts his hands on her hips to steady them both. “’Drea are you OK?” Her eyes flutter open and she sighs, “You kissed me. You kissed me here in the orchard under the stars.” Nate chuckles, “Yeah, I suppose I did.” He strokes a hand up her arm and cups her jaw. “I think I will do it again.” Before she can react, he brushes his mouth over hers, and as her lips part for him he caresses his tongue with hers. She moans into his mouth as his hands cup her behind urging her into him. “Nate…” She whispers against her jaw. “What is it Sugar?” He asks kissing down her throat. “Why do you call me that?” She whispers. His eyes meet hers, searching. “Ms. Ruthie does, it just stuck and you are so sweet… I don’t know it just fits, why?” “Grand-dad used to call Grams that.” “Oh, do you mind ‘Drea?” “No, I don’t mind it. Nate?” She asks as she looks into his eyes. “Yeah?” He asks as his hands travel up and down her back as if he can’t get enough of her in his hands. “Kiss me again.” She whispers inches from his lips. “Oh Sugar, you only have to ask.” He growls and ‘Drea melts into Nate’s kiss, swept away by the romance in the moment. Chapter Four: Apple Pickin’ The alarm sounds at 5am jolting ‘Drea out of her dream-land recap of twilight walks in the orchard with Nate. Last night couldn’t have been more perfect. Throwing on jeans and a gray pull-over, ‘Drea grabs her sneakers and heads to the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Sugar.” Grams calls as ‘Drea pours a mug of coffee. “Morning Grams, sleep well?” “Yes, I did. How was the orchard?” ‘Drea sighs and sits at the table, nibbling at a piece of toast. “Oh Grams, it was nice.” “It looked really nice to me, Sugar.” Grams says with a wink. “Were you watchin’?” ‘Drea says blushing. “Andrea Ruth! As if you didn’t watch Grand-dad and me walkin’ every night. Nathan reminds me of him, strong but sweet.” “It was lovely Grams, I always thought the orchard was magical. Momma used to say it too. Last night it was, it was perfect.” “I don’t know about magic, Sugar. All I do know is your Grand-dad and I put all our love into this place; into your Momma and you, we never wanted anything else.” “I miss her Grams, so much.” ‘Drea chokes back a sob. “Oh Sugar, not a day goes by that I don’t miss you Momma. Now that you are home it does ease the pain.” ‘Drea hugs her hard, “Me too, I guess you are stuck with me then.” “Good, now go pick some apples, I hear Nate’s truck pullin’ up.” Grabbing the basket her Grams has packed ‘Drea heads out and hops up into the truck with Nate. “Morning Sugar.” He says kissing her sweetly on the cheek. “Ms. Ruthie send breakfast?” “And coffee.” ‘Drea says with a nod. “Love of my life.” He winks taking the mug. “I loaded the bins already, so we are ready to go.” “Let’s hit it.” Nate pulls into the orchard driving down the worn trail. As he comes to a set of trees nearly bursting with ripe green apples he pulls over and stops the truck. ‘Drea looks over her green eyes dancing with the flecks of gold and Nate’s heart races. Before he can say a word, ‘Drea hops out of the truck and leaps up a tree effortlessly. “Careful Sugar, no broken bones.” Nate calls as he pulls the ladder out of the back of the truck. “My Grand-dad used to say that I could swing in one of these all day. He would tease me that my Daddy was part monkey.” ‘Drea says as she tosses apples into the first bin. “Ha. I seem to forget sometimes that you are a Westwood.” He says as he climbs the ladder and starts on the tree next to her. She peeks around a branch her green eyes blazing at him through that black hair framing her face. “What exactly does that mean?” “That you are determined and tough as hell. I keep underestimating you ‘Drea.” Nate says his eyes full of heat. “Oh.” ‘Drea says, smiles then moves to a higher branch. By noon, they have loaded all the bins full of apples into the back of Nate’s truck and are sitting in the grass against a tree resting. Nibbling on the sandwiches and odds and ends that Ms Ruthie packed picnic style and sipping on waters. “Looks like the rain missed us.” Nate says squeezing ‘Drea’s hand. “Yeah. I could stay here all day, it is so peaceful here.” Nate tugs her hand pulling her into his lap, pulling the clip from her hair so her long black strands fall around them. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” Nate says sweetly as he kisses her softly running his fingers through her freed hair. “Grams will come looking for us Nate, and without her ‘gs’.” ‘Drea says teasingly. “Nah, she hasn’t been in the orchard since I have been in town.” Nate says kissing her jaw line and nips at her ear. His thumbs rubbing circles into her back. ‘Drea kisses him gently tugging at his bottom lip as her hands twist and tug in his shaggy blonde hair. “’Drea?” He groans, as she nips at his stubbled jaw. “Hmm?” She purrs. “You drive me crazy… Mmm… ‘Drea, we can’t…not here.” ‘Drea pulls back and laughs, “No we can’t, can we?” She stands and walks back to the truck and Nate yells, “’Drea, I said we can’t, I didn’t say I didn’t want to.” Turning back to him as he repeats her words back at her, she leaps into his arms. “Oh Nate.” She whispers kissing him hard. “Grams is going to Bingo tonight right?” “Mmhmm, hasn’t missed one as far as I know.” “Let me cook for you, come to the store tonight and I’ll have dinner and dessert.” ‘Drea says as she strokes his jaw. “I can’t say no to you lovely Westwood women. See you later then Sugar?” “Yeah, I gotta get to the store; you gotta get the apples up to Grams. Will you tell her about dinner?” “Sure it will be my pleasure to give Ms. Ruthie the night off.” ‘Drea kisses him once more and heads through the orchard to the store. “Yep, she will be a hell of a way to go.” Nate says to himself as he drives his truck up to unload the apples for Ms. Ruthie to clean, and separate. ‘Drea paces around the island as she decides what to make for tonight. She decides on lasagna and a salad, and rolls out dough for herb bread. After mixing the salad and prepping the lasagna she places them both in the fridge. Locking up the store, she heads to the house where Grams is on the porch peeling apples. “I hear I get the night off huh Missy?” “Yes, Ma’am.” ‘Drea says with a smile. “That’s a girl. You two have some fun tonight, Sugar.” ‘Drea kisses her cheek and goes into the house. After a long bath, ‘Drea has lotioned herself and is wearing a silky pink sundress and while ballet flats. She leaves her hair down; he likes it down, and checks her make-up. She whistles on her walk through the orchard as she heads back to the store. As the lasagna and bread cook in the oven she sets the table. Using a white silk table cloth and lighting candles, once she is happy with it she walks to the cooler to get something for dessert and is stopped in her tracks. Sitting on the shelf is a pie and a note: If you think I wouldn’t have my hands in this Missy, you were wrong. Enjoy your night-Grams. Taking the pie and the note ‘Drea smiles. Just as she puts the plates on the table there is a knock at the door. “Come on in Nate, its open.” Nate strolls in handing ‘Drea a single red rose. “Thank you.” She says as she takes him in: he has shaved, and is in a blue dress shirt and black jeans. “You look nice Sugar.” He says pulling her into an embrace. “You clean up nice yourself, hungry?” “Always.” He says with a wink. “I was going to bring wine, but I didn’t know…” Nate starts as he sits down. “I’d rather have a beer anyway.” ‘Drea says handing Nate a bottle. “You are an amazing woman Sugar.” Nate says taking a sip. As they eat they sit together smiling, laughing, and talking about the store. “So in just a few days we will know if this will all work out?” Nate asks as he finishes his plate. “Not exactly, I see it as worth it all regardless if anyone shows up. Grams is the only family I have left and I am happy here.” ‘Drea replies as she slices the pie, as she cuts through the meringue she gasps. Nate brows shoot up, “What is it ‘Drea?” “Grams, she… Oh it is my favorite!” She stammers out. “What…huh?” Nate asks again confused. She carries the pie over and hands him a plate, “When I was a little girl Grand-dad used to buy me Mounds candy bars at the grocer. Grams made me a pie for my birthday one year. I can’t believe she remembered.” ‘Drea says as she bites into the chocolate crème pie with meringue and coconut shavings and sighs. “Sugar you would be surprised at how much she remembers. All she talks about it you and how proud she is of you.” “She is too good to me; Lord what would I do without her.” “Let’s hope we never find out Sugar.” Nate replies as he finishes his pie and clears the table. ‘Drea starts running water in the sink as Nate grabs her arm, spinning her into him. “Dance with me ‘Drea.” “There is no music Nate.” She says shutting off the faucet. “So.” He says matter of fact, and twirls her across the kitchen. The whole world stands still as Nate holds ‘Drea in his arms and he brings his lips to hers. As her arms wrap around his neck he groans against her mouth. Nate’s knees nearly give out, so he locks them in place as he pulls back. “Come with me ‘Drea.” Nate leads ‘Drea through the orchard to a clearing; there is a blanket on the ground, and flameless candles, and cushions set up against a tree. It takes ‘Drea a moment to take it all in as Nate wraps his arms around her waist pulling her into him. “Nate…” ‘She finally gasps, as he squeezes her hand. “I may have had some free time this afternoon, sit.” He says as he sits pulling her into his lap. “Tonight couldn’t get much better, this is beautiful.” She whispers as she kisses him sweetly. “’Drea…” Nate moans as he turns them, laying her on her back on the cushions and blanket, his eyes searching hers. ‘Drea’s hands fist in his shirt and he crushes his mouth to hers. As his hands run up her thighs, ‘Drea starts unbuttoning his shirt, ripping most of the buttons off making her giggle. “Oh, I’m sorry.” “It’s OK. I didn’t like that shirt anyway.” Nate says with a chuckle, as he tosses it off and trails kisses down her throat. Slowly he unbuttons the buttons on the front of her dress kissing every inch of exposed skin, as she arches up to him. “Nate…” She pleads. “Ssh, right here Sugar.” He whispers as he slides her panties down her legs. “I am going to take my time with you Andrea. I have been desperate to touch you for like this for days.” As he pushes her dress off, he takes her mouth with his again, wrapping her legs around him. ‘Drea has never felt like this. Nate had spent his afternoon turning the clearing into a romantic wonderland, and he was worshipping her body like time stood still. Phillip never gave her butterflies, she never saw sparks when he kissed her. Nathan Kyle could make all those things happen and then some. As Nate slowly sank into her, he thought his brain would explode. It was better than anything he could have ever imagined…and he had spent a lot of time imagining… The feel of her soft skin, her heart racing, the smell of vanilla and sugar that came from her was nothing compared to the sweet taste of her. As her sweet pants turned to moans and soft whispers of his name; Nate lost himself and went right over the edge with her. Pulling the extra blanket over them, Nate pulls her against him and kisses her hair. “You are beautiful ‘Drea.” As he disposes of the condom in his jeans pocket, he hears ‘Drea sniffle. Concern filling his face, he turns her chin up to look at him, wiping a stray tear from her cheek with his thumb. “Jesus, Sugar did I hurt you?” ‘Drea chuckles out a sob, “No, Nate. No one has ever made me feel so special. No one in a long time, not since…” She trails off. “Since you left here? Oh Sugar, you’ve been with the wrong people. You are amazing, ‘Drea. It’s there loss and my gain.” He says sweetly as he tucks her beneath him and brings his lips to hers. “I plan to spend the night showing you just how amazing I think you are ‘Drea.” ‘Drea stretches as she feels the arms tighten around her. Relaxing back into Nate’s arms, she relives last night and it hits her… We are STILL in the orchard, jerking up she laughs out loud. “We stayed out here all night, and we are naked.” She says as Nate’s eyes flutter open. “Looks like we did, better get up to the house before Ms. Ruthie comes huntin’” Nate teases as he grabs her dress and hands it to her with a wink. Once they are dressed, they walk up to the house where Ms. Ruthie is waiting on the porch swing peeling apples. “Mornin’ you two.” She says with a conspiratorial grin. “Grams, we were um…” ‘Drea starts. “Andrea Ruth, do you think you could possible spin a tale and make be believe anything other than what happened between you two in the orchard? Do you think Grand-dad wasn’t so smooth himself?” Ruthie says with a laugh. “Grams!” ‘Drea says blushing. Ruthie’s eyes dart to Nate lovingly, “Nathan.” She says sweetly. “Morning Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as ‘Drea pulls him into the house. “Pancakes and bacon are on the stove.” Ruthie shouts. As Nate sits digging into the pancakes and bacon, ‘Drea pours the coffee. Sitting beside him she sighs as she bites into a piece of bacon. “So are we…I mean…Um…” She starts. Nate laughs, “Yes, ‘Drea you’re my girl, that is if you want to be.” ‘Drea blushes, and then smiles. “Um, well, just like that huh?” “Guess so.” Nate says finishing his plate, he stands pulling her into him. “I like the sound of that, you ‘Drea…My girl…mine…” Crushing his lips to hers, he turns and lifts her to the counter behind her and her legs wrap around his hips. After surrendering to needing to kiss her senseless he remembers where they are… In Ms. Ruthie’s kitchen, her only grand-daughter on her counter… Jesus man you are a goner. Pulling back he smiles, “OK. I am going back to my place to change; I’ll be back in an hour to put in the display cases.” He adds as he kisses her again, and then he saunters out of the house saying goodbye to Ms. Ruthie on his way to his truck. After gathering her wits, and cleaning up the breakfast dishes, ‘Drea showers and dresses quickly. Ruthie is cooking apples when she comes into the kitchen. “Oh Sugar, you seem lighter this mornin’” “Grams, really…” ‘Drea says with a giggle. “We have calls about tomorrow all mornin’, should have a good turn-out Sugar.” Ruthie says as she starts preparing jars to can apples. “That’s great. Nate and I are going to put in the display cases today.” “Oh, so how are you and Nate, Andrea?” ‘Drea smiles, “Good Grams. He is so sweet, and makes me feel…special.” “Well, good Missy. Now, you get on, I’ve got things to get done. I’ll bring jars down later, once they have cooled.” “Grams, Nate and I will come and load up after supper.” “Alright then Sugar.” Ruthie nods as ‘Drea heads out the door and into the orchard. By the time ‘Drea walks to the store, Nate is backing the truck up to the front doors to unload the display cases. She stops, admiring the view of him stretching across the truck removing the straps holding down the cases. Will she ever tire of oogling this man and his backside? Get a grip ‘Drea, you are gawking like a pervert! Turning just in time to catch her, Nate smiles. “Hey, Sugar.” “Hey yourself.” She calls back as she turns to unlock the doors. “Need some help?” “Nope, they are lighter than they look. You should get in there and bake, Sugar.” Nate says with a grin. “Oh so one night under the stars and I am destined to be the ‘little woman in the kitchen…” She says teasing. Nate laughs, “Well hell, maybe.” He winks. “I would do anything with a donut.” ‘Drea waggles a brow, “Then I had better get to it then. I fully intend to make you work for every bite.” She winks back at him as she turns and saunters into the kitchen. Nate lays his head against the cool metal of his truck and sighs… Yep killing him…killing him… ‘Drea cranks Bon Jovi on her IPod and hooks it into the sound system; she starts mixing flour, eggs and adding all the other ingredients to the mixer. As her dough rises she starts mixing up her glaze. Singing along with ‘Always’ as she rolls out her dough, she feels arms around her waist and smiles. Nate... “They aren’t ready yet.” She teases as he nuzzles her hair. “I got the cases in, and bolted into place. You are ready to open Sugar.” “Nearly. Grams has apples at the house, jars of jelly and some other stuff.” “I’ll go get it now.” Nate says sweetly as he nuzzles her ear pulling her tight against him. Whipping around to face him he hoists her up on the counter and kisses her hard and demanding, her hands roaming up and into his hair and tugging. A cough from the front door startles them both, making ‘Drea nearly jump off the counter. “Well Andrea, I see you changed your recipe. Exactly which part of the process is this?” A man from the door says, adjusting his suit. Part Five: Sometimes you have to face the Past, in the Present, to have a Future. ‘Drea’s face falls as she takes in the man she never thought she would see again... “Phillip. How did you know where to find me? Why are you here?” She asks appalled that he has the guts to show his face now. Nate takes her hand in his and she swears she heard a growl low in his throat. Phillip stands his whole 5’10 in the door way in his expensive black tailored suit and eyes the place. His perfectly styled black hair, not one strand out of place, his brown eyes assessing his distaste for the situation. “Andrea, I was curious as to where my fiancé ran off to, I have missed you pet.” Nate eyes ‘Drea? Pet? What the hell, she isn’t a pet. “Um Nate, this is Phillip my old boss. I would say it is a pleasure Phillip but it isn’t.” ‘Drea scowls. Nate sighs, “Phillip.” Nodding icily. “Nate would you mind seeing to Grams? I will see to this and be ready to set up when you get back.” She says not taking her eyes off of Nate. “Are you sure, Sugar?” Nate asks sweetly, clearly marking his territory. “Yes Baby. It won’t take long.” “Ok.” Nate replies kissing her cheek sweetly, turns and strides out like a man on a mission. After ‘Drea shakes her head to steady herself she turns to deal with this mess. “Phillip what do you want?” She asks him as he strides over to her. “I have missed you My Pet. Why did you leave?” Phillip says as he touches her cheek. “Why? Why! I guess you and the waitress didn’t think I would mind? You could have cared less that I left you Phillip. You don’t love me and I don’t love you.” She snaps as she jerks away from him. He chuckles, “Ah Pet you are so much smarter than I give you credit for. I am a bit disappointed in the whole ‘kissing the handy man thing’ but I can forgive you.” ‘Drea closes her eyes mentally counting to ten, “Don’t call me pet. I hate than Phillip, I am not your damn pet. Why would I want your forgiveness, we are over.” Phillip laughs. He laughs! “We are far from over my pet. My father has decided that since you left, the restaurant is no longer high-priority. He is threatening to boot me and close if you don’t come back. I booked us a flight and we...” ‘Drea slams a pan across the room, “Now you listen to me, Phillip. Very carefully, I am not going back to New York, I am not working for you and I am not putting back on your ring. Now leave before I make you.” She turns to her dough and starts to roll it out and he grabs her spinning her into him pinning her against the island. “Phillip, I am warning you.” Phillip smiles, “Andrea, you have no idea what you are saying and who you are messing with. You will go back to the way things were and that is that.” He pushes against her and nuzzles her neck. “Never, Phillip I mean it. Back the hell up and NOW!” ‘Drea pushes at him and he jolts back. Not because of her force, but Nate’s. He grabs Phillip by the throat and jerks him to the door. Choking off his airway, making Phillip gasp and beg. “Nate! What are you doing?” ‘Drea gasps fearing Nate will kill him. “I am just taking out the trash Sugar, won’t be but a minute.” Nate says dragging him out the door and jerking it closed. Nate is bubbling with fury, standing outside during the conversation was nearly impossible. This egocentric ass caged her in, put his hands on her. He throws him into his car and he crumbles to the ground. Gasping for air Phillip is cursing Nate with every breath. “I will sue you. I will own you. She is my fiancé and belongs to me.” Nate growls grabbing him by the jacket and hauls him up against his shiny little BMV rental. “Now you are going to listen to me, real good. I am going to speak nice and clear, as to not confuse you.” Phillip starts to talk but Nate shakes him furiously, shutting him up. Nate continues, “You are not welcome here. She doesn’t want you here. If you decide to show up here again, I will be waiting and you will see just how handy I am asshole. Andrea is no longer your fiancée, employee, or whatever else she may have been. So get in your car and have you a real nice day.” Nate growls letting him slide down the car. Phillip gasps for breath as he climbs into his car and drives away. Nate turns and walks back into the kitchen where ‘Drea stands at the sink. “’Drea are you alright?” Nate asks as he wraps his arms around her from behind. She blows out a breath and closes her eyes, “Yes, he just tried to get his point across. He wanted me to come back and make his life easier.” ‘Drea says as she turns in his arms and he pulls her in tight. “I know Sugar.” Nate says. “You were listening?” ‘Drea asks surprised. Nate nods, “He looked like a classic douche and I wasn’t leaving you alone with him. When he got too close, I decided to remove him.” He says drawing a giggle from her. “Thank you, Nate. So...is he still alive?” ‘Drea asks as she nuzzles into the crook of his neck. “Yeah, but if he comes back we will need to plan on where to hide the body. I won’t be so polite next time.” Nate says sweetly. “He won’t be back. Phillip doesn’t love me Nate, he never did. I won’t live that way and now he knows that.” “OK, so now that you are alright. I will leave you to my donuts and I will see to Ms. Ruthie.” Nate says as he kisses her sweetly then he is gone. ‘Drea turns and starts punching out donuts and cranks up the fryer. Placing six on a plate, she boxes up the rest and sits the plate on the table just as Nate walks in. “Grams load you down?” ‘Drea asks as she pours coffee. “She sure has been busy. Sit with me...” He says pulling her into his lap, “We will set up everything up and then I am going to cook you dinner, tonight.” ‘Drea bites her lip to stifle her laugh. “You want to cook for me?” Nate kisses the tip of her nose, “Oh ye of little faith. Yes, I can cook.” “Well Nathan Kyle, there are still many things I do not know about you.” ‘Drea purrs as she watches Nate eat his donuts. Nate frowns, “It’s all hype Sugar... not much to tell.” ‘Drea new better than that, but she would let it go for now, at least. It is important for her to know him, but it isn’t like he is telling these things to everyone else. He really won’t open up to anyone and yet he is to her, little by little. Picking at her donuts she arches a brow at him, “So what are you cooking?” “Homemade pizza. Does that work for you?” He asks as he swallows the last donut in one bite. “Absolutely, one thing I loved about New York was the pizza.” After an hour of setting up the apples, jars and displays, Nate excuses himself to go into town for groceries and to change. After ‘Drea cleans the kitchen up for him, she sets the table similar to the night before, with candles. Needing to change and get ready, she leaves the door unlocked and a note: Gone to shower and change. The kitchen is all yours, see you shortly. ‘Drea She nearly skips through the orchard on her way to house. After changing into a green camisole and a jean skirt, she brushes her hair out into long black waves. Once she retouches her make-up ‘Drea slips into flip-flops and heads back to the store to meet Nate. The door to the kitchen is open and she over hears Nate and...is that Grams talking? “Ms. Ruthie you know I do...” Nate says. Does what? ‘Drea wonders, as she stands still out of view, listening. “If so, she should know about your past Nathan. She would understand. How would you expect her to share a bed with you and not know about your nightmares?” “’Drea has been through enough.” Nate snaps. “Yes she has been through a lot, but don’t use that hogwash on me Nathan. It is about give and take, she told you things I am sure.” Ruthie says back shaky. “And that’s why I can’t, why... I want to protect her Ms. Ruthie. I couldn’t bear to hurt her.” He says sounding broken. “You can’t protect and shelter her, she runs from that. I lost her for ten years. Nathan, I won’t lose her again.” Ruthie says choking on a sob. Damn it! It is a conspiracy. It wasn’t as hard for her knowing Nate wasn’t letting her in yet, but he talked to Grams... What the hell! Pissed beyond all points, she stops up into the kitchen. First, Phillip and his completely idiotic ass comes walking back into her life begging for her to come back to soothe his Daddy, then you have these two Judases! Her life is out of control and she is putting her flip-flopped foot down right now! Nate whips around and his face pales, clearly knowing she heard everything. “Well don’t stop on my account, you were only talkin’ about me.” ‘Drea says scowling at them both. “I think I will leave you two, I’ll leave the door unlocked Andrea Ruth.” “Thank you Grams.” ‘Drea replies, not taking her eyes off Nate. Nate frowns down at his hands. “Sure you can manage Ms Ruthie?” “Nate...” ‘Drea starts, interrupting whatever answer her Grams was going to give by shutting the door behind her. “What is this?” Nate meets her gaze and sighs. “Listen ‘Drea there are things about me, things that I don’t discuss.” “Obviously.” She scowls, “Unless you count Grams.” ‘Drea grabs a beer and takes a long draw. “No problem talkin’ to her huh?” “Only just because I needed to be sure you could handle it.” He starts. Throwing her hands up in exasperation ‘Drea groans, “You didn’t feel that you could trust me to handle it? Damn you Nate, no secrets, no games. Remember?” Closing the distance between them, Nate grabs her wrists. “Don’t!” She yells, jerking away, infuriated. He kept things from her and she knew it, but because he saw her as weak? She left here years ago for similar reasons; to escape the pain of losing her Momma and the pity everyone felt for her. It was etched on all their faces and it made her sick to meet anyone’s eyes. She would be damned if he would treat her as a child, as she was weak! “’Drea, please just let me explain.” Nate pleads as he reaches for her again, “You owe me that at least.” If looks could kill he knew he would be dead already. She paces around the island, “I don’t owe you anything.” ‘Drea says as she stalks out of the kitchen and into the orchard away from him. Nate’s body is shaking, he can’t lose her. He knew tonight was the night he was going to tell her everything and she was going to understand. She was going to know he loved her and that he would beg her never to leave. He never thought he would fall in love, but the moment he saw her, he was a goner. Turning off the oven he bolts from the kitchen and into the orchard after her. ‘Drea is running she lost her flip-flops in the trees somewhere and she could care less, just slowed her down. How could he keep things from her but tell Grams? How could he think he could hide from her? Swatting the angry tears from her face, she stops at the tree in the center of the orchard dropping to her knees. To the two stones she has never seen, two grave markers. ‘Drea traces the name: Franklin Westwood. “Grand-dad, what was I thinking coming back here? I can’t do this.” She sobs. “I came here to lick my wounds of my unhappy life, not gut myself again and again.” Scooting over she traces the name: Cassandra Westwood. Flopping onto her side she runs her hands in the grass of the space between the graves and cries. Nate stands just outside the clearing, as he hears ‘Drea cry into the night. His heart nearly ripping from his chest. She wants to leave. Suddenly, his chest is too tight he can’t breathe. He knows if she leaves she will take his heart and his only shot at happiness with her forever. He had been a selfish bastard to shelter her, to think she was breakable. She was the strongest, bravest woman he had ever known. She had been through so much and watched her own mother die, helpless to stop it. He coddled her like a child and he was wrong, she held him together, she made him want to be better, stronger, she made him want to be hers. He ached to be hers. Walking over to her he curls up behind her on the grass, she lay silently sobbing as he pulls her into his chest. “Ssh Sugar, I am sorry. I am so sorry.”He whispers running a hand down her hair soothing her. “’Drea look at me baby please.” He pleads. ‘Drea look up at him, her green eyes tear stained and dark. He swipes at the tears with his thumbs and sits them both up. “’Drea, I left home at nineteen, things were not great at home. My Mom was struggling financially and I knew I needed to go. My dad had died of a heart attack and she had never worked so she had a rough go finding work. So I enlisted.” “Yes, I-“‘Drea starts but Nate puts his finger to her lip. “Please let me get this out Sugar.” He says looking pained. She nods as he takes her hands, “I went into the National Guard, I specialized in Search and Rescue...and well Recovery. I watched people die ‘Drea, so many more than I could count. My team said that I would get used to it, after time it wouldn’t bother me anymore. Can you believe it ‘Drea...get used to it...” He says with a pained chuckle. “After a while though, the lives I did save, couldn’t even erase the faces of those I watched die. I got out, but I live with it every day. It haunts me ‘Drea every damn day.” Tears fill ‘Drea’s eyes again, “Oh Nate.” Shaking his head he continues, “When I came here, no one accepted me ‘Drea, except Ruthie. Then you came and turned me inside out. I wanted to tell you, ‘Drea I did. I watched strangers die Sugar, but you watched your Momma die. It was selfish of me to think you wouldn’t be able to handle it. That you couldn’t understand.” ‘Drea cups his face in her hands and kisses him. “Oh Nate, I am so sorry. Of course I understand, it took me ten years to even talk about Momma. I am sorry, I overreacted.” Everything in Nate’s body relaxes, “Oh Sugar I thought I lost you.” ‘Drea shakes her head and smiles shyly. Nate kisses her over and over again, “No secrets and no games, ‘Drea never again.” Hoisting her up in his arms, ‘Drea curls into his chest as he carries her back to the kitchen in the store. The next morning, ‘Drea wakes to her alarm at 4:45am. After dressing in jeans and an old sweatshirt of her Grand-dad’s that says ‘Westwood Orchards’ on it, she wanders into the kitchen for coffee. “Mornin’ Grams.” She murmurs into her mug as she sits at the table. “Andrea Ruth.” Ruthie nods. “Is everything settled between Nathan and you?” “Yes Ma’am.” ‘Drea sighs, “I over-reacted Grams.” Ruthie chuckles, “Love will make you do that, Sugar.” ‘Drea gasps, sputtering coffee, “I never said I-“ “You don’t have to, it is all over your face, and his as well.” Ruthie says with a knowing wink. “I went to see Momma and Grand-dad last night Grams.” ‘Drea says changing the subject. “Oh, did you?” Ruthie asks, knowing that ‘Drea had never been there since her Cassandra’s funeral. ‘Drea nods. “I should have done it long ago, Grams. I was being selfish and cowardly. I blamed myself for so long and I-“‘Drea says on a sob. Ruthie jerks her eyes up. “Andrea Ruth! How dare you take the blame for something that was in God’s design. You shouldn’t have lived with all that built up in you all these years Sugar.” “I know that now Grams. Now come on we have a store to open.” “Yes, we do Sugar.” Ruthie says as they walk out the door and head up to the orchard in ‘Drea’s car. Part Six: Phillip’s Last Stand. ‘Drea loads the display cases with cakes, pies, donuts, and cobblers. Displays of Ms. Ruthie’s canning and jellies are set out, along with baskets of fruit from the orchard. A knock on the door, startles them all. “We aren’t open yet.” ‘Nate yells as he hauls a box in, turning he nearly drops it as there in the doorway stands Phillip. “I see you wanted to see how handy I am.” Nate growls sitting the box down. “Actually,” He starts as he holds his hands up in silent surrender. “I came here to talk to Andrea.” He says looking at her, “Pet, can we...” He starts then jumps as the laugh roars out of Ms. Ruthie’s throat. “Pet? Oh I know you didn’t call my Grand-daughter, your damn pet.” She roars. “Grams, I can handle this.” ‘Drea says ushering Phillip out the door, to his car.” “Listen, Phillip you have exactly ten seconds to say whatever it is you have to say and get the hell out of here before those two...” She gestures to the door where Nate and Ruthie stand watching like hawks. “Well, they know how to hide the bodies...if you understand.” He nods, “Listen Pet, Um I mean Andrea. I am sorry. I never knew what I had until you were gone. I need you, I want you. Please come back, run the restaurant, be mine.” “Phillip. I can’t, I want more.” She whispers. He gawks at her like she has grown two heads, “More? God Pet I would give you the world, anything, everything.” He pulls her into his arms and crushes his lips to hers. Nate and Ruthie are yelling and cursing from the doorway, as ‘Drea pushes Phillip away. “Phillip, I’m not in love with you. My Grandparents had love, passion and...magic. God Phillip that is what I want... I want to love, I want to ache for the man I love... and that’s-“ Phillip sighs, “That’s not me.” ‘Drea nods smiling sweetly. “So it is the handy man then. You are in love with him?” ‘Drea nods, “Yes, Nate...his name is Nate and yes Phillip I love him.” Phillip sighs, “I guess that’s that then. I can’t fight for your heart when you already gave it away, Pet. I am so sorry for the way I treated you Andrea, I took you for granted. I didn’t value you for the amazing person you are and that is my loss. I am so glad you didn’t let my mistakes damage you. I will always love you Andrea and just know that if he better be good to you Andrea.” “Phillip, I forgive you. You were no happier than I and well I have let it all go.” She says and he smiles at her fondly, kisses her again and gets into his car and leaves. Nate stands in bewilderment... He kissed her twice...Twice... She nodded and smiled at him sweetly. What the hell? Was she going back with him? Shaking it off he goes back to hauling the boxes and stocking shelves. The store was opening and there were already people looking around. He would deal with his broken heart later. There was not a second to spare, between serving customers, boxing up items and carrying to the cars, they were all busy. It seemed like the whole town maybe the whole county had showed up to see the Orchard back and thriving. Nate caught gazes of ‘Drea, she looked blissfully happy. He couldn’t help but be a little sad at that. He gave this woman his heart and she didn’t even know it yet. She could leave without knowing it. Would it change her mind if she did know? By noon, the entire store is cleared out, Nate switches the sign to closed and ‘Drea sinks to the floor. “We did it Grams!” “Oh Sugar, your Grand-dad would be so proud of you.” Ruthie says as she sits in a chair. “Of us, Grams.” ‘Drea says as she stands dusting off her jeans. “Grams, can you get back up to the house alright? There is something I want to do...” “Even an old woman can take a hint. I will see you both for supper?” “Yes, Ma’am.” They reply in unison. Part Seven: Finality. Nate sits in the passenger seat of ‘Drea’s car as they wind up the old mountain road. What was he thinking? After Grams had left, ‘Drea had said they needed to talk and that needed to drive so he all but agreed. He knew what was coming, bracing for the heartache he blows out a breath. “Where are we going? You haven’t left the orchard since you have been home.” “That’s right.” ‘Drea says glancing at him with a smile, “We are going somewhere special, Nate.” ‘Drea drives up the old road methodically, her head spinning. It hadn’t taken so long for her to realize that she had fallen in love with Nate. Phillip’s visit just made her sure. She wanted to desperately to tell him before, last night in fact. Nate had secrets though, deep secrets that haunted him just as hers did. Now that they were all out in the open, she wouldn’t run anymore. ‘Drea had to tell him, had to know for sure and if he ran ‘Drea might crumble. Pulling up on a shoulder, Nate’s eyes grow wide; there is nothing but a broken guard rail. ‘Drea shuts off the engine, walks over and sits on the edge of the broken rail. As Nate sits next to her, she leans on his shoulder. “After ten years, you would think they would just fix the damn rail.” She says shaking her head in disbelief. “Jesus, ‘Drea this is where—“ She nods as he pulls her into his arms. “I wanted a new beginning; I had to come here to close this chapter first.” She says, tears filling her voice. Nate’s heart breaks for her as he runs a hand up and down her back. “I miss her so much Nate, damn it I miss her so much.” “Oh Baby.” Nate whispers, kissing her hair. “I didn’t let myself remember. It hurt too much. This whole time it was holding me back. I’m ready to move on now Nate.” All of a sudden his gut tightened. She is leaving. Nate feels sick, oh after all he had hoped for she was moving on. Without him. ‘Drea kisses him, stopping his thoughts. “Yeah.” He says shaking his head to clear his thoughts. “Well, I guess now that the orchard is making money again you will be—“ ‘Drea looks up at him wide-eyed, “You think I am leaving?” Nate’s eyes widen to match hers and she continues, “Nate, I brought you here because this is where my world stopped ten years ago. It is time to let it start turning again. Today, was the best day of my life. This is what I was meant to do.” Nate shakes his head...confused, “What about Phillip?” ‘Drea laughs, “Oh Nate, Grams and you should learn to eavesdrop better. We talked and there is nothing there. We said our goodbyes and that is that. I am not in love with him I told him that. The orchard is magical Nate, I have always thought so. It may sound dumb...” “No it doesn’t ‘Drea. There is so much love there.” Nate says stroking her hair away from her face. “I found myself again Nate. For ten years I ran from who I was. I am a Westwood. I am bossy, determined, I dream, believe in magical orchard, that dessert can solve all problems, and in anger I lose my ‘gs’.” Nate smiles. Taking a deep breath, she blurts “And, I love you Nate.” Nate’s eyes fly open wide. “What was that?” ‘Drea giggles, “I love you Nathan Kyle. I never expected to find all the missing pieces of my heart, but you put them all back in place.” Nate takes in all she has said and smiles, “Oh Sugar, you surprise me every day. I need you ‘Drea, I love you. You push the darkness back with your beauty Andrea. From the moment I saw you lying in the grass looking up at the clouds, hell I may have loved you even then.” He stands pulling her into his arms, spinning her. “You know we will have it all, don’t you Sugar? We can marry in the orchard, walk there every night, raise a family, and keep Ms. Ruthie on her toes.” Eyes teary, ‘Drea smiles at him. “Yes Nate we will.” ‘Drea says as she kisses Nate, knowing in her heart that she found her magic.",
