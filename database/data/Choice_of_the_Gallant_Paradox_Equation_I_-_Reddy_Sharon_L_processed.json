      "content": "Chapter One \"That one?\" \"Yes, My Lord. A pretty thing.\" \"Yes, and he seems to have more spirit than the others. Do you suppose it's their long lives that make them weak?\" \"They call themselves civilized. I find them boring. They live millennia and never live at all. Lord, the instruments say his mind is worth harnessing.\" \"Excellent. Buy him.\" \"He is expensive. He's the scion of one of their great houses.\" \"Very nice. I've never owned a king before. I think I'll just take the one. He will fill all three roles. That should make Lord Rorisk take note.\" \"A charming idea. He'll require intense physical training. It will reduce his useful time in the mind/comp link.\" \"And enhance his beauty. A fair trade. Stim him.\" \"Temporary?\" \"No. In fact, give him all four of the stimulation's. Let's see if they work on this weak-willed race.\" \"Do you wish the experiment documented?\" \"Of course. Wipe his name carefully, Demisk.\" \"And what shall I put in its place?\" \"Nothing. Leave him nameless. Leave his knowledge of his station among his people, if possible.\" \"A nameless, wanton, king. My Lord, you have a wonderful humor.\" **** \"Gallant.\" He moaned softly in his sleep. She had come again. \"Take heart, Gallant. You will free them all. Learn, my gallant one. Do all they ask. Build for them. That which they seek is their destruction and freedom for this world. Build. Come to me.\" He awoke in desperate need of her. The emptiness she left, he could only suffer. He carefully hid the name she called him. He would not share the gift she had given until his people were free. He grasped her promise of freedom and fought to stay alive. He heard them coming again. \"Well, Demisk?\" \"Amazing! He's stronger! My Lord, none of the others have been successful. He's the only one that's lived through the first stim.\" \"I've made several large wagers he'll survive all four. Give him his reward for surviving. Document it carefully. I'll show the record at the banquet.\" \"Take him to room three. How many, Lord?\" \"Ten of the stimmed oriki. Hungry ones.\" He lowered his fevered body into the swirling waters of the pool set in one corner of the room. The chain on the collar he wore was just long enough to reach it. A reward for surviving? What were oriki? What were the multitude of holographic lenses set in the walls and ceiling to record? He hated the collar and its chain. He wondered if they knew. He'd never hated before the stim. He smiled softly. It was probably a side effect. Side effects were dangerous. He intended they learn the fact well. \"Hello, pretty thing. Come out of the pool.\" \"I'd rather not.\" \"We are in need of you. Won't you aid us?\" \"Who are you?\" \"We are women of the oriki. Help us.\" \"I'm currently not much help to myself.\" \"Oh, but you will be of great aid to us. Come.\" He really didn't have any choice. Three of the women were pulling on the chain on his collar. There were ten of them. They were quite beautiful; long dark hair, large green eyes, and skin of pale aqua. He didn't understand what was happening to his body. It must be due to the stim. One of the women touched him. \"Please, I don't understand what's happening. Please, don't touch me.\" \"Foolish boy, you are a slave. As are we. You have no choices.\" **** \"Where did you find him?\" \"In the market.\" \"Then he's of high rank. Responds well.\" \"He's been stimmed, Rorisk.\" \"Stimmed?! Hensk, none of these soft people survive stim.\" \"This one has. It's fully documented. I'll arrange a private showing for you.\" \"Hensk, you're after a favor. What is it?\" \"I'm going to enter him in the combats, if he survives the entire set of stims. I want your trainer to teach him.\" \"Leave him while I watch the documentation. If he survives, I'll lend you my trainer.\" \"Demisk, have him prepared for Lord Rorisk.\" **** \"He has potential, Master Demisk.\" \"My lord believes so. He has survived all the stims.\" \"Good. Too often, I'm given ones to train that have only had the body stimmed. Combat is as much of the mind. Do I have his full time, or is he in other use?\" \"He is, but my lord will reduce his link time with the computers to three hours per day during his training.\" \"Reduce?! How much is he on now?\" \"Twenty-two hours. He is given four of rest.\" \"He may be interesting to train. I ask the lord schedule his link time with regularity. It will aid his training.\" \"He has already done so. You have him but the first three hours of the day.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk. Good. Now that he's gone, let's get acquainted. Do you have a name?\" \"No. It was taken.\" \"Sounds like Hensk. Been pretty heavily used, haven't you, boy?\" \"Since I haven't had a chance to compare notes with anyone, I've got no basis to judge, but I definitely have been busy.\" \"Hold still. I'm going to look you over. Now, now, don't tense. I won't hurt... Oh, I see. A blush. You've not been broken by it. You'll learn control.\" \"That would be much appreciated. Just once I'd like to... \" \"Not respond to every touch instantly.\" \"It would be pleasant not to have my body temperature rise at a tap on the shoulder.\" \"And if I teach you to fight, what will you do?\" \"Fight.\" \"Yes, you'll do.\" They became friends. The old trainer had been seeking someone like him for a very long time. He held his dream of freedom in his heart and trained the boy. Lord Hensk had made an error. He had created a hero. The old trainer would teach him to be a warrior. **** \"What effect did the last three stims have on you?\" \"None that I could tell. No, one. I'm faster, but that may be due to the training. \"Yes. I don't think any of them worked. Well, the first lowered your thresholds, but that's all. Have you always been different from the rest of your people? \"Trainer, I am a child. I don't know. I have no other children to compare myself with, though I know I am quite large for my age.\" \"A child?\" \"Yes, I am but... I do not know my years, but perhaps I can give you information which is useful to you. Ah, I know. The first stim. It nearly killed me. I was far too young to have sexual maturity forced on me.\" \"You were prepubescent?!\" \"Very. At what age does your species mature?\" \"About fourteen.\" \"Then I was a child of... This is difficult. I lost so much when my name was taken. I am of a great house. None would have spoken to me without my name and title and the taking of it... I know that I am very young. Perhaps, between twenty and thirty. In comparison with your people... physically nine or ten. I had no body hair until the stim. I'm still a bit smug about it.\" \"Oh, my son, the cruelty of what was done to you makes me ache.\" \"Don't. There's already too much pain around me.\" \"Boy, I've seen the documentation of the first stim.\" \"That was an interesting experience. I had no idea what those women wanted.\" \"It didn't take you long to learn.\" \"I learn fast. Trainer, I like this weapon. Its simplicity... attracts me.\" \"The staff? Yes, I like it too. A simple wooden shaft. Boy, I can't pretend to teach you longer. You know all I know.\" \"Thank you. I'll use it well.\" \"You know I won't return. My master is already unhappy he gave Hensk my use.\" \"Strange. At the time, he seemed to feel your use for mine was a fair exchange.\" \"Lean near. When you destroy them, let me kill Rorisk for what he did to you.\" He smiled at his only friend. \"I love you too. And I promise I'll remember. Thank you.\" **** \"Master, the direct mind link obstructs my work.\" \"In what way?\" \"It tells me the lord seeks the impossible. I know it is incorrect. I can vision it, but in the link, I know the vision is incorrect. I ask to use the physical station. I cannot override the computational limits while the matrices hold my mind.\" \"The link has been known to limit creativity. I will put your request to the lord.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk.\" \"He is pleased with you. Your sweep of the combats has made him the envy of his peers. They have requested you be provided at tonight's banquet. Entertain them well. Go to the preparation chamber. The attendants await you. Now, boy!\" \"Yes, Master.\" He ran to the chamber. He'd hesitated. That kind of mistake could cost him his life. \"Entertain them\" meant Rorisk was coming. He was so close to the answer. He had to get out of the link. He didn't intend his master to have what he would build. Or, not all of what he would build. The link would give him away, note the discrepancy in his request. She had come again and told him to build the twelve plus one. The plus-one was to be his. The attendants prepared him and he learned he had been right. Rorisk was at the banquet. \"He doesn't respond as well.\" \"Rorisk, he was fresh stimmed. Although, it may be the link. It is draining.\" \"Better. It just took a bit. How much time does he spend in it?\" \"Twenty-two per day.\" \"That's twice recommended!\" \"Yes, but other than slowing his response, it's had no ill effects. I have him on project three. I expect results within a twelveday.\" \"If you get them, you'll get a ministry.\" \"I'd get one eventually without it. I'm more interested in the project itself. I need a very rare element to complete it. I wish an interview with your uncle.\" \"The emperor?! You must be very sure you'll succeed.\" \"This one is. Aren't you, boy.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Hensk, project three is a dream. No one really expects it to be completed. The tools don't exist.\" \"You are touching the tool I created to build it. His mind is like no other. Before the stim, he was over the tenth rank of intelligence.\" \"OVER! Impossible! Nothing in existence is over the tenth rank.\" \"He is. On both scales, physical and mental. Unique in the universe. Are you pleased to know that, boy?\" \"No, Lord Master.\" \"Why not?\" \"It means I am alone.\" \"Very good. Yes, without another of your kind, but I shall solve that for you. I'm having females of your species prepared. You wish to speak?\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Speak.\" \"There are no females of my species. My Lord Master has told me I am unique.\" \"Very good. Very good. Consider yourself as being bred to another species.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" **** \"I will return, Kirel.\" \"From the photosphere of a star? And if you do succeed, why would you come back? You could be free.\" \"And leave my children?\" \"Are they yours? They're not like you. They're merely children of my race. You've never even seen them. They're just a few among many. A failed breeding. You couldn't find them if you searched.\" \"Then I will claim all children as mine.\" \"You'll claim nothing. You're a nameless slave. Haven't the ten years you've been one taught you anything?\" \"Yes. They've taught me patience.\" **** \"Hensk, you're a fool. He'll never return.\" \"Wrong, Rorisk. He thinks he has children here. He believes, if he succeeds, I'll give them to him.\" \"And he has no children?\" \"None. He's not mature yet. The physicians estimate it will be hundreds of years before he's capable of siring offspring. I had them change his genetic structure. His children will ripen far sooner, but it will still be hundreds of years before he sires them. The first thing I shall do with project three is collect them. Perhaps, I'll give them to him. Did your uncle grant my request?\" \"Yes. Five point two akits of the element will be sent to you. In return, he will receive eleven of the machines.\" \"I shall need only one. Did he speak of his plans for them?\" \"Yes. He'll use them to direct the evolution of the recalcitrant worlds.\" \"Excellent. The yumari are beautiful. I shall enjoy having them as obedient slaves.\" \"His thought exactly. When we decide we want them, they'll surrender without a struggle. He's already chosen his agents.\" \"The priests of Denskarra?\" \"Hensk, you astound me. Yes, the dark brothers. They have pledged to do as he requests in this galaxy if he gives them freedom to do as they wish in the others.\" \"The servants of the Dark One will cleanse the universe of life. I am not sure I trust them to allow life in this one.\" \"He pointed out, if they destroyed it here, they would not exist and would be unable to cleanse it elsewhere.\" \"Our emperor is a wise and devious man.\" \"Yes. My uncle serves the Dark One well.\" **** \"Lord Master, the time ships are complete.\" \"You wish a reward. Speak it.\" \"I ask for my children, Lord Master.\" \"With this ship, I have the power to grant your request. You have no children in this time. So I shall find them in another and bring them to you. You are a nameless slave. Your children shall be the same.\" \"NO!\" He broke free of his guards and ran. He heard Hensk's laughter mocking him. Slaves could not escape. There was nowhere to escape to. He ran by the keyboard and triggered the mechanism. He had little time before it engaged. He dove into the corner and laughed, as he closed the matrix. He had an escape. The thirteenth ship formed around him. Now to free a world and distract the dark brothers. The mechanism engaged. The oldest race stepped from their suddenly opened cells and walked away from the guards holding useless weapons. The power satellites were torches in the sky. The densk fled the crumbling city. Fled to ships that would not fly. The one they had been given to free them had completed his task. They were really very proud of him. They hadn't expected him to accomplish it for several hundred years. The child had freed his foster parents while still an infant. The slaves of other races extracted revenge. An old man happily told Rorisk why he was strangling him. The densk disappeared from the planet. One scream at a time. When they were gone, the elder race sent four to restore the ships. The freed of other races had transport home. They would free their worlds. All that would remain of the servants of the Dark One that had infested their galaxy were the eleven priests and the one lord. The child would keep them from inflicting great harm. They tapped the energy source he had created and engaged the great defenses that had been awaiting it. They reached into the mind of the child with the key they had been given and freed his powers. **** \"Gallant, you are not forever alone. I await beyond time. You will find my aspects, but you must search. Each will give you love, but you will leave two and one shall leave you. They do not know I am within them. I await you. My fathers love you. Look for me. Know me by my name. Athena.\" \"ATHENA!\" He awoke at the sound of his own shout. He pulled himself to the console. He must complete the ship. The formless space around him was dizzying. He began programming a reality within it. He wanted much more than he had given the other twelve ships he'd created. He wondered if those who had them would ever realize he had deliberately made them small, boxy, and very noisy. Would they ever know infinity lay behind the noisy walls of the inaccessible engine room? The thought of Hensk trying to sleep in the tiny cabin with the roar of the engines ringing in his ears pleased him. He poured his dreams into the program. All the rooms he'd dreamed. All the gardens he'd only imagined. All the laboratories, studios, pools, the libraries and the banks and banks of computer storage he would someday fill. He gave his ship an exterior reality, then built the program to dematerialize it to land. He smiled. He doubted any of the twelve in the timeships he'd built would look beyond to see what the power to dematerialize truly meant. He laughed when he noticed he'd found a way to create little pockets of timelessness. They'd be very handy. He began programming the life support structure and gravity. He'd found he didn't care for weightlessness. He entered the last command. The ship would gather information from all available sources. He leapt onto the console. It would be the only stable item. Even the floor, chair, and bubble of atmosphere he'd created would be changed. He leaned down and tapped the pad to run the program. He wandered through the ship. He kept getting lost. He loved it. His existence had been limited to a corridor of cells, an arena, link room, preparation room and Hensk's banquet halls. He vaguely remembered wide streets and green lands. He tried to remember his mother, but no image would come. He had one clear memory of learning at a station and a man's smile and nod he had done well. He knew he was very young and from a great house, but that was all. Hensk had taken his name, and with it, every voice that had ever spoken it. **** \"Hey! You're stepping on my tulips!\" \"Oh! I'm sorry. I was looking at--\" \"Whoa! Are you all right?\" \"I really doubt it. Can you understand me?\" \"That's a very strange question. Of course I can. Look you'd better sit down. Here. Lawn chair. Would a glass of water help?\" \"Thank you, Mistress.\" \"You sit right there and I'll go in and get you one.\" Julie sighed as she walked into the house. An angel had just tromped her tulips, swayed dizzily when she spoke to him, then been totally amazed when she offered him a chair and a glass of water. Typical Saturday in LA. Too bad he was on something. When she carried the water out, he was staring down at the city from the middle of her tulip bed again. \"You're in my tulips.\" \"I've been very careful not to step on them. It's murky. Smells awful.\" \"The air or the water?\" \"The air, but I think the water may qualify as well.\" \"Out of towner. Tourist?\" \"Definitely.\" \"Yeah, the LA smog is pretty intense the first time. You get used to it. Today's not bad. Pretty good onshore flow.\" \"You've got to be joking! The hydrocarbon by-products are absolutely noxious! Fossil fuel?\" \"You're beginning to make me nervous.\" \"Probably not half as nervous as I am. I'm sorry. I'll leave. Your tulips attracted me, then I saw the view... Yes, I should definitely leave. Would you answer one more very strange question? What's the name of this world?\" \"You're the most gorgeous man I've ever seen and you're crazy. Just my luck. The world is Earth. Now go before your keepers tromp my tulips trying to catch you.\" \"Yes, I should get back to my ship. She'll have most of the information I need by now. Thank you for your kindness, Lady.\" \"Hold it. You're bleeding.\" \"Yes, but it's minor. One of the dark brothers found me too far from my ship. It's the first time I ever made that mistake. I shall not make it again.\" \"Sit down. I'll clean it up. Who'd you run into? One of the Bloods? I've seen them in the neighborhood.\" \"Bloods?\" \"Gangs. Where are you from, anyway?\" \"Somehow, I doubt you'd believe me.\" \"Try me.\" \"Well, I'm eight galaxies and several hundred years from my home world.\" \"You're right. I don't believe you. That knock on the head shook something loose. I'll probably be sorry I did this, but come inside and I'll get you... What are you doing?\" \"Listening. RUN! Don't argue!\" He grabbed her hand, then scooped her up and carried her. They'd found him already. Somehow, they were tracking him. He dodged the beam fire and ran for his ship. The Earth girl was hardly a hindrance. She was very light. He thanked the Powers he hadn't locked his ship. He ran through the door, slammed it and dematerialized. Since they were tracking him, it made no sense to leave. \"LOOK OUT!\" He spun and saw the girl on the back of the hooded figure of a dark brother. She'd saved his life. Now he needed to save hers. She'd kept the brother from using his weapon, but she was merely a temporary hindrance. He ran to aid her. When the dark one struck her, something happened inside him. He screamed in rage and killed it. He began to shake in reaction and shock. Julie was kind of surprised she woke up. The guy in the hood didn't look like he was going to. Necks didn't bend like that. She realized she was hearing whimpering. Soft, terrified, crying. It was her angel. He was curled in a corner. \"Shh. It's all right. You got him. He can't hurt us now.\" \"I... I killed him. I didn't intend it, but he hit you. I lost control. He really didn't have a chance. He was helpless and I killed him.\" \"Helpless?! He was trying very hard to fry you with that gun! If I hadn't yelled, he'd have succeeded! You saved your life and probably mine! You've... never killed anything before, have you? Nothing.\" \"I've never seen anything die.\" \"I hope I wake up and find out this is all pepperoni pizza. Look, I'm Julie. What's your name.\" \"I haven't got one. They took it.\" She decided to call it pepperoni pizza and get on with it. It was either that or have screaming meemies. \"Who took it?\" \"The Lord Master's servants. He never allowed me to have one. It pleased him to use me nameless.\" \"All right. From the top. Where are we?\" \"My ship.\" \"And where did you get the ship?\" \"I built it. I built all the ships.\" \"Who did you build the ships for?\" \"My master. It was my labor of twelve years.\" \"And who was this master?\" \"Lord Hensk.\" \"The one who took your name? So, why'd you work for him?\" \"The question is meaningless to me?\" \"Why'd you work for some creep that... took your name?\" \"I was too young to wish to die. Nameless ones were only fed if the master remembered to order it. My master usually remembered.\" \"Wait a minute. Are you talking about... slavery?\" \"Yes, but I ended it. I burned out the power satellites. I fed the power of the star I harnessed through them. Without power, weapons would not work and locks would open. The servants of the Dark One could not have stopped my people leaving.\" \"So you started a slave revolt and your people got rid of these servant guys.\" \"No. They would have just left. Although, some of the other imprisoned species may have destroyed them. My trainer wanted to kill his master. Perhaps I am guilty of two deaths. I told him thank you, instead of no.\" \"If you freed them, why didn't you stay?\" \"I had set twelve servants of the Dark One loose in the universe. I decided, if they were chasing me, they'd be too busy to destroy unsuspecting worlds. I must find his ship and destroy it.\" \"I was right the first time. You're an angel. A complete innocent. Well, LA can change that in a hurry. Why am I doing this? Come on. Let's get you some survival skills. Wait a minute. I'm not thinking straight. Where are his friends?\" \"Friends?\" \"Yeah. You know. The ones that took potshots at us on the hill.\" \"Oh, that was him. He just kept landing a few seconds further in the future and trying again, then he went back to the past and laid an ambush in here.\" \"I see. He had a time machine.\" \"That's what the ships are. It's why I have to keep the dark brothers busy.\" She giggled. She just couldn't help it. She was sitting on the floor of a good-size room, that couldn't be in her yard, talking in calm tones about a dead man that hopped around in a time machine, built by an angel, who... Too much. \"All right. Are any more likely to show up?\" \"No. I don't know how he followed me. When I locate his ship, I hope to learn.\" \"OK, let's find his ship. What do you want to do with him?\" \"Leave him. My ship will dispose of him. He is a... contaminant. She'll feel the evil and rid herself of it.\" \"She didn't before.\" \"But he was alive then. He isn't now.\" \"Now stop that. No more crying. Ship, get that thing out of here. WOW! Did I do that?\" \"I think she agreed with you.\" \"I feel like Alice in Wonderland. Come on, little white wabbit. Let's find a ship and then you'll only have eleven chasing you.\" \"I hadn't thought of that. What's a wabbit?\" She had pepperoni pizza delivered. It just seemed appropriate. He loved it. **** \"You have to have a name.\" \"I like Wabbit.\" \"No. That's just between us. Hasn't anyone ever called you anything but--ooh, I hate this-- slave, or boy?\" \"Only in a dream. I once said I would use the name if I freed my world.\" \"Well, don't you think it's time you dusted it off and stuck it on?\" \"Julie, I like this world. Your people have wonderful ways to say things. 'Yo, bro.' 'Hey, dude.' 'What's shakin'?' So many greetings.\" \"The name.\" \"I've never said it before.\" \"And you never will, at this rate. Say it.\" \"Gallant.\" \"Yes! Perfect! It fits you. Belongs. See, you did know your name. OK, Gallant, you've watched four days of TV. You understand the difference between fiction and reality and you have a name. Want to meet some people? Don't look so shocked. I'm dying to show you off. You're an incredible blond hunk. Just one thing. Don't dance slow with anyone but me. Two heartbeats would land you in some government research lab. Probably in pieces.\" \"E.T.\" \"Yeah, E.T. all the way. Did you figure it out? Why we understand each other?\" \"Yes, but I'm afraid to tell you.\" \"Why?\" \"E.T.\" \"Gallant, I doubt you'll send me running to the gov at this point.\" \"I'm a telepath.\" \"Yeah. Makes sense. Why haven't you... read anyone?\" \"That would be very impolite!\" \"Yep. Gallant. Change clothes. Not here! In the bedroom.\" She shook her head and laughed. Carla would never believe she'd stopped a beautiful man from stripping in front of her. She wasn't sure she believed it. It was the innocence. It made him seem like a child. \"Wow! I think I bought those jeans a bit small. They look like they were sprayed on.\" \"They said, 'shrink to fit,' so I used hot water and air to make them smaller. Perhaps I should have stopped after the first wash, but they didn't look like the ones you wear.\" \"Caught. Come on, gorgeous, let's go strut our tight pants.\" **** \"Get away from him, or I'll break your limp wrist.\" \"Ooh, aren't you the possessive one.\" \"Gallant? Hey, you! Come back here a minute!\" \"Look, Missy, I am not… He looks like he's in shock.\" \"I think he was badly abused.\" \"I think you're right. Let's see if this works. Take his hand and gently massage it. See if you can get his attention.\" The rather attractive man sat down on the floor in Gallant's line of sight. It was obviously for a reason. It was going to leave a large dirty smudge on his immaculate white pants. It surprised her a bit when he assumed lotus position and closed his eyes. They were beginning to attract attention. Gallant suddenly blinked and turned to look at her and she sighed in relief. \"Gallant! Are you OK?\" \"Yes. Just a bad memory.\" \"I'm sorry I brought it back. I'm Chuck.\" \"Gallant, tell Chuck he's forgiven.\" \"Forgiven. No, wait. Thank you for the compliment, Chuck, but I like girls.\" \"Thanks, Chuck.\" \"You're more than welcome, Julie. I have a friend to tell her 'technique' worked. I'll have some friends help watch pushy types don't head this way. There are a few.\" \"I like this world.\" \"World?\" \"L.A.'s pretty far out, Chuck. Different world.\" \"Especially this part of it. Julie, the Boulevard might not have been the best place to bring him.\" \"Yes it was, Chuck. Anyplace else, we wouldn't have met you. Right, Gallant?\" \"Yes. It was nice meeting you, Chuck.\" \"Never met anyone whose name fit better. Later.\" \"He liked my name, Julie. He thought it fit.\" \"Yeah. He liked the way your pants fit, too.\" \"Yes. That too.\" She burst into giggles and he smiled. \"I felt you both calling me, Julie. He was… very focused.\" \"I noticed that lotus position was practiced.\" \"Dance with me. I've watched. I know who you think looks well. I won't look foolish and embarrass you.\" \"You peeked.\" \"Only at your face as you watched them. You see? It made you mistrust me.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Forgive me?\" \"I will, if you dance with me.\" \"Blackmail. I love it.\" \"I learn quickly. **** \"Gallant, get your head back in the van.\" \"Your moon is so beautiful. I've never seen a more beautiful world.\" \"How many have you seen?\" \"Hundreds, but this is the first I landed on with people. I'm glad. Humans are wonderful!\" \"You're bombed out of your mind.\" \"Julie, can we stop? I want to walk in the moonlight by the sea.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind. There's a beach I like just ahead, Leo Carillo. We'll go home through Topanga Canyon after daybreak. Want to show you some forest. We'll nap in the back of the van. Gallant, I've got to go back to work Monday. My vacation's over.\" \"I know. You've been looking at the calendar and sighing for two days. I'm glad I tromped your tulips on your vacation. You've been a wonderful teacher. YES!\" She laughed and turned the lights off. He'd been out and running for the beach before she'd gotten the brake on. She grabbed a jacket for herself and a blanket for him. She just knew he was going to get wet. She ran after him. His laughter stopped her cold. It was... wild. She sat down in the sand and cried for him. He'd been caged for so long. His spirit was just learning to be free. \"You're crying. What did I do?\" \"Not you, Gallant. The past.\" \"My past. Your tears are for me. May I kiss you?\" \"I'd like it very much.\" \"You'll... \" \"What is it?\" \"You'll have to teach me how.\" She decided he had a gift for understatement. He learned very fast. **** \"Julie... \" \"You're leaving.\" \"I never said good-by before. It hurts.\" \"Yes, it does. Gallant, don't forget me.\" \"Never. Julie, may I come back someday? Take you dancing? Show you all I've learned?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"One year from the day I tromped your tulips. Is it a date?\" \"I'll mark it on the calendar. See you March Eighth, Nineteen Ninety-one.\" \"In your tulips.\" \"I'll be there.\" **** Gallant knew how much he still had to learn. Of course he chose Earth as the place to learn it. \"All right, Mike, what are you laughing about?\" \"Clara, I've been drafted. It seems I'm about to go to war.\" \"You're the last decent young man in this neighborhood. The young ladies will miss you.\" \"Oh, I'll be back. The war won't last too much longer. We'll beat them.\" \"When do you report?\" \"By the day after tomorrow, but I'm going to the recruiter today.\" \"Give the Kaiser a punch on the nose for me.\" \"I will, Clara. Would it be all right if I left my things here?\" \"Of course. You've become more like family than a boarder in the last two years. The only family I've got. Outlived all the others. Mike, if I'm not here when you get back, the place is yours.\" \"Clara... \" \"Now don't argue. I did it months ago. I've got no one else to give it to.\" \"Thank you. I love you, too.\" \"Oh, go on. Say good-by to all the pretty young things you squire around.\" She died before he got back to the big house in Chicago. He signed the documents that had been awaiting the return of 'Sergeant Gallant' and took possession. He aired out the closed house, repaired the damage two years of emptiness had caused and settled into life in the time known as the roaring twenties. He began establishing the identity of a nephew. He'd need it before too many years passed. He talked about his nephew a great deal to the others at his place of employment and the people on his beat. He'd gotten the job by a bit of hypnosis. The physician who checked him hadn't noticed his two hearts. He became one of Chicago's finest and helped fight the lawlessness of the gangs. **** He dragged himself from the lake and sought shelter from the biting wind. They'd disposed of the 'body' of Detective Gallant in their usual effective manner. He almost hadn't gotten out of the chains they'd weighted him with in time. It had been very close. He dragged his shattered body to the shelter of an empty beach house and sank into trance. He hadn't been hurt as badly since Hensk had dropped a building on him. When he left the house more than a month later, he was nearly an inch taller. He carefully replaced all the food he'd used, then went to collect his inheritance. Mitchell Gallant looked a lot like his uncle Mike. He needed a place to live. So many had lost everything when the great drought had turned dreams to dust. **** \"Mitch, that laugh of yours sends chills through me. It's... I don't know. Wild. Crazy.\" \"Yeah, I've been told that before. You guys stay here. I'm going to see if I can get close enough to lob a grenade into that machine gun nest. You'll know if I make it.\" \"Sarge, be careful.\" \"Always am. I like being alive.\" \"Jesus, Joey, do you think he really believes that?\" \"Mac, I gave up second guessing the sarge a year ago. I just wait for his eyes to go glittery, then duck.\" \"Sometimes I think he's crazy. Especially when he laughs like that.\" \"If he's crazy, it's the best kind. We've been in practically every battle in Europe and he's kept all of us alive. All but Smitty.\" \"The guy I replaced?\" \"Yeah, kid. The only one the sarge ever lost. Sat and cried when he got hit, then took apart the patrol that got him. Never seen anything like it. Look, one thing you gotta' know. None of us talk about the sarge. We don't mention the things he does. He wants it that way. He'll keep you alive, kid. So just you don't say nothin' about him. Ever.\" \"But he's a hero. He should get promoted and decorated.\" \"You make a fuss, someone'll check him out. He don't want that and, if you're smart, neither do you.\" \"Why? What's wrong with him?\" \"Nothin's wrong with him. He's as good a man as ever lived. Better than any I ever met. Just don't talk about him.\" \"Man, you're serious, aren't you? Why, Joey?\" \"'Cause he ain't human. We all know. We seen him get near blown apart. We kept quiet and hid him 'til he healed. Took near a month, but we managed to cover for him. You don't believe me. OK, watch. Go on. You ever seen a man run that fast?\" \"Jesus! What is he?!\" \"An angel. Our very own guardian angel. Anzio to Omaha. Now, kid, you gonna' keep quiet?\" Mac looked around at the men in the ditch with him. They were waiting for his answer. \"I didn't see anything to talk about. Just a real good sergeant I was lucky to get.\" He smiled as the men around him grinned and turned back to watch \"a real good sergeant\" take out the enemy gun emplacement that had them pinned down. **** He loved the post-war years. Right up until the time 'Manny Gallant' was drafted. He sat down and laughed until he cried. The war was in Korea and they called it a \"police action.\" Another group of men agreed he was just a real good sergeant. He grew another half inch, but he didn't lose any men. He saw it coming, but didn't try to avoid it, just kept traveling with the Daredevils. He'd found a shape he and his ship both liked. She was a small silver travel trailer. He loved riding motorcycles and traveling the country with the show. It was one of the happiest times he'd ever known. All the Daredevils were fond of the 'kid' who had joined them. His name was Murray Gallant and he was a 'sixteen-year-old orphan' when he joined them. He was 'twenty-three' when he was drafted to go to Vietnam. Butch settled down and let him park the trailer he called \"Alice\" in his garage. The kid had grown a bit when he came back. **** He left the world he'd called home for nearly a hundred years and set out to explore other worlds. He spent nearly two thousand years learning the ways of other worlds and fighting to keep them safe. He became a student. On Earth. He smiled in satisfaction when he burned his draft card in front of the campus administration building in nineteen sixty-nine. Alex Gallant would not go. **** \"Gallant!\" \"Hello, Julie. You feel just as good as I remember.\" \"Been a lot longer than a year for you, hasn't it?\" \"Yes. I had a great deal to learn. I brought you some presents. Let's go in. Your tulips need the rain. We don't.\" \"Do they ever. It was dry again this winter. I'm afraid it's going to be a bad year for forest fires. You look wonderful, Gallant, but I don't think those jeans would fit you now.\" \"I don't think they would either. I've planned our evening. Do you mind?\" \"Not at all.\" \"Money is always a problem for me. I set up an account in your name a bit in the past. It's a trust. It matures today. Would you draw funds from it for this evening, please?\" \"Sure. How?\" \"Just call the bank. Here. This is the paperwork.\" \"Uh, I don't think I'll ask how you just made that appear like that.\" \"It's just math.\" \"Math?\" \"A lot of math. I never seem to have enough pockets, so I made a few extra.\" \"Yeah. OK. Right. Gallant, you set this up a hundred forty years ago!\" \"Yes. It seemed the most reasonable time to deposit a small amount of gold.\" \"How much should I draw?\" \"Twenty thousand should be enough. Oops. Steady.\" \"Twenty thousand?!\" \"You're quite right, fifty thousand. One shouldn't short oneself in Las Vegas.\" \"Gallant, you're grinning at me. Just how much is in this account?\" \"I don't really know, but it should make you give serious thought as to how well you really like your job. Call the bank. I'd rather not use Alice to get there before they close.\" \"Alice?\" \"You named her.\" \"Alice in Wonderland!\" \"I thought you'd remember. Call the bank.\" **** \"Monte Carlo?!\" \"Why not? You won so much in Las Vegas, you might as well play with it somewhere else.\" \"Gallant, you won it.\" \"Did I put the chips on the table?\" \"No, but you played the cards.\" \"Team effort. Let's stop in New York. I want to see Phantom of the Opera.\" \"For which you already have tickets. Just like the ballet, and the opera, and the Comedy Club. And probably dinner reservations just like Spago's\" \"Opening night would be nice. Julie, you're the only one who can appreciate how much I've learned. You weren't my first teacher, but you were the one who taught me I was free. I'm showing off for my teacher. And feeling exceptionally smug.\" \"How long, Gallant?\" \"Julie, please don't ask. You really want to know, don't you? The answer will shock you. Two thousand one hundred years.\" \"Uh, I need to sit down.\" \"I told you not to ask.\" \"Next time I'll listen. You remembered a date with me for two thousand years?!\" \"It was the first I ever made. I took my time getting ready for it.\" \"Uh, huh, and I thought I took a long time in front of the mirror.\" \"Julie, I was a very young boy when I came here the first time. Call me eleven. Now I'm about twenty-two.\" \"Childlike innocence. I ignored it.\" \"Julie, yours was my first kiss. I still remember it. I'd been used for years, but never kissed. I had escaped, but you taught me I was free.\" \"Gallant, if you were that young... \" \"They call it stim. My reward for living through it was a rather abrupt introduction to a large group.\" \"There are a lot of things you haven't forgotten.\" \"I'm working on creating dusty corners for them in the attic. You, I keep on the piano in the parlor. Monte Carlo?\" \"Why not?\" **** \"You won't be back again.\" \"I don't know. Yes I do. I'll be back some day to meet your children.\" \"Be Godfather?\" \"Yes. Thank you. I love you, too. Julie, have pepperoni pizza on March eighth once in a while.\" \"Done. Thanks, Gallant. I needed something.\" \"You know, I think I'll just stop saying good-by.\" \"Not yet, but someday, I think you will.\" **** \"GALLANT!\" \"Hello, Julie. Brrr. March Eighth is a lot colder here.\" \"Hurry. Get inside. You'll freeze your ears. How did you find me? Dumb question.\" \"How did you end up in Fairbanks, Alaska?\" \"Jim. He loves it here. It's home. Now, you've got something bothering you. Tell Aunt Julie.\" He smiled. She still knew him. She'd matured well. She was even more beautiful at forty-eight than she had been at twenty-four. He told her about the dreams, but he didn't tell her how long they'd been haunting him. \"Athena. Gallant, is this the dream that gave you your name?\" \"Perceptive as ever. Yes. It's become insistent. I'm about to start in ancient Greece and look up every Athena who ever lived!\" \"You're sure she's human?\" \"Never found the name in any other culture.\" \"Wait a minute! Knew I heard a bell. Jim said something about an Athena. Last night... Yes! A lecturer at the University. No, she can't be the one. She's a geneticist. Plump and seventy-ish. Maybe she's got a granddaughter. Silly. There must be thousands of Athenas.\" \"True, but I had to come here. Now. Ah, hello, you must be Jim.\" \"And you can only be Gallant. Welcome. I've been waiting to meet you for a very long time. You're responsible for my meeting Julie.\" \"I am?!\" \"Yes. I delivered a pepperoni pizza to her on March eighth in ninety-two and stayed to find out why she was smiling and crying. Never left. She was the most beautiful girl I ever met and her best friend was an angel named Gallant. She was either crazy or special. Took me at least two seconds to decide which.\" \"Took him two hours to propose.\" \"Took you two hours to get dressed.\" \"We got married March Eighth, Gallant. Twenty-three years ago. In Las Vegas.\" \"That's the most wonderful story I ever heard.\" \"WOW! It's him, isn't it?\" \"Yes Alice, it's him. Gallant, our daughter Alice. Your oldest Godchild.\" \"You, my dear, are as beautiful as your mother.\" \"You're right, Mom. He definitely knows how to deliver a compliment. So, Gallant, how are you at hugs?\" \"Come here and I'll let you decide.\" **** \"Anyway, she's got this project going, Gallant. Long term thing. Genetic selection. No real meddling. Just pick the best. You know; long life, strong bones, good teeth. With current life expec running about eighty in healthy enviros, she figures two cen by proj culm. Bout one cen from now.\" \"Despite the verbal shorthand, I got all that. And you signed up for it.\" \"Shh, don't tell Mom and Dad.\" \"Tell us what, Alice? Oh, the project. Well, it makes me a bit nervous, but your father says it sounds reasonable.\" \"You know, Mom, I bet they find a gene for mind reading when they run mine. Where's Ben?\" \"Brenda called to say she'd be late. Study group.\" \"I don't believe it. Mom, she's out with that guy again. Yeah, you think so too. Dad?\" \"Trying just as hard as I am to trust her.\" \"Well I'm not a parent. I don't have to. I'm going looking. He gives me the crawlies. And he's the best of that crowd he runs with. Uh, oh. Mom, what'd I do? Why's he staring--\" \"Shh! He's listening.\" \"Alice, get your vehicle. I'm coming with you. Let's go. Julie, we'll find her. Move, Alice!\" The place Alice thought Brenda had gone, with the boy she didn't like, was just a few blocks away. When she stopped the car, the stench of evil was so strong, Gallant couldn't feel the direction it was coming from. \"Where?\" \"That house.\" \"Stay here.\" \"No way, Gallant. I don't have the gas to sit and run it and I'd freeze.\" \"All right, but stay behind me and be prepared to duck. Alice, if I find what I think I will, don't watch. That's an order, not a request.\" \"One of those dark brother things.\" \"I don't give orders for other reasons.\" \"Understood.\" Now he knew why he was in Fairbanks, why Athena had sent him. She'd sent him eight times before. There were three left. One of them was Hensk, but not this one. He went through the door. It would probably have been locked anyway. The stench of evil sickened him. Somewhere in here was his Godchild. Alice watched him go through about ten people, then ducked and turned away. He was right. She didn't want to watch. She knew when it was over, but she didn't turn around. She could feel he didn't want her to. \"Alice, get her home. I'll be there soon. She's asleep. She won't remember anything after she left school. Tell her she hit her head.\" \"How will you get there?\" \"I'll run. It's cold. Go on. You can carry her.\" \"I know that. She weighs less than I do. Thanks, Gallant.\" \"Thank Athena. She sent me. Now go. I've got to get these boys out. When I destroy the ship, it'll take the house with it. Go!\" He carried them out quickly. He could already hear sirens. Someone had called the authorities. The two blankets he'd found would be enough. They wouldn't freeze. He slipped the medunit back in his pocket and checked every room to make sure he hadn't missed anyone. That's when he found the kittens. He knew Mama was dead. He tucked the three tiny things in his shirt, put in the destruct code he'd programmed nearly nine thousand years before and ran for the door. He ran through the night, holding the kittens in his shirt with one hand to keep them from being bounced. He was delighted to see the lights of Julie's house. It was cold. The run hadn't been long enough to really warm him. He ran in the kitchen door. He didn't realize someone had been following him. \"Get me warm milk and an eyedropper or something. They're starving.\" \"I know better. Five min, Gallant.\" \"All right, Jim. Julie, your entire family speaks shorthand.\" \"Do? Yeah. Guess. Comes of closeness.\" \"It's more than that. Alice may be right. They may find something very interesting in her genes. How is she?\" \"Which one?\" \"I know how Brenda is. Alice.\" \"Fine. Waiting by Brenda to give her your story. How bad was she?\" \"Julie, she's fine now.\" \"In other words, you'd rather not tell me and I ought to have sense enough not to push it. All right. She's fine now. Her godfather fixed her.\" \"Yes. I'm hoping to get a hug from her mother for it. Shh. Julie, it's over. All the kittens are safe at home.\" \"How many left, Gallant?\" \"Two.\" \"Yes, but it doesn't end there does it? You could still be killed by one of the ones you killed in your future. I mean... \" \"Yes, but I have it on good authority I won't be.\" \"Athena again.\" \"She's waiting for me. Four times. As four different people. You know, Alice's project... I'm not sure.\" \"Bad?\" \"No, not really important in the long run, but no problem.\" \"Don't tell her that. She has designs on an MD and a slot on it. Loves genetics. Intensely curious about yours.\" \"Tell her I have an extra pair of chromosomes. And no one else on my home planet does.\" \"Oh, Gallant!\" \"I've known a long time. I'm as different from them as I am from you. And I like you better. They're boring!\" \"Here. Hit up Bill Aikens. Vet. Caught him as he was pulling in the drive. He said twenty cc's every two til they're stuffed. Form mixes with warm water.\" \"Thank you, Jim. All right, little one. Let's get you stuffed. Yes, hungry. Poor baby.\" Julie went to find Alice and discovered Brenda was awake. She laid a finger to her lips, smiled and led them to the kitchen. They stood quietly in the doorway and watched Gallant feed the three tiny kittens. He held the tiny life so gently in his big, beautiful, hands. And his smile was so soft. **** \"Mom, he's gone.\" \"I know, Alice.\" \"He didn't even say good-by.\" \"Alice, it hurts him terribly to say it. He's said it far too often.\" \"Yeah, too often. I understand. Will he be back?\" \"I don't know, but we'll make sure we have pepperoni pizza on March eighth. Just in case he shows up for a slice.\" The dark brother was angered at the loss of another of his kind. He traced the woman back though time. He would find the escaped one at their first meeting and destroy him before any of his brethren died. He laughed. The foolish slave had even left the door to his ship open. He would herd him to it and be waiting within.",

      "content": "Chapter Two \"Professor!\" \"Yes, Alan, what is it?\" She smiled. She did so love to hear excitement in the voices of her students. \"I've found something. Hominid. Professor, I don't think it's... I think they're alien.\" \"Oh, my. Let me see that corder. Hmm. You may be right. Exhume them carefully, then we'll take them for a full scan at the university.\" \"I'd really rather you didn't.\" \"Who are you?\" \"My name is Gallant.\" \"Uh, Alan, leave it.\" \"Professor, you've got to be kidding!\" \"No, I'm not. Please don't ask questions. Go back to camp and send Mick to me. Don't talk about it, Alan.\" Gallant smiled at the confused young man. \"Alan, come here. I'll explain. Those bones are why I'm here. They have no business being on Earth. In a moment, they won't be. You're on your way back to camp to send Mick to the professor. It's been a long day. You've enjoyed it, but didn't find anything unusual.\" \"You hypnotized him.\" \"Yes, I did. How did you know who I was? You recognized my name instantly.\" \"Pepperoni pizza has been a March Eighth tradition in my family for five generations.\" \"Ah, I see. And who is Mick?\" \"My son, Miklos. I've got a thing for ancient Greece. I think it began with my name.\" \"Your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Professor Athena Buchannon. Oh, dear! What did I do?!\" She sat down next to the big, beautiful, blond, family legend and watched him. He looked pretty stunned. She wondered why she wasn't. Maybe because it was March Eighth. Or would have been by the old calendar. Suddenly an intense wave of mingled emotions washed over her. Foremost was a kind of ironic joy. \"Whoa! Warn me if you're going to let loose with a blast like that, please.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I'm a very strong empath. You just about flattened me. All right, what's with the bones?\" \"I'm not sure. Athena, are you a... I'm not sure how to ask this. Are you gene selected?\" \"Great-great-grandmother Alice's project. Yes, though it ended a while back. I didn't pick my husband from stus at the U in Alaska. They were still a bit disappointed. I'm the cream of the crop they tell me. I'm fifty-two. Got three PhD's, an MD and I'm continental martial arts champion. In the Olympics twice in biathlon. Medaled both times. My son Mick's on his way. Curious. Real curious.\" \"Hi, Mom. Uh, huh. Well, from the way you're brimming, I'd say Gallant showed up for pepperoni pizza. Hi, Gallant. I'm Mick.\" \"I take it you're an empath too.\" \"Not really. Just with Mom. Dad before he died. High psi, but no breakthrough. Just poten. What's that?\" Gallant turned the small unit over in his hands. He'd built it because Athena had told him it would be needed. \"It will give me the genetic code of the bones, their age, then destroy them. One of the dark brothers seems to have decided to meddle in Earth's distant past. The bones indicate I might have a chance at stopping him.\" \"You mean they indicate you will stop him.\" \"No, Mick, I don't. Chance exists. The course of life in the universe can be changed. Earth could become a barren ball and have always been that way. Or be totally changed. The bones merely mean I can succeed. Keyed. Stand back a bit. You too, Athena. I've never used this before and I'd rather not learn it's too wide a band by having you two disappear.\" \"Oh, terrific. Come on, Mom. Let's get uphill.\" Gallant smiled. He really liked the pair of them. He wondered where the bright coppery hair had come from. Julie's family had all had hair in varying shades of soft brown. He waited until they were some distance away, keyed the unit, then ran to join them. They watched as the ground sank very slightly in the area. \"Good. Now, let's see how I did.\" \"Gallant, I've found more bones. Hmm... NO! This gets changed! Mick, pack us. We're going with him. Do it! Send resigs to the foundation. Get a super out here for the kids.\" \"Mom, Elaine?\" \"Up to you, Mick.\" \"Athena, you aren't coming with me! I never take anyone with me!\" \"You do this time, Gallant. I'm going to do my bit to change the universe. This is probably why I was born. The other bones are yours. I'm going to see to it they're not here.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, oh.\" \"It's still too dangerous. Athena, I won't trade your lives for mine. It's been incredibly long and full. I'm sorry, I won't take you. I'll be careful.\" \"No. You'll take us or I'll hunt for your ship. It's got to be around here someplace. I'll look for it until I find it, then I'll follow. Probably take me a hundred years to figure it out, but I will. If I don't, my son, or my grandkids, or my great-grandkids, or however many it takes, will. You are not going to die in Earth's past.\" \"One of those selected genes was for stubborn!\" \"Yeah, that too. I like it when you yell at me. It's loud, but it's all exasperated 'I care' underneath.\" \"You're really determined to go with me.\" \"Yes, Gallant. There's more to it. I'm bored. I have skills that I can't use for anything but play-acting. I'm a trained researcher in a half-dozen fields that are dying out or have too many in them already. The world is a delightfully peaceful and prosperous place and it's driving me crazy.\" \"And Mick?\" \"Inseparable. Too closely linked. Elaine's his love. I can't imagine her allowing herself to be left behind. You'll like her. Gallant, she's family already and she doesn't really have other. She said she'd recognize her mother, because she's seen her on vid. We don't even need to come back. The three of us can say farewell and no one will hunt us. She's making pepperoni pizza. She loved the idea. Right in the middle of modern Greece, she's making an old Italian dish American style. Come on. She's a great cook. Almost as good as Mick. Have to say you look like you appreciate good cooking.\" \"I'm comfortable this way.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm putting us all on a training program. We're all going to be in top form when we... Gallant, you just decided to take us along, didn't you?\" \"Yes. Your empathic powers are strong.\" \"It's not that. Look at the dig, Gallant. Look close.\" \"They're gone!\" \"Yeah, both sets. There's no settled earth. We've got a chance! Come on! Let's eat!\" **** \"Damn, you're just about too gorgeous to exist. Now I see why Great-great-great-grandmother Julie called you an angel. You look like you walked out of a Renaissance painting. Gallant, we're going to tower over these people. You know, no one ever mentioned how tall you are.\" \"I wasn't. I grow a bit once in a while.\" \"Explain that. You got a real weird feeling. Come on, Gallant. You know I'm too curious to drop it.\" \"I discovered it a few thousand years ago. Now, you see, I haven't even begun explaining and you're already shocked.\" \"No, but a 'few thousand' did knock me a bit.\" \"You're sure? Well, I'd never really been hurt badly. I'd learned my body could heal itself. I drop into a trance state, light enough I can find water and food if I must, during it. It's not restful. I sleep an approximately equal time afterward. This particular occasion, I tranced nine days. Yes, a lot. It was the first time I'd run into Hensk. I had him. Or thought I did. I chased him into a building on Apboretha. His ship was on the ground floor. It was a trap. He took off and dropped the building on me. I'd never had a broken bone. I made up for it. Multiple fractures. Arms, legs, ribs. I'd nearly gotten out. Somehow, the building missed my head. An old female dug me out and stayed by me. She gave me water and cared for me. I think she set the bones. My body grew. It strengthened itself by becoming taller and thicker. I'm incredibly dense. I weigh half again as much as a human my size. After that I came back to Earth. I needed to learn a lot more about just staying alive in an environment that... Anyway, that's why I'm about six-four and massive.\" \"Six-four? Gallant, we haven't used those terms for... a couple of cens. Well, a cen-and-a-half.\" \"Athena, I spent more than a century on Earth. The twentieth. I kept getting drafted. I hate being drafted.\" \"You went to war?\" \"Four of them. Two world wars, Korea and Vietnam. Grew a bit in all but the first. I was a very good sergeant. I only lost one man. Smitty. Right after we hit Omaha beach. I went back to the sixties later and marched for civil rights, then was a war protester.\" \"You were a hippie!\" \"That too.\" The last of the dark brothers had chosen to destroy the world and people he loved. He'd chosen the birthplace of western culture, Athens. Athena, Mick and Elaine had crammed to learn ancient Greek. They had Gallant to help with accent. Athena had been right. He liked Elaine. She was very proficient in the martial arts, but no one he'd ever seen was as good as Athena. Except himself. Mick was almost as good as his mother. \"Who's he after, Gallant?\" \"At a guess, Plato.\" \"Not Socrates?\" \"No, Athena, I don't think so. Plato would still have written his dialogues. They're the true treasure. Athena, you know the culture. You and Elaine are going to stand out even more than I do.\" \"I've given thought to that. Gallant, I'm gray-eyed Athena. You are Apollo. Mick and Elaine are minor divinities.\" \"Athena, that could seriously change the mythology of the period. We can't risk that. This time is pivotal in the development of your own civilization.\" \"It's just an expedient. You can use hypnosis to clear it. I got the idea when we landed atop Acropolis. There's another reason I chose this way. As gods, we won't be... pursued.\" \"Athena, I learned to handle male advances thousands of years ago. Your three times great-grandmother and a nice fellow named Chuck taught me.\" \"Hey, not just you. You may be super-gorgeous now that I've got you in shape, but Elaine, Mick and I are not mashed potatoes.\" \"No, you are champagne and caviar. All of you, but you most of all. Although, I'm not sure how I feel about your haircut.\" \"Short is practical. Cut it to a cen before every comp I was ever in. Call it battle dress. I'll be wearing a helm. At first anyway. Come on, Gallant. I can feel you've decided to go with my plan. Let's roll. Mick and Elaine are ready. Kiss for luck?\" It shocked them both. The sudden blending of their minds and the heat between them. He'd found the first Athena and she knew it too. \"Gallant, I don't quite know what to say. Nothing... Nothing like that ever... Not even with my husband.\" \"Athena, I've searched ten thousand years for you. Lead me, My Lady.\" \"Oh, Gallant, that's why I made you Apollo. We lead together. Let's go find Plato. Before I start trying to talk you into putting Alice on hover for a couple cens. Uh, hi, Mick, Elaine.\" \"Hi yourself, Mom. Very high. Grats, Gallant. You found your girl. And she's a beaut.\" \"That she is, Mick. Now, I have suddenly developed an acute desire to come out of this alive. Shall we see if we can accomplish it?\" **** \"Evil has come among you. Lo, Socrates, your students are endangered. I, Athena, seek Plato. Apollo has seen his destiny. One seeks to alter it.\" \"Oh, beautiful Goddess, he absents himself this day. His loves are not among these either. I had believed they sported on the slopes of Lykavittos. Now, I fear for them.\" \"Fear not. He is mine and in my keeping. Apollo, it pleases me to walk through my city. Will you speak to these? I would not change your vision with my presence.\" \"Yes, Athena, I shall touch each that the tale not be told. Come, Socrates, your words ring through the ages. Plato records them well. I would not have them changed. They guide the young of the future.\" \"Then I ask you take this vision.\" \"Socrates, I give you this day to remember us. On the morrow, you will awake, remembering all but our presence here and your trepidation over the fate of Plato. I bid you continue your discourse and pass this day as others. Speak not of us to those I have not touched.\" He gave each of them the same command, then ran after Athena. The speed of his run would convince Socrates and the young men they were, indeed, who they claimed to be. Athena was an excellent tactician. He struggled to calm himself. If he could keep his mind on the job at hand, he would have what he so desperately wanted. He could smell the evil. The dark brother was nearby. \"GALLANT!\" She saved his life. The dark brother had sprung from ambush and nearly shot him down. He suddenly knew the future she had changed. He would have been injured to dying, but would have killed the brother before death. It had been a trap. Plato wasn't the target. He was. \"NO! ATHENA!\" The sudden tears almost blinded him. The dark brother had shot her down. Mick and Elaine were headed toward the hooded figure at a run. He screamed in rage as he saw him shoot first Mick, then Elaine. He pulled the unit he'd built out and turned it on. It was still keyed to the dark brother's genetic code. He smiled as he listened to his death screams. It shocked him a bit. He had killed, but he had never enjoyed it before. He ran to Athena. She was alive! So were Mick and Elaine, but all were badly injured. Mick and Elaine he could save. Athena... No! She would not die! He needed Alice. Desperately. She wouldn't live through the journey to the ship. He laughed wildly as Alice materialized around them. Somehow, she had heard his need. And answered. He changed a decimal on the coordinates and threw her into flight. He had no idea where they were going, but the decimal point would insure a long flight. He did something he'd never done before. He placed Athena in nontime. She was the first living thing he'd ever risked suspending. He turned to Mick and Elaine, pulled out the medunit, and went to work on them. **** \"I can't find them, Elaine. I know they're here. I can feel it, but I can't find them.\" \"Mick, the note he left said he was going to try to heal her. You can feel she's still alive.\" \"Yeah, and still unconscious. This ship is huge. I only found my way back because I could feel you.\" \"What?\" \"Surprised me too. The link just grew with the love. Elaine, they're thirsty. At least she is. Terribly thirsty.\" \"Mick, this may sound weird, but ask the ship to help you find them. Told you it was weird.\" \"No, you're right. Come with me, Elaine. Pack food. I'm not kidding. We could end up dozens of Ks from here.\" \"All right. Give me five. Find a pack.\" They packed food. Mick said no to water. Gallant wouldn't have taken his mother anywhere they couldn't find it. He took Elaine's hand, then a deep breath. \"Alice, they need us. Please, help us find them.\" They set out hand in hand. Elaine squeezed his and smiled. All the corridors, but one, were dark. **** \"Mick, is she... out again?\" \"Just sleeping, Elaine. Gallant. Gallant, drink a bit of broth, then sleep. I know how it works. Mom told me.\" Mick sat back and smiled. They were both tired, but his mother's injuries were healed. \"Elaine, I'm going to trek back and check to see if Alice has anything she wants to tell us. I'll bring more food too. Stay with them?\" \"Naturally. Mick, this is a... bower. A beautiful clear pool, flowering trees, soft deep grass, roses on trellises... A bower in the middle of the ship.\" \"Not half the middle. You should see some of the... rooms. There's a meadow and a forest of strange trees. There's something that can only be a racecourse of some kind. There's a room full of nothing but labels hanging in the air, all with names of musical instruments. Bedrooms in a hundred different styles... Thousands of rooms. Told you I got lost. I keep looking for a kitchen closer to us, but haven't found one. Well, it's only a little more than a K. Not bad. Be back. Love.\" \"Love. Mick! How long?\" \"Sleep? Same as trance. Five days. Want a book or three?\" \"Yes. No, bring my pack. Might as well work on my thesis. I might get to deliver it.\" \"Bother you?\" \"No. Truth is, I'm as excited as I've been about anything in my life. You?\" \"About. Right up there with you saying yes when I asked you out the first time. Elaine, marry me.\" \"Gee, I thought I was going to have to ask you.\" **** \"Hensk. I can feel him. He's teamed up with the bel-Nathans. Nasty combo. Those people don't stand a chance. Wonder why he's so interested... Telepaths! A whole race of telepaths! I've got to help them. I'll get you somewhere safe, Athena.\" \"Gallant, you're not going into battle without me to watch your back.\" \"Athena, I don't want you in danger!! I want you safe!!\" \"Yell at me some more. I love it. Hey, I love you. Don't expect to keep you, but intend to have more than so far. Much more. Hensk is the last one, Gallant. And he scares you. Bad. He's got you... programmed. How many times have you met up with him?\" \"Seven.\" \"And?\" \"He got away.\" \"And you got hurt.\" \"That too.\" It happened the same way again, but it took nearly seven years. Seven years of running, fighting, running... The telepaths helped. So did the augmented horses Athena and Gallant gave them for transport. They all fell in love with the people, especially their leader Chervan. Communication wasn't difficult. The telepaths, some of them, learned to vocalize, in English. Gallant taught 'finger speech' to the others. He was uncomfortable communicating telepathically. The concussion he sustained, when Hensk blew out a mountainside trying to kill him, kept Gallant from going into trance. Athena never left his side the twelve weeks it took him to heal. She'd never let go of his hand the two weeks he lay unconscious. He spent four more months with her. \"The dreams.\" \"Yes, Athena, the dreams. She's come back.\" \"You're going alone, aren't you, Gallant?\" \"Athena... \" \"I've always known the time would come.\" \"Do you want to go home?\" \"This is home. There's nothing on Earth for me. Mick and Elaine feel the same. Our skills are needed here. Besides, Chervan and I together are an unbeatable combo. We'll get this world out of the stone age and on the road back to tech civ in nothing flat. Gallant, I want... Before you go... \" \"Tell me, Athena.\" \"I want all of you. I want the whole thing that I got just a taste of the first time we kissed. Drop your barriers with me just once. It's the one memory I want I don't have.\" She recoiled in shock when he opened his mind to her. He dropped his arms to his sides and turned away. He should have known better. \"No, Gallant! Stop! Again. Slowly this time. It was just too much all at once. You carry so much loneliness and pain. It hurts me to feel it. Show me the love and joy too. I want to know all of you. Love all of you.\" He stood with his back to her, desperately trying to rebuild his barriers. \"No, Athena. Even I don't want to know all of it. I put it all away and forget as much as I can. I surprised myself too. Chervan is scolding me. It seems I knocked half the paths on the planet to their knees. She's not really angry, just upset I didn't give them enough warning to get their barriers up.\" \"Warn them now. Don't argue, Gallant. I won't listen and I won't let you win.\" \"I don't really want to win. I want this memory too.\" **** He wandered. The dreams had sent him from Athena, but not to anywhere. He restlessly searched for Hensk, dodged a few attacks by dark brethren he'd already destroyed, and wandered. \"Find her, my gallant one. Find the second who bears my name. Build the door.\" He awoke aching with loneliness. A door? A door to where? He stumbled to the comp station. He was being driven. He avoided looking in a mirror. He knew what he'd see. Knew because his clothes hung on him. Knew because he couldn't eat or rest. A door to where? A door to beyond where he was? Where was he? He began again. From where he was. If he defined that, he would, perhaps, know what was beyond. The name Hrune. It came to his mind again. Hrune... He tapped Alice's memory banks. Hrune... Yes! Orbel Hrune, Lahathan mathematician. Theory of infinite universes. He patted the console. \"Thank you, Alice. Now I know what door I'm to build. Let's see if you and I can figure out how to build it. I hope you're in the mood to help.\" She was, but it still required months of work. Most at the comp station. He found a red giant to power it and began the work of building it. Athena hadn't come to his dreams since he'd begun the work. She came the night before he opened the door and whispered, \"The second Athena.\" Gallant cautiously explored the universe he'd created a way into. It shocked him when he discovered it was 'the same' as his. He was sure it shouldn't be. He was stunned when he learned his own people didn't exist in it. There was a race as old as his in another galaxy, but very different. He wasn't surprised to discover he actually liked them better. He set coordinates for Earth. It was home in his emotions and humans were the people he truly needed to know existed in this universe. Alice flashed \"Well it's about time, Nervous Nellie!\" on her screen and he laughed. \"You're right, Alice. I've been avoiding it, just as I avoided visiting Earth after the twentieth century, for several thousand years, because I was afraid it would change too much. This universe shouldn't be at all like ours, but it is. And telling myself it doesn't matter if there aren't humans in it is not working.\" He hopped through time. Humans not only existed, they flourished. By the twenty-second century, they'd put all their boundless energy into exploring their galaxy. Earth was the home of the Orion Arm Federation of Free Worlds and the base of the highly regarded Exploration Fleet, but they had a problem. It was called the Durcassin Empire. He hopped forward and saw the Federation and the Empire settle into an uneasy truce. The Federation grew on one side of the wide 'Zone of Neutrality,' by inviting space-faring peoples to join. The Empire grew on the other side, by conquest. Gallant decided he was lonesome and wanted people to talk to. He laughed when Alice gave him the location of a group of humans. She knew him very well. She flashed, \"And it's a dangerous place.\" He told her to give him data and hurry. He knew what 'kind' of danger when she landed. The fact she landed close, told him she was worried. He walked around a small outcropping and introduced himself. \"Hello, I'm Gallant.\" \"You have no business being here!\" \"Hey! The weapon is hardly necessary. I'm unarmed and intend injury to no one.\" \"Commander Telas?\" \"He's as unarmed as he claims, Captain. My sensors detect nothing that could be construed as dangerous.\" \"Cybernetic augmentation. Isn't that a bit unusual?\" Gallant smiled and cautiously lowered his hands. \"It wasn't a choice. Captain, he's not human. Very advanced physiology. Two hearts and a unique cell structure. Slow continual replacement. He probably has a life span of thousands of years.\" \"Thank you, Commander. Now, Mr. Gallant, why don't you tell me what you're doing on a planet that's, basically, falling apart under our feet.\" \"Looking for someone to talk to. Your scientific teams attracted my attention. I just decided to be friendly and say hello. Hello.\" The captain laughed and Gallant's smile widened. He'd missed humans. \"You've picked a pretty unstable setting for a chat. I'm Justin Merris, captain of the Federation Exploration Vessel Curie. We're trying to find out why this is the fourth planet in this region that's disintegrating.\" \"I think I know what's happening to the planet. If I'm right, it will spread. I'll give you the data I've collected.\" \"Thank you. It'll probably give my security chief fits, but why don't you come back to the ship and have a cup of coffee with me?\" \"I'd love to. With your permission, I'll land my craft in your shuttle bay. Captain, I'm going to take a very unusual step and invite Commander Telas aboard my ship, to make the journey with me. He's already deduced more than I really want known about me. I'd like the opportunity to convince him not to reveal everything he learns. The best way to do that is let him know everything, then choose not to reveal it.\" \"Commander?\" \"It's rather convoluted logic, Captain, but a very accurate judgment of my personality. I believe Lt. Ochis would feel a great deal more comfortable about having both his craft and him aboard if I arrived in it.\" \"Agreed. Commander Duchelle!\" \"Yes, Sir! Where did he come from?\" \"A ship. Mr. Gallant, Lieutenant Commander Athena Duchelle.\" \"Athena?! How interesting. Just Gallant. Now, Commander, if you'll come this way, I'll show you my ship.\" Gallant just turned and walked off. He couldn't think of anything to say to her. He noticed Telas followed at a nod from his captain, but he was a bit surprised he did. He wasn't surprised by what the woman named Athena said behind him. \"Well! I've never had quite that reaction to my name before. Or quite that response to an introduction. Not the politest person I've ever met.\" \"Commander Duchelle, your greeting was not exactly fleet protocol. He's not human. Telas seems to find him more than a little intriguing. He also seems to have some idea what's happening to this world. Finish your tests, then report to me aboard the ship.\" \"Yes, Captain. Non-human. Hmm.\" \"Commander, your intense interest in non-human anthros almost got you left behind on Base Six Four. This is not the place to be thinking of other things. I'd like as much information as we can get before this world becomes an asteroid belt.\" \"I know, I know. Curb my curiosity and get on with the job at hand. Yes, Captain. Still, he's very interesting.\" \"Yes, and he has data to add to yours, so I suggest you assemble some.\" \"Yes, Sir. We're about done.\" Gallant didn't take Telas directly to the Curie. It was nearly three months before he took him there. Of course, it was only ten minutes as far as the captain was concerned. In those months, they became very good friends. They had a great deal in common. Telas' cyber augmentation had been done by an alien scientific group when he was a child. He had been, basically, a slave to the computer that ran their ship. A fleet ship had tracked the abducted human children and freed them, but too late for Telas. Federation medical knowledge was incapable of reversing the augmentation. Telas would live for thousands of years as part man, part computer. He laughed when he told Gallant Alice was the first girl he'd ever truly loved. Gallant smiled and ached for him. The laugh was real, but tinged with longing. Gallant showed Telas what was causing the breakup. The device was small and nearly undetectable in the vast reaches of the neutral territory. The Empire had invented a new weapon. Soon it would begin to destabilize stars. Soon after, it would affect inhabited worlds. They landed on the Curie and Gallant joined the captain for coffee. They'd just begun to chat when Telas' voice came over the com. \"Gallant! Now!\" Gallant ran from the captain's ready room. Telas had a man in his arms and was stepping into a lift. Gallant leapt consoles and people and dove into it just as the doors began to close. \"Emergency one, shuttle bay two. Emergency two, medical. He's a mess inside. I don't know how he got from the pad to the lift. 'Something' destabilized the transport system. You stunned the bridge crew.\" \"If I didn't know better, I'd think you planned it. You timed it perfectly. Shuttle bay first.\" \"Doctor Marsh says we can save him, but Commander Duchelle is still on the planet and it's coming apart. I couldn't get her on comm.\" \"Damn! Telas, convince him he must violate neutral space. Destroy that thing.\" \"I will.\" Gallant ran for Alice as soon as the lift doors opened. He hadn't given the captain an easy job. The Curie would take a real beating just getting close enough to blast the device. He'd take a real beating saving Commander Duchelle. He didn't quite reach her before it began. Athena got a shoulder under him and got him to his feet. The landslide had rolled him about three hundred meters, then near buried him. She was amazed he was alive and astounded he was conscious. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" \"Would you believe rescuing you? My ship's over that cliff that used to be a ridge. Your transporter is nonfunctional.\" \"This job would be easier if you weren't quite so... \" \"Comfortable. I'd still weigh more than a human. This won't work. There just isn't time. Here. Go. Take this. It's the key to my ship. Push the green button on the navigation console. It'll take you to the nearest inhabited planet.\" \"Look, big, blond, and 'comfortable', you'll get out of this with me, or we'll not get out of it together. Don't argue! Just keep going.\" \"Why do I keep meeting stubborn women named Athena?!\" \"Explain that statement while I 'stubborn' us to a bit more stable ground. If there is any.\" \"There isn't. This whole planet is about to crumble around us. LOOK OUT!!\" She cried as she rigged a travois. He'd pushed her out of the way, then thrown himself between her and the falling, bouncing rock. It would have killed her. She didn't know why it hadn't killed him. She reminded herself the travois \"put basic physics to work\" and she knew she could do it, dragged him to a spot that didn't have tumbling cliffs on both sides and dropped to the ground, exhausted. The planet was coming apart, but she had to rest. Gallant awoke and looked around. Athena Duchelle was curled on the ground near where he lay. She'd gotten him a long way while he was unconscious. He decided it was probably his turn. He assessed his condition and smiled. He'd always liked a challenge. He struggled to his knees, waited for his head to stop spinning and his vision to clear, then got to his feet. She was small and ordinarily he'd have found her weight an easy load, but this wasn't ordinarily. He decided she'd been asleep when the rock hit her. She'd probably regain consciousness in a few hours. But they didn't have a few hours. He got his bearings, put her on the travois and set out. He faced the hill and laid down the travois. He'd have to carry her. He begged for just a little luck. If the hill would stay stable just a few minutes, he thought he could make it to Alice with her. He picked her up and started up the hill. He got about two-thirds of the way before the hill began to disintegrate. Suddenly, Alice was around him. He laughed, told her he loved her, gently laid Commander Duchelle on the floor and collapsed, before he could get his healing unit out of his pocket. **** Athena looked around. They had to be in his ship. She felt a faint vibration, so she knew they were in flight. How had they gotten there and where was he? She found him. He was unconscious on the floor not far from her. She rolled him over gently and began to examine him. Broken clavicle, scapula, ribs, badly bruised leg, she thought his sternum might be cracked and his mass of blond curly hair was matted with blood. And somehow, he'd gotten her to his ship and off the disintegrating planet. She'd found the one she'd been looking for. She smiled at the thought her little-girl white-knight dreams fit with grown-up girl plan, after all, even if he was a bit plump for the armor. Now to keep him alive to accomplish it. She gave up hunting for medical supplies after she'd gotten lost twice and nearly didn't find her way back to the control center. She settled for a small basin of water and a soft cloth. \"Hello.\" \"Hello, Gallant. How'd we get here?\" \"We staggered, until a beautiful lady performed an impossible rescue.\" \"What?\" \"My ship just does the impossible now and then. Neither of us can figure out how. Unh. There seem to be pieces of me where there shouldn't.\" \"Broken ribs. Several. How in hell did you pull that travois with a broken clavicle and scapula?\" \"I didn't pull it far. Couldn't get it up the hill.\" \"You carried me?!\" \"You don't weigh much. Probably not more than a hundred twenty pounds, soaking wet.\" \"Pounds?! Gallant, you use some amazing terms; weeks, months, pounds.\" \"Showing my age. Still hovering. The Curie may be in trouble. Alice needs my help to find her. I need yours to get to the controls. Push that chair over here, then help me into it.\" \"At least you have sense enough not to try to stand. Lord! You're heavy!\" \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lean on you that much. I weigh near three times what you do. Did I hurt you?\" \"No. I knew it and was prepared to help. I just didn't expect you to need it that fast. Concussion too. Had to be with that smack you got. You didn't expect dizzy to make slow assist fast support, either.\" \"I do know how strong you are. You pulled me a long way.\" \"We wouldn't have made it without both of us. Gallant gestures are wonderful. Teamwork is practical. What are you doing?\" \"Helping Alice find the Curie. The course was plotted by Telas, a person, not a computer. There wasn't time to input the data.\" \"Computers can't play hunches and Telas has the most data as a base for his. You know the data he's got.\" \"Precisely. Got her. Put us in her engineering section, Alice. I think Telas and I can hold her together long enough to destroy that disrupter. Athena, how well do you know her systems?\" \"I helped design them. She's a prototype. I hitched a ride on her for this mission. Pulled 'Mama's baby' and they let me get away with it.\" \"We're landing. Get someone to help me to the Curie's engineering console, then let Telas know I want him on the ops station.\" She ran for help. She barked, \"Work now, questions later!\" at the two open-mouthed crewmen who stopped and stared at the room too big to be in the little travel trailer. They got Gallant to the main engineering console of the shaking ship and held him up while he worked. Athena worked on the secondary station and implemented the commands that flashed across her screen. Telas did the same thing on the bridge. They tuned the shields, dampened the oscillation, the ship steadied and damage control began to catch up. The captain gave the order and the device was destroyed. The Curie raced for Federation space. Gallant smiled and collapsed. \"Get him to Medical. Now! STOP! You can't carry him like that! Telas! Am I glad to see you! He's got a broken clavicle and scapula and ribs and a concussion. Probably a half dozen other--\" \"I'll carry him. Get a lift and notify Dr. Marsh we're coming. He's his own best healer, but with a concussion, he'll need help.\" As soon as they got on the lift, Telas had Athena get Gallant's healing unit out of his pocket. He looked at the readings, then told her to put it back in the pocket. She raised an eyebrow. \"He doesn't need more help than we can give him. That unit isn't a great deal better than ours, just enough faster to make the med techs too curious.\" \"His ship is going to drive me crazy. It's smaller than it was in the shuttle bay.\" \"Only the physical interface. The ship is still infinite.\" \"Mathematical construct.\" \"Yes, a programmed set of dimensions. There's a very rare non-replicable isotope at the heart of it, but the rest is all a program he wrote. He called it the mathematics of finite infinity. I managed not to say that was a contradiction.\" \"It exists, so it's not impossible. Of course, I'll probably spend the rest of my life reminding myself of it. Get him to teach you why it's not, someday. He has enough time, too.\" \"Thank you, for understanding knowing someone who does means a great deal to me.\" \"I also know there's far too much caring there for a few minutes. It exists, so it's not impossible. Lynn!\" \"Him there. You there. Now, Lieutenant!\" \"Yes, Commander.\" Gallant was unconscious for two days. Dr. Marsh told them it was actually some kind of trance state. Once she'd healed his concussion, his own system had taken over and begun healing his other injuries. She complained about tripping over people every time she turned around, but smiled when she groused. Athena, Telas and Captain Merris smiled back. He awoke and asked for water, drank deeply and drifted off to sleep. Lynn Marsh sighed and tripped over people for two more days. Midday of the second day, Athena asked for her help. \"I think you're crazy.\" \"We've talked about this before, Lynn.\" \"Theoretically, not as a course of action.\" \"I'm going to the Pauling. She's got the finest medical facilities in space. I want this and I do know what I'm doing.\" \"I'm not sure it will work. Athena, he's very, very different.\" \"Yes. And very, very special.\" \"You're in love with him!\" \"Oh, yes, since I was eight. I always helped the white knight rescue me in my fantasies, but I know he's going to leave. Lynn, he's not even from this universe. Came through a 'doorway,' he called it.\" \"Two hearts, continual cell replacement, another set of chromosomes, for heaven's sake!\" \"And two arms, two legs, blond curly hair, beautiful voice, the gentlest smile.\" \"I give up. If gray-eyed Athena, connoisseur of the fleet, thinks a slightly plump alien is the most perfect male in existence, who am I to argue?\" \"Did you notice? He has gray eyes too. Sort of a sea mist blue-green gray and the fairest skin--\" \"Stop, already. I'm convinced. Climb on the table and let's get this started before I regain my sanity. But I get to be there for the finale. If it works.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it will.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it probably could, maybe.\" \"You don't really doubt it will, either.\" \"I'm a doctor. I believe in good science and miracles.\" **** \"You mean you can cook?!\" \"Gallant, I can do almost anything. Following a recipe isn't that different from following a chemical formula. Not that I need a recipe. Traditional New Orleans fare. Seven bells. My quarters. See you then.\" \"I'll be there.\" Telas watched Athena walk away and grinned. \"Gallant, you're in for a treat. Athena grew up in New Orleans. Everyone in the fleet has tried to talk her into cooking dinner at one time or another. Every man has tried to get an invitation to her quarters.\" \"Uh, oh.\" \"Relax. You're not really her type, too comfortable. She likes slender with lots of muscle.\" \"More than half the reason I'm the way I am is to avoid being someone's type.\" \"Gallant, you've had thousands of years of experience. Women shouldn't make you that nervous.\" \"Telas, those thousands of years of experience are why women make me nervous.\" He decided he was in trouble right after he pulled a rose from a nontime pocket and gave it to her at her door. Her smile was warm enough to raise the ship's ambient temperature two degrees and his a bit more than that. She'd looked so lovely framed in the doorway with the glow of candlelight behind her, he'd done it without thinking about it first. He was too lost in her smile to notice she hadn't asked how he'd made the rose appear. Dinner was superb. He enjoyed it, the soft jazz playing in the background and her company. He also enjoyed the excellent wine she served him. \"Athena, thank you. It's been a very pleasant evening. Dinner was wonderful. I enjoyed it immensely.\" \"Good, then you'll stay a bit longer.\" \"I really should go.\" \"Can you dance?\" \"Of course I can dance.\" \"Here, one glass each of wine left. And a dance before you leave. Gallant, I know you're going to slip off to Alice and leave for wonderland.\" \"Not many people catch that allusion. Yes, Athena, it's time for me to return to my own universe. Oops! My, you're quick.\" \"Fastest reflexes in the fleet. Other than Telas. Barely spilled a drop. Why don't you drink it instead of wearing it? Would you believe I represented the Americas in the pan-Federation games? Hundred meter sprint. Took the silver. I was still in the academy at the time.\" \"You really are a very surprising young woman. I was told you attained the rank of Lt. Commander faster than anyone else had ever done it.\" \"That probably won't stand long. The Fleet's growing. Rank's going to come a bit faster for some of the bright young looies. I'm glad to see it.\" \"You asked about my 'stubborn' comment. I knew another beautiful woman named Athena once. She didn't have the Fleet to give her a place to use her skills.\" \"You found her one, then left her behind. Miss her. Loved her. Still do.\" \"You are entirely too perceptive. And far too beautiful by candlelight. I don't think I should have had that last glass of wine.\" \"Dance with me.\" She was soft and warm in his arms. Before he quite realized what he was doing, he was kissing her. As he scooped her up in his arms and carried her deeper into her quarters, he decided the last glass of wine had definitely been a mistake. He was very glad he'd made it. Gallant returned to his own universe, but she haunted his memory and his dreams. He'd fallen in love. He knew it and that he'd never love another woman in quite the same way again. He longed to return to her, but the other 'dream' Athena had gently told him he must not. He decided on a fishing trip. He was not expecting company. The tall, slender, extremely fair boy with near white hair, who walked out of the woods on his right, appeared to be in his mid-teens. He liked his smile, but wasn't feeling particularly sociable or he'd have chosen somewhere else for his fishing trip. \"Hello.\" \"Hello. Who are you?\" \"I'm Apollo Avelaine. Lane. How's the fishing?\" \"Quite good. It usually is on uninhabited planets.\" \"Pretty good if you go far enough into the past on inhabited ones too.\" \"Are you going to tell me who you are and why you're here, or just keep dropping obscure hints?\" \"Look at me. I've given you my name. My mother is gray-eyed Athena. Not one of the human ones. My hair is lighter than yours, but I look too much like you for you not to know me. Feel who I am. I traveled here from another time in a ship named Alice. You brought me. I've come to help you find my brothers.\" Gallant stared at him in shock. Lane laughed. \"You said you felt pretty strange when I told you. Hello, Dad. I'm from your future, but you've got me now. Just be glad you didn't get the girls too. \"Girls?\" \"You spend almost thirty years raising a family. I'm sixteen and the only boy of the group. You're taking most of the girls to your home world. I'm officially the youngest of three boys and three girls. You and I are going to find my brothers.\" \"Six… children. I told you all this?\" \"No. I'm Athena's child. I'm the timewalker. All my life exists within my memory. I'm Apollo. I see the future.\" He knew the boy was his without doubt. He could feel it. He didn't doubt he saw the future either. It was too clear in his eyes. \"That's a terrible burden to carry. Why did I bring you to me?\" \"To get my brothers. And to meet our Godfather.\" \"Your Godfather?\" \"Telas. You're about to hook our supper. You clean. I'll cook.\" **** The place looked very different than when he'd left it, but he'd expected it would. He smiled when he saw her, stopped and waited for her to feel him. She almost dropped the bundle she was carrying in the street. \"Hello, Athena.\" \"GALLANT! You've come for him. I think I've always known you would. Oh! Who are you?\" \"Lane. I told him to come. He didn't know. You forgot to mention what you were planning.\" \"'Forgot' probably isn't the operable term. I figured he'd argue about it. In fact, I knew he'd argue about it. Come on, Gallant. You know the paths all know you're here. Mick will know by now too.\" \"Chervan has already informed me, in no uncertain terms, I'm staying for dinner.\" \"Being one of three humans on a world of telepaths has been a very interesting experience. One I wouldn't trade. Mick and Elaine have four kids. Seven full humans on this world now, but with a bit of telekinetic assistance, the human strain will blend in within two generations.\" \"I had assumed that was how you'd overcome the inter-species differences. It hurt me to learn my last night with you was... shared, Athena.\" \"Oh, Gallant! It wasn't! Don't think that! I... Chervan and I... Before I came to find you, then after you'd gone. We... I wanted... \" \"Athena, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Don't cry. I'm not angry, nor hurt any longer. Feel.\" He held her a moment and then stepped back from her. She would know why. Leaving her had been very hard the first time. Now he would have to do it again. \"What's his name?\" \"Pericles. We call him Clete. Biggest kid on the planet. Strong as an ox and almost as fast as you are. Gentle and deadly. Strawberry blond curls. Looks just... Lane's your son.\" \"From somewhere far in the future. In my future. He tells me his mother's name is also Athena.\" \"Dad, we're staying for five days. It's important.\" \"He also tells me he sees the future. Handy if you're wondering if you're going to catch dinner. Not a bad cook either.\" \"That was a hint. All right. I'll cook dinner one of the days you're here. One of the days.\" Gallant laughed. She hadn't changed. She was a terrific cook, but she disliked it. In the near eight years they'd trained, then fought side by side against Hensk and the bel-Nathans, she'd cooked no more than a dozen times. Always as a special treat for him. \"Gallant, you're taller. How long have you been gone?\" \"Am I? I hadn't noticed. Not long. Just a few years.\" \"That means you got hurt and spent major time healing yourself. What happened?\" \"I fell down a hill and most of it came along. I had pretty good help healing. Must have put more energy into it than I needed.\" \"No, it means you broke a whole bunch of bones and your body strengthened itself by getting bigger. And thicker.\" \"Athena, I'm comfortable this way. Although, I've a feeling I'm about to get in very good shape. It seems I'm about to take on the job of training my sons.\" \"Well, Lane looks like he's in good shape and I've been training Clete since he was two.\" \"TWO?!\" \"It was either that or let him hurt himself trying to copy the older kids. To be honest, I was afraid he'd hurt someone else. He's massive, Gallant. Nearly a hundred ninety centimeters and about a hundred ten kilos of muscle and still getting bigger.\" \"He'll top out at one ninety-five and one fifty K. It'll always be all muscle. He likes to work-out.\" \"Lane!\" \"Sorry, Dad, but Athena doesn't mind.\" \"He's right, Gallant. I'm kind of pleased to know.\" \"Let's see, that's about six-four-and-a-half and three hundred thirty pounds. Whew! That is big.\" \"He's like you, Dad. All of us are. We're heavier than humans. He'll look like about one-thirty K. Two hundred eighty pounds for you.\" \"That's still big.\" \"Yes, it'll drive Dutch crazy. So will his purring.\" \"PURRING?!\" \"In the future. Shouldn't have mentioned it. You're about to meet him.\" \"Lane, you're going to drive me crazy.\" \"Always did.\" \"Hi, Mom, I just heard. You must be Gallant. I've heard a lot... Mother?\" \"You never asked.\" \"You mean you didn't tell him either?! ATHENA, YOU'RE HOPELESS!\" \"Gee, Gallant. You haven't yelled at me in seventeen years. Feels great.\" He groaned, Athena grinned and Lane and Clete sat on the ground and laughed. Five days passed and he had to leave her again. **** The trip through the doorway and to Earth in the time of the Federation was rather short. Athena's world was very near it, as he thought of it. But when he got there, he ran into unexpected difficulty. He tried to remember the man across the desk wasn't just being difficult, but it wasn't easy. \"He's my son and I want him!\" \"He's a Federation ward, Mr. Gallant, and you will have to prove your status.\" \"Dad, get Telas. He's expecting it. You set it up years ago. Remember?\" \"Oh. All right, Lane. Anything has to be easier than this.\" Gallant stormed out of the office and down the steps. Clete was having a bit of difficulty not kicking something in response to what he was feeling. What he got from Lane was too mixed to define, but it was predominantly anticipation, so strong it was a hunger. It was almost as strong as his father's frustration. \"Why, after all these years, did they make him a ward of the state?! Lane, when did I set this up with Telas?\" \"I don't know. Just that you do.\" \"Why don't you know and why didn't you tell me sooner?\" \"There he is. Right on time.\" \"Telas! It's good to see you!\" \"Hi, Gallant. Hello, Clete, Lane. Let's see, you're here to pick up Roberrin. That means this is the first time my godsons have met me.\" \"You mean I'm your godson too?\" \"You are now, Clete, but not yet. That even confuses me. Let's see... Your dad asked me a long time ago, but he hasn't... The simple answer is: Yes, and now that he knows, he will. I have a file on the duties and, more relevant, the privileges of my duty station. I believe this is the time to invoke my hugging privilege. I've watched over your son, Gallant. I gave him his first hug. Lynn Marsh states she was not really hugging him when she handed him to me. We were there. The Pauling was Athena's ship and they loved him too. We're quite smug. Athena trusted us to build her son into the person he could be. It's time he knew his father and his brothers.\" \"Telas, I can't prove I'm a Fed citizen. I'm not. They refuse to take straight paternity without a long involved court proceeding. I'm... two steps from just grabbing him.\" \"That's what I'm here to help you do. You want him to disappear from this time period. There are others helping. Lynn Marsh is Fleet Chief Med Officer. She's just had all his medical records put in a coded file and sealed under Fleet Med Command. The captain of the Pauling just 'lost' all his records at Admiral Merris' request. The only one left to 'hit' is Social.\" \"There's a sweet little old lady who will help at the school. Dad will charm her socks off and she'll 'forget' to refile Dutch's records. She thinks it's dumb to put a kid with an obviously caring parent in an institution. Clete and I will get him. It'll take him all of ten seconds to figure out who we are. It'll take us about two hours to convince him he doesn't need to say good-by to about forty girls. Come on, Clete. He'll be on the field for track practice by the time we get there. Dad, remember to tell me about sweet little old Ms. Brown.\" \"Telas, they're going to drive me crazy.\" \"You're going to turn them into outstanding young men and it'll break your heart to part with them.\" \"That too. I can already see it coming and I haven't even met Roberrin. Three sons, Telas. Three beautiful women gave me sons. And I already ache to hold... Lane calls him Dutch. His eyes light when he says it. I would have gone anywhere and done nearly anything to see... Telas, Social? I want my son.\" \"Back to the office you just left. You get that man to get into Dutch's file. As soon as he does, I'll key in an erase command from the outer office. I've got the Fed's pri-one override command. As soon as he closes the file, it will cease to have ever existed.\" \"Pri-one? Override?\" \"You have friends in high places. So will the boys when they reach this time. Gallant, you put them in the academy sixteen years ago.\" \"Wait! Don't tell me any more. I don't want to know the future, but I do want to know what happened to Athena.\" \"She saved a world and lost her life. Highest commendation the Fed can give. One of six ever awarded. She stopped a war. No one knows how she did it. The defense shield she threw up around a defenseless world fused into a lump of metal. It lasted just long enough to deflect the incomings. When it blew, she died. She was the only one who didn't live through the attack. Nearly two billion people owe her their lives. Every city on that planet has an Athena Boulevard or Athena Duchelle park. Half the girls under ten are named Athena. She's one of the Federation's greatest heroes.\" \"Sounds like the girl I knew.\" \"Ooh, it hasn't been very long, has it?\" \"No. Not long enough to forget the fragrance she wore or the way she felt in my arms. A minute, Telas. I need a minute.\" \"Gallant, she loved you. You were the last man she invited 'in' for dinner.\" \"Telas, there are four Athenas.\" \"I'd say the explanation lies in your future and in those three boys.\" \"I'll wait for it. There are three girls too, but Lane says they're close to each other, but not to him or me. Family, but not really friends. I don't understand it, but I don't think he does either. It may be the only thing that confuses him. I may have to do something about that. I'm not sure it's healthy. Teenage boys are supposed to be a bit confused.\" \"The only thing that confuses Dutch is girls. He never forgets a comm number, but he gets the names that go with them mixed up.\" \"Lane says he doesn't understand why they think he should choose between them either. He loves him incredibly, like he's been waiting for this moment his whole life, living for it. Let's go. I want my son.\" He insisted the man check the files to make sure he wasn't named as father, all files. He wasn't, just unspecified non-human. He made a hasty exit. He'd made such a fuss the man was going to go through them again. Telas led him to the school and he almost collapsed in mirth. He set about charming Ms. Brown and charmed himself right into trouble. Lane was near giggles before they got to the field. Clete wasn't far behind. He had no idea what was so funny to Lane, but he'd never felt anyone as strongly as he did him and his near giggly mood felt wonderful. He could have found his brother on the field with his eyes closed. It didn't take him long to notice them. He watched him come across the field and made an estimate from the ease and speed at which he did it. He could see Lane's description of 'fast' was an understatement. Lane's intense surge of excitement when he ran up to them didn't at all agree with his casual posture, but he didn't say anything, just stood and smiled. \"Hi, Dutch.\" \"Who are you?\" \"You've already figured out the answer. Come on, we're breaking you out of this place. Dad's finishing off your computer tracks now. He's Lane. I'm Clete. Apollo Avelaine and Pericles Buchannon. Our dad's Gallant. So's yours. Let's go.\" \"I need to say good-by to some people. I can't leave without telling them.\" \"Dutch, the important ones are helping. We haven't time for farewells to every girl in a ten kilometer radius.\" \"Just Rosalind and Jackie. Oh, and Carol and Diane. How did you know I wanted to say good-by to girls?\" \"He remembers the future. Pretty strange, but I'm starting to get used to it. Dutch, relax. You're starting to make me tense.\" \"He's wondering why Dad didn't come for him before, Clete. It's worrying him.\" \"Exactly. Well, why didn't he?\" \"Because, until I told him eighteen days ago, he didn't know either one of you existed. He didn't know I did until I walked up and introduced myself. NO! You can't tell her good-by.\" \"But she's right across... You really do know what's going to happen. Wow! That must be great.\" \"Dutch, you're not dense. Think about it a minute. Lane will never have a surprise, not even a happy one. Yeah, better. You're still doing dips emotionally, but your brain's getting back in gear. Oh, I'm an empath.\" \"A big one.\" \"Yes, and he'll get bigger, but so will we. Primarily because he makes us work at it. Yes, we're all the same age. You need to know Dad, so you understand who you are, Dutch.\" \"We're all the same age? Dumb question. You just said that.\" \"Not dumb. I wouldn't have known what you were going to ask if you didn't ask it. That's how it works. Dad's going to tell us how 'little old Ms. Brown' helped clear your files later.\" \"Little!? Old!? Corinne Brown may be the most beautiful redhead who ever walked a planet!\" \"Yeah. Make sure you don't let on you knew it. I worked very hard setting him up for it.\" \"Ooh. Does he do this often, Clete?\" \"I haven't been around him long enough to know, but from the way he's enjoying it, I'd say as often as he thinks he can get away with it.\" \"Ms. Brown. Our dad must really be something.\" Gallant got back to Alice quite late. He very carefully told Lane about 'sweet little old Ms. Brown' helping get rid of Dutch's files. He could have cheerfully strangled Telas when he added, \"Yes, your dad charmed her socks off.\" He began to realize he'd been had when the three boys collapsed in giggles in a corridor just beyond the main control room. **** \"DAD! Lane's having a nightmare and it's bad! Real bad.\" \"Where, Clete? I don't even know which room he chose.\" \"Come on. Hurry. That one.\" He pulled him out of sleep and into his arms. It was the first time he'd truly held one of his children. The rightness of it washed over him. \"Easy, Lane, easy. Tell me.\" \"I can't. It'll come and it'll pass, but I can't talk about it now.\" \"Not a nightmare, a future event.\" \"That's what all my nightmares are.\" \"Do you have them often?\" \"Too often. The closer the event, the worse they get. I know one day they'll stop. Well, they won't happen very often. Sorry, Clete, bad enough I have them. You waking up in a cold sweat and terror that isn't even your own isn't fair. But I can't do anything about it.\" \"Yes you can. Break the cycle. Do something to change it.\" \"Dad, I can't.\" \"You can and someday you will.\" \"If he doesn't, I will.\" \"Hello, Dutch. Woke you too.\" \"Something did. Something like cold breath on the back of my neck.\" \"WHEN?!\" \"Just now. Dad, what is it?\" \"We're leaving. This minute. TELAS! Clete, find him and see where he wants to go. We're out of here. NOW!\" He knew what the cold breath meant. Something about his sons was enough force for change the powers were involved. He fought the Dark One as the personification of anti-life in his own universe, but he was not the power of the destructive force. Like a ship cutting through water, his sons were increasing the possibilities for life to exist in some way and the bow wave of circumstance was exerting more pressure. There was no Dark One in Dutch's universe. The cold breath said, \"Chance is aligning against you. The 'dark power' has taken a hand.\" **** \"You have to give us Alice for a few days.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"There's something we have to do.\" \"Lane, I'm not giving you my ship without more explanation than that.\" \"We have to find the third Athena.\" \"Where is she?!\" \"Easy, Dad. She's my mother. We'll take her to you, but it's a long way in your future.\" \"I want to go with you.\" \"Sorry, it has to be just us. You have something else to do.\" \"Which is?\" \"Save a world.\" How had he let Lane talk him into this? He didn't like cold damp places. Especially cold damp places with bars and chains. He sighed and wondered how he was supposed to save this world. He'd gone straight from a stroll in the forest to a dungeon in chains. Not a great deal of world-saving opportunity in a journey of less than ten minutes with thirty guards. Oh, my. Dark-haired and beautiful! \"Visitors. How nice. Excuse me, but I'd like to discuss these chains.\" \"Be quiet! Where was he found?\" \"He walked out of the sacred grove.\" \"Then why is he alive?\" \"Because, Lady, he didn't walk into it.\" \"Get him down! Now! Attire him appropriately and bring him to me.\" Well, step one. He was being unchained. He wasn't extremely pleased with all the touching that seemed to be involved in the process, but the women were removing the... chains. He found it very difficult to concentrate on the architecture of the interesting building. The occupants were very distracting and all seemed to be female. He didn't have any difficulty paying attention when he was guided before the woman who had ordered him freed. \"Yes, I can see it now.\" \"Would someone please tell me what you're all muttering about?\" \"You have been prophesied. You will save us.\" \"Well, that's what I was told I was supposed to be doing. Close that window, please. I'm cold. Your idea of appropriate attire and mine seem to be quite different. Oh! Now, wait a minute!\" He didn't quite know what to do. He couldn't bring himself to hit any of them. They were so much smaller than he was. It would have been like hitting half-grown girls. Some of them were half-grown girls. Just before he stopped thinking about anything, she appeared in his mind, laughed and said, \"Save them, Gallant. Only you can. They will save their world.\" **** Lane grinned when his father walked through the door. The scenery he saw through it when it opened was lovely. He wouldn't tell him all of where they'd been or what they'd done. None of them ever would. Neither would Alice. She understood he wouldn't really want to know. \"Hello, Dad. I see you saved them.\" \"They say I did, Lane, but I don't really know.\" \"Dad, if you hadn't, that grove would not be standing.\" \"Rather an unusual way to... save a sacred grove. Where are Clete and Dutch?\" \"We're on our way to get them. Clete's preventing a murder.\" \"Whose murder?\" \"Auri, Aurora, got herself into a mess. He's going to be in rough shape when we get him.\" \"Injured?\" \"Not yet.\" \"You've lost me.\" \"It's his culture. He's going to fall apart on us. Dutch will do his best, but he won't be able to stop him.\" Gallant stared after the boy who had laughed wildly, then run into the corridors of the part of Alice he called the maze. The wild laugh had been startling, but hadn't bothered him near as much as the deep sobs that he'd heard as Lane had disappeared into the vast labyrinth of the ship. She was landing. Dutch ran in, pulling Clete behind him. \"Help me with him. It was the only way to save her, but he's almost catatonic. She told him you'd come for her before they made up their minds what to do about it.\" \"Do about what?!\" \"The sacrifice. He kept her from being sacrificed.\" \"How?\" \"How do you keep a woman from playing the role of virgin sacrifice?\" \"Oh, I see. But why is he in such bad shape?\" \"Just before we left, she told him who she is.\" \"Terrific. Now, if you'll tell me who she is, we'll all know.\" \"Lane's sister. Our sister.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"It gets worse. She told him she'd name their son Connell.\" \"Oh, brother. His culture has very strict taboos about these things, with good reason. Now I know why Lane ran. I need to find him.\" \"Dad, he said good-by to us. He said you'd send him away. It's not his fault. CLETE! Damn! I'll go after him.\" Gallant finished putting in the coordinates for the most peaceful place he knew. He had a mess on his hands and Lane had as much as said it would get worse. He needed to know what that 'worse' was. He'd barely begun to look for him when he heard Clete, then Dutch, scream in his mind. He'd wondered if they could at need. He ran for them. He suddenly realized Lane was right behind him. Dutch was near incoherent. \"I couldn't stop him!\" \"Give me that!\" He grabbed the medunit from Lane and went to work on the son who had tried to kill himself. It was going to be close. He spared just enough attention to notice Lane holding Dutch and calming him. So, he knew he'd be sent away, did he? The nightmares! He now knew what they were about. Within a few minutes, he was sure his son would live. When he finished repairing the damage he'd done to himself with a knife, he stepped back, took a deep breath and realized Lane was no longer in the room. \"Dutch, where's Lane?\" \"He said he had to get ready. Dad, he told me to tell Clete he'd miss him. And Auri had always known. Change things. Please, Dad.\" \"Dutch, he set Clete up for this. He knew this would happen.\" Dutch grabbed his arm and as he turned for the door. He was so angry he almost threw him aside. It shocked him enough to stop him. \"Dad, think! It's not like that. He's carried it inside his whole life. He doesn't think anything can change. Auri didn't either. Dad, he thinks he'll spend fifty years in Earth's past. Alone, Dad, until Clete and I find him. I'm not supposed to tell you.\" \"Yes, that's where I'd take him. About mid-twentieth century. I always liked it there. You can let go, Dutch. My mind is working. I'm going to move Clete to the surgery. I'm going to put restraints on him. I want you to stay with him.\" It didn't take him long to find Lane. He was lying on the floor of the command center, curled around a pack. \"Were you planning on going somewhere?\" \"Please, just do it. I've already reset the coordinates.\" \"Hmm. Earth. Nineteen forty-two. Oh! You're planning on helping build the Alaska highway. Too bad. They'll just have to manage without you.\" \"What?\" Gallant sat down on the floor next to his son. He looked terribly confused. It was an improvement. \"You're not leaving. It would probably be easier than facing Clete, but I think it's necessary you do so.\" \"You can't... change the future.\" \"I already have. Several times. Done a bit of past changing too. Come here, Son.\" Gallant pulled Lane into his arms and held him as he cried. He was very thankful Dutch had stopped him and 'thumped' him for being so angry. He was also thankful Telas had told him just enough to assure he paid attention to the thump. He didn't pursue the thought there had to be a reason he'd allowed Clete to be injured. Why hadn't he done something to change it before? Hadn't he known? Why had Clete been so overwhelmed by the culture of his world that he'd tried to kill himself? His mother was human and flat practical about such things. There had to be something adding to the horror. Something his strongly empathic son had felt from someone else? From Lane? His sister? Or him? Who had added just enough shock to make him grasp the knife? He was only sure it hadn't been Dutch. \"Dad... I'm... It's all changing. Dizzy.\" \"Easy, Lane, open your mind to me. I'll help you ride it out.\" He entered his son's mind and saw the wild spirit beneath the tightly controlled and slightly cool surface. He withdrew when the images began to settle. He didn't want to know the future. \"Thank you.\" \"Lane, you're very much my son. You're also as much a victim of this as Clete is. Now, we'd better get to him. Alice isn't going to put us down anywhere until we're ready, then she'll take us to a favorite spot of mine.\" \"Disneyland. Nineteen fifty-nine. Is that why Alice looks like a little silver travel trailer most of the time?\" \"I don't know. It's her choice. I do rather like it though. Rolled awning, wheels and all. I spent nearly a hundred years on Earth once. Towed her behind a car and explored North America.\" \"Motorcycles!\" \"Yes, those too. I have several of different types. Racing and doing stunt shows was a good excuse to travel and paid enough I didn't constantly have to worry about running out of money.\" \"Easier than the rock shoveling I thought I'd be doing. I couldn't even have gone to school. The first time someone got a stethoscope on me... \" \"Yes. You'd have spent all your time hiding what you are. You don't have my power. I just hypnotized doctors into forgetting I had two hearts.\" \"You fought in their wars.\" \"Several of them. Seemed like every time I changed identities, I got drafted. Very long ago, but I still remember. Especially Korea and Vietnam. Not good memories.\" \"Why did you do it?\" \"I could save lives. Some that lived through those wars wouldn't have if I hadn't been their sergeant. But I took lives too. Too many.\" \"You once told me you were a hippie.\" \"I went back and joined protests against racism and Vietnam. I didn't like the drug scene, but I liked the ideals of love and peace. Liked the music too.\" \"A red Gibson Les Paul and a clear Dan Armstrong bass. I've seen them.\" \"That bass put blisters on my fingers, but it has the most incredible tone. Lane, when do I find her?\" \"Dad, Mom's not the girl of your dreams, but she'll make you incredibly happy. She dies, but it's not really death. She has to go back to where we found her.\" \"But you said… I don't understand.\" \"I can't explain it. She's... something else, but she came to you as a woman, a human woman.\" \"The girl of my dreams. She's going to haunt me for another ten thousand years, isn't she?\" \"No, Dad, forever. But always with the promise of someday. She comes again right after Mom leaves.\" \"Admitting that's reassuring feels distinctly odd. Clete's going to wake up soon.\" \"Dad, open yourself to Clete and Dutch. They need to know you. Just as I did.\" \"I want to know them too.\" Gallant took them to Disneyland, then to other places he loved. He began to get into very good condition as he helped Clete get back into it. Then he took them fishing and relaxed just a bit too much. \"NO!\" \"Ah, the slave. You see slave, I have found your children. I've spent nearly one hundred years hunting you. Since you have children, I know it's been longer for you. You should have stayed away. I wouldn't have pursued you. You meant nothing. I had those telepaths at my feet. They were mine! Then you came. Three boys. They'll ease the irritation I felt the times I thought I'd killed you, then discovered you were still alive.\" \"Please, Hensk, Lord Master, spare them. I beg you. I will give my pledge to serve you and never seek escape.\" \"Don't be foolish. I already have you. We will return to the world I left a hundred years ago. They will hold you. The Dark One shall reign. Nothing will stop it. Rorisk will love your pretty boys. I think I'll loan you all to him.\" \"No, I won't allow you to do that.\" \"Did you know I had you altered? I won't have to wait long for these. They're probably capable of siring children now. I'll have them stimmed and try them with females of other species until I find one cross-fertile. You obviously did. It should be a very interesting process. Now, what is the best way to do this? Ah, I have it. You three put these chains on, or I will kill your father.\" Turning the weapon on Gallant was a mistake. He charged it. He expected to die, but Hensk would never get another shot off. His sons would kill him. He wondered how he'd found them. He felt the shot. Clete held on against the storm of emotion. He had to get through to the brother who was the source of it. \"Kill him! Do it now. Do it, Lane. Think about who he is. What he is. What he did to Dad. Kill him.\" \"Clete, I--\" \"DO IT!\" \"Yes. For my father.\" \"All right. Now, you check Dutch. I'll... Oh, damn. Lane, try to get over the changes. Past them. Whatever. I need you. They're both alive, but that's all I know.\" \"Go. They're not settling. It's uncertain. Dad. Help Dad. I'll... check Dutch. Medunit. Get unit. Call Alice. She'll--\" \"ALICE! Alice, help me!\" Clete said thank you many times in the not quite hour that seemed like many. Most of the thanks were to his mother. He knew when Lane began to regain consciousness and was beside him with a nourishing broth she'd taught him to make when he opened his eyes. \"Fishing trip. Vacation. Some vacation. Drink.\" \"Clete?\" \"Check your memories, Lane. They're both going to make it. Good thing I ran out of things to read and got into Mom's medical texts.\" \"Dad's in trance.\" \"Yeah. I used the medunit on him to help him along. Dutch knocked the blaster down just enough. Missed his head. Ah, Dutch is coming around. I'm in love with Alice. Aren't I, Sweetheart? She came. Just... materialized around us. Left Hensk outside. Still there I guess. Drink the rest. It's a good vitamin and mineral mix with more calories than you'd think. Got to get to Dutch. He'll wake up screaming for Dad.\" \"Let him know he saved him. Fastest move I've ever seen anyone make. Other than Dad.\" \"Yeah. Other than Dad. Later.\" Clete walked into Dutch's room and took his hand. He forced himself to calm. Dutch wasn't even fully conscious yet and he was already desperately worried. \"Dad's alive! He'll make it! Take it easy. You saved him. He's hurt, but he'll live.\" \"I couldn't let him die, Clete. I... love him so much.\" \"That is obvious. Dutch, you moved faster than humanly possible. Much faster.\" \"I've always been fast. They say Mom was.\" \"No, Dutch. We've been training together for weeks. You never moved at anything like that speed. You may be as fast as Dad. How's your head?\" \"Brother empath, you know. Thumping. Tell me the story.\" \"You hit the barrel and he creamed you with the stock.\" \"Hensk?\" \"Lane took the weapon and killed him. Wasn't easy. He finally went all cool and did it. Said, \"For my father.\" Went clear out afterward. Pretty heavy change, I guess. Surprised he held up as long as he did. He went dizzy as soon as that creep came out of the trees.\" \"Weird, Clete. Didn't that guy know it wouldn't work? If Dad hadn't escaped, he wouldn't have us. If he didn't have us, Hensk couldn't take us.\" \"I don't think he cared. Dutch, all he wanted was to have Dad beg for us. He planned on killing him anyway. Just wanted him to grovel at his feet.\" \"And he did.\" \"For us. Offered himself up in bondage in exchange, then tried to give his life. Yeah. Tried. He charged straight in. I felt him intend to die. He was too scared for us to think. If he died, Lane wouldn't exist. I'd still be at home. You'd still be in a Fed school.\" \"Would we? Or do we sort of exist in our own timestream? We took Lane's mother to Dad. What if... What if I couldn't... get her? Would he have just disappeared from between us?\" \"No answers, Dutch. Maybe it was always supposed to happen this way. As for his mother, she was trying desperately to break through. Never felt anyone... thing, whatever, want someone like she wanted Dad.\" \"Even I could feel it. Well, now what?\" \"We wait for Dad to wake up surprised to wake up.\" \"Yeah, the nicest kind of surprise. How… \" \"Pretty bad. He'll be under awhile.\" Gallant was as surprised as Clete expected. He made sure they were all leaning over him, right where he'd see them as soon as he opened his eyes, but he almost landed on him when the rush of relief hit him. \"You're all here.\" \"Yes. And so are you. Hensk isn't. The last one is gone, Dad. Lane 'remembered' you telling him the code and blew the ship. Dutch yelped and we lit out. Said he felt something.\" \"Where are we, Clete?\" \"Ask Lane. He set the coordinates.\" \"Ophidus sector. Nice and quiet.\" \"My home world is near here.\" \"That's why it's quiet. Safest place I could think of.\" \"OK. Enough. Sleep. You're exhausted.\" \"Not yet, Clete. How?\" \"Seems Dutch inherited more than your good looks. He moves fast.\" \"Who killed Hensk?\" \"I did.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"I'm not, but I didn't enjoy it.\" \"Good. I'm afraid I would have.\" \"Damn it, Dad. Sleep!\" \"Yes, Clete, and well. But hugs first. Dutch?\" \"Wow, first even. Sleep, Dad. We love you.\" He did. Soundly. For six days. Strangely, it was almost two full days longer than he'd tranced. He deserved it. He'd spent his life pursuing the servants of the Dark One he'd allowed into the universe. He'd still run into them now and again, but he could reverse any damage they did and run. He knew they would all be destroyed. Now he was truly free to begin fighting the Dark One himself. **** Dutch didn't know how he knew what the sudden shock had been, but he did. He ran out of his room yelling. \"Lane! Something's happened to Dad! Damn! Clete! Lane's out cold! Bring him! We've got to find Dad!\" They found him deep in Alice beside a small pool of clear water. Dutch wasn't sure how he'd found him either. He'd just run in the direction that 'felt' right, but he'd been to the pool before. \"He came to the pool, Dutch. I could swear... Dutch, I looked for this the other day. I swear it wasn't--\" \"There are a lot of odd things in this ship, Clete. Lane's told me about a few of them. He even told me where some of them were. I didn't find a meadow he talked about either. He's out cold too. Doesn't seem to be... Clete, he has a sword in his hand. He's holding it tight, but it's too cold for me to touch. Both shoulders of his shirt just crumbled when I moved him.\" \"Like they were dipped in liquid nitro. Dutch, he's ice cold.\" \"His hearts are beating steady.\" \"He's coming around.\" \"Dad! Dad, wake up! What happened?\" \"Hello. Did you hear them?\" \"Hear?\" \"The voices, Dutch. The music. I followed it here, then... NO! I don't want to be... Too late. I already gave my oath. Made the choice. Did it ten thousand years ago. Never expected to have it made official. I hate being drafted!\" \"You may hate being drafted, but you're extremely proud and rather overawed at the moment.\" \"Too accurate, Clete. My shoulders hurt. How's Lane?\" \"Coming around. Could you please give us an explanation?\" \"Someone, who called himself my father-in-law, just knighted me. Informed me I was Knight Hero and had been chosen to protect this universe. Said I'd been doing it long enough to prove I was capable of it. Hello, Lane, I think I just met your grandfather.\" He kept them with him for more than a year. Taught them and trained them to fight at his side. Laughed with them and shouted at them. And learned to love them too well. Not long after he nearly lost Dutch to a horror even he couldn't have survived, he took them to Dutch's universe, where it didn't exist, and left them on the Curie. Captain Merris was rather surprised, but promised to get them into the academy. He hunted Telas. He had a gift he wanted him to give them. He returned to his own universe aching with the pain of farewell.",

      "content": "Chapter Three Lane handed his captain his resignation and waited while he read it. \"I must say, this is something I would never have expected, Lieutenant.\" \"I know, Sir. It's necessary or I wouldn't do it.\" \"You're a fine officer. I hate to lose you, but I wish you every success. When do you want this to become effective?\" \"The day after tomorrow, Sir.\" \"Very well, Lieutenant. I will so enter it. Would you like me to order transport for you?\" \"No, Sir, that will take care of itself.\" \"The day after tomorrow.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Lane walked out of the lift just as the blip appeared on the tech's screen. That was as far as his future memory could be trusted. He intended to change everything he remembered after it. \"Captain, we have a ship on long range scanners. I'm trying to establish communications, but I haven't received a response.\" \"Any information on the type of craft?\" \"No, Sir.\" \"Captain, you won't receive a response. That ship doesn't belong here. I know how it got here and can get it back. The occupant is dying and needs my assistance. I ask that you transport me aboard at maximum range.\" \"I would like more information, Mr. Gallant.\" \"Just Lane, Captain. He needs me. That ship is my transport. It's weaponless and, at the moment, defenseless.\" \"Lane, if this request came from anyone else, I'd probably deny it. Will you notify me when you're safely aboard?\" \"Yes, Captain, I will.\" The captain stood and walked over to the young man who had so recently been one of his finest officers. He shook his hand. \"Take care of yourself. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say you will be missed.\" A chorus of affirmation from the other members of the bridge crew followed his words. Lane smiled at the people he'd known and worked with for three years, some of them longer. \"You'll hear from me again, Captain, and some of you, I shall see again. Good journeys to you all.\" He turned and left the bridge. It had hurt to resign the fleet, but he knew the time had come, had known it would come. He was ready, but it still hurt and there was another goodbye that was going to be even harder. The transporter chief was his best friend and wasn't going to just let him beam out of his life. \"Lane, I want to know what's going on.\" \"Mick, it's time for me to start work in the family business. I'm needed. You know how it is with me. I've seen things coming. That ship out there is the beginning of a series of events that must be changed. I can't change them as an officer in the fleet. I have to be outside the rules.\" \"We're going to lose two other officers too, aren't we? You're going to get your brothers.\" \"Mick, are you sure you don't see the future?\" Mick smiled. It was an old joke. One that they'd shared since they had become friends three years before. \"Take care of yourself and keep in touch or I'll hunt you down and break your arm.\" \"I'll be in touch, Mick. Good journeys.\" \"Good journeys.\" Lane smiled at the closest friend he'd ever had, other than his brothers and father, as the transporter hummed into function. He would keep in touch with him. If he survived the next ten minutes. He started moving as soon as he materialized. The beam hit the place he had been. \"I'm here to help! I know where you're from! I can save your life and get you back! Don't you think this ship has enough--\" He dove behind the console. \"Damage without you shooting up the bridge! My name's Lane!\" That had been too close. \"Yours is Pethnar. I can see--\" He dashed across an open space. \"The future! If you don't kill me, we both have one!\" He waited a few moments, then slowly stood with his hands in the air. \"That's better. See, no weapons. First we need to cancel the self-destruct. I can get you home, if you'll just let me.\" The man nodded, then folded. Lane raced for the engine room. He had a very short time to cancel the self-destruct. He grabbed the cutter out of his pocket and ripped a panel off. He clipped a connector and yanked off another panel. He pulled out a circuit board and ran back to the bridge. He dove under the central computer console and clipped two more connectors, scrambled up and hit the sequence on the pilot's board. The self-destruct stopped ticking. He'd have taken time for a sigh of relief if he'd been able to afford it. He pulled his pilfered medical supplies out and went to work on the severely injured anthropoid. He wished his former captain would give him a few minutes. The constant beep of the communications console was a distraction. He reached up with one hand, opened a channel, said, \"I'm real busy. Call you back,\" and snapped it closed. It stopped beeping. He took time for his sigh of relief. He'd made it. The young man would live. He held back the dizziness and carried him to a cabin. He struggled back to the bridge and opened a channel. They were waiting. \"Hello, Captain. I'm all right, just had a great deal to do. I've saved the pilot, but it was close. I want to report you're short some medical equipment.\" \"You don't sound all right, Lane. Are you sure? I don't suppose that ship has visual capabilities. We'd like to see you.\" \"Ordinarily it does, but it's going to take a bit of repair. I'm just out of breath. I've been moving pretty fast. I have an operable ship and am about to get underway. Safe journeys, Captain. Thanks for standing by. Give my best to the crew. Parth ship Elpeth out.\" \"Lane, wait! The medical supplies will be listed as humanitarian aid to injured lifeforms. Wouldn't want to add a negative postscript to an otherwise perfect record. Besides, I already filed it. You know how I hate to recall closed files. Federation ship Omaki out. Lane smiled, then groaned as his head spun. He forced himself to relax and let his consciousness float above the shifting images in his mind. He had changed the future. He would wait until the images settled, then see if it had been enough. Lane pushed aside the future memory that was no longer true and followed the one he'd created with the change. He moved the injured young man to a bed, then sat down beside him and waited for him to open his eyes. \"Hello, Pethnar. I can feel you trying to communicate, but I'm not getting anything but your name and a few disconnected images. My dad is the real telepath in the family. Nod if you want me to take you home. I thought so. I know how you got here and I can get you back. I don't think you'll be in too much trouble. Your dad's going to be too happy to see you. You rest. I'll get steering and navigation back on line. Should be back in your own universe in a few hours.\" Lane started on the repairs. The bridge looked bad, but the damage Pethnar had done while shooting at him was mostly superficial. The real problem would be in rebuilding the defensive system. He checked the seal on the patch Pethnar had made. It looked good. He was glad he'd been able to save him. Anybody who had worked as hard as he had to survive deserved to make it. **** \"Hi, you look better. Just in time to help me clear some of this out of the way.\" Lane watched Pethnar kick a crumpled strut with a jagged end. \"Yeah. It put a nasty hole in you. Take it easy. I fixed the hole, but you lost a lot of blood. I do need you to sit on this piece while I move this one. The minute I took the weight off, it would fly up and try to take my head off.\" Pethnar grinned and made dusting motions and a bit of a show of sitting very carefully on the beam Lane had indicated. Lane laughed and removed a mass of metal from beside him. \"Good. One end. Slide down it and let it rise slowly. All right. Now we can get the rest of this out of the way. Our bow is unstrung. You don't understand the reference? Well, the weight on both ends of the beam bowed it across the debris in the middle. There was an ancient weapon that used a piece of wood... Ah, you get it now.\" The defensive shields were put back on line and Lane set course for the doorway between the universes. Pethnar had come through it by accident and it had saved his life. All Lane could do was go back through and hope the patrol that had attacked Pethnar was gone. He was sure they were. He didn't see them in his future, but he knew things could change. He used things in ship construction record to get the sample needed for his translator and practiced the language, not just words he would say. **** \"Parthan ship Elpeth calling Parth. Come in, please.\" \"Parth control. Who is this?\" \"My name's Lane Gallant. The prince is on board and safe. This ship was attacked and he was injured, but he's all right now. We'd like a pick up. He made an emergency patch and it's a good one, but we don't want to tempt fate by trying it out on a surface landing.\" \"We've got you. Establish an orbit. The king just ran out of here. I'd say he was on his way. Thank you. We're mighty fond of our prince. Parth control out.\" Lane laughed and thumped Pethnar on the back. Pethnar grinned at him. \"I told you he wouldn't be mad. Just make sure you tell him you won't be taking any more experimental ships for a joy ride. I imagine he's going to keep one hand on you for a few days just to make sure you're really here.\" He laughed at Pethnar's expression. \"Yeah, overprotective. Probably why you took the ship in the first place. Thought so. I'll do what I can to help. You really saved your own life. I just brought the medical equipment on board. Don't shake your head at me. I didn't slap a patch on that wall with a hole in my side and I didn't outmaneuver the bunch that attacked this ship.\" \"Parth ship Denvith calling Elpeth. Come in, please.\" \"Elpeth here. That was quick.\" \"The king was in a hurry. We're going to take Elpeth aboard. It'll be a tight fit. Want us to send a pilot?\" \"No, the prince is as good as anybody you could send and I'm fair help. Give us speed and course. We'll be there.\" Pethnar grinned and shook his head. Lane was much more than fair help. He was better than anyone he'd ever seen. He just wished he could really say thank you to him, but he couldn't. He was telepathic with his own race, as were the majority of his people. They were beginning to adapt to it and he was one of those 'more advanced.' He no longer agreed with that designation. He had never really wished he could speak, until he hadn't been able to communicate with the ships that attacked him. When he hadn't answered, they had decided he was hostile. Now, he wished it again. He 'touched' his father, showed him Lane and his feeling for him. Lane gave the pilot's chair to Pethnar and took the operations console. He began reading off course and speed corrections. The little ship entered the hold of the big transport and landed with barely a bump. They got an all clear and opened the hatch. Pethnar grinned at Lane. His father was on his way across the hold at a dead run. He would tell him thank you for them both. **** \"Your Majesty, I really do need to go back.\" \"Call me Jessar, Lane. I think of you as a good friend of the family. Pethnar agrees. He really wants you to stay.\" \"I'd like to, but I can't. I do need to ask a large favor though. I need a ship. A small one. The doorway between the universes was a tight fit for the Elpeth. I also ask you remove all record of its coordinates. It's a secret that must be carefully kept.\" \"How did you know about it?\" \"My father created it. It's our way to visit home.\" \"Who is your father?\" \"Gallant. That's another secret that must be carefully kept. For his safety and mine. He has enemies who would be very happy to use me to get to him. I probably shouldn't have told you.\" \"Sir, we are most honored you have trusted us. Pethnar says he'll miss you, but do it your way. I agree. I have just the ship for you. You'll like her. I do. Panbath! Order Lissa prepared. Make sure she's fully stocked. Have her ready by... Is dawn soon enough? Dawn tomorrow. Make sure all the new equipment is functioning properly. Put Ardth in charge of the preparations. Now, I think a party is in order, don't you?\" **** Lane was delighted. The little ship was an absolute jewel. She had been the king's personal ship. She was sleek, clean and tastefully appointed. She was also faster than anything else her size. She was set up for a crew of three, perfect for his needs. He wasn't sure how he felt about her extensive armament, but knew it would be needed. Her shields were good, but he would make major improvements in them. He would also make her capable of things no other ship in the universe could do, but for that he would need his brothers. He smiled widely when his comm to the fleet ship was answered. Clete's 'range' kept getting longer. \"Hi, Clete. I need you. I'm sorry to give you such short notice.\" \"It'll take me a few hours. My captain won't be happy. I'll give him my resignation and say my farewells. I knew this would come someday. Do you want me to message Dutch?\" \"Yes. Tell him to kiss the ladies farewell. We'll pick him up in three days.\" \"That's some ship. Not many could get there that fast.\" \"She's a gem, Clete, but as soon as we get Dutch, we need to do some modifications. We'll be doing most of them ourselves. Say hello to Godfather for me.\" \"I will. Ride our shadow. We've been running nervous. See you soon.\" Lane tucked under the big starship and took a nap. He'd been running nervous too. Things were very tense close to neutral space. He was awakened by the comm call. \"Nelson calling Lissa. Come in, please.\" \"Lissa here. Hello, Telas. It's good to see you.\" \"I'm pleased to see you too. Clete's preparing to beam over. May I inquire why you've chosen to resign?\" \"It's time to carry on the family tradition.\" \"Understood. I've prepared something that should be of assistance. Clete's bringing it. It's coded. I don't believe you'll have difficulty in finding the key. If you see Alice, give her my regards.\" Lane smiled. He knew what the key was. Telas had made sure he 'realized' it, rather than 'remembered' it. He knew he'd enjoy it. \"I shall. Good journeys, Telas.\" \"Safe journeys to you. Say hello to Dutch for me. Clete is transporting now.\" \"Hi, Lane. What a mix. I get the pleasure, but what's got you so worried?\" \"I'll explain my emotional state once we're underway, Clete. We've got some changes to make and not a lot of time. Get on ops. I'll take con.\" \"Done.\" Clete grinned widely when Dutch transported aboard and pulled both his brothers into a hug. He'd felt Lane's tightly controlled impatience and hunger to be near him growing. His own wasn't quite as strong, but it was close. He'd actually felt it when Dutch got the message they were coming. \"I've missed you guys. Clete knows how much of an understatement that is. Guess this means we've got work to do. Captain said hello. Didn't even act surprised when I resigned. Said he knew it would come eventually.\" \"What's the relief I feel?\" \"Well, Clete, there are two lovely ladies who think I should make a choice... \" Lane and Clete burst into laughter. Dutch hadn't changed. Neither had his pleasure in their laughter. Clete pulled them into another hug. It was what they both really wanted. \"Clete, pull that info up. Let's see what he gave us. The key is Wabbit.\" Clete and Dutch smiled widely. It was a story Gallant had told while Telas was with them and it did seem rather appropriate. Lane returned their smiles. It felt so very good to be together again. The Gallant boys were on the loose and the universe was about to change. **** \"It's all here, Lane. Everything. Specs, power requirements, circuit diagrams. Everything. Some things we won't be able to use. They tap a source of energy that doesn't exist in this universe.\" \"Not so, Dutch. We'll tap through the doorway. He'll know it's us. We have to be able to travel. Too much depends on it. I remember us doing it.\" \"This is going to take work. And we'll have to do it all ourselves. We'll build inside Lissa's shell. Start with the dimensional matrix. Give us room to work. Need things. Hmm... One of the nonaligned worlds as base. That means we'll need credits.\" \"We'll do runs as a courier in the Amarri system.\" \"Oh, brother! Lane, that is one hot war you want to put us in the middle of. Blockade runners have a short life expectancy.\" \"He's right, Lane. The pay is high because so few live to collect it.\" \"I know, Clete, but we need the credit.\" \"There's more to it than that. I can feel it.\" \"That's the problem with having an empath around. All right. It's iffy. I've got multiple images of the future. The packets and passenger we carry could end that war. If we get through. Getting through will depend on the shields. Ending the war will depend on you.\" \"Uh, oh, Clete, I think you're in trouble. Even I could feel the worry in that statement.\" \"Yes. Let's get to work on the shields. We'll need them to present ourselves for employment.\" \"Lane, you haven't told me what I'm supposed to do yet. You dread telling me. I'm not moving til I know.\" \"Dutch, get started. We'll be with you in a few minutes.\" \"Now, wait a minute!\" \"Dutch, if he doesn't kill me, we'll be there.\" \"Oh. All right. Clete, remember, he knows how it turns out. He can't help it. Count to ten thousand. I don't think ten will be enough.\" **** Dutch walked onto the bridge and knew he hadn't changed things yet because Lane was expecting him. He still intended to make one though. \"Lane, I've had it. It's like a polar zone between you two. I can't function in this atmosphere. I'm freezing. I can't stay out of it any longer. I want to know what's going on.\" \"Dutch, it'll work out. It's necessary. He'll get through it. It's going to be rough. Be there when he needs you. He'll even forgive me someday.\" \"Some explanation. Dammit, Lane, I want more!\" \"I asked him, no, told him to do something that goes against every instinct he has. Everything he is. I'm counting on him to finish the job right. If he does, the war will end. If he can't do it, it's going to pull more systems in, then the Empire, then the Federation.\" \"It's why you pulled us out. You saw it coming.\" \"Yes. I stalled it. I rescued the young man piloting the experimental ship that would have been the trigger. Even after he engaged the self-destruct, there would have been enough left to... I hoped that would be it, but it wasn't. There's only one image that leads out of interstellar warfare. It depends on Clete making a woman who fears him love him. Love him so much she'll do anything for him. Love him enough to live for him.\" \"I'll get back to work. I'll be there, Lane, but you be there too. He won't get through it without you. You understand. I can only care.\" \"He won't want me. I don't remember being there.\" \"Good. I'm making this change. Same way I helped make the first one when you thought you were going bye-bye.\" Lane stared at him with his mouth open. \"Dad didn't need much, Lane. Just a reminder you'd already lived with the pain long enough.\" \"Dutch, you're amazing.\" \"Yeah. And cute too.\" **** Clete raised an eyebrow at Lane, but he just smiled. He hoped he was right. Dutch was getting very irritated with the Chair of the Planetary Assembly. \"I think the fact we're here is reference enough! If we couldn't get through the blockade, we'd be space dust!\" \"Dutch, calm down. I don't think the chairman meant it quite that way. He doesn't know who we are. It's a little hard to trust strangers who drop in and say, 'Give us your secrets to carry,' in the middle of a war.\" \"You're right, Lane. Being a fleet officer spoiled me. I got used to people knowing I was loyal, dependable, trustworthy, and well-trained as soon as they saw the uniform.\" \"You were a Federation Fleet officer?\" \"We all were, Gen. Lane decided you needed help, then he decided we should help too. We're here. Now let us help.\" \"I shall make arrangements for you to begin immediately. Please, accept our hospitality. Quarters will be assigned until we have a mission for you.\" \"Thank you, Gen.\" As soon as they left the council hall, Lane started to laugh. Dutch grinned. \"Nothing like telling an old lady you're a Boy Scout to convince her to let you carry her packages. Now, let's find where they keep the pretty ladies on this world.\" Clete burst into laughter too. Dutch thought it sounded wonderful and his grin widened. He left them leaning against a wall laughing. They'd catch up. **** Lane warned Dutch another hit was coming. He just couldn't dodge them all. \"Shields full.\" \"Eighty percent max!\" Lissa rocked with the force of the blast, but Lane got her steadied fast. They had a long way to go and he was trying to make a change. But he couldn't find one that didn't lead to a sudden end of the path. \"Make that sixty. Lane, we've got to shoot back. Clete, take over ops. I'll take the gun. Give it to me on manual, Lane.\" \"I don't-- Damn! He's already gone.\" \"He's right, Lane. Incoming. Aft shield down. Compensating. We're at thirty-two percent. We don't get that fighter off our tail, we've-- Shields off! Go, Dutch! YES! Shields up. We've got another one. Not anymore. Damn! I hope he knows what he's doing. Evasive, Lane! Dutch, routine A on three, two, one... NOW!\" The little ship had never fired back before. She'd run the blockade time after time and never fired a shot. This time they'd been waiting. The admiral had decided to take her out. Half a fleet could have gotten through the holes left in the blockade. He'd sent every ship with any kind of a chance at catching her after her. Half a fleet did get through. A fleet of cargo ships. The desperately needed supply ships opened a hole a little wider and sped through it toward the planet. The little ship had done her job and the admiral had lost his. She'd also reduced the strength of the blockade by eighteen ships. \"Nice work, Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Aren't you going to say anything, Lane?\" \"Do you really want me to say it?! I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You're right. We wouldn't have made it without the gun. I was hoping for a change. I guess... I was just hoping we could avoid killing anyone.\" \"So was I. Lane, we had to do it. The people on the planet need those medical supplies desperately. For every life lost up here, a thousand will be saved on Amarri. If it had been weapons they were trying to get through, I'd have told them to stuff it. Nice piloting.\" \"Ahem.\" \"Yeah, Clete, I know. You're the one who made us practice until every zig and zag was perfect. Worked too. I knew exactly where I'd be after every maneuver. Now, how long til touchdown? I've got dates and I need a bath.\" \"Twins again, Dutch?\" \"Nope. Triplets.\" \"I don't suppose you'd want to share.\" \"Clete, you've got to be kidding!\" \"I am. Touchdown in twelve minutes.\" Laire wasn't extremely young, but she was young to have been given the task of seeking the one ally the assembly was sure would end the war. She was pleased they thought her the right choice and didn't disagree with the assembly on that point, but she really wished there was another world that offered as much hope of it. She put aside her irritation at that and worked on the proposal. Then her office door opened and her level of irritation went up another notch. She didn't like being interrupted and didn't want her office cleaned, but it was fourday, the time scheduled for her lunch and Missa had a schedule too. She almost wished she did want lunch. Missa's mother and hers were old friends and she'd known her since she was a child. \"You're so lucky, Laire. A tenday with the three of them.\" \"I'm not looking forward to it.\" \"What?! You're about to spend ten days with three beautiful, blond, eligible men and you're not looking forward to it?\" \"Unlike you, Missa, I have other things on my mind. They're just three young hotshots. I'm not particularly interested.\" \"Those 'hotshots' are the most brilliant, talented, gorgeous hunks of pure male ever to hit this planet. Curly hair and gray eyes and voices that make your heart thump. Especially the little one.\" \"Missa, one hundred eighty-five centimeters is not little.\" \"See what I mean? Even you've noticed them. But you're right, Dutch only looks little when he's standing next to Clete. Kerith asked Dutch how tall he was. He said they're 'stair steps,' exactly five centimeters difference. Lane in the middle at one ninety. How'd you know how tall Dutch was?\" \"Those three young men have been the predominant topic of conversation since they landed here. If anyone had gotten them on a scale, I'd have overheard their weights too! I'm sorry, Missa. I'm just bored with the subject.\" \"All work. Laire, you worry me. You're either in conference or up to your ears in communiqués. You don't go anywhere but department social functions and you don't really socialize at them. Just work, work, work.\" \"We're at war. I have a job to do. Now, if you've finished stirring up dust on the pretext of cleaning my office, I'll get back to it. I'm not looking forward to it, but I must take an offer of alliance to Bernis, another bunch of swaggering males.\" Dutch sat down on the bridge and shook his head. Their passenger was not the friendly sort. \"She's an iceberg. Brr. Like a marble statue. Beautiful, but no feeling.\" \"That's the problem, Dutch. The feeling's there, but she's got it locked up. She'll never reach the bernisi. She's got everything they respect buried. She can't stop this war the way she is.\" \"Lane, I'm glad I'm not Clete. I get frostbite when I talk to her. She's an iron maiden, smooth metal outside and sharp knives within.\" \"Yes, and I've told Clete to step in and pull the door closed. They're going to cut each other apart, but Clete will bleed and bandage her wounds.\" \"She's broken and you told him to fix her.\" \"Violently.\" \"Oh, shit.\" Lane counted lives that wouldn't be lost and ached while he fixed the dinner tray. Clete, of course, felt it and was hovering right outside the galley when he finished it. \"Take this to her.\" \"Lane, she's revolted by me. Afraid of me. I can handle the revulsion, the fear--\" \"Clete, it's not you she's afraid of. It's herself. She's convinced herself she's made of stone. She's afraid of a crack. If Bernis allies with Amarri, the war will end instantly. The Fed or the Empire might win a war with the bernisi, but no one else would and everyone knows it. Her job is to convince the chief lord Amarri is worthy to be an ally and there's only one way to do that. She must 'burn with the fire of the hills.' Can she succeed the way she is?\" \"No. Give me her dinner. Wine and two glasses. Isn't that a bit obvious?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thanks.\" Clete knew Lane was right. He reminded himself the ambassador really did want to end the war and would have given her life to accomplish it, was giving it to accomplish it, steeled himself against her feelings and knocked. \"Ambassador Kardina, I brought your dinner.\" \"Leave it outside.\" \"Not this time. This time you eat. You're not going to forget another meal. Open, or I'll let myself in.\" \"Oh, all right.\" She opened the door and looked up at him. He could feel her fear. He almost handed her the tray and ran. He didn't. He poured two glasses of wine and handed one to her. \"Now, I'm going to sit here while you eat. You want to get rid of me? Eat your dinner.\" \"I'm in the middle of some trade figures. I'll eat when I'm done with them.\" \"I'll wait.\" He watched her work. She was a dark-haired beauty. Fortyish and richly feminine, very young to carry the hopes of her world and she knew it. He pushed the wine a bit closer to her hand and smiled when she absently picked it up and drank some. He took a few sips of his. Who had made this beautiful woman fear love? Why had she locked her passions away? He pulled her glass toward him and refilled it. She lifted it and drank, then reached up and rubbed her neck. He stood and stepped behind her. \"Easy, let me rub the knots out. SIT STILL!\" He realized he was trembling. The fragrance of her was making him dizzy. He ignored her fear. He'd felt it rise after her pleasure in his touch. It was the order in which they came that gave him hope he could help her and her world. He slipped his thumbs under her collar and massaged the tight cords of fatigued muscle. He felt her pleasure then her terror, again in that order, but the terror was overwhelming his determination. If this was going to be, it must be now. She felt the change in him and stood. He loosed his powers and reached for her. He opened her emotions and crashed through her barriers. He felt her terror as her walls crashed down and it excited him, aroused him. And he hated himself for it. He destroyed the ice statue she'd created outside and found fire within. He freed himself from his own barriers and fueled it with his own. He'd never done it before. In that instant, he knew he too had feared the passion within, just as she had. Lane had chosen this way to free them both. He forgave him and lost himself in the fire of the woman in his arms. Dutch and Lane were in the galley when Clete became fire. \"Lane!\" \"Hang on, Dutch! Take my hand. We'll ride this storm. We knew it was coming. We've known what he was since we were sixteen. Remember how it was. Dad was careful, but we knew. When we all joined minds, we knew what Clete was.\" \"Yeah, but like you always say, reality is much more intense than remembering.\" \"Now it's your turn. We won't get through this unless you shield us. He'll burn us out. You're the only one who can stop that from happening.\" \"Lane, I don't know how!\" \"It's not knowing. It's being. Be who you are!\" Dutch found his barriers. He hadn't known they were there. He set his power free. He met Lane's mind with his and set him free too. Lane hadn't known he was barriered either. He'd seen his brothers', but not his own. They joined with Clete and felt him surge into completeness. Passion, intellect and power blended. Something more than the sum of its parts blazed into existence. Dutch laughed with delight in their minds. Laire traced Clete's smile with a fingertip. He'd healed her and she hadn't known she was injured, but the smile was gently ironic and she was rather sure she hadn't been the only one healed. \"What are you?\" \"I'm not sure, Laire. Half human, half something more. Our father isn't from this universe. You got caught in, no, caused the breakthrough. You freed me. Freed us all. You're very special. Now I know why you walled yourself away. No one you'd met ever responded. They were half-passioned. Involved only with their bodies.\" \"Yes! I didn't know why. There was something wrong with me. I wanted more, more than they had. I loved a man deeply. He left me. He feared me.\" \"Laire, you burn with the fire of the hills.\" \"Clete, that's not fair!\" \"No, but it's real. You mustn't hide what you are. Must be who you are. It's the only way to win them and end the horror of war on your world and you want that more than anything else.\" \"Show me, Clete. Show me how to be who I am.\" Bernis, the home of the oldest species and civilization humans had ever found, was an odd world. It had a cycle of geologic upheaval that shouldn't have been stable, but was. It was also completely predictable. The bernisi had adapted to it and that adaptation was nearly as odd as the cycle. Many studies of both had been done by scholars in the Fed, but they'd found no answers. The bernisi had been tolerant of the studies, but not surprised by the outcome. The bernisi had been the first species humans had contacted that looked human and a real shock. They'd told them there were thousands upon thousands, but they'd never learned why either. They hadn't given humans a great deal more information about the galaxy. They'd stopped exploring a very long time before, if they ever had, but they did tell them a bit about other peoples they'd find nearby and that they'd been anticipating meeting them for a long time. They liked the Fed. Laire went over everything she knew about the bernisi one more time, as she faced the entry to the Hall of Lords. She smiled when she thought of how her view of that knowledge had changed over the last few days. \"Back me up, boys.\" \"Such a beautiful back.\" \"Dutch, you're incorrigible.\" \"No, but very encourageable.\" \"Clete, help me keep myself open. Don't let me get lost in trade figures and treaty negotiations.\" \"You won't. Bank the fires. We'll be standing at your back. Feel us there. Feel me there.\" \"How do I look?\" \"Ravishing.\" Lane grinned at her. She was surprised. She hadn't expected him to say it. \"Clete, doesn't have all the passion, Laire, just the power. Frankly, you knock my socks off.\" She laughed in delight at the very old phrase and took Clete's arm; beautiful lady in black, escorted by the warriors in white. Dutch winked at Lane and pulled their minds together. They became fire. The warriors at the door dropped back instinctively. Dutch and Lane hit the huge iron doors and they crashed open. The Warrior Lords stirred. They growled low in their throats. These were men and the woman burned. She won them in that moment. They were hers. The Chief Lord knelt before her. \"Lady, the warriors of Bernis will aid in your world's battle. Command us. We serve your fire.\" The warriors roared their approval. Laire stretched out her arms and exulted in her triumph. They returned to Amarri with an escort of bernisi ships. They had no difficulty getting through. The blockade dissolved around them. Tar a'Reth h'Mun, the chief lord, contacted Lissa and drily noted his computer had asked for assistance with the code the blockade fleet used. It just couldn't find a key to unencrypt the yelps on their comm channel. Laire was still giggling when they landed. Three days later, Lane dropped in the middle of the hall in the building that housed the Planetary Assembly. Clete moved people out of his way and Dutch went through the ones in his. They knew what was wrong. The war was over and the future was changing. \"No! Don't call med! Let us take care of him. Clete, clear this hall. I'm going in. It's bad.\" \"I can feel it. Do it fast or I'll be down there with him. OUT! Everyone out! NOW! MOVE! CLEAR THIS CORRIDOR!\" The guards on the assembly chamber door looked at each other, then Clete, and went inside the chamber. If Clete wanted the corridor clear, they weren't going to argue. One person came out of the chamber, Laire. \"They sued for peace. Sent an apology. Terrible misunderstanding. Terribly sorry. Hope you aren't angry we killed several thousand of your people. Oops.\" \"Yeah, oops. Look, Laire, keep everyone away. We need a few minutes. Lane's riding the winds of change.\" She went back in the chamber and brought out the chief and two other bernisi lords. They each moved into a corridor. Laire stood over them. No one would disturb them. If the council had to spend the night in the chamber, they would. Dutch opened his eyes and smiled. \"Can't be heaven. You're the most real woman I've met. Find us a room. This is going to take a while. Feel silly in the hall.\" Laire opened the first door along the central corridor and ordered the occupants out. It was the Assembly Chair's office. There was a small apartment behind it. Dutch walked. The bernisi carried Lane and Clete. They didn't ask what was happening, but Laire told them what Clete had said. Tar nodded. \"They're the sons of the Fire Lord. We knew them when they came into the Hall. They serve all life. It's an honor to guard them. And to serve them.\" Laire was still thinking over all of what Tar had said when the Assembly Chair asked permission to enter his office. She granted it, then winced when she realized that was exactly how she'd put it as she walked from the comm to the door to open it for him. \"Laire, it's rather embarrassing to have to ask to enter my own office.\" \"Chair Firth, I'm sorry. They need time. Your office was closest.\" \"Keep it as long as they need it. I just need some notes I made on my data pad this morning If you want me, I'll be sitting on the floor outside the door, hashing out a trade agreement with the chief lord.\" Laire was still laughing when he left. He was a very happy man. Her whole world was happy and she knew that the three in the apartment behind her were why. She looked up from the papers she was working on when they came out together. \"You absolutely glow. What happened?\" \"You changed the future. Lane's been learning the new one. It's never been this rough before. Thanks for your help.\" \"Dutch, Tar recognized you. He called you the 'Sons of the Fire Lord.' He said you serve all life.\" \"Sounds like he's met Dad. Lane?\" \"Not necessarily Tar, Dutch. The bernisi are a unique species. They've evolved through the rise and fall of civilization on their planet dozens of times. Part of that evolution is a racial memory. If they met Dad or us in their past in some way that was significant to them, all of them would remember. I'm not thinking straight! Laire, you didn't hear that.\" \"You can travel in time?!\" \"Not yet, but we will.\" \"Oh... my. What happened? I know you 'remember' your future and get dizzy if something changes, but… Why did it flatten all three of you this time? Please tell me, Lane.\" \"All right. Sit down on the couch with me. I'll tell you what you really did. Your little war wasn't destined to stay little. The Empire was on the verge of coming in. They would have chosen what they saw as the strongest side. The Federation would have rushed to the aid of Amarri. It would have spread. Neutral space would have become a war zone. Trillions would have died as world after world became a battleground. No one could have stayed out of it. Except, perhaps, the bernisi. Neutrality wouldn't have existed, but I don't think even the durcassins are foolish enough to attack them. I didn't see what would happen after a certain point.\" \"Dutch! Calm down! It's changed.\" \"Yeah, Clete. Lane…\" \"Dutch, all the explored galaxy would have been at war. I wouldn't have left the fleet. You two wouldn't have either. Laire, you stopped that. You ended the war and the Empire has no reason to come here. You are the savior of the known galaxy.\" \"No, Clete is. And you and Dutch. But I'd be delighted to accept the title of helper. Yes. I like that. Gallant helper. It has a nice ring to it.\" \"You helped a new branch of the family business. Starting small, but growing.\" \"What do you mean by starting small, Dutch?\" \"All we've done is save one little piece of one galaxy. And evidently us. Dad saves universes. He usually saves his own, but he's saved this one once or twice as part of saving... everything. We know he's been here several times, though after what I think of as this time. I'm confusing you.\" \"Yes, but keep going. I have illusions I'll sort it out.\" \"The first visit was when Mom decided to have me. He said he didn't stand a chance once she'd made up her mind. She was the second Athena.\" \"Family joke, Laire. Three different mothers with the same name. We're half-brothers. Only Dutch was actually born here. Lane and I come from Dad's universe.\" \"How much of this is 'family business,' Clete?\" \"All of it. Your job as helper from now on is to not know anything you heard in this room.\" \"I want to tell my husband. He should know.\" \"WHAT?! What husband?!\" \"Relax, Clete, I haven't married him yet. I haven't even asked him yet. I guess I decided the minute I saw him. It just took awhile to realize it.\" \"Just who is this you want to entrust our lives to?\" \"Tar a'Reth h'Mun, Dutch.\" \"Chief Lord of Bernis.\" \"That's him. I don't think he'll mind being second choice.\" \"Second choice?\" \"Well, I don't think Clete would say yes and my previous reaction to rejection was a bit too extreme to ask on the off chance I'm wrong.\" Lane didn't tell Dutch and Clete all he'd seen when the future had changed. Dutch had pulled out while he was still following the path in his mind. He 'remembered' waiting until they reached the world where they would find much of what they needed to finish the ship. He went to the ship and Dutch and Clete started on locating things they'd need. He was deep in the control systems when Dutch arrived about two hours later. \"They're expecting us, Lane.\" \"Good. How much could you locate, Dutch?\" \"Parts, boards, raw materials, things we can adapt, maybe twenty percent. It will about use our fees from Amarri. Enough to establish a matrix. We're not going to be able to build most of it in this time, but probably enough to get to another.\" \"Where's Clete?\" \"Rock hunting. I left him in the university library pulling every piece of planetary survey information they had stored. We need some extremely rare minerals besides the one isotope that's not just rare.\" \"Was he having any luck?\" \"Yes, but not finding the minerals.\" \"Explain the grin, Dutch, or I won't have remembered why it's funny.\" \"He was sitting on the floor with some ancient hvorkin maps unrolled. They aren't delicate, but they aren't easy to keep flat either. There was a pretty student holding down each corner for him. You know Clete. He could feel they really wanted to help, so he gave them something useful to do. Most attractive paperweights I ever saw. He asked me to stay, but I told him I had something to do too.\" \"That doesn't sound like you, Dutch.\" \"Yeah, well, I couldn't resist. When I left, he was loosening his collar. He was getting real warm. I figured he should get himself out of this one. Besides, I've already got plans.\" \"I thought so. I just couldn't see you leaving if there were several lovely ladies around.\" \"I have plans for you too, Lane. You're going out to dinner.\" \"Dutch, I've got a lot of work to do.\" \"Nope. If you look, you'll see you go. I'd prefer you didn't search for the memory though. Everyone should get nice surprises. Three hours. Very casual.\" Lane realized he was running late. He'd gotten involved and the three hours had slipped away. He really didn't want to leave what he was doing, but Dutch had pulled the double promise from him. He would go to dinner and he wouldn't look into the evening's future. He wondered just how casual \"very\" was. \"Let's go.\" \"Just a minute, Dutch. Let me get shoes and a shirt. You're wearing a tux!\" \"You're fine. They're waiting.\" Dutch began pushing his protesting brother toward the hatch. Half the fun of the evening would be watching his staid brother just surrender to the silliness of the situation he was in. As soon as he got him through the hatch, the ladies helped with the pushing and they were in the transport and on their way before he got a chance to turn around and run. They helped hustle him into the restaurant too. \"Dutch, I may strangle you. This is not what I would call 'very casual.' How could you do this to me? Why didn't I remember this?\" \"It was there. One of the first images I saw in the change. You weren't looking at anything in the near future. Your mind was on the war that wouldn't happen. Relax. Oh, oh. Clete may make things a bit warm out tonight.\" Lane started to laugh. He sat in the midst of a bevy of beautiful women in evening gowns, shirtless and barefoot, his only attire the pair of faded pants he wore when he worked on the ship. The women were enjoying it as much as Dutch was. They kept dragging him onto the dance floor. He tensed and took a deep breath. At least he wasn't cold. Clete was keeping things quite warm. He was beginning to wonder how Dutch could handle the heat in his tux. Laughter became giggles when Dutch answered the thought almost as soon as he had it. \"That's it. I'm dying. Here hold this.\" Dutch handed his jacket to the pretty woman on his left and proceeded to strip to the waist. Soon, he was dressed, or undressed, to the same extent as Lane. Two of the bernisi came in shortly thereafter and the evening got strange and wild. No one in the club minded the dance floor being taken over. The friendly combat of the four beautiful warriors was the best show in town. They carried the wildness with them as they hit club after club. They ran into Clete in the early hours of the morning and laughed as the four young women with him reduced him to their state of dress. Two more bernisi joined them and they prowled the capital. The city became one wild celebration. The streets filled and the summer night rang with peeling bells. The war was over. **** Dutch did a fast lookover of physical facilities when they landed on a world that wasn't human. It had been the third Fed explorers had discovered with people that looked like them and definitely advanced enough they wouldn't damage the culture introducing themselves. The bernisi had pointed them that direction, the opposite side of Fed space, and told them there were interesting worlds there. Dutch was rather sure they wouldn't have if they didn't know they'd carefully make sure of it first. He smiled when he stepped into Lissa and headed for the bridge. He didn't need to yell or query the ship comp for his brothers' locations. He hadn't since Clete had freed them of their barriers. It was very nice not being the only one who needed to. He'd never been jealous that Clete could find them by their feel and Lane knew where they'd be, but it had been a wish he'd never expected to have granted and meant a great deal to him. \"The facilities are the best I've seen outside the Federation. They can do the exterior modifications. We've got one problem. There's a source for the element we need, but it's held by some pretty nasty people.\" \"We've got a solution to that, but he's not going to like it.\" \"Not Clete again! Lane, he's going to get real difficult to live with. We're using him. I don't like it.\" \"It's not quite the same situation. He'll need you. I won't be much help. In fact, none.\" \"You're hiding something. Something bad. I like this less and less. You expect to be... Show me.\" \"Yes, you need to know. It's going to happen soon. I'm ready for it. You need to be. Take my hand. I warn you, it's going to be bad.\" \"NO! I want it changed! I want it stopped! I won't let you! You can't do it, Lane! Please, try to find--\" \"Dutch, it's the only way I could find. You know I looked. I get through it. We get what we need. We clean up a mess. Clete ends it. Dutch, I grow stronger for it. We need what we get from it. It's my choice. I choose not to change it. Clete's coming. You'll have to get yourself under control. Accept it. This is the way I want it.\" \"I'm going to talk to Clete. We have to work this out between us. You may be overruled, Lane. This will be harder on us than you can imagine. The choice isn't only yours to make. Stay put. I'll talk to you later.\" He caught Clete before he got to the ship and told him they needed to talk. He led him to a place he could explode, a place wide open and empty. Lane would wait. He believed they would accept his decision. \"I told him we had the right to choose too, Clete. He's sure it shouldn't be changed. Truly believes changing it would negate a lot of things we accomplish. He's positive he can take it. Question is, can we. Can you?\" \"Leave me. Get as far away from me as you can and do it fast. He'll know our decision. I can feel yours. Go.\" Dutch ran for the ship. He found Lane, shoved him into an empty cabin and locked him in. He got himself locked into another and destroyed the remote for the door. He waited. Clete couldn't contain it much longer. Fury. Blind, unreasoning, fury. Rage. Dutch had a fraction of a second to recognize it, then it washed thought away. He fed it. Gave it his power. The police didn't have enough men. Brawls broke out everywhere, even in the police stations. It passed quickly. There weren't any severe injuries. The physicians marveled there weren't. Clete let Lane and Dutch out, then they went out and got drunk. They had a lot of company. Psychologists began long papers about the racial memory that had caused thousands to suddenly go berserk and attack with their bare hands. Psychics spoke of the release of the anger within. Theists preached of the fury of gods. It happened four days later. Dutch screamed in anger when he felt Lane lose consciousness, but he was a long way away. He yelled for Clete to stay with the ship. He was working very hard when he got back to Lissa. There was no point in trying to hide the pain he felt. Clete knew it and he knew he hurt just as much. Dutch let the tears he'd been holding back flow, when he laid down the tools he was holding and pulled him into his arms. \"They picked him up with a couple dozen others on the university grounds. We can't even go after him. The ship won't be ready for days. The planetary police chased them, but were afraid they'd kill the innocents. Clete, they stunned them. Loaded them like cordwood on grav carts. Carried one each as a shield. Kids mostly. Students. I got the story from a semi-hysterical secretary who saw it out a window. Slavers. They've never hit a population center before.\" \"And they won't again. Let's get the ship ready. I'm empty where he belongs. Dutch, stay close. You keep me here. Something in me wants to... break free and join him.\" \"Damn. There's a lot to this he didn't see. I feel stretched. Pulled. Like you describe. It didn't happen when we were in the fleet. We've developed some kind of bond. A gestalt. More than the sum of its parts. I could find him by the direction of the pull. I'll know when it begins. Four systems away and I'll know.\" \"I'm going to be very angry before this is over.\" \"So will I, Clete. So will I.\" Lane awoke cold and chained. He knew much more time had passed than if he'd just been stunned. The lack of a headache would have told him that if he hadn't known where he was. He was on display and being sold. He forced himself to relax. The casual handling would soon end. The unit clamped to his head would complete its scan and his price would go up, way up. He saw the blue-skinned anthropoid's eyes widen when he looked at the screen. He nearly laughed as the unit was replaced with another. When it displayed its results, the blue male ran toward the central auction area. He had just become the most valuable piece of property on the planet. It didn't take long for that person to return with another. The memory began when the technician who had run for his superior spoke. \"A perfect specimen, physically and mentally. Bidding will be heavy. A unique item of unknown origin, not of any species we've encountered before. We believe it breedable with technological assistance.\" \"Take a sample. I want the results before he's auctioned. Sale contingent upon signing a no-cloning clause. He is unique, therefore trebly valuable. Minimum to be the highest any single sale has ever brought. Curtain the area. Private showing only. Ascertain if viewers can afford him. Post test results on the central screen. I'd take him myself if he wasn't going to make the clan rich.\" Lane jerked against his chains when the obese male touched him. The male smiled. He followed his memory. It held a path to what they needed. \"I will warn you. Do not touch me again.\" \"I have decided to do the sampling myself. Call me when the curtains are in place. Have a physician standing by. He will receive his first lesson as a slave from me. He will need repair. I find I wish to see the color of his blood.\" Lane followed the memory which showed him how to distance his mind from his body. He found the link with his brothers and sheltered his mind in their caring. He returned to himself strengthened. The pain was not great. The physician was efficient. There would be no evidence of abuse when he was viewed. He was carefully cleaned. The last thing that was done was the removal of the gag. The slaver hadn't wanted his clientele to know he was selling used goods. He knew what was coming, but couldn't help fighting against the eye cover and mouthpiece. The screens before his eyes were blank. He tried to distance himself, but the disk on his forehead prevented it. He would have cried out, but the mouthpiece stopped him. He was twice branded. His owner had claimed him, and his progeny. He fainted. He awoke and his tasks began. The screens filled and his mind worked. He had no choice. He was the creative element, the intuitive circuit, of a vast machine intelligence. He felt when his body was used, but the work never ceased. Nutrients dripped into his veins. Wastes were removed by filtration of his blood. He neither slept nor rested. He was aware of all that was being done. Aware of hands and laughter. Aware of being moved and touched. Damaged and healed. Aware of what was being taken from his mind and body. He was not aware of the passage of time, his ostentatious display, nor of the price paid for each integration performed, each touch felt. The one who had purchased the unique item at a price no other could have paid stroked him and smiled. He was an excellent example of why he could pay more than anyone else. He had recouped his price in a very few days. He invited his guests to enjoy themselves and ordered menial slaves to serve them. He would enjoy their envy. He kept a physician nearby. He always got carried away when he had an audience. This night was no exception. He became a bit angry with himself. He lost money when pain blanked the mind for several moments. He made up for it by selling chances on the use of his slave for a short period. He was delighted when the female who won invited all to participate. The mind blanked again, but the entertainment had been worth the cost. Dutch did a last systems check in engineering. They'd lifted as soon as Lissa was capable of it and had been working to complete her the entire journey. He ran for Clete as soon as he was done. He knew he wasn't on the bridge, but he didn't know why until Clete backed out of the area where they'd built their replicator and turned around. The photon cannon in his arms was an eloquent statement of his gentle brother's burning anger. \"The ship's ready.\" \"I felt it when you got sure. Carry this. I'll get the other one.\" \"He didn't have this in his memory.\" \"I don't plan on talking to him about it, Dutch. That society is diseased. We're going to perform surgery and remove the malignancy. It must be done before we release him. I'm not going to let him blame himself for it. I'm not going to feel guilty about it. Are you?\" \"No. I want the slaver. You take his owner.\" \"Done.\" Two men took apart a world. They began with the ships that rose from the single city to drive them off. They demolished buildings and destroyed vehicles. Slaves slew their masters and protected the backs of the two men in slave clouts with photon cannons in their hands. They found Lane and Clete went wild. Fury set fire to the planet. This rage was directed. It had a focus. Dutch found the slaver and told him who he was. He looked at the bloody thing he held in his hand and smiled. He left the cannon. He didn't need it. Clete left his weapon too, just dropped it. The raging mob grew silent and watched when he began to take apart a building with his hands. They made way for the man who stalked the streets, spattered with blood and dripping gore. Dutch helped Clete demolish the building around Lane. When they reached the vault, where the one who had paid to use and abuse him so badly had taken shelter, they quickly rebuilt a scan unit to read the lock, then Dutch went back to Lane and Clete entered the vault alone. He knew it contained dozens of armed men. They would not stop him. The last thing, the one who had called himself Lane's owner, saw was Clete's cold eyes and icy smile. The people in the streets huddled together in silence. The rage was more than they could hold, more than all of them could encompass. It had passed beyond them. Dutch was gently disconnecting Lane when Clete got there. He'd been unconscious since the power to the machine had failed. He would soon awaken, but they'd be done before he did. They wrapped a slave clout around him, then they smashed the machine with their hands, took the rare element from its heart and wrapped Lane's hands around it. Clete ripped open a water main and they cleansed their blood-drenched bodies. They sat down and held Lane between them until he awakened, smiled softly and told them it was time to leave. No one else died. The freed slaves had no more anger. They watched the three walk away from a city that was no more. Retribution had come to the clans that had enslaved a god. Lane knew he was still a bit confused by the time he'd been in the machine, but he was sure he'd have remembered remembering… He quit chasing the thought in circles and just asked Dutch. \"Is Clete all right?\" \"He will be. Just give him time, Lane.\" \"He's so withdrawn.\" \"DAMMIT! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?! I'm sorry, Lane, but you had to know. You say you gained something. Well, he lost something.\" \"Dutch, I guess my future memory isn't the only thing still only semi-functional. I don't understand.\" \"I hope you never do.\" \"Dutch, what did he lose?\" \"Innocence. Now, stop thinking about it. It's done. The choices were made. The blood spilled. The knowledge gained. Use it. Help me put this matrix together.\" Lane put one part of his mind on the task before him, but with another he sought to order his future memories and find the sound of Clete's laughter in them. When he found Clete's laughter, he saw what he must do. \"Put it away, Dutch. We have something else to do. I can't tell you what. It's got to be a surprise. Keep Clete busy. We're changing course. We're close, so we'll be setting down in about an hour. Go away. I want the bridge. Don't ask. It's part of the healing.\" He commed ahead. They'd be waiting. It was the perfect time, halfway through the two-day event, just in time for the celebration of acceptance. He landed the ship and smiled. They were waiting. \"Clete! Dutch! Let's go. Come on. We don't want to hold things up. They've got everything ready. Boy, am I glad the first thing we get are baths and appropriate costumes. You guys are grimy. Move. Move. Don't ask. You'll see.\" The bath was wonderful, if a bit overattended. The hot volcanic springs were the center of existence on Bernis, believed to hold great power of healing. The traditional warrior costumes suited them well. Clete and Dutch had learned they'd landed in the middle of Laire's wedding. They were ready in time for the acceptance ceremony and hurried to places in the Hall of Lords to hear it. \"I, Tar a'Reth h'Mun, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" \"I, Laire Brith Kardina, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" The hall rang with cheers. The Chief Lord had chosen and been chosen. It had been well past time. The Amarri woman was worthy. She had been worth the waiting. She would bear warriors of Bernis. Any woman touched by the fire of Bernis bore children to her people. Any man touched by it sired them. It was the greatest of the survival traits of their ancient species. \"Congratulations, Laire. You're going to be very happy.\" \"Thank you, Lane. Look, boys, don't go away. I've got to join the women. They want to see if I'm fit to go with them into battle. They're the home guard. Wish me luck. They're a formidable bunch.\" \"Actually, they're the ground troops on any world, but you know that and are waiting to see if we do.\" \"Caught, Lane, but still nervous.\" \"You'll do great. They love a woman who can bring a chief lord to his knees. Right, Tar?\" \"Yes, Dutch, and they had begun to despair that I would find one. I'm glad you're here. This day is one of great victory for me.\" \"You're a lucky man.\" \"Yes, Clete, I am. I wasn't sure she'd accept me.\" \"What?!\" \"Last night was our trial together. I feared her decision.\" \"I still don't understand.\" \"How do the humans say it? Oh, yes. Clete, my friend, you are a very tough act to follow.\" Clete stared at Tar for a moment and Dutch and Lane started to laugh. He was speechless. Tar grinned at him and suddenly he roared with laughter. The knot inside Lane untied. Innocence might be gone, but laughter had returned. Laire smiled at the sound. She helped the ladies lay their plan of battle for the evening. She made introductions, then whisked Tar away and left the dozen, dusky, unattached women around them. They were carrying carafes of wine and three extra glasses. She smiled at Tar. By morning, she and he would be viewed with near awe. \"Oh, my head.\" \"Don't talk so loud, Dutch. Where's Clete?\" \"You're asking me?\" \"You either, huh? I thought we'd decided not to do that again.\" \"We were set up by an expert. Good Lord, I don't believe it!\" \"Well, now we know where he is. Come on. Let's get to the hot springs.\" \"Yeah, before it gets embarrassing to be seen in public.\" Clete found them at the springs in the early afternoon. He had a rather large party escorting him. He smiled and sighed as he slipped into the water. \"Lane, I've got a buzzing in my mind.\" \"I noticed it too, Dutch. Strange sort of thing.\" \"You know, it's kind of familiar. Bit distracting.\" \"That's true. Any suggestions?\" Clete looked from one to the other. They were leading up to something. \"We could try asking him.\" \"Asking me what, Dutch?\" \"Clete, could you please try not to purr so loud?!\" They got quite a bit done that afternoon. Lane defined the space and programmed it while Clete and Dutch set up the matrix. The two parts had to be finished as a unit. They set the chunk of rare isotope into its brackets below the pilot's station and crossed their fingers. Lane sent current through it and started the program running. A wave of dizziness passed through them. They walked to the door of their small hold and Lane laid his hand against it. \"Now we see if we really did it.\" He pushed the door open and walked through. \"Incredible! Where did you get it from?\" \"Everywhere, Dutch. I started here with... well, a hotel lobby. Central herbarium, fountain... Like the fireplace? It'll burn forever. You can reshape it, poke it, add fuel. A real fire, but a program. Through those doors is a pool and gymnasium complex. Those lead to kitchen and dining areas. Remember all those questions I asked you? Come on. Let me show you the results.\" \"Lane, I want to see that fire program.\" \"I'll show it to you later, Dutch, but I want to show you what's down this hall first. This door leads to… \" \"Perfect! It's perfect! Incredible! The colors, the shapes. Wonderful!\" \"This is your space, Dutch. It's like a holosphere. You can change it, within limits. It'll always be a set of rooms, living quarters. You'll have to fill your closets, but never will any of us stand waiting for a shower again. Want to see Clete's?\" \"I want to see it.\" \"Right across the hall, Clete. Come on. You know I'm enjoying myself immensely. Open that door.\" \"Lane! How... \" \"Told you. Like a holosphere. The enclosed courtyard is primarily holoreality. It has day and night, sun and moonlight. The furnishings are 'big and comfortable.' The bedroom opens onto the courtyard too. You have a very modern frontier feel. Fireplace works like the one in the living room. You can even put it out and start a new one. There are birds in the trees, but I didn't see any need for bugs. Stock real food if you want it. These are really just large bedrooms. They're not meant to be complete homes. Come on. I want to show you mine.\" \"I'm coming. I just want to see-- Lane, that's outrageous! That bed would hold eight!\" \"Large and comfortable. This way. End of the hall is mine. Like the door? Mahogany. Wood and brass. I'm going to fill the bookshelves with the real thing. Nice thing about holoreality, it doesn't have to be polished. Nice, big, four-poster in the next room. My fireplace is smaller, but went with the décor. Dutch, I didn't give you one because it just didn't fit with your ultramodern requests.\" \"I have no complaints at all, Lane. I wouldn't use it. If I want to sit by a fire, I'll do it out in the central area. Lighting controls?\" \"Voice. Water is the only thing you get that's real. Food synthesizer is in the kitchen. This way.\" \"We're going to really like this too, Dutch. He's real smug.\" \"He deserves to be, Clete.\" \"Yeah, he does.\" \"Thank you.\" The kitchen was a homey place set up for synthesis or real cooking. It had a breakfast nook and a well-appointed dining area. The pool, spa and gymnasium complex had been very carefully planned. It was a very well-thought-out arrangement. \"I've got one more set of doors. I don't even know exactly what's behind them. I know there's a lab and computers and... Well, this piece in the front is an add on. Behind those doors is everything in the Wabbit program. A finite infinity. I... peeked at the program. It made me miss Dad so much I stopped. Oh, I forgot! Hold is behind the other doors in the gym. Lissa is now the outside framework of her own dimension. All those numbers we crunched were to integrate a cargo transporter. It's a pretty complicated process. The cargo lift is no longer operational. Here are your keys. The hatch now has a lock. Look familiar don't they. Damn, I miss him.\" \"We could visit, Lane.\" \"Dutch is right. She needs a test run. We could find him. Look. Is it a problem?\" \"Clete, I'm sure I'd have noticed it.\" \"Let's try something. I've been wondering if we could use your future memory more effectively. Remember how we hunted a solution when you saw those drug dealers were... going to kill him? Let's see what would happen.\" \"Clete, you know what… \" \"Yes, I know how hard it was to let Dutch take the chance and have faith Dad would be in time to save him, but they're both alive and they wouldn't be if we hadn't.\" \"Clete's right, Lane. We need to be able to use it as a way to gauge our actions.\" \"Dutch, I think you just like making me dizzy. All right. The couches by the fireplace. We... Oops! We hurry! Come on! Things are already starting to change.\" They laughed and ran after him. They'd made the decision to make a test run and find their father. The future Lane saw was changing. He didn't quite make the couch. He was laying on the floor giggling. Clete picked him up and put him on one. \"I don't believe it! They were defined in the program! He surprised me again!\" \"How about explaining that, Lane?\" \"We're complete, Dutch. Engines, computer banks, everything. The banks only hold basic information. Telas couldn't have carried their store of knowledge, but the processing capacity is there. You know, I'll bet he carried... It would have taken most of his memory. For us from Dad. A present. He wouldn't have trusted it to anything else. I thought... Clete, you even commented you were worried because you'd seen him using the ship comps to store info. Now we know why. We also know why even Dad couldn't remove Telas' augmentation. He's trusted us with the best-kept secret in the Fed. No Fed comp could have held all the program. His living brain is the basis of the system. Alice lies behind the doors in the gym.\" \"Alice? All of... Yippee! I don't have to spend years building engines!\" There were some problems. Lissa didn't fully integrate into the system. They went to work on it. First they dropped the transporter. It was an insoluble lump in an otherwise smooth blend. They redesigned the bridge. In fact, they practically gutted her and started over. They finally hit the solution when they put her on the inside instead of the outside. They put her back together. She was a ship within a ship. They moved the controls for time/space flight off the bridge and into their living room. They had two ships. Lissa could be dropped free and used independently. They dubbed the time/space ship Melissa. They entered it in her log. They hoped she liked it. Lissa had transporters and weapons. Melissa did not. Melissa could travel in time and was virtually indestructible. Lissa was not. Lissa fit inside Melissa. They thought it a very neat arrangement, especially when they learned Melissa could be made very small on the outside even with Lissa in her. It meant they could 'stack' their father's ship in her. When they told Melissa to choose her own shape, they decided she definitely had a sense of humor and was 'sweet' on Lane. She'd found the perfect way to tease him. Her shape of choice was a small 'wood,' scarf-draped, fortune-telling booth. They gave up trying to figure out why Lissa was in Melissa even when she wasn't. The answer had to be because Melissa wanted her there. They just stepped through the door in the back of the booth, stepped out of Lissa's hatch, slapped it closed, walked two meters to the hold and entered the living room, even when Melissa was in Lissa's hold. Their ship had a unique personality and a stubborn streak. She was not a copy of Alice and they were delighted with her. \"Lane, where and when do we find Dad?\" \"At one of his favorite fishing spots. About the same amount of time has passed for him as for us.\" \"Better. Why were you so worried about it, Dutch?\" \"I don't know, Clete. Yes I do. His voice. I want to hear his voice just as it was. Just as I hear it in my memory. I'll never forget hearing my mother's voice again. I was twenty-three and somewhere I was four. I was a brand new ensign. Her voice came over the comm channel. The captain sent me to sickbay. I was useless on the bridge.\" \"Don't tell him.\" \"What?\" \"Don't tell him. You ache when you talk about it. He didn't think about you running into her. It was a scar he didn't intend to open.\" \"But, Clete, it was wonderful. I... Oh, I see what you mean. It brought it all back. I heard her and knew when she would die. How alone I'd be. Yeah. I won't tell him.\" \"You two get by the hatch. We have to get out before he runs for it. Others who arrive in his vicinity like we will intend to kill him.\" \"Don't be far behind, Lane.\" \"I won't, Dutch. Hurry. We're about to land.\" They stepped out and Dutch yelled, \"Dad!\" He'd been halfway through the door. He spun around and stared at them. He was still standing with his mouth open and one hand on the door when Lane joined them. He stepped away from the door and smiled. They ran for him like boys. Clete steadied him until he got his breath back. Dutch had nearly knocked him flat. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Dad, that has a rather obvious answer. We smelled fish frying a universe and several thousand years away.\" \"Dutch, you haven't changed.\" \"No, but you have. You've been taking very good care of yourself. Gotten very comfortable. No workouts, good food--\" \"Ignore him. We built Melissa and she needed a test run. This is where we all wanted to bring her, to find you. What's wrong?\" \"Clete, do you have any idea how hard it was to say goodby to you? Now I have to do it again!\" He hadn't changed. He still knew exactly when they needed to be shouted at. They told him how they'd filled their years and asked how he'd filled his. He told them of his wanderings and his battles. He spoke of people he'd met and parted from. Clete ached for him. They were three together. He was, as always, alone. Even though he knew he'd have disagreed and pointed out Alice was always with him, it still hurt. They showed him their ships, introduced him to Melissa and talked long hours before the fire. Lane told him they'd learned to choose the changes they would make. Gallant laughed when Clete walked out of the kitchen, handed him a towel and noted his surge of relief had been a surprise to him too and he was cleaning up cocoa while he made more. He spent several days with them. One evening his gentle smile told them it would be their last. He wouldn't say goodbye. He'd said it too many times to people he loved. In the morning he was gone. They set course for the doorway. They would see him again. Someday.",

      "content": "Chapter Four They explored their universe through time. They became wanderers. They'd begun with an orderly exploration, but soon tossed away the plan. Lane told them their future was getting acquainted with their ship and the universe, for awhile. They enjoyed Earth in a great many periods of its history. They avoided wars. They knew how Earth's wars turned out and what they eventually led to. It was a rocky road, but she was exactly how they wanted her. They were having breakfast when Dutch sighed. \"I'm bored. Let's find something to do.\" \"Just what did you have in mind, Dutch?\" \"You're grinning at me. You were waiting for me to say it. All right, Lane, what's up?\" \"Time to make some changes. We're going to do some real traveling. I want to stock up on Earth. There are things that just can't be synthesized or replicated properly. Melissa is going to be very cooperative and take us in just like Lissa would. Put together lists of everything you want. Not too long. If it can be replicated successfully, don't include it.\" \"Champagne and caviar. Blue jeans. The real thing. Real cotton and silk kimonos. Leather boots.\" \"Dutch, most of that is very easy to replicate.\" \"I know, Clete, but we don't have a lot of the patterns I want. I know where to get them though. Old Meister will have almost everything, including the best roses ever grown. I wonder if he's still mad at me.\" \"Probably, fathers tend to get angry when their daughters are unhappy. If I remember, you made two of them unhappy.\" \"I never said I'd marry them, either of them. Why does every set of twins think I should choose between them?\" They landed Melissa at the spaceport and started their shopping trip. Jan Meister wasn't angry. In fact, he spent a great deal of time telling Dutch how happy his daughters were. Dutch didn't mind, though he did get a little tired of looking at grandchildren at about the two hundredth holoframe. Meister was a collector. He shared his collection by allowing replicator patterns to be made. Dutch shared his enthusiasm for real materials and sighed with him that no replicator would ever duplicate the feel of raw silk or the smell of real leather. Clete and Lane left the two sybarites and went to an antique book shop. Lane found several items he wanted. Clete discovered the collection of ancient films and asked for copies of several. He made an instant friend when he asked for Fantasia and Snow White. He walked out of the shop with a complete collection of full-length Disney animated classics. He also carried a carefully preserved cel. The old man in the shop had decided he should have it. He thought Clete would give it the care and love it deserved. Dutch was carrying a case of champagne into Melissa when they arrived. \"Just in time. I told interested parties I didn't want any of this to go through a transporter. They thought I was a little eccentric. I stored the replicator patterns on Lissa. Give me a hand.\" \"As soon as we store our own treasures. Wait'll you see what Clete got.\" Lane placed his books in his library and watched Clete very carefully hang the cel. It was from Snow White and in amazing condition. Clete ordered a slight change in the lighting. Dutch walked in with a case of champagne in his hands and just stood and looked at the cel. He'd loved early Disney animation since he was a small child. \"You know, she's probably the reason I've never really fallen in love. I've been looking for her since I was three.\" They moved all the items Dutch had stacked on grav carts into the ship, put them away, then opened a bottle of champagne. Melissa did her Lissa imitation and they left Earth. As soon as they'd cleared the watchful eyes of Earth control, Lane set coordinates for some real traveling. He remembered they were needed a third of the way across the universe and several thousand years in the past. They explored on the way, but inside the ship. One of their explorations was of the ancient books Lane had found, especially the cookbooks. Clete liked to cook too, but he liked 'homey hearty fare.' Dutch was the perfect person for whom to cook. He made coffee, and anticipated \"YUM!\" the entire time they worked. He truly appreciated it, and the synthesizer began to make more 'raw' than cooked foods. Lane was becoming an artist in the kitchen. Their father and Clete could do 'spectacular,' but Lane was the one who enjoyed it most. They were approaching the world when Dutch and Clete agreed he'd found a better recipe for wild mushroom and black walnut wine sauce, and he had a recipe his father would want. He and Clete were both 'after' their father's pizza sauce. Dutch chose a lovely brandy for after dinner. \"I'm awed, Lane.\" \"Thank you, Dutch. This one I will trade to Dad, then the sauce for your sausage, Clete.\" \"Nope, you'll share. You aren't going to make pizza as often as we like to eat it.\" \"I don't think you can change that one, Lane. I'll help talk him into making the sausage whenever you want to cook with it.\" \"I had no doubt of it, Dutch.\" \"Talk to us about the faint undercurrent of dread, Lane.\" \"It's an Earth-type planet with a similar development pattern. The culture is the closest we'll ever find to the Western culture of Earth, at least in this era. Humanoid in the extreme, though gravity is a bit lower.\" \"One of the worlds seeded with life a bit later than others?\" \"Dutch, Dad told me to leave the question of the seeded worlds alone when I was four. I don't think he knows why he's sure he, and we, should, but he is.\" \"OK. But it's still a valid question.\" \"He's right, Lane. Is there enough difference in gravity to need to retrain for it?\" \"No, not even enough for the people to show it much. They've got themselves in a real mess. They're about to destroy their world.\" \"Lane, you said it was in a stage about equal to the Earth's nineteenth century. How can they destroy themselves?\" \"I wish I had an answer to that, Dutch. We've got a real mystery. Technology makes a big leap, then in about twenty years, they blow themselves up in a nuclear war. We may have found another time traveler.\" \"That's not good. If you're right, we've got a real problem too. When are we?\" \"I'm following my memory, Clete. We find a blasted world, then journey into its past. At that point, we have to change things. There she is. A radioactive cinder. I remember us doing a thirty-year jump.\" \"Do fifty. See what happens.\" \"Well, that's it. Clete, take over. I'm down.\" Dutch grabbed him and got him to a couch. They'd made the first change. It was a fairly small one, so Lane should steady in a few moments. Melissa landed in a small clearing. There was a frontier city about a kilometer away. Lane moved them forward two years and a partial-season. \"All right, Lane, now what?\" \"Side arms practice, Dutch. Projectile weapons. Outside. Attracts the attention of a boy about twelve. He's our guide. Clete, put a corder and medunit in your pocket. This is going to be a rough go. I've got multiples. Nothing clear. Dutch, be careful. Snow White lives here, but you're the wrong prince.\" \"Figures. I'm going to meet the girl of my dreams and I'm not the boy of hers. You steady enough to hit the buttons on the replicator?\" \"Yes, but every choice we make will cause a few seconds of confusion. There are just too many images to find a clear path. I'm going to be semi-useless. We'll just have to play it out.\" \"Why am I carrying a corder and medunit?\" \"That happens right away. The corder locates us a small gold deposit. The medunit saves our young guide's life. His mom is going to be very grateful, Clete. Be gentle. She's very lonely. She thinks her husband is dead.\" \"And he's not.\" \"No. Good. That takes care of a half-dozen of the multiples. You made up your mind the right way, of course. These are about right. There you are, Dutch. Choose clothing and sidearms along those lines. Clete, you're going to look real big to these people.\" \"Yeah, I figured that out when you said we didn't need to retrain. Big man to knock down. I'm going to spend half my time trying not to break anyone.\" \"We're all going to have problems. I think I see a way to shortcut them, but we'll have to watch our... Yes, keep that medunit handy. We make some unscrupulous unfriends.\" \"What you mean is our backs sprout holes.\" \"Would you rather fight every man in town, Dutch? And every one that hits town? All one at a time? If we clean them up all at once, you'll have more time for ladies.\" \"Oh, well, what's a few holes?\" They'd spent a lot of time practicing with weapons used by various cultures, first with their father, then while they were in the academy. Though those were only from the cultures humans had met, there weren't great differences in them. They'd practiced more with 'variations' since. Clete really couldn't resist making them work as a team and Dutch couldn't resist turning anything into a show. It was going to prove very useful. Their guide arrived not long after they began practicing with replicas of Colt 45's outside Melissa. They were near enough like the guns common to the culture to be custom-made for show people. Their young guide arrived while they practiced. \"Gee, I've never seen anybody shoot like that!\" \"Hi. We practice a lot. Goes with the show.\" \"Trick shots, huh? Interestin' guns. Can see bigger wouldn' bother you guys none. You're kind of in the middle of nowhere for a medicine show. Who are you fellas?\" \"I'm Dutch. He's Clete and that's Lane. We're retired. The booth came down through the family. We're real sentimental about it. Usually leave it in a safe place. The clearing looked good.\" \"How'd you get it here? Where's your mounts? Are you stayin' in town? Want to have supper at our place?\" \"Whoa! Let's see. Lane, do you remember all those questions?\" \"In order: a friend dropped us off; don't have any; haven't decided yet; we'd love to, if we can pay back with a few chores. What's your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Shoulda' said. I'm Billy Kendirk. Come on. We need to get goin' so Ma knows to make for more 'fore she starts dinner. We definitely got chores you can help with. Pa's been gone awhile and me and Ma ain't been keepin' up too good.\" Lane knew when it was coming. Billy was talking animatedly about his mom's berry pie. \"Look, I'll get some berries right over there. We'll have pie tonight.\" He ran right into a... Might as well call it a bear. Filled the same niche. Grew just as big. Was just as hairy and dangerous. Clete charged after him. He got swiped, but not bad. He decked the bear and went to work on Billy. Dutch and Lane picked berries. Billy had taken a beating for berry pie. He deserved to have it. \"I healed everything major. Left the superficial stuff. Just hit him with a dose of antibiotic. Lane, that could have been prevented.\" \"I know, Clete. This memory has a way for us to really help them.\" \"Good work, Clete. He'll be real proud of his scars. How about you?\" \"Dutch, scars don't last on me. You know that.\" \"That's not what I meant.\" \"Oh. No, I could heal me, but the shirt would still have holes. Wouldn't make sense.\" Dutch laughed and thumped Lane on the back. It completely surprised him and Clete laughed and picked up Billy. He'd regain consciousness soon. Lane was giggling and complaining he was dizzy, so Dutch steered him. It didn't happen often, but sometimes Dutch just surprised him with an \"I love you.\" Dutch was a blaze of love in his soul and the love between his two brothers the most wonderful feeling in existence. Lane located the gold. He handed the corder back to Clete and he and Dutch rolled over a rock in the stream and picked up a few nuggets of placer. They rolled the rock back. The deposit itself was a few hundred meters upstream. They'd help Billy file a claim. It would get him and his mom through the rough times until his father returned. They could see how rough they'd been as they walked into the yard. Billy's mother ran for them when she saw Clete was carrying her son. \"BILLY!!\" \"Easy, Ma'am! He's roughed up a bit, but he'll be all right. Had an argument over a berry patch. My name's Clete Gallant. My brothers Lane and Dutch. Let's get him inside.\" \"Yes. Thank you. I'm Sare Kendirk.\" \"Billy said you'd trade us a home-cooked meal for a few chores. My brothers are carrying a load of berries in their shirts. Figured Billy ought to get his pie.\" He laid Billy on the bed and smiled. \"Nice kid. You can be proud of him. He'll grow up to be a fine man.\" \"Thank you. Hurts a bit he's havin' to do it so fast. You're bleeding. Take your shirt off. Do you whilst I'm patchin' Billy. Where'd your brothers go?\" \"To find things that need fixing. I'd better go help.\" \"You sit right there til I get those claw marks cleaned out. Then I'll see if we got a shirt big enough to fit you. My husband wasn't near your size, but he liked things loose.\" \"You said was.\" \"I figure somethin' happened to him and he ain't comin' back. Been gone more'n a year. Went south to buy us a good startin' herd.\" \"Lot of things other than dying can delay a man. Give it time. A good man is worth waiting for.\" \"I don't know how long we can wait. Place is goin' downhill. Me'n Billy are just scratchin' by. I'm tryin' to hold the land, but I'm wonderin' if… \" Clete realized what he'd done. She'd been alone for a long time. He'd slipped out of his shirt and she'd stopped talking. Lane had warned him. Her need washed over him. He had to get out of the house, or distract her, or something. He wouldn't be able to resist that need long. Billy woke up. Clete thought, \"Whew, kid's got good timing,\" and grinned as her emotions became maternal. Billy chattered at her as she bandaged Clete. He kept her distracted until he could get into a shirt and make excuses about helping his brothers. It was a good thing Lane had told him her husband was alive. He wondered how he'd known. \"Hi, Clete. You look warm.\" \"Dutch, you're pushing it. This corral's in bad shape.\" \"Everything is. You can see they've been trying, but they need logs split and carried. Probably don't have money for nails either. Lane's in the shed putting an edge on the ax. Help me see how many of these nails we can pound back to usefulness. Pull that rail loose. We'll redo it. It's been over-nailed. I'd say Billy's work.\" \"He's getting better. There are only a couple bent nails on the most recent.\" In three hours, they'd accomplished more than Billy and his mom could have in a month. They were finishing repairs on the roof of the house when Sare called them to dinner. She stared at the rebuilt corrals, the rehung barn door, the repaired shed wall, the rebuilt buggy and the stack of rails laying next to the shed. They dropped off the roof and went to wash up. Billy yelled and she dashed in to get her pies out. She wondered what she'd done to deserve being blessed. She was glad she'd decided to fix a bit extra because of the size of the men. They definitely deserved it. They appreciated it. \"Billy, you were right. The best berry pie I ever had. Do you feel up to a little walk? I've got something to show you. Ma'am, I'm going to have to walk off that last piece of pie. I hope you don't mind if Billy goes with me.\" \"My name's Sare, Lane. And after what you boys did around here today, I wish you coulda' held three pieces of pie. Go on, Billy. I'll wash up.\" \"No, Sare, you won't. Dutch and I already drew straws on that chore. I wash. He dries. You get to sit on the porch and watch the evening settle in.\" \"Clete, you don't have to do that. You done enough already.\" \"You did the work of cooking for three extra and spent time on those pies. We'll take care of the extra cleanup. Now, outside. Go on. Don't you feel guilty. We don't have to do dishes often. It's a novelty.\" They joined her on the porch within minutes. They were watching the sunset when Lane and Billy walked into the yard. He looked very serious, but Clete could feel his mother saw the excitement beneath. \"Ma, I'm goin' into town with them in the mornin'. I've got somethin' to do. I'm goin' in and see if I can sleep. Night.\" \"Now, what was that all about?\" \"It's his story, Sare. He's decided how he wants to tell it. He really does have things to do in town. We'll be back tomorrow evening.\" \"Lane, I don' know what you're up to, but you're all in on it. All right. He can go. Just make sure he's home before dark. I hate waitin' supper.\" She smiled at them. They were real nice men. And Clete... \"Well, we've made ourselves a spot in the barn. Might as well get a good night's sleep. See you in the morning.\" \"We're right behind you, Clete. Come on, Dutch, turn-in time. Billy's going to want to make an early start. Goodnight, Sare. I really enjoyed dinner.\" \"They're rushing me off again. You have a pleasant night. You sleep in. We'll buy Billy breakfast in town. That way you'll both get a treat. Goodnight.\" \"Goodnight, Dutch. You boys sleep well.\" Dutch strolled into the barn and grinned at Clete. \"Warm evening.\" \"Give him a break, Dutch. Even I could feel how lonely she is.\" \"Me too, Lane. How do you know her husband's coming home?\" \"We pick up a telegram from him tomorrow. He was robbed and he spent the last year out on the range, working to earn a very good small herd, and enough to get them home, from a rancher. He didn't have money for a telegram before. Clete would have answered her need and she'd have hated herself. Her husband won't be home until spring, but she won't be so lonely once she knows he's coming. Now, she and Billy will have enough to see them through. All we have to do is get him to town and back. After tomorrow, he'll be safe.\" \"Uh, huh, just how does one trip make him safe?\" \"Clete's about to get a job.\" \"Why me? Why is it always me?\" \"Relax, Clete. The first thing you do is hire us.\" Dutch stared at the animals tied to hitching rails along the street of the town. They gave him a very odd feeling. \"Lane, they're horses.\" \"Like the bear and the people, Dutch, similar evolution on a seeded world. This is a very Earth-like planet. There was very little drift. I'm just glad we spent so many of our vacations at the academy learning to ride.\" \"I used to spend my offtime in the holosphere riding too. You'd be amazed at how many women like the smell of saddle leather.\" Lane and Clete laughed. Billy, who had been leading and a bit too excited to notice Dutch had suddenly stopped, when the horses came in sight, ran back to see what was going on. They told him they were teasing Dutch about finding a horse he liked. By then, they were. Lane assured it. They went to the assay office first, then convinced the clerk at the courthouse to file the claim in Billy's name. Billy insisted on buying them breakfast at the hotel. They left him shopping at the general store and headed for trouble. It was waiting for them at the saloon. \"Lane, that place shouldn't be open this early.\" \"It's not, Clete. It's open this late. The proprietor doesn't like it, but his current clientele become violently insistent. Lawmen aren't plentiful and the only remaining deputy in town is recovering from a very close call.\" \"I suppose I'm not supposed to break anyone.\" \"Right, Dutch. Very few of these are real nasties. They just follow along.\" \"How do we find the rotten apples?\" \"They find us. You'll know who they are. They're the ones that shoot me in the back.\" \"Lovely. I suppose you can't just point them out and save us the trouble of buying you a new shirt.\" \"I get shot in the back, Dutch. I don't see them.\" \"Noisy isn't it? This is a rowdy bunch. The bartender's nervous. NO!\" \"Where's he going?\" \"He's about to stop a bully. Get ready, Dutch. Clete's about to heat things up. No one hits someone smaller, especially a woman, if he can stop it. Take the man in red plaid first. He pulls a gun.\" Clete dropped the man from the balcony. He was careful. He dropped him on several others to break his fall. Dutch relieved the man of his gun and put him down for a nap. Clete dropped from the balcony and tucked several others in. Lane was busy too. He kept removing guns from people who were aiming at Dutch and Clete. They took care of the ones aiming at him. \"Over already and I was just getting warmed up.\" \"Two. Armed. Back room. Three. Same. Upstairs. Two. Doors.\" \"Clete says you get to play some more, Dutch. You get the back room. I'll remove our unfriends outside.\" Clete had already headed for the stairs. Lane slammed the doors outward, finished putting the two men to sleep and dragged them inside. Dutch was dragging two from the back room. \"Dutch, see that door up there. When it opens, draw and shoot the gun that sticks out. It'll be pointed at Clete's head.\" Dutch drew and fired. Clete reached through the door and hauled the man out. He held him in the air with one hand and put him to sleep with the other. \"Catch. They'll break if I drop them.\" Dutch and Lane caught the three Clete dropped over the balcony railing and stacked them with their friends. They made a total of twenty-three in the pile. The bartender decided it was safe to stick his nose above the bar. \"Who are you boys?\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Dutch. This is Lane. The big man calming the ladies upstairs is Clete. Damn, Lane, let's find a cold shower. Somebody's very grateful.\" \"Let's go get him. Billy's about to need us.\" \"We'd better hurry. He gets his shirt off and we'll be fighting women too. Clete! We don't have time for them to tell you they're grateful.\" \"Hey! You don't have to push.\" \"Sure we do, Clete. Lane says Billy needs us.\" \"Why didn't you say so?!\" Lane and Dutch shook their heads and laughed when Clete dropped from the balcony and went through the doors at a run. He had Billy's problem taken care of before they got there. He was dumping the man, who'd tried to make Billy give him money when the storekeeper went to the storeroom for more flour, on the walk when they arrived. The storekeeper was pleased. He told them the man wouldn't have tried it if the town had a lawman on his feet. Clete asked why it didn't. He'd have heard how worried he was about his town if he hadn't been able to feel it. Lane told him they'd make sure Billy got home safely with his supplies. \"Dutch, go with him to the livery stable. He needs a wagon and a team. See if they've got anything we'd like. Try to find a horse big enough Clete's feet won't drag the ground. There's some good-looking tack in here. We'll help the storekeep tally and get Billy's purchases moved outside. See if you can find horses not broken to a bit. I know. They bother me lots more than they do the horses.\" \"We'll probably have to take what they've got or break our own, Lane.\" \"You know how I feel about it.\" \"We gentle them ourselves. If possible.\" \"If possible.\" \"Come on, Billy. Let's go horse shopping.\" Billy was near abounce when they returned with a wagon and team. Dutch grinned and winked at Lane. He'd found what they wanted too. \"You did well, Billy. That's a nice team.\" \"They'll pull a plow too, Lane. Ma won't have to do her garden by hand. Do you think she'll like the material I picked?\" \"It'll make a very pretty dress. Clete, you and Dutch load. I'm going to the telegraph office to see if we have any messages. Billy, come with me.\" \"I ought to help load, Lane. It's our stuff.\" \"Come on. You stay, I'll feel guilty. They don't really need us. Look. We'd be in the way. Clete heaves from the walk and Dutch guides it into place. They'll probably beat us to the corral.\" Billy cried when he read the telegram. Lane and the clerk carried on a long discussion about the weather and pointedly didn't notice. The culture was much like Earth's nineteenth century in some ways, but 'real men' not crying wasn't one. The contents of the message were personal. They were being polite and giving him 'privacy' to deal with his emotions. After he told them what the message was, the clerk wished every \"wallop\" message that came in was good news, and was glad that he'd come that day. They didn't have a lawman to take it to the ranch, and he'd have been trying to figure a way to take the good news out to them, and might have 'bent' the rules to do it. Billy said he'd tell his mother he'd been \"real pleasured to give the good news.\" Lane smiled, as they walked out. Billy was working very hard on the way he spoke. He was 'a man of substance' now and intended to sound like it. His purchases had included two thick, quite expensive, books. Early education took place at home, not in schools. Those were for older children, who wanted to learn things they couldn't, working with a parent, older relative or family friend. It wasn't an apprenticeship system. The duty of teaching a child was strong enough in the culture it was near totally literate, but the books Billy had chosen weren't for the purpose of teaching children to read. Those were inexpensive and plentiful. He mentioned the books and Billy began the explanation he'd remembered. He saw how the culture could produce \"bad apples.\" It was where the memory came from. That was the way it worked. His memory was cluttered with would-have-been and it was wonderful. Dutch didn't allow nightmares and Clete told him if he had one. He ignored what he remembered, after a point. Dutch wouldn't choose that path, unless it was the right one. Clete was \"getting exasperated\" with his self-doubt. He was the one they knew could be trusted to make the best choice, always, and he didn't. Lane had the feeling that was going to change. He paid attention to feelings. Mick O'Herlihy had told him it would be weird if he didn't 'get hunches' and not training a very convenient talent was silly. And then gotten him into several situations he'd 'felt' his way out of, with his head spinning, and one he hadn't. He had a feeling Dutch had to accept he had their complete trust, as they had his, soon. It wasn't lack of self-esteem. It was intense admiration. He was their center, the love that filled them with joy was perfect and total, like their father's. He was going to have to accept that love inspired love, and himself. Billy and Lane reached the livery stable just as Clete and Dutch arrived with the wagon. There were a large number of people standing around. They'd heard someone had bought the big black stallion. They wanted to see what kind of fool would buy a horse that couldn't be broken. \"That's him, Clete. Only one big enough to carry you.\" \"You're right, Dutch, and he's as pretty as you said. Hand me the hackamore and the black blanket. He'll like this saddle. It'll fit well and look real good on him. I'll meet you by the other corral in a few minutes. He'll probably need shoeing. Tell the smith I want to do it myself. He's on your way.\" \"Aren't we going to stay and watch!?\" \"We really hadn't planned on it, Billy.\" \"Lane, nobody's ever ridden that horse! Nobody! He's wild. A killer.\" \"Nonsense. Horses don't kill unless they have a very good reason. We'll stay, just so you see all the horse needs is the right kind of treatment and what that is. Go ahead, Dutch. Take the wagon. We'll catch up.\" Clete was sitting on the ground in the middle of the corral softly singing. The black animal circled him several times and he ignored it. It wasn't afraid of him. He established as mutual. It became curious and edged toward him. He sang to it and looked in its eyes. He sang of rolling plains, sweet green grass and the friendship between man and beast. The black dipped its head and he gently rubbed its nose. It danced back a few steps, but soon returned. It wasn't really wild. It had just been out on the range since a colt. It had some familiarity with people and no bad experiences there, and had also been in the corral long enough to get used to people, in general. It just didn't trust them. Since most of the people around the corral felt the same way about the very big horse, it wasn't surprising. The horses of Clete's world were augmented, but it didn't take much longer for the black to decide he was more interesting than threatening. It really wasn't a 'wild horse.' Like evolution didn't mean species were identical. This animal was a bit more 'domesticated.' He'd been told it's daddy was a plow horse, and it was obvious to Clete that the animals had been pulling plows longer on that world. He slowly stood and stroked it. He held each piece of tack up and let it get acquainted with it, then laid it back on the ground. People gasped when he vaulted on its bare back and it reared. He rode it down and sang in its ears. He could feel when it calmed and slid off. He added a bit to his estimate of time domesticated. It accepted a rider \"belonged\" very quickly. He held the local version of the hackamore up and very slowly put it on. He ran his fingers under every strap to assure their placement, then picked up the blanket. He turned the animal's head with a gentle tug on the hackamore. He made sure it watched him put the blanket on. He then picked up the saddle. He turned it over in his hands and explained all the pieces. The words held no meaning for the horse, but the soft voice calmed it and the saddle became familiar. Clete made sure it was watching when he gently set the saddle in place. The horse danced a bit, but soon calmed. Lane knew when Clete cheated. He felt him spread a blanket of calm over the horse when he tightened the cinches. He was in a bit of a hurry. He swung up in the saddle and taught the black the signals of the reins. Lane opened the corral door and he rode out. No one watching got terribly excited. It had become a very calm afternoon all over town. Lane grinned. His horse was going to be very easy to 'gentle.' He watched Clete ride toward the smithy and he and Billy went to find Dutch. \"Very nice, Dutch. Stallions.\" \"They were the only ones not bit-broken, Lane. Besides, I thought the two buckskins went nice with Clete's black.\" \"Let's saddle up. Clete's at the smithy. We'll have him check these too.\" \"Oh, no! I'll bet he takes his shirt off. There go my chances with every woman in town.\" Lane laughed. He and Dutch weren't as massive as Clete, but they were all well-proportioned. Dutch never had any trouble finding willing companions, usually several at a time. He and Clete both knew the real reason Dutch preferred multiple ladies. He thought none of them would expect attraction to develop into a long-term special relationship, if there were several. He didn't seem to realize some of them still fell in love and wanted more, but at least they knew he didn't from the beginning. They all ended up taking off their shirts. The smithy was rather secluded, so they didn't attract too large a crowd. The blacksmith changed that. He decided to have a beer and told the bartender about the size of the men working in the smithy. The bartender told him about the fight. The barmaid, who had just started her day's work. overheard. She told the girls in the hotel kitchen. Word spread. Soon every knothole in the smithy had an eye and the doorway got very crowded. Clete knew they were there, but he was keeping things calm until he finished the horses. \"Lane, as soon as he's done, it's going to get very warm around here.\" \"I know, Dutch. We'll just have to try to get him out of town while he's still thinking about his horse.\" \"Sometimes I wonder why I stick with you guys.\" \"Spillover, Clete. You need us to keep you from being mobbed. You hate it when somebody gets left out.\" \"Dutch, you're the one that likes ladies in multiples. You look for twins.\" \"Had a soft spot for look-alike ladies ever since I met Cory and Cally at the academy.\" \"There. Done. Your 'soft spot' wasn't what I was talking about.\" Dutch dumped a bucket of water over him and Clete chased him out of the smithy. They ran back in. Lane sat down on the hard-packed dirt floor and laughed. Shirtless was not something one did in public in the 'nineteenth century.' They'd shocked a very large group of women. The shock didn't last long. It wasn't Earth's 'Western' culture, just one very similar. They didn't have the same reasons to teach 'sex is sinful.' Neither unwanted pregnancy nor venereal disease was a problem and the afternoon was getting warm. Clete grabbed his shirt, swung up on the black and winced. \"I'm out of here. I'll be at the first cold stream.\" Lane and Dutch pulled on their shirts and got ready to follow. It took them awhile. They kept having to lean against things. Billy wasn't sure why they were laughing so hard, but he laughed too. He had a gold claim, supplies and a telegram to take to his mother. He was a very happy boy. The day wasn't over. They were nearing the ranch when Clete felt a problem. \"We've got company, Lane.\" \"How many, Clete?\" \"Half-dozen. Mean. Mad. Greedy.\" \"Get them for me.\" \"NO! Dutch, get Billy out of here! Lane's down! I'm after the--\" \"Sons of bitches that shot him in the back! Grab on, Billy! I'm going to put you in those rocks. We'll catch the wagon later. They won't run far.\" Dutch dropped Billy off and raced back. He heard gunfire and swung off his horse. He started his circle and took out a man holding a rifle. He wasn't gentle. He was too mad to worry about breaking him. He felt Clete's blast of rage and heard horses scream. The ones who had tried to run away would be mountless. Most people caught very little of what Clete was feeling. Most animals caught most of it. Clete stopped his horse from killing the man who had tried to kill him. Dutch ran down the two who were running. He met Clete at Lane's side. \"Bad. Damn. Why doesn't he let us know sooner?\" \"He does when it's one of us, Clete. I broke some.\" \"Me too. Slug went through. Medunit says touch and go. How far are we from Melissa?\" \"Too far. Triage. Stabilize him.\" \"He's actually sturdier than we are, Dutch. He's on his way. Go get Billy. He'll have a survivable wound by the time you get back here with the wagon. We'll use that coil of rope to secure the... men, then borrow the wagon to take them back to town.\" \"Done.\" All six men were alive, but in bad shape. Clete made sure none of them were actually dying. Billy wanted to shoot them. Dutch told him Lane would want them legally tried and convicted. Billy decided Judge Herkmer would take care of them when he rode through. In his culture, a judge decided guilt or innocence. The jury of fifteen decided penalty, within limits. If Lane lived, the men wouldn't hang. Clete didn't treat any of them. They would all be treated by a physician when they got them to town. They'd live because he'd saved Lane. That was enough. They tied the men on their horses and gently laid Lane on top of the supplies in the wagon. When they got to the ranch, they carried Lane inside, then unloaded the wagon fast. Sare just didn't understand when they began making a place for Lane in it. \"You're not going to take him with you?!\" \"Yes, Sare, we are. It's the fastest way to get him to the doctor.\" \"That bouncin' will be bad on him, Clete.\" \"We'll take it easy. We've seen enough injuries to know he'll make it. He heals real fast. He'll be fine in a few days.\" \"You're just sayin' that. He ain't gonna' make it. He's shot through the lung. If he survives, he'll be... well nigh a cripple a long time.\" \"Tell her, Clete. She'll keep it secret.\" \"Dutch... \" \"Tell her or I will. Who we are, what we are, where we come from, why we're here. I'll keep Billy busy outside.\" \"What's he mean?\" \"Lane's not going to like this. Sare, Lane wasn't shot through the lung. He was shot through the heart. He has two. We all do. Put your hands on my chest. We're not from your world. We're from the far future. Our father is... too far away to describe. It's our legacy, our job, to carry on his work. We... save worlds. This one will be murdered if we don't change the future. It will die in war. Killed by weapons that are developed too soon. We're here because someone else is here. Someone from the future. You don't believe me and I'm scaring you. Watch. This is why Lane won't die.\" He pulled the medunit from his pocket and used it on Lane. Sare gasped as she watched tissues knit together. \"It's what I used on Billy. I healed all but the flesh wound. I thought he deserved to brag about his scars. Great. Now you believe me and you're terrified. Sare, we're the good guys. The Gallants. The white knights. My mother helped destroy an army and rebuilt a world. Dutch's mother was an officer in a service that maintains the highest ideals. She gave her life to save a world. Lane's mother... I don't know. She was searching for our father. He's the true hero. We're just in the family business. Better. At least you're not terrified.\" \"You're angels.\" \"Definitely not. If Lane hadn't told me your husband was alive, I'd have proved it.\" \"How did he... \" \"Know? He sees the future. When it's terrible, we go back in the past to change it. I feel what other people feel. Dutch is the power, the love, that binds us. Lane knew he was going to be shot. It wasn't important enough to change.\" \"I was right. You're angels.\" \"Nah, just the Gallant boys.\" \"Same thing and I don't think you know much about angels. I won't tell Lane you told me.\" \"Thanks and you're right. I don't know much about angels. Lane didn't give us much briefing on the culture other than it's a lot like one we know well. He didn't even really explain why this is a frontier.\" \"The government bought it from the people who were already here. It was about empty and waitin' for the time we could meet the price. We pay half our taxes in food to earn the land, and they get it for another 68 years. Farmin' just isn't what most like to do, and they kept their numbers down, so the land could support the people huntin' and roamin' over it with their herds. When they just started blendin' in with the city people other places; goin' to school, learnin' trades and such, they worked out a plan to take care of them all and build them some schools and nice parks, horse ranches and such. It's goin' to be one country on more'n half this continent when we get this land producin' and bring the west and east together, and richer for the blendin'. I'm tryin' to think who could war like you say. It would take somethin' that would make someone true afraid.\" \"Yes, something is learned too soon. Now, not in close to a century.\" It took two days for the people of the town to come to a decision about the men keeping watch over the ones they'd brought in and put in the jail. Lane was actually 'up and around' by the time the mayor and town council visited them. He was healing incredibly fast. They'd told everyone he was lucky. Not many people could say they'd been back shot, had the bullet bounce off a bone and ended up with not much more than a flesh wound. \"Mr. Mayor, it's an honor, but--\" \"Take the job, Clete.\" \"Lane, we aren't going to be here long. They need someone who wants to help build this country.\" \"They need someone now. Today. Next week will be too late.\" \"All right. Swear me in. You've got yourself a town marshal.\" The first thing Clete did was make Dutch and Lane deputies. As soon as the official party left, they held a conference. \"All right, Lane, what do you see?\" \"Snow White and the witch. Sorry, Clete. There's a very lovely young lady who's desperately worried. Somehow, she's the key. Dutch, you're the one she turns to. Clete, the witch is your problem. She's not really that bad. You'll get her straightened out.\" \"And just what will you be doing?\" \"Spending a lot of time dizzy, Dutch. It's already starting. I need a chair. Go mingle with the townsfolk. Get acquainted. I'll be all right. I'll even meet you in the saloon. Oh, Clete, you've got another deputy. He's ready to get back to light duty. He's at the boarding house. Look him up. His name is Parker Redlore. Now go. I'm tired of keeping you in focus.\" Clete found Parker Redlore. He was a serious young man recovering from a serious injury. Clete asked to see it and did a bit of sleight of hand with the medunit. Parker decided he was fit enough to stand a watch at the jail. He told Clete he felt lots better. Clete agreed \"a reason to get up and around\" made a lot of difference. Dutch was very good at getting acquainted with the townspeople, half of them anyway. He met some men too. Then he saw Snow White. She was fairytale beautiful; black hair and porcelain skin. Perfectly proportioned to fit in a man's arms and lips created for kissing. She was also being hustled down the walk by an older woman. She looked up and right into his eyes. His head swam. He was drowning in twin blue pools. The older woman gave her arm a yank and called her a hussy. She meekly dropped her eyes and hurried along. That's when the shooting started. Dutch dove for cover. Six men were barreling down the street on horseback. As soon as they passed him, he vaulted on behind the one trailing. He tossed him from the saddle and went after the next one. He was on his third when Clete dove from atop a porch and took the lead three out of their saddles. It had been a very short jail break attempt. Clete and Dutch grabbed two unconscious men each and dragged them toward the jail. It was getting very full. Clete went back for the last two and Dutch got acquainted with Parker. He really liked the kid. The townspeople were very pleased with their full jail. They decided to hold the ice cream social, stock sale and dance, they'd been considering canceling, after all. Four men took a big wagon up into the mountains to get ice. They were quite sure the social would be well-attended. Four days was plenty of time for word to spread to outlying ranches the town was now a safe place to bring families. Their new lawmen were personally invited by a large number of people. Early that afternoon, Dutch asked Lane who should watch when. He just smiled at him. \"All right, we draw straws. Short straw takes first watch. Long straw takes last.\" \"Make that four straws, Dutch. I'm in on this too.\" \"You got it, Parker. Four straws it is.\" Dutch grinned at his new friend. Clete had been busy. Every time Parker fell asleep on the cot in the office, Clete used the medunit on him. A few more naps and he'd have nothing but a scar to remind him of the hole in his side. \"Long straw. Well, at least I'll get to see the stock show and have ice cream at the church. A lawman's work is never done. Later.\" \"Dutch, you've got the short straw. Clete's and mine are the same length.\" \"Ah, well, I wasn't that interested in the stock show and I will get to go to the dance, but I'd sure appreciate it if you'd send me a dish of ice cream. You know, Parker's really dedicated. He's a lawman because he wants to make the 'frontier' safe for people. When we leave, he should be marshal, Lane.\" \"Yes, Dutch. A real prince of a guy.\" \"Oh.\" Lane led Clete to the ice cream social. He didn't have any trouble identifying Snow White. She was obvious even before he asked for ice cream for Dutch. He grinned at Lane when he identified the witch. \"I'll take it to him.\" \"You'll do no such-- Drat that girl. I'll never turn her into a proper lady. Her father should have sent her to me years ago.\" \"Ma'am, I think you're doing a fine job. She seems like a very nice girl.\" \"Oh, she's nice enough, but she just won't walk and talk like a lady. I mean, look at the way she ran out of here. No bonnet. Runnin' down the street with a dish in her hand.\" \"Ma'am, I think being a lady is something that comes from inside. Any woman can wear a bonnet and walk and talk proper. A lady is something more. She's got you as an example. She's bound to turn out right.\" \"Please call me Bella, Marshal. Won't you have another dish of ice cream?\" \"If you'd be willing to join me in that shady spot over there, I'd love one.\" \"Lispeth, I'm goin' to sit a bit with the marshal. You come dip.\" Clete smiled as she dropped her apron on a chair and came round the table. He noticed she hadn't put on her bonnet. Bella was a very handsome woman, if a bit strait-laced. He noticed the afternoon was getting warm in his vicinity and wondered if she was planning on loosening those laces a bit. He also knew exactly when Dutch got his ice cream. \"I brought you some ice cream. The marshal said you'd asked and I... \" She was breathless and blushing. Dutch decided he was going to get hurt. He was already in love. \"Thank you. I thought it was the only thing I was going to miss this afternoon. I seem to have been very wrong. But now, it's here and you're here and I haven't missed anything after all. Let's sit on the porch. I feel like a real villain eating ice cream and sharing lovely company in front of all those misguided people back there. They call me Dutch. What's your name?\" \"Tessa. I probably should get back. My aunt will be upset if I don't.\" \"Was your aunt with you in town a few days ago?\" \"Yes. I saw what you did. You were wonderful.\" Dutch looked into her eyes and got dizzy. \"Uh, just doing my job.\" He was in trouble. She was pure and sweet and innocent, and he'd have promised to stay with her forever in that instant. And would have. And counted himself lucky. \"Speaking of jobs, you came to see me for something. You wanted to talk to a lawman.\" \"That's just the way Parker says it, proud-like. I been tryin' to think of a way to see him, but my aunt would never believe it was just business.\" \"I see. You and he are more than friends.\" \"Fore my pa sent me to my aunt's place, he used to come over of a Sabbath and have dinner.\" \"Why did your father send you to your aunt?\" \"He said to learn proper lady things, but I don't believe it. He never said anything about it before. He was scared of somethin' and wanted me safe. I'm real worried. I ain't heard from him in more'n ten days and he wasn't in church on Sabbath.\" \"It sounds like he may be in trouble. Can you tell me any more?\" \"My pa's a good man. He's real smart. He makes all kinds of interestin' things. He sells some of 'em to people to make lots of 'em. Gets money for every one they sell. We do pretty good on it.\" \"A successful inventor. A very rare and talented individual. You said you thought something had scared him. Any idea what?\" \"I don't know more'n it started after a funny little man came to visit. I watched from my window. It was pretty late at night. He got Pa out of bed. He showed Pa somethin' and he got real excited. He put on his pants and went off with him. He snuck back in early in the mornin'. Acted funny when I asked him about it. Said he'd been busy makin' us rich and I shouldn't pry.\" Dutch made the mistake of looking into her eyes again. He swallowed. It didn't help the lump in his throat at all. He hadn't expected it to help the one in his chest. \"We thought something strange might be going on around here. This town sprouted more than its usual crop of nasties recently. We've been trying to figure out why.\" \"Well, two of them fellas I seen afore. They work for a minin' company Pa built some things for. They got a big dig up in the mountains. They come got the things Pa built.\" \"Tessa, I want you to go back to the fair and find my brother... Never mind. Why don't you go to the stock show? I think you'll see someone there who will be real pleased to see you.\" \"My aunt will be mad, says ladies don't belong in barns.\" \"Your aunt probably won't even notice. Unless I miss my guess, she's in the company of my brother Clete.\" \"The marshal?!\" \"That's the one. I doubt she'll be looking for you.\" \"Aunt Bella with the marshal, she's probably just as glad I'm not around.\" She giggled. Dutch thought it was the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard. \"Thank you, Dutch. I feel lots better.\" She flashed him a dazzling smile and walked away. He groaned and buried his face in his hands. \"Dammit, Clete. Not now!\" Lane walked around the corner of the building and sat down in the chair Tessa had just vacated. Dutch didn't even look up. \"Go to the saloon, Dutch. Find company. You two were running a feedback loop. Get drunk if necessary.\" \"Lane--\" \"Go. I'll take over. You don't want to be here when Parker comes in.\" \"You're right. He'll be floating on air and all I'll want to do is ground him. You all right?\" \"Yes. You've made the change. I needed a nice quiet place to let the images settle. Now, GO!\" Dutch was too busy meeting people to actually drink much, but he had several companions, two of whom were carrying unopened bottles, when he got to the large open area where the fair, which the people called a \"social,\" was being held. The sound of gunfire had attracted his attention. It didn't surprise him at all that Clete found him immediately. He was feeling pretty strange. \"Dutch, you're going to get drunk.\" \"Yes, Clete, I certainly am. Lane's orders. The girls are his idea too. What's going on?\" \"Sharpshooting show.\" \"About time for Lane to show up. Let's show off. I need it. Ego boost. Found out a knight loses to a prince.\" \"The way it has to be.\" \"Come on, girls. The Gallant boys are about to join the show.\" \"I'd have never known he'd been drinking. Do you really intend to be in the show?\" \"If Dutch says he needs it, he needs it. I'll find you a nice place to sit and watch, Bella. Just promise you won't go away. I plan on taking you dancing later.\" \"Don't you worry, Marshal. I'll be right where you can find me.\" \"Hi, Clete, Ma'am.\" \"You know what's going on, Lane?\" \"Yes. We'll be waiting for you. Routine three. The whole thing. The horses are standing behind the grandstand.\" \"He really does need a boost. Alcohol?\" \"He really does and you know he'd never pull a gun if he didn't know exactly how much he'd had and what its effect would be.\" \"Yeah, he wants the anesthesia, but needs the boost. Routine three should be enough of one to reduce the desire for the anesthesia. I'll be there.\" Clete found a place in the grandstand for Bella and met Dutch and Lane by the horses. The horses weren't trained for the routine, but they'd only use them for the intro. They vaulted on. They were riding bareback. Clete nodded and Lane signaled the emcee. They kicked the horses into motion and started boosting Dutch's ego. They rode, tumbled, shot, tumbled, shot again. Then they really started showing off. The finale was perfect. Dutch started his run. Lane did the lift and Clete tossed him. He soared into the air, did an impossible double fast draw, and shot the tops off six pennants at the top of his flight. He reholstered the guns and dropped onto their crossed arms. They tossed him into the air and did handsprings. They ended in a line and set six guns spinning in perfect synchronization. They spun and put two shots each through the center of the target, spun guns into holsters, turned toward the audience and bowed. Total silence. They whistled for their horses and vaulted on. They actually got out of the performing ring before the place exploded in cheers. \"I FEEL BETTER!\" Lane and Clete laughed. They told their horses they were wonderful and Lane led them back to their stalls, then he began looking for company. The band was tuning up and the dance would be foot-stomping fun. Company found him. A lot of it. Dutch swept through with more company and they hit the dance floor. Clete escorted Bella onto the floor and the town cut loose. They collected guns when a few men decided to shoot theirs into the air. The party didn't get much quieter, but it did get safer. \"Lane, we're getting out of here. Things are really starting to warm up.\" \"I noticed, Dutch. I don't think I'm going to be able to stand the heat much longer either. See you in the morning. Ladies, I'm drowning in moonslight. Save me.\" \"Where are they going, Marshal?\" \"Walking in the moonslight.\" \"All of them?\" \"I'm the only one who's chosen a lady for the evening. They just have company. Would you like to take a walk in the moonslight, Bella?\" \"Yes, Marshal, I would.\" He smiled. She sounded surprised. He could feel her pleasure in the invitation and the surprise. \"Please, I'm only Marshal when I'm working. I am most definitely off duty. I'm Clete.\" \"I'm glad you're off duty, Clete.\" Dutch watched the street from the office. The town was nice and peaceful. It made him feel very nice. He'd had a nice night and didn't have the hangover he'd been planning before they'd showed off. He nodded to Bella and Clete on the walk across the street. \"That is a changed woman, Lane. She's beautiful.\" \"Amazing what a little bit of Clete's own brand of sunshine can do for a late bloomer. Nice thing is, it'll last. She's discovered she's beautiful, Dutch. Now she always will be. Ah, that's the judge. We need to get this done and find that mining company.\" \"Did you see him light up when Clete introduced Bella?\" \"Yes. So did Clete. That's one worry off his mind.\" \"I'm gone, Lane. Out the back. See you in court.\" Lane sighed and ached a bit for Dutch. He didn't blame him for not wanting to be there when the two approaching the door arrived. He needed a bit of time to bury the hurt a bit deeper. \"Hello, Parker. You must be Tessa. It's very nice to meet you.\" \"Tessa, this is Lane. Isn't Dutch here? We were goin' to ask him to lunch.\" \"Sorry, Parker, you just missed him. You two go on. Busy day. There are Sare and Billy Kendirk.\" \"Oh, what a pretty dress.\" \"Please tell her that, Tessa, and make sure Billy hears. He chose that material for her. He said it was the first store-bought present he'd ever given her.\" \"Lane, you're a nice man. All of you are nice. Dutch especially. I felt much better after we'd talked. It was like I had a big brother I could tell my worries.\" \"I'm sure he'd be complimented. I don't think anyone's ever said that to him before. Ah, Sare, Billy. You know Tessa and Parker, I believe.\" \"Hello, Tessa. Parker, you're looking well. You had us worried for awhile.\" \"I'm much better, Ma'am. Been healin' right well.\" \"Sare, that's a real pretty dress.\" \"Billy picked the material for me, Tessa.\" \"Think I'll have him come shoppin' with me. I never know what's goin' to be pretty made up. Not many men have the knack. Musta' got it from his pa. He always picks you pretty things too.\" Lane worked to keep his hurt for Dutch out of his eyes and smile. He really had found Snow White, but she'd already found her prince. \"Billy, I think Clete will want you. You'll be testifying. I think he'd like you to meet the judge. I saw them go into the hotel.\" \"I want to meet him too, Lane. It'll be easier sayin' what I got to say if'n he's not a stranger. I'll head over there. All right, Ma?\" \"Certainly is. You got important things to do. You get 'em done.\" She smiled as he ran across the street. Parker made a swipe as he went by and laughed when he missed. \"Amazin' how this town's changed since you boys come. How you been, Lane?\" \"I'm just fine, Sare.\" She watched Parker and Tessa enter the hotel, then turned and grinned at him. \"Yep. Amazin' how healthy everthin' got after the Gallant boys walked in from somewhere.\" Frontier justice was swift. The judge heard the testimony, asked the prisoners questions and made his decision. The fifteen men and women set the punishment. The six, who had attacked them, were given the maximum of twelve years \"confinement and labor.\" The other six, who had made a loud and foolish attempt to scare the town into letting them go, were given one year. If Lane had died, six would have also died. With the town and jail empty of 'bad guys' and Parker on his feet, they weren't really needed there any longer. Clete turned over his badge to Parker and they headed out to solve the real problem. \"Do we check the mine or the farm first?\" \"You choose.\" \"Again, huh? I hate doing this when we're riding, Lane. I'm afraid I'll hit something big and you'll fall off. The farm. CLETE! Help me get him down!\" \"I've got him! What happened, Dutch?\" \"I asked him farm or mine and he told me to choose.\" \"While we were riding?\" \"That's what I said.\" \"You picked?\" \"The farm. I don't think he expected this.\" \"I didn't. Find us some place in the shade. This is.…\" \"Bring the horses, Dutch. He's clear out. We hit something bigger than one planet in trouble. Shade. Get water. I hear a stream over that way.\" Clete settled Lane and sat down. \"Clete, wrong choice. Bad choice. Both wrong.\" \"Lane! Lane? Dutch, we've got to decide to do something totally different. We've got to change things fast.\" \"We use Melissa?\" \"Done.\" \"Roller coaster. Swoops and dives. Flying.\" \"Lane, we're going back to Melissa.\" \"Good choice, Dutch.\" \"Here. Cold water. Do you need me? Do you want me to come in?\" \"No. Just give it time to steady. They're not what they seem. Six of one. Half-dozen of the other. We have to choose the right ones. Our key. Snow White. Everything follows.\" \"The men we put away?\" \"No, Dutch. Twelve await. Our test. Our judgment. Our choice.\" \"Clete, he's not making a lot of sense.\" \"He's worried, but not lost. Still confused. Getting better. Scared a little. For us.\" \"I'm worried all right. We're about to undergo a very strange test. It's waiting for us in the clearing with Melissa. We'll be given one clue. Snow White. Just that. I don't know what it means, but that's what we're given. Each of us must make exactly the right choice. We're facing judgment. I'm ready.\" \"Do you have any images after we reach Melissa?\" \"No, Dutch. Once we ride into the clearing, everything ends. We're given the clue and told we must choose on our way there.\" \"No point in putting it off. I'll get the horses.\" \"Clete, somehow, everything we've done, everything we are, has been leading to this. Dutch is our center, but he still feels like the weak link. As if he doesn't really belong.\" \"I know. Our talents are obvious. He isn't really capable of envy, but he gets wistful about them. He puts his life in our hands with a trust that frightens me. If we asked him to die, he would cheerfully give up his life and only ask if we were sure it was necessary.\" \"That's some progress. A few years ago he wouldn't have asked. You know, he's the only one who belongs here. We're outsiders. Both born on the other side of the doorway. This is his home. He's our touchstone with this universe.\" \"The choice must be his.\" \"Yes, Clete, the choice is his. We have to believe in him, as he does in us. Are you ready to die if he says it's necessary?\" \"A very good question. I need-- No I don't. The answer is yes. His lack of faith in himself makes it hard for me. I have to look past it. I find it's his and not my own.\" \"Good. I think we have one major problem.\" \"Convincing him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"They weren't real happy about leaving that nice fresh clover. I finally convinced them. Told them too much would give them tummy aches. All right. You're both looking at me like... I don't know, but something's up.\" \"Yes, Dutch. It's time you carried your load. We're handing it to you.\" \"Lane, I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"He's telling you the choice is yours. Whatever it is, it will be the right one for us. We give you ourselves. Use us as you deem necessary. Stop it! Why can't you trust yourself? We have complete faith in you. You must know that. You don't know it. Lane, he just doesn't believe me.\" \"Then we show him. Sit down, Dutch. Between us. We're going to take you apart and put you back together again. Decide now. Are we doing the wrong thing?\" \"You never do the wrong thing.\" \"There it is. That's the problem. Of course I do, but I do the best I can. So does Clete. So do you. That's all that really matters. Take our hands. You must decide. We can't join together unless you will it. You are our binding force. I'm not even sure we'd exist in this universe without you.\" \"That's silly. Of course you'd exist.\" \"Would we, Dutch? Clete's from the past of another universe, created out of one woman's love and determination to give him existence, an impossible feat. I helped bring my own mother to my father, but you brought her into our reality. You are real. Your mother made a choice and used well-known biological techniques, the tested methods of science. Clete and I are impossible. You are not. We're dreams come true. You are firmly real.\" \"Lane, you're scaring him.\" \"Good. He needs the courage it takes to overcome fear. He can't go on being fearless. It's not real.\" \"All right. You want to show me. Do it.\" Dutch reached for them and pulled their minds to his. He fought down his fear and conquered it. They broke him apart. They showed him what he was to them, their faith in him. Their absolute, unquestioning, trust. The union was complete. He was one being and three. His doubt died. He learned himself. His was the power of choice. He was their freedom and his own. Mistakes were unimportant. Trust and striving were all. They gave him their love. The ultimate gesture of total trust. He showed them his. They had always known. He had been afraid of failing them. He learned he could not. He slowly separated them from himself and found they remained bound to him. He would always know where they were, when they were, and how they fared. He had taken his place and accepted his burden. \"Wow.\" \"I believe that expresses it nicely. All right, Dutch. Now I think we're ready. How about it?\" \"It'll take me awhile to get my feet back on the ground, Lane, but yes, we're ready.\" \"Good. I'm drowning in your pleasure. Put your backside in the saddle. Let's get this done.\" \"Clete, you're a fraud. You're singing inside.\" \"Dutch, if we don't start riding, it'll be outside too.\" Actually, they all sang several songs their father had taught them. The folk medley from the 'Sixties' just seemed appropriate somehow. They were going to be tested. They were ready. Dutch reined in and just stared at her for a few seconds. This was more than a likeness. \"Snow White, right out of the cel.\" \"Yes, Dutch. The test awaits you. It is life or death and you three must choose. You may choose only six. No more. The powers of this universe have met and you are their battleground.\" \"Good and evil.\" \"Do you think it that simple?\" \"No. Chaos and order; life and death, shadow and light, endings and beginnings. They can't exist without each other.\" \"You are so very young to have the wisdom to see it. I am here because it is your wish to serve that which also possesses the wisdom. Remember, no more than six.\" \"That's your clue, Dutch. We have faith in your decision.\" \"I know, Lane. I'm ready.\" They rode into the clearing and stopped in surprise. Twelve beautiful women stood awaiting them. They dismounted and their horses trotted off. One of the women stepped forward and smiled. \"We are companions for you. You have the choice of six.\" \"What happens to the others?\" \"They will be slain.\" \"And if I choose none? What happens to you?\" \"We will live, but you three will be slain. Do not choose that way. You are needed.\" \"I've made the choice. We'd rather die than be the cause of death to innocents. Kill us. We're prepared.\" The women lifted the bows laying at their feet and they fell in a rain of arrows. Lane whispered, \"It was the right choice, Dutch.\" He knew it was. He smiled as he died. \"Awaken.\" Dutch opened his eyes. Snow White sat on the ground near his feet. He sat up and checked Lane and Clete. \"They live, as do you.\" \"I'd assumed I was alive. I was dead?\" \"If life was not truly risked, it would not have been the testing you wanted. \" \"I guess we did, I did, want it. That's why you're Snow White and not Lane's or Clete's dream girl.\" \"Why did you choose this way? \"We want to protect life. Want to serve it. Choosing life for some and death for others may be necessary sometime, but if we had the choice, it would be life for all. The choice we were asked to make had no compassion. Without compassion, we are a force for destruction. It is not what we have chosen to be.\" \"You have chosen a symbol. It is fitting. Awaken your brothers.\" \"Clete, Lane, wake up. We have company. Seems I made our decision correctly.\" Lane and Clete sat up and grinned at him. They hadn't had any doubts. \"Kneel before me. You have been tested and found to be pure of heart. Your oath to serve life was given in your choice.\" Snow White produced a gleaming sword from somewhere and tapped Dutch, then Clete and Lane on both shoulders. \"Roberrin, I name you Knight Champion. Pericles, I name you Knight Guardian. Apollo, I name you Knight Judge.\" Suddenly she was gone from the clearing. \"How about that? We have official status. Our side, three. Opponent, zip.\" \"Dutch, I've got memories again. We've still got a change to make.\" \"And I'm absolutely awash in brotherly love. Horses or Melissa, Lane?\" \"Both, Clete. Round them up. I'll see if I can talk Melissa into a new shape. Dutch, I'll need you. She listens better if you're around.\" \"Right, Lane. Sure she does. You neglect to mention she only listens to you.\" They spent the night in Melissa and set out on the road in the morning. Lane had been successful. The bright painting on the side of the wagon said \"Gallant Brothers Traveling Show.\" The buckskins didn't mind pulling it. The black tossed his head and danced down the road ahead of them. They headed for the farm first. It didn't take them long to find the evidence they'd expected. \"We're on the right track, Lane. Tessa's father was working with radioactive materials. I found residual traces in his workshop. Is this the piece you meant?\" \"That's it. Dutch, come over here. What do you think of this?\" \"I think our time traveler is stranded without it. He wouldn't have left it behind unless... He doesn't want someone else to have time travel! He's a fool, but not intentionally destructive.\" \"Most of the stuff in the shed looks like they were working on power generation.\" \"That would make sense, Clete. All right. I've got a clear image of the way to the mining camp. Put that piece in Melissa. He kept it out of their hands. We have to do the same. Let's see... Dutch you drive. I really need some rest. I spent most of last night trying to pick a clear path through the jumble in my head. Wake me when you need me.\" \"Lane, why don't you go in and go to bed?\" \"I like the feel of the sun. Oh, hide our keys. Yours and mine. Clete can keep his around his neck. Three alike is too many. They'll... Ah, that's better. Good choice. They'll never notice.\" Dutch shook his head and tucked the keys into the horses' harness. They became one more decoration in the gaudy equipment. He smiled, as he looked at Lane curled up behind the seat of Melissa-as-wagon. He felt a surge of protectiveness. Clete grinned at him as he climbed up beside him. It was a new feeling from Dutch. He'd been waiting for it a long time. He chuckled softly when Dutch arranged himself to keep the sun off Lane's fair face. Clete tapped Lane awake at the crossroads. He pointed and went back to sleep. They maintained their cover by camping at a spot that showed frequent use. Lane stood watch while Clete and Dutch slept. They dawdled over breakfast and took their time breaking camp. They knew they were about to have company. Everything was put away and Dutch was hitching the horses when it rode in. \"What are you doin' here?\" \"Hitching a horse to a wagon. Oh. Traveling. We're showmen. The Gallant Brothers. I'm sure you've heard of us. I'm Dutch. My brothers are around here someplace. We took so long over breakfast, they decided to fix lunch.\" \"This road doesn't go anywhere.\" \"You mean it doesn't go up to a big mine?\" \"What do you know about that?\" \"I know where there are hard-working men, there's money to be made. Sounded like a big enough operation to be worth the trip. There are my brothers now. All right! We eat good today.\" \"Hi there. Company for lunch. Come on, Clete. Bring those fish over here. Let's stuff them. I've got some wild tubers and herbs. Dutch, where are your manners? Introduce us.\" \"Sorry, Lane, we hadn't gotten that far. I'll stir up the fire. Ouch! Stones are good and hot. Hmm... Ooh, those leaves smell good. The fish will be nice wrapped in them. Won't you join us Mister... \" \"Carna. Lef Carna. Don't mind if I do. Sure looks good.\" \"In a few minutes, it'll smell that way. I'm Clete. That's Lane. I catch the fish, but he turns them into a feast.\" \"How do, Mr. Carna.\" \"Jes, Lef. Where'd you boys come from?\" \"Down south lately. We've never really had a place to be from. Our dad's a traveling man, quite a magician. Never could figure out how he made all those flowers appear. We're on our own now. Put together our own kind of show. Got enough material we can vary it to suit the audience.\" \"Where'd you hear about the mine?\" \"Dutch, do you remember?\" \"Not right off hand, Lane. Yes I do. A pretty girl told me about it. I stuck it on our route.\" \"What was the girl's name?\" \"Lef, you just asked my brother a question he probably can't answer. He doesn't remember their names. Just tells them they're beautiful and gives them a farewell kiss.\" \"Clete, I remember their names. I just don't always remember which name went with which girl. I usually just give them one I think suits them. Let's see... I called her 'Snow White.' She had soft white skin and big blue eyes. Wasn't too long back. I spent an afternoon with her. I had dates for the evening. Twins I think. Sisters? Four of them, anyway. All with soft brown hair. No, they were just friends. Yeah, friends. Or...maybe that was the night I woke up with a whole bunch and I couldn't remember where I found them all.\" \"See what I mean? A question he can't answer.\" Lef laughed. He liked these boys. \"Well, the boss keeps a pretty tight lid on things. We don't see many strangers, but we could use a good show. We had a bunch of boys ride off with our supply list and they ain't come back. They were carryin' a little money, but not a lot. I figure they got drunk and spent it and lit out. You boys could make extra if you're carryin' good drink.\" \"Sorry, Lef. Got enough trouble with Dutch sober. Drunk he gets in more. Forgets to ask if they're married. Lane and I hate having to leave town in a hurry.\" \"Too bad. Even the saloon's gettin' low.\" \"You have a saloon?!\" \"Dutch, we got everthin'. Good-size town, all in all.\" \"Women?\" \"Them too. Jes be careful. Right number of 'em's married.\" \"Yippee! This isn't going to be as boring as I thought.\" They'd needed Lef. He got them through the guards and Dutch to the mine owner's office. That person wasn't pleased. \"Boss, we need somethin' new. They're jes' showmen. I jes' don' see no problem.\" \"You aren't paid to make decisions. I told you not to let people come here, not guide them in. Get out of here, Lef. Before I forget you're a good miner.\" \"Sir, we put on a good show. We're even getting pretty well-known places. We're here. Why don't you let us do what we're good at?\" \"All right, but keep to your own business.\" \"No problem. A mine is a mine. You've seen one hole in the ground, you've seen them all. I like sunshine and moonslight. And women. You don't find any of them in a hole.\" Dutch grinned at the man who made his skin crawl. He'd already figured out what was being hidden. There were other things being pulled out, but he was standing over a uranium mine. \"We'll put on a big show day after tomorrow.\" \"Why so long?\" \"You want to give everybody a day off? You do, we'll do it sooner. We just figured you'd want it on the day most of the men aren't working.\" \"Day after tomorrow.\" Dutch left the office and walked to the saloon. Lane had told him they needed to enhance their reputation a bit. He and Clete were already there. They'd taken rooms at the hotel. Dutch wasn't looking forward to the hangover he had been told to build. \"Day after tomorrow.\" \"Right. Clete, what's the feel of the place?\" \"Suppressed energy. Hard labor with not a lot of ways to unwind. Worry. Some fear. Unfocused. Lane, some of these men are in bad shape.\" \"I saw it. Radiation sickness. There's more here than just a mine. We could synthesize the drug, but I don't see any way to give it to them.\" \"I do, Lane. Let's set up a still, get real drunk tomorrow night and give it away. Real friendly.\" \"Ow, my head. Two hangovers in a row is too much to think about, Dutch.\" \"I think one is enough too, Clete. Tomorrow night we'll drink a substitute. They won't know the difference. We'll add some herbs to it. Sell it as a tonic, then 'get wasted' and give it away. Lane can make it taste good.\" \"Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"No, I'm all right. Not bad. Good change. Images clearing. We've got a path. A good one. All the way through. Damn. Well, it'll be worth it.\" \"Uh, Clete, did that 'damn' make you as nervous as it did me?\" \"Yeah, Dutch. Why is it I'm no longer worried about a hangover?\" \"We'll get through. Tessa's father and our traveler are in the mine. They think our nasty has Tessa. There's a girl here with the same coloring. He showed her from a distance and sent them a piece of her hair. Our time traveler is from this world. He's an incredible genius, but time travel was an accident. He found the mineral and figured out what he'd done after the fact. He wanted to stop the terrible chemical pollution of his time. Thought he could do it by creating nuclear power and bypassing the fossil fuel age. A bit dotty. Looked up Tessa's dad as a great inventor in the right area. He's just as worried about Tessa as her dad is. Nice old boy. He'll be willing to listen to what we have to say, but we have to show him his world comes out of its chemical slog. He's going to fall in love with Melissa.\" \"Lane, what are we going to get through?\" \"Dutch, you don't really want to know.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Where do we start?\" \"Right here. No, wait. We've got to get the still going. Clete, you and me. Dutch, find all the women you can. Go out of here with a bottle in one hand and your shirt in the other. Make a point of asking if they're married. Clete and I will join you in the same condition. We're going to do some heavy showing off. No guns. Pure physical stuff. Clete, it's going to be a very warm night. We're going to be spread a bit thin. We want the undivided attention of every single woman here.\" \"How many is that?\" \"About two dozen.\" \"No problem.\" Lane and Dutch laughed and Clete grinned. Lane still felt a little odd, but he was too wise to dwell on something before it happened. Dutch watched them leave, then went to the bar and ordered two bottles. Drunk was going to take quite a bit of the rather watered alcohol served in the place. He wondered what Lane would say if he asked for a hangover cure. They'd agreed not to use it. They had decided it was too easy. If they were going to abuse themselves, they should pay for it. This was different. It was in the line of duty. He decided they shouldn't suffer for it. Lane would see the decision and make the arrangements. He made a swift end to one bottle and started on the other. He knew what kind of single girls he would find in a mining camp, but by the time he got through the second bottle, they would be beautiful ladies. He grinned at the bartender's expression when he handed him the second empty bottle and ordered a third. He didn't open it. It would spill. That was it. He was ready. He took off his shirt and shook out his hair, gave a whoop and burst out the doors. He did a tumbling run down the middle of the road and grinned. Both shirt and bottle were a bit dusty, but neither was damaged. He asked the first woman he saw if she was married and did she have friends. She said no and yes and he started gathering them. They weren't shy. He was dizzy with kisses when Lane and Clete found them. They showed off. Miners coming off shift got in the spirit and challenged Clete to contests of strength. Dutch ran a race against a horse and won. Lane spun through the women and every lace was undone and in his hands. They did a perfect tumbling routine, then headed back to the saloon. They cleaned out the stocks and shared them around. The moons came up and Clete let loose. The night got warm, very warm. They'd gotten the women a bit drunk too. They'd found it was a good way to keep them from noticing their two heartbeats, until they stopped noticing period. When morning came, Lane handed Dutch and Clete small capsules and swallowed his own. Clete stretched and purred. They left a large group of sleeping people in the meadow and went to find a hot bath, shirts and breakfast. \"Clete, you're purring again. It makes my teeth rattle.\" \"Sorry, Dutch. I'm trying not to. Just takes a bit of shutdown time.\" \"You were wide open and broadcasting last night. Wonder how many people here in the camp picked it up.\" \"Look around, Dutch. A lot of them. Those three women over there are married.\" \"I see what you mean, Lane. They look very contented.\" \"They are. The only frustrated people in this camp are single men. All but three of them.\" \"Clete, you're smug. Since I am too, I'm sure it's appropriate. But the purring drives me crazy!\" \"Let's get to work. These are the herbs I need for flavor. Clete, you get them. Stay away from the mining operation. Dutch, you start the drug synthesis. I'm going to buy a lot of grain. Mention I need to replenish my mash.\" \"Lane, you're really going to fix these people up, aren't you?\" \"What do you mean, Clete?\" \"I recognize a few of these. Looked over your shoulder when you were analyzing the local plants. Our tonic is going to cure practically every disease on the planet and give them a good vitamin dose besides.\" \"It'll taste good too. They've got a magnificent biota. I don't blame Professor Princar for wanting to save it. Most of those plants are already being used. Their medicine shows are true aids, not fraudulent like the ones on Earth were. Their biota is why they're much healthier in general. Medicine shows bring herbal aids from elsewhere. Birth control in a tea and antibiotic in poultices, salves and powders. They're just beginning to learn why the things they've been using for centuries work. It's why our time-traveler is so desperate to save it and chose this as the time. Tessa's father is aware of what they'd be be losing. If there was something to help radiation sickness, I'd have used it instead of having Dutch synthesize. Oh, unlock Melissa for him. Ride out bare-chested and bareback, gathering bag over your shoulder.\" \"All right, but I'm taking a shirt. Dutch sometimes misses places when he spreads screen and I hate finding out about it when I get red spots.\" They laughed and went to work. By late afternoon, they were ready to sell their tonic. They didn't have to pitch it. Every working girl in the camp pitched it for them. Men started lining up as soon as they saw them setting up. They sold it by the dipper and by the bottle. A few special bottles were prepared just for children. They contained everything but the alcohol. They said they never charged for children's tonic. They drank copious amounts of fluid that looked like the same thing, but wasn't. The actual alcohol content of the tonic was fairly low. They started acting drunk and got generous. Dutch slipped extra doses into the dipper for men who were in more advanced stages of radiation poisoning. Clete did his sleight of hand with the medunit on a few men with the type of injuries that occurred among pick-and-shovel miners. Lane brought buckets of their tonic out and kept the big iron kettle brimming. They kept careful count and Dutch took a friendly half-dozen bottles to the saloon. He shared them with the bartender and the working girls. Clete gave take-home bottles to the shaft boss to give the men working the last shift. They bottled the last kettle-full and left the bottles sitting out, then went to the hotel for a good night's sleep, about four hours. They got ready to build their show arena early in the morning. Clete made sure they were all well-spread with a good sunscreen. Dutch said he didn't plan on getting any sun on \"that part\" of his anatomy. Clete told him to hold still. Lane made sure Clete didn't get spots, then they went for wood. The hammering attracted attention and an audience. Lane and Dutch grinned at each other when Clete took off his shirt. Several of the married women gasped, but they didn't leave, just stood and watched him split rails. He shook his head and laughed when Lane and Dutch dumped buckets of water over him. They finished the arena and grandstand by mid-afternoon and went to get ready. They asked the bartender to collect admission for them on the way to Melissa. They replicated three snow-white, silver-trimmed outfits and strapped on guns. They had trained the horses and added several pieces to routine three. Clete whistled and they started the show. The miners and others in the camp were a very appreciative audience. They didn't know some of the things they did couldn't have been done by someone from their world, but they were sure they'd just seen the best sharpshooting show on it. Dutch was feeling very nice when they rode out of the arena to thunderous applause. Clete was pleased too, but there was an undercurrent of tension in Lane that kept him from reveling in Dutch's pleasure. \"That went well. The horses are born performers.\" \"Clete, that's an understatement. They and we were magnificent.\" \"Dutch, give me your gunbelt. You too, Clete. We don't want them on us. I'm going to give them to the hotel manager and ask him to keep them for us. I already told the bartender to give him the gate receipts to put in the safe. Clete, do you have the medunit?\" \"Yes.\" \"Let me see... Dutch, put it behind the lamp at the mine entrance. We'll want it, but we don't want it found. Push it back in the niche. Do it, then meet us back here. Don't be seen. Move fast. Now.\" Clete watched Lane 'waiting.' He could feel his tension had become anticipation of something and it wasn't pleasant. \"Dutch is close and so is something else. Tell me what it is, Lane.\" \"Pain. Our nasty boys are real sick. They want us. We're going to have to let them have us. It's the path to the survival of this world.\" \"Can't we change it?\" \"We could. Do you want to risk it?\" \"Risk what?\" \"Changing something because it's hard on us, Dutch.\" \"A silly question. Don't you think so, Clete?\" \"Yeah. Sorry I asked.\" \"Oops. Unit's in place. Now what?\" \"A good meal. The boarding house porch. Enjoy it. It'll be our last for awhile.\" Lane nearly hoped something would change things, but nothing did. It happened just as he remembered. Before they'd quite finished dinner, they were taken to the mine owner's house. \"They were easy to take, Boss. We just held guns on everybody else in the place and they stood there and let us chain them up.\" \"Idiot. You made them heroes. Well, spread the word we found out they're wanted men and were after the payroll anyway. Maybe somebody will believe it.\" \"Nobody's going to come up here to the house for 'em, Boss.\" \"Lef might have, but I put him back out on the trail. Did you get their wagon?\" \"Yeah, but we can't get it open.\" \"Search them for keys. No, I think I'll do it myself. Hold very still if you don't want a bullet put through your brother's head.\" Lane held his breath. He could feel Clete's anger. He breathed in relief when he felt him clamp down on it. He held very still. He felt Dutch begin to pull them together. It worried him. It wasn't in his memories. He gasped and concentrated on the shifting images. Dutch had made a good choice. The path was still clear. Being together would make what they had to go through easier. He felt the gun at his head and watched as Dutch was searched. Clete's turn came last. The man found the key around his neck, but didn't realize what it was. He left it there. They laughed together in their minds. He had found the key to the universe and had not recognized it. Then it began. Endless hours of pain for one, then another. Dutch's love had 'added value' to the ordeal. They were more interesting, because they were stronger together. They would gain something from it, but that wasn't the reason it was worth it. It would strengthen the rule of law in the still sparsely settled land. It was Clete's turn again, and it was time. He waited for Dutch to begin the path. \"How much longer, Lane?\" \"Soon, Dutch. They don't want us to die of thirst. We're still strong enough to be interesting. Clete, come on. Come back to us. Dutch, do something.\" \"He's trying to shield us from his pain.\" \"I know what he's doing. It's just the wrong choice. Pull him back. Force him if necessary. Show him what I see. He must accept the bonding. Must let us help hold him above what he's going through. Do it, Dutch. Do it now. He'll die if he takes it alone. He'll take his and ours. Like he's always done. Stop him. This time stop him. This time you can.\" \"Lane... \" \"Dutch, this time you can. Now, stop him.\" Dutch fought Clete. Fought him with his love. Pulled him. Drove through the barriers he had built and wept for him. Tears he wouldn't shed for himself. He gathered them together and forced Clete to open himself. Forced him to accept their presence. To see why he must allow it. Forced him to accept their strength. He surrendered his pain. They had made the choice for him. \"They're bringing him back. They give us water. Not enough to rebuild ourselves, but enough to keep us alive. Dutch, prepare yourself for the blood. You felt the pain. You can't let the sight shock you. We'll lose him if you do.\" \"Can I be angry, Lane?\" \"Oh, yes. We can be very, very angry.\" Rage. Blinding, burning, rage. Fury like he'd known only once before. Lane and Dutch burned him clean with their anger. He struggled to lift his head and look at them. He smiled and slipped into unconsciousness. Lane sighed in relief. \"He's dying of thirst. We all are. If that's what you plan, tell us now. We'll be unconscious by nightfall.\" \"Give them water. I don't want them drying up and passing out. This one too. Give him some now and more later. I want all of them alive for awhile. We're not done with them. Bring that one downstairs. Make sure this one's secured.\" It was Lane's turn again. Dutch held his mind with his love and refused to let him count how many more times each of them would suffer, or the days until it would end. The very sick ones had learned they were \"something else.\" Lane said they would tell no one. They were interesting enough, they were given some food too. It gave them the energy to heal enough to live long enough. Lef set his glass down on the bar and leaned close to the bartender. The hair on his neck was standing up and he was sure he smelled something bad. \"They ain't. Ain't wanted by nobody. Did a stint as lawmen, I hear. He's lyin'. This smells bad.\" \"Lef, he said he was just gonna' keep 'em here til the judge passed through.\" \"When did he say it?\" \"Been 'bout eight days.\" \"Judge passed through more'n six days ago. Talked to him a spell. How I found out they been lawmen.\" \"They put on a good show, Lef. They got a bundle a' money in the hotel safe.\" \"I want ever' man believes in findin' out the truth a' this in here tonight. Keep it low. We don' want them special hired guns to hear. Get the miners. We got to know. This ain't right. The judge didn' get no wire to come up here. How long ago he take 'em?\" \"'Bout ten-eleven days.\" \"The day he sent me out. I's 'sposed to be gone four more. Too long. Longer'n ever 'fore. Smelled bad. Why I'm back. Damn. Hope they're alive.\" \"I'll send the girls out. They like them boys.\" \"I jes' hope we ain't too late.\" Lef learned how the Gallant boys had been taken and told the men they were fools. They started getting mad. Not at Lef, at the men who had made fools of them. They laid plans. They surrounded the house and took out the sentry. Lef looked in a window and ran. He knelt in the grass and was violently ill. He chose ten men and made them swear an oath of secrecy. All the others listened to the oath. The ten had guns. They would be the judges. They broke through doors and windows, saw and killed. They shot all but the boss. They hung him on his porch. Lane smiled when Lef released him. \"Hello, Lef. Take us to the mine entrance. I've got a miracle waiting there. Get the two men he was holding in the mine and bring them to us.\" Lef held Lane and cried. The men wrapped them in blankets and carried them to the mine. They found the locked door in the abandoned shaft and freed the two men. Lane whispered the location of the medunit to the professor and lost consciousness. Lane didn't know it was Tessa's father who healed them, or that Lef helped. The professor swore him to secrecy. One look at the medunit had told him they were from farther in the future than he was. Lef watched them healed and believed. He took seven men and destroyed the lab, then blew up the mine shaft. The professor watched in sorrow. His time craft was gone, and with it his dreams of saving his world. He was not sorry to see the bombs he had been forced to build buried under the mountain. When Lane regained consciousness, he told him his story. The camp broke up. Lef stayed until he knew they were all right, then said goodbye. He was going to the federal court to apply to become a judge. They'd accept him. He had letters from several men saying they were sure he'd be a good one. Dutch, Clete and Lane left soon after he did. They took the professor and Tessa's father with them. Their first stop was his farm. \"Let Tessa know you're all right.\" \"I thought he had her and all the time she was safe. I'm an old fool, Lane.\" \"No, just a loving father.\" \"Say hello to Bella for me. She's quite a woman.\" \"Do you mean my sister Bella?!\" \"That's the one.\" Clete grinned at the expression on his face. Dutch and Lane managed to keep from laughing, just. They drove out of the yard and stopped by the bank of a stream. Dutch climbed down and removed the keys from the harness. \"What do we do with the horses, Lane? If we set them free, they'll just be captured again.\" \"Clete, just how much did you tell Sare?\" \"Just what I told him to, Lane. Everything.\" \"That's where we take the horses. It's not far. Let's go. Professor, watch for berry bushes. We'll talk Sare out of one more meal. Wait'll you taste her pie.\" They had one more meal with Sare and Billy and left the horses in the barn. They carried their tack into Melissa and laughed at the professor's expression when he stepped into Lissa. He started toward the bridge and they redirected him. Clete held him up when he stepped into their living room. \"This is... is... \" \"Melissa, our ship. Make yourself comfortable while we stow this.\" \"Here, Dutch. I'll take yours too. You stick with him. Show him the kitchen and fix him a cup of tea. He needs it.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Come on, Professor. This way.\" \"This isn't possible!\" \"Neither are we. Well, Lane and Clete insist I am, but since my father doesn't exist in this universe, I have my doubts. Here. Sit down and drink this. I'll tell you why we're here. And why we're not sure why you are. Lane says we... interrupted the paradox, or shorted the loop.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"What you did here would have left your world a radioactive cinder in fifty years. Of course, you wouldn't have been born, so it wouldn't have happened. But then, you would have and it would, and round and round. We're new at this and still trying to figure that part out. Or we found it because we were supposed to change it. Dad says just fix and don't worry.\" \"Dutch, you're confusing him.\" \"I figured he might as well be as confused as we are, Lane.\" \"Help. I've set course for your world's future, Professor. I know you need to see it to truly believe it will change soon enough without changing the past. We're interested too. I know, but I want to see. We'll be landing soon.\" \"How soon, Lane? Does the professor have time for a tour?\" \"No, but we'll give him one anyway. Melissa loves to be shown off. Just the apartments though. We'll skip the ship proper. It would take years to explain finite infinity.\" \"Finite infinity is a self-contradictory statement.\" \"See what I mean? Come on. We'll start with the gym.\" They showed him Melissa, then his rich, green, and peaceful world. He promised to work to better his own time in his own time and they left him in his workshop mulling over the concept of finite infinity. They didn't return the rare element that made time travel possible. They 'forgot' to mention they had it. Dutch dropped onto a couch in the living room as Lane put them in flight. \"Lane, let's take a vacation.\" \"Exactly, Dutch. We're on our way, but I think you should know vacation runs right into work.\" \"Then we'd better start getting back in shape. The gym. Now.\" Dutch and Lane groaned, but followed Clete to the gym. They knew he was right. They had weight to regain and strength to rebuild. Vacations were more fun if they could show off.",

      "content": "Chapter Five A vacation on a lovely Fed planet was a nice surprise, but Clete knew Lane was right about it turning into work and they weren't in good condition yet. He glanced over at Dutch and grabbed a shirt. \"Dutch, you're turning pink. You didn't use screen again. Put this on.\" \"Uh, oh. Thanks, Clete. I didn't expect to be in the sun this much or I'd have remembered.\" \"Sure you would.\" \"Lane's over there someplace.\" \"Yeah, and very relaxed, near somnolent. At least he'll have screen with him. That shirt's too big. We're still underweight.\" \"Muscle mass takes time to rebuild.\" \"I know. I'm worried about how much time we'll have. There's something wrong here. A nervous undercurrent. Tense. That ought to wake Lane up. Thought so.\" \"What did you do?\" \"Decided we go on a full ten-day training schedule tomorrow.\" \"Oh, Clete! We're supposed to be on vacation!\" \"Lane said it was going to turn into work. It just did. Ten/five/ten run. Dawn tomorrow. Dutch, I really believe it's necessary. I doubt we'll get in the full ten days. Feel like doing a few katas?\" \"No, but I will. Odds on how long before Lane shows up?\" \"I can feel how close he is. Tai chi. Begin.\" \"You knew I was coming. You could have waited for me.\" \"Get in line, Lane. Too fast, Dutch. From the beginning.\" Clete moved them into the shade. They could cure sunburn, but avoiding it was always first choice. He seldom forgot sunscreen and Lane would be severely teased if he did, but Dutch never seemed to remember it. By the time they finished three hours of what should have been light exercise, they knew they were in worse condition than they'd realized. Clete designed a diet for them. They'd been starved. They had used some of their body mass to stay alive. Dutch added a bit to their schedule, a meditation routine. He wanted to see if they could increase their ability to distance their minds from their bodies. If they could, they would never go through the kind of pain they had suffered again. He nearly gave up the idea in panic when Lane went under and he spent an hour trying to bring him back, but both Lane and Clete believed they should go on. They trained their bodies and began to learn to control them to the deepest physiological function. An 'accident' taught them how well they'd learned. \"DUTCH! Lane! Come on! He's hurt!\" Lane followed Clete into the sea. Dutch was in real trouble. How had he missed it? Why hadn't he seen it? The sudden shift in current had pulled Dutch against the wreck he had been exploring. His snorkeling partner was struggling to free him from the entangling weeds. Riss was hanging on against the panic she felt as she swam in the cloud of blood at his side. She swam to the surface and took him a lung full of air. Then started working to free him again. Suddenly his brothers were there. She got him another lung full of air and he smiled and motioned her up. They brought him up and began floating him to shore. Clete felt her fear and pulled her in. \"He'll be all right, Riss. He's in a state of trance. It slows his metabolism and reduces the blood loss. You saved his life. You did well.\" \"Oh, Clete, it came so sudden. It pushed him into the wreck and tangled him in weeds. I didn't have anything to cut him loose with and there was so much blood and I just--\" \"Easy, easy. It looked like a lot of blood because it dispersed so fast. He's not hurt as bad as you think he is.\" \"Clete, I know how bad it is. It was the first thing I checked.\" \"Riss... Oh, damn. We're not human, or not completely anyway. We're half something else.\" \"I know. He has two hearts. I like the double beat.\" \"Well, we've been learning to control our bodies. Dutch is the best. He's healing already. Go look.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"Clete, what did you tell her? Damn! Clete, she's right. It's not possible. The wound's closing. Healing as I watch it. In... twenty minutes it'll be gone.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"Come on. Let's get him above the tide line.\" \"Hello. Thanks, Riss. You saved... Why are you all staring at me?\" \"We're going to move you into the shade, Dutch. Go back into trance and finish healing yourself.\" \"What are you talking about, Clete?\" \"Just go back under. We'll talk about it when you wake up. Lane, I'm going to buy Riss and I a drink. We'll be back. Come on, Riss. You look like you need one as bad as I do. Hot cocoa with something minty.\" \"I'm with you.\" Lane watched them walk off and smiled. Clete didn't need a drink, but he must have thought Riss did, or at least that she needed the walk and something warm. Somehow Dutch had learned to put himself in a healing trance. The injury wasn't really bad, not much more than a nasty gash. The entangling weeds, blood loss and shock had been the real danger. He worked to get rid of the guilt he had missed the incident in his memory and put it in perspective. They had learned something invaluable from it and that was what was most important. Dutch came out of his trance after a very few minutes, looked at his side, grinned at Lane and went to sleep. Lane noted the sleep. It told him the healing trance required an energy expenditure. Normal trance conserved energy and revitalized. He had timed the trance. He would time the sleep. If it was about equal, they could assume at least Dutch had inherited another of their father's physical attributes. He thought about missing the memory of the incident and wondered if he hadn't been intended to. The fact he hadn't become dizzy... Clete looked slightly disgusted when they came back. He hadn't been extremely successful getting rid of the guilt. \"How is he?\" \"Asleep, Clete. Just grinned at me and went to sleep.\" \"Oh, I see.\" \"Well I don't.\" \"Riss, I can't explain it, but what he did made him tired.\" \"What are you besides human? Your blood's red. You look like us. That's not extremely unusual, but this is.\" \"Our father is... Well, he's from an older species, more physically advanced. He thinks most of his people are boring. Spends most of his time with humans. Prefers their company. Spent several years with Clete's mom.\" \"Lane, are you telling me you had a different mother than Clete?\" \"Oh, I'd say she was different. Wouldn't you, Clete?\" \"Very.\" \"The longer I'm around you guys, the more confused I get.\" Dutch lifted himself to his elbows and smiled. \"That's why you're with me. I'm a much simpler person.\" He looked from his two brothers to the pert little brunette he really liked and wondered why they were all laughing. They continued with the meditation routine and began to notice it was having more effects on them than expected. Lane answered the question in Dutch's eyes when he sat down across the counter from him in the kitchen. \"We're changing. Our temperatures are lower. Our resting pulse rates are slower. Our entire metabolisms have slowed.\" \"I get cold easily, Lane. I had to come back to Melissa for a sweater last night.\" \"You can speed up your metabolism to compensate, Dutch, probably to a much higher rate. With sufficient fuel, you'd probably barely notice sub-zero.\" \"I'm not sure I like it.\" \"Remember how easily Dad got chilled? We'd be broiling and he'd be wearing a jacket. Well, that's about where we are. Not quite that extreme, but moving that direction.\" \"I don't understand about you, Lane. We're half human. You're not. Why are you... Why weren't you like this before?\" \"You, Dutch.\" \"Duh.\" \"I spent my entire childhood waiting for you. Wanting to be with you. Wanting to be... more than just your half-brother.\" \"I never think of you that way. I never have.\" \"I know. Just goes to show how tight the bond of our father's heritage is. You didn't think of us as half-brothers from the moment you met Dad.\" \"Maybe more than even just brothers, the triplets everyone thought we were.\" \"Aren't we? Aren't we one who became three?\" \"Or are we three becoming one?\" \"Does it matter? Would you change it?\" \"What a silly question. And I can't say I mind becoming more like Dad either. In fact, I've decided I'm going to be rather smug about it.\" \"You look even more like him than we do, Goldilocks. Let's find Clete. I've remembered something.\" They found Clete, relieved him of his barbell, and pushed him toward the spa. He had regained nearly all the mass he'd lost and he pulled both of them in with him. He was pleased with the success of the training program and their timing was, if anything, better. They laughed and played a bit, then settled into quiet relaxation. Lane began to tell them of the images and the change that was needed. \"The current that caught Dutch is a fairly common occurrence. Ten years ago it was an occasional one; twenty, nonexistent. The entangling weeds weren't a result of the current. They caused it.\" \"I felt it! I didn't recognize it, but when I was trying to free him, I was feeling an... anger that wasn't my own. It wasn't focused. Just a formless anger.\" \"That's right, Clete, a formless anger. It's growing stronger.\" \"Lane, there's… evil here. Deep and ugly. A cold malevolence. A power of destruction. Strongest near the sea. I want to do something about it.\" \"That's the decision that gave me memories, Dutch. We find an island. It's in the southern ocean. It's the source of the hate. We feel the malevolence. It's not natural to this world. The island is volcanic. It hasn't been active for thousands of years. That changes abruptly.\" \"And?\" \"That's it, Dutch.\" \"All right, we know what you mean. How do we get to the island?\" \"By boat.\" \"I want to take Melissa.\" \"Changing. No good.\" \"I think we should start at the beginning. Twenty years ago.\" \"Good idea, Clete. Well, Lane?\" \"Changing. No. Same result.\" \"That's it then. We don't go to the island.\" \"What?\" \"The island's a trap. We refuse to spring it. We battle from here. We mock it in our thoughts and-- Well, we know it changes things. Let's get him out of the water.\" \"Dutch it's not the same! He's not unfocused! He's not there!\" Dutch grabbed Clete's mind with his and began the search for Lane. He poured his love and Clete's, their desperate need to find the one who was more than brother, into it. He felt an echo and found another who searched. He felt strength pour into his call. He smiled as he recognized the mind that searched with them. Another joined, gathered into the search by love and need. They found him and battle was joined. Power fought power. Love and life battled hate and death. Fought for Lane, for his spirit. They were losing until a will refused to lose. Refused to be defeated. Refused to allow it. Dutch found his own 'stubborn streak'. He would not allow it! He would not let Lane be taken from him! Clete added his passion. The fire of his spirit. The driving need for Lane in his life. His rage at his being taken. It burned through the channel the searching minds had created and became relentless. That which had taken Lane began to fear. Love, will and rage were forged into a weapon guided by Dutch's hand. A burning sword of power. Suddenly, Lane was with them, fighting with them to free himself. That which had held him fled into the darkness, mocked by their love and joy. The strange union began to dissolve. The dissolution was gently tinged with sadness. Two had touched one they had thought to touch no more. Clete wept for the poignancy of their partings. Dutch gathered his brothers and returned them to themselves. Lane softly whispered, \"Mother,\" in their minds. \"I'd say that changed things.\" \"Clete, you have an absolute gift for understatement. Lane, are you all right?\" \"I... Yes. No. I'm not sure. I feel... unreal.\" \"No.\" Clete reached out and pulled Lane to him. Wrapped him in his arms and held him. Dutch was a bit surprised, but trusted Clete's instincts. He joined in the embrace and they held him between them. Lane began to laugh. \"I know I'm real now. I'm being squished.\" Clete and Dutch joined in his laughter, but they didn't let him go, not for quite some time. They needed to feel he was real as much as he did. He didn't know something was odd until the next morning. After two days, he knew he had to share his worry. \"Dutch, the images are gone.\" \"Which images?\" \"My memories of the future. They're gone. That's why I felt unreal. I catch glimpses of near events. I know Clete is about to walk through that door, but nothing else.\" \"Sit down, Clete. Explain.\" \"I can't. When we decided to take on a task, I'd see an abrupt end if something happened to us. As soon as we found a solution, the future became myriad possibilities. The possibilities increased with every change we made. I started with one for my life. It became several when Dad didn't send me away. They became many. The many became myriad. Now they're gone. I'm useless to us.\" \"That's ridiculous! Don't ever say it again!\" \"I'm sorry, Clete. It's how I feel.\" \"I think it's ridiculous too, Lane. You knew Clete was coming in.\" \"Like I said. Near. Nothing that leads beyond the next moment. No memories beyond.\" \"Limbo. We all are.\" \"Your turn, Clete. Explain.\" \"We haven't made any plans. We haven't made any decisions. We haven't made any choices. Too delighted to have Lane with us to think beyond the moment. You're the key, Dutch. Have you made any decisions?\" \"No. You're right. I've just been existing. Something took Lane right out of Melissa. It shouldn't have been able to do that. I haven't wanted to make any decisions. It happened when I made a change.\" \"You're afraid. You don't want him to have memories. You don't want the power to put him into... well, under the influence of his changing memories. You're afraid it'll happen again. Dutch, you can't hold your breath forever. Choice is a function of who you are, of what we are together. If you refuse to make choices, you cripple yourself and suspend him in limbo.\" \"I need time.\" \"No, you need to pull yourself together now. We don't have to ride out to battle, but you must choose to do something. Even doing nothing is a choice. It just leads to nothing. If we do nothing, the enemy has won. Entropy defeats us.\" \"I don't know what to choose.\" \"Choose to face your fear. It isn't of dying. It's of losing us. What we have. What we are. Choose!\" \"I... choose to strengthen us. To learn more about us. To make what happened impossible.\" \"Yes. Yes! It's not the same, but it's there. A future. Not far. No splitting. To the point of another time of choice. Thank you.\" \"What's the first step, Dutch?\" \"We've learned to use your passion and my will. Lane is our weak link. We have to learn to use his intellect. Blend your passion and my will to the use of his reason. Bring him fully in. I think the key is his insatiable curiosity.\" \"I'm lost. I don't think I'm that curious.\" Dutch smiled and Clete burst into laughter. He really was \"lost.\" He just didn't see it. \"Lane, you're so curious, you've found a way to see the future.\" \"I was born with that, Clete. It's just there.\" \"Clete was always passionate. Probably gave hugs that bruised when he was two. I'm so stubborn, my mother said I reminded her of her Dutch grandfather. He refused to give up and spent five years in a crippled spaceship living on food concentrate and recycled water and air. He'd plotted his course and knew eventually he'd tumble through a space lane. He thought it would take twelve. Dutch isn't from Duchelle. It's for him. I had it by the time I was a year old.\" \"But my sisters see the future too.\" \"One future. Unchanging. You say they're quite happy that way. Would you be?\" \"I can answer that. You wouldn't. You get excited every time you anticipate a change, Lane. You can't wait to find out what happens. Like a kid at Christmas. Near breathless with anticipation.\" \"Am I really?\" \"Yes. You're surprised. You've always thought of yourself as rather cool and reserved. Almost envied Dutch and I our... drive. That's the best word I can come up with. Lane, you're about as cool as a stable star. Your reserve is stability. Nothing else. You can't resist a puzzle or a mystery. And... behind it all you may be a freer, wilder, spirit than either of us. You have no reserve when it comes to learning the truth of things. I agree with you, Dutch, insatiable curiosity.\" \"That's our key. Now all we have to do is figure out what to use it on. The lock it fits. I think we... Let's start with meditation and Melissa. She's a mystery. So are we.\" \"You just got him excited, Dutch.\" \"Good. We're on our way.\" Five days later, they were ready to begin working on the 'anger' again. They had already won the real battle. They knew it. \"Can you feel the difference, Clete?\" \"Yes, it's weaker. Still malevolent. Still angry. But weaker. Why, Dutch?\" \"Well, Lane? A mystery?\" \"Not really. Analogy: There used to be receivers that could run on either of two sources of power, current running along wires and directed to outlets, or storage batteries installed in the unit and replaced when exhausted. We unplugged it from the wall. Eventually, it would run down.\" \"How eventually?\" \"A very long time, Dutch. A lot of wrecks, drownings and fear long time.\" \"So we still need to take it out.\" \"Yes. It doesn't belong here.\" \"I pity it.\" \"Explain that statement, Clete.\" \"It doesn't belong anywhere, Dutch. It's not needed, not wanted and it has no home. I'll destroy it, but I'll pity it.\" \"Your pity and compassion are the greatest weapons in our arsenal, Clete. It has neither. We have an island to find. In Lissa. Melissa stays here. You know, she's not happy with her current shape. We should move her.\" \"Suggestions, Lane.\" \"Put her where she can be either of the two shapes she likes, Dutch. The spaceport or the carnival.\" \"Let's take her to the carnival.\" \"Whoa! Changes! Oh my. That was a good choice. We really are going to have fun when we get back. If we get back.\" \"You know, Clete, it doesn't even bother me any more when he says that.\" \"Says what, Dutch?\" \"If.\" Lane coaxed Melissa into being Lissa at the spaceport to drop her, then let her be her favorite shape at the carnival. They hung a closed sign on her and ran the fifteen K back to the spaceport, Clete's idea. The port manager muttered about idiot computers that lost landing records when the ship on pad three asked for clearance for liftoff. They flew to the island and landed. The volcano began to smoke. \"Is it in the volcano, Lane?\" \"No, not really. We climb it to see and it erupts.\" \"I don't like that. An eruption would cause tremendous damage along the shoreline for thousands of kilometers.\" \"Not to mention giving us very hot feet.\" Clete grinned when Dutch sat on the ground and laughed. \"Oh, it didn't like that. You decided not to climb it and laughed at it.\" \"Change. The gun! You're going to use Lissa's gun to vent the volcano!\" \"Yes, Lane. What does that do?\" \"Makes it decide to hurry. Back to the ship. NOW! Run, Dutch! RUN!\" Dutch put on a burst of speed and dove through the hatch. He was in the gun turret by the time Lane and Clete got to the ship. He chose his point and fired through the volcano. He tracked the beam down, cutting through the side and deep into the island base. He kept tracking down as Lane lifted off. The sea began to boil as molten magma poured from the rent in the volcanic shaft. Dutch laughed. It would be very angry now. \"That's cruel, Dutch. You're laughing because it's helpless against us.\" \"Yes, I am. Help me out of here. Give me your hand. If I unstrap, I'm going to land on my head. Ah. Better. I wondered when Lane was going to turn the ship back over.\" \"Just in time to nearly land me on my head. He's been pretty busy. A lot of people wanted to know exactly what we thought we were doing.\" \"Ooh, I'll bet he's been busy. Our nasty thing is very close, Clete.\" \"Yes. Let's get us all together. I think it's going to mount a personal attack.\" \"Lane!\" Clete followed Dutch the few meters to the bridge. Lane looked up and smiled. He reached out a hand and Dutch took it, then held out his other hand to Clete. They joined minds and waited. When the attack came, it was furious. And futile. Dutch exulted, then realized Clete's overwhelming feeling of pity was their true weapon. He willed the malevolent force to feel it. To know it. To see Clete's sadness for the pitiful thing that could know only hate. His compassion for something his love would destroy. It screamed into nonexistence and Clete wept for it. They requested landing clearance and set down on pad three. There was quite a reception committee waiting for them. Dutch apologized for firing a weapon in the planetary atmosphere, but explained all he could think about at the time was the loss of life and property an eruption would have caused. Then he had to apologize for landing on the island in the first place. He was getting rather aggravated with the whole affair when the media people burst into the room. They were suddenly heroes. The people who had been ranting at him were touting his quick thinking, posing with the three of them for the vid. Dutch looked at Lane and he winked. Dutch grinned. He now knew who had commed the media. Clete was grinning too. Lane didn't feel smug very often. Dutch and Lane groaned when he ran them back to the carnival. The port manager looked out and swore. Pad three was empty again. And no one could find the liftoff records. Two technicians spent some time looking for the glitch in the computer. Melissa chose a slightly different spot on the midway and they took down the closed sign. The first customer was a lovely girl. Dutch had no problem devining her immediate future. It started with dinner, then a show, then... Clete and Lane laughed. Dutch would never change. Lane watched the future take shape and hunted for a change. When he couldn't find one, he headed for the beach and Dutch quickly. They didn't have much time. \"Dutch, we need to talk.\" \"About?\" \"Clete. We need to do it fast. I'm worried and he'll be here soon.\" \"Start talking.\" \"He's going to fall in love. Helplessly in love.\" \"Lane, that's not a problem. It won't change things between us.\" \"Dutch, she's going to die. He's going to want us to stop it. Want us to change it.\" \"Then we change it.\" \"We can't. Let me rephrase that. If we do, thousands die. She makes the choice to save them. I've been doing what-ifs for hours. I kept thinking I'd find something. Dutch, she's carrying his child when it happens.\" \"Damn. We have to tell him. He'd never completely trust us again if we don't.\" \"I know. I've thought about rushing us off the planet. Getting us out of here before he meets her.\" \"That's not right either.\" \"I know. Here he comes.\" \"What's wrong, Lane?\" \"Let's go to Melissa. I want our home around us. A fire. A cup of cocoa. Us.\" \"You're hurting. You're both hurting.\" \"Yes, Clete. Come on. Lane will explain. You have a choice, but we know how you'll make it.\" \"All right, Dutch. We run. I want the hurt lessened until we get home.\" They ran. It did keep the pain at a distance. They settled by the fire in their living room. Lane told Clete what he had seen. Clete's choice was love, even for a short time. They had known it would be. They wouldn't leave. He met her the next day, a Fleet officer on leave, beautiful, passionate and loving. Her name was Helen. Dutch and Lane put the pain into the future and reveled in Clete's happiness. \"Dutch, Helen and I are going to the beach. Do you want to come?\" \"No, Clete. Lane and I have plans too. Have fun.\" \"We always do.\" \"Yeah, I know. Do me a favor. Try to keep things from getting too warm. At least til evening. We're getting tired of looking for places to take a cold shower.\" \"I'll try. I want to bring her here, Dutch. I want her to know who I am. I want to bring her home.\" \"All right. Take her out of the hotel. She stays here with us. With you. It's where she belongs.\" \"Tonight?\" \"Tonight.\" Dutch went to see how Lane was. He'd made a choice. In a way it was a betrayal. A violation. \"Will he hate me?\" \"No. He's going to be pretty mixed up about it for awhile. Let's get to work. We have a great deal to get ready.\" \"And not much time.\" \"Stop. We promised him we wouldn't dwell on it, would keep our minds on other things. He deserves to be happy for the time they have. She's quite a woman, Dutch. She will do what needs to be done.\" Clete brought Helen home. She learned what the man she had fallen in love with was. It didn't really surprise her. She'd known there was a uniqueness about the brothers that went beyond being half human. She became part of the family, one who belonged in their lives, a part of all of them. \"Dutch, Clete asked me to marry him.\" \"I never doubted he would Helen. I'm very happy for you both.\" \"No you're not. Neither is Lane. Oh, I'm welcome and you even love me, but you're not happy. I want to know why.\" \"The choice wasn't mine to make after all.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Helen, I... We... Damn. Did you extend your leave? Did you tell them you were getting married? Who to?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did your captain say?\" \"He told me Commander Telas said Clete's father would be pleased.\" \"He's our godfather.\" \"Your godfather?!\" \"Yes, and the best there is.\" \"I don't doubt that. It's just a very antiquated concept. What does that have to do with why you're not happy?\" \"We... I'm sorry, Lane. I'm sending her to you. I can't.\" \"You can't what?\" \"Find Lane. Ask him. He lives with the future. I don't have to that often. Just... find him. You have choices to make. He's a very good guide.\" Lane smiled gently when Clete walked into his room. He'd tried to ignore it, but he was too honest with himself to do it any longer. \"You told her. Lane, you told her.\" \"She asked, Clete. Would you have had me lie to her? I couldn't have even if you'd asked it. I respect her too much. Has it changed things between you?\" \"Yes. How else would I have known?\" \"Do you love each other less?\" \"Of course not, Lane, but now there's a desperation, a poignancy, about it. No one should have to know when they're going to die.\" \"I agree, but many of us do. My mother wasn't the same situation, but she knew. I'll know. Perhaps everyone does. She could have chosen not to. I told her that. A dozen ways. Dutch has known we'd have to tell her from the beginning. Even before I did. But he couldn't actually do it. It hurt him too much.\" \"The night he got drunk.\" \"Yes, to deaden the pain, so you wouldn't be burdened with it. Now go get ready. All weddings are both joyful and sad. Yours will be no different. You just know the reasons.\" \"Lane, I don't know if I can get through it.\" \"Clete, when you see her coming down the aisle, red hair, green eyes, turned up nose and freckles, you'll be the happiest man in this universe. Probably more than this one. We're going to live an incredibly long time. Well, if we don't get ourselves killed. We'll have to face this again and again. Father chooses to love and accept the pain of parting. You've made the same choice.\" \"Yes, I guess I have. Get ready. You're giving away the bride.\" \"That didn't surprise the magistrate as much as your first suggestion.\" \"I know. He just couldn't handle the concept of two best men. What will he do when you join Dutch beside me instead of sitting down?\" \"Stumble a little, then go on. He's more adaptable than he thinks.\" The wedding was beautiful and joyous. Helen and Clete went back to Melissa and Dutch and Lane went out on the town, looking for company. Everyone seemed to be. It was a very warm autumn night in the city. Helen had twelve more days of leave. Four days after Helen went back, Lane ran for Dutch. He hadn't been able to keep his brothers from knowing it would be soon, but they really didn't want to know when. He really didn't want to know, but he did. \"Find him! Find him fast!\" \"He's over there. Not far. Come on!\" Sand. Dutch hated running in sand. It slowed him. Dragged him down. He wasn't going to be there. Wasn't going to be fast enough. Clete would feel him coming. Would know what was coming. Clete's scream of pain and loss cut through him. Drove him to his knees. Lane caught his arm and dragged him up. They ran on through the pain, and the anguish, and the dragging, treacherous, sand. They caught him and held him. Kept him with them. Held his mind, when he would have thrown it after her. Held his body, when he would have thrown it into the sea. Held his life between them, when he thought it had ended. Along the beach, people saw two holding one and weeping, and wept with them. The official notification was delivered, personally, by Telas two days later. Dutch led him to Clete's rooms, where he'd shared so much with his wife of such a short time. Lane was waiting for him when he walked out. \"I've given him her message. I don't know how to judge his reaction. I did as she asked. It seemed the choice should be hers. She believed she died for a good cause. I asked her to let me take the mission. She refused.\" \"We knew she would, Telas. So did Clete.\" \"The ship would have killed thousands, Lane. I still tried to change it. We were close, but there was too much orbital traffic to risk firing a weapon to attempt to destroy it. Helen loaded everyone aboard into survival pods, stunned five to do it. There wasn't a self-destruct. It was just an old mining ship being dismantled for salvage. She didn't learn why a station-keeping jet suddenly fired and aimed it right for the planet. She used the one that hadn't fired to guide it into the moon. It was barely in the realm of possible, a feat of piloting I might not have been able to duplicate. She may have been the only one who could have done it. And she may have known it. I'll miss her too. Dutch, how is he?\" \"He needed to be alone. Lane, will he be--\" \"Dutch, he'll laugh again and love again. This time will become one of his most wonderful memories. He knows it already. He just doesn't feel it yet. You two have given him a gift from her. Someday, he'll be ready to receive it. You, Dutch, gave her another choice. Telas, you gave her the means. Thank you, Godfather, for interceding with the captain on her behalf.\" \"He thanked me. He too will miss her. He too understood... she made the decision not to change it.\" \"I looked for a way we could change it, Telas.\" \"I was sure you had, Lane. Dutch, help him get rid of some of the guilt he couldn't find one. He'll help. He thinks Clete's got too much to carry now without that too. Don't you?\" \"Yes, Godfather.\" He left them to return to his ship. He would watch over the tiny thing that awaited, suspended in sickbay, the caring and love Clete would give when he was ready. Someday, he would claim Helen's gift. And delight in the little boy who called him \"Daddy.\" Dutch was worried about both his brothers. They were just wandering around. They'd visited a couple beautiful worlds, looked at the lovely and peaceful scenery a few hours and... wandered. The time had been important, but it had been long enough. \"Lane, we need to do something fun.\" \"We're on our way to the pleasure planet of Jesera.\" \"That wasn't exactly what I had in mind.\" \"Yes it is, Dutch. You want to show off, show up the bad guys, be a hero, and meet lots of lovely ladies. Not necessarily in that order.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind.\" \"I thought so. Something fun. This will be good for Clete too. That's your next question.\" \"Will it?\" \"See? Next question.\" Lane ducked the playful swipe. He was looking forward to seeing Dutch's face when they landed in the midst of an interstellar showcase of muscle, madness and beauty. The madness was the work. The muscle and beauty were the fun. The work would be fun too. Dutch really disliked bullies and drug dealers. \"Tell Clete we're on full training schedule. Starting in ten minutes. Meet you in the gym.\" Dutch laughed and went to find Clete. It was time for him to rejoin the team. Time he learned he could still laugh. Time he remembered why he was alive. He was still laughing when he got to the gym. The incredulous look on Clete's face had been wonderful. No one but he had ever called a training schedule before. Lane put them through their paces. He told Clete to pay attention and shape up. Within a few hours, Clete had retaken his place as training director. He hadn't even realized he'd done it, just started following the schedule Lane had made and gradually slipped into it. They had been a very long way from where they were going. In twenty days, they had honed their bodies and their skills to perfection. When they landed, they were ready. Lane entered them in every event but the beauty contest and he signed them up as escorts for that. He carried their very busy schedule back to the hotel room Melissa had landed in and handed copies to Clete and Dutch. \"Lane, this isn't fair. We're faster and stronger than full humans.\" \"Clete, we aren't competing against humans in most events. The top weightlifter in your class is a targ. Dutch's main competition in the track events is a corduni. We're even going to lose a few contests.\" \"Hey! I just found my favorite event!\" Clete and Lane turned to Dutch and chorused, \"Beauty pageant escort.\" Then Lane told them why they were there. They swept through the events. They were listed as 'The Gallants, anthropoid mix' on the official charts. The only problems arose when Clete was entered in bodybuilding, weightlifting and wrestling events. There were some very warm audiences. They solved the problem by dousing him with cold water whenever they started to get warm. He spent a great deal of time wet. Lane was right. They did take second in a few events, never third. They also ended in a few ties. They laughed when they tied for first place as best all-around athlete. It was the only competition all three were in as individuals. They took every event they entered as a team. They built a showpiece out of martial arts routine six and sharp shooting routine three and presented it the night of the award presentations. The stunned silence of the stadium audience lasted nearly two minutes before the night was split with a roar of approbation. By the time they showed up for beauty pageant duty, females of every species were begging the stage manager/producer for one of them as escort. Dutch had an idea, of course. \"We'll escort them all on. Then you assign someone else for the rest of the duties. We'll bring them on two at a time so the schedule doesn't get off.\" \"I can't do that.\" \"Why not? Dutch has given you a solution that keeps you out of hot water.\" Lane smiled at the thoughtful look on the man's face. They all liked him and it was going to be very pleasant to help him out. \"Would you rather assign us one each and then try to walk past the other twenty-seven finalists? We'll even provide our own costumes, something that will contrast well with the dark formal attire of the other thirty escorts. You do have three alternates listed.\" \"Hmm, it would be unusual. You boys are an attraction. Wouldn't take long to spread the word. Would probably attract more women. Might even boost ticket sales.\" \"Yes, and no one would be late getting lined up to go on either.\" \"How would you boys like to travel with the show?\" \"We thought you'd never ask.\" They dressed in the full formal tradition of Earth's twentieth century, white tails and diamond studs with blue satin tie and cummerbund. They finished it with white capes lined in blue satin. They all loved the style and had since Alice had shown them an image of Gallant in it when he had been very young. The memory of hearing him nervously asking her how he looked, and the three of them giggling too hard to explain why, when he asked what was going on, brought smiles, as they got ready. Dutch and Clete thought they were done, then Lane handed each a white top hat, a silver-headed walking stick, a deep red rose and a diamond ear clip. Clete looked at the ear clip in his hand and grinned. He brushed his hair back and put it and the top hat on. He pinned on the rose, spun his walking stick and strolled out the door. Dutch and Lane laughed. The Gallant boys were going on the town and expecting trouble to find them. The producer stared at them in amazement. \"You didn't tell me you were going to dress like that!\" \"Is there something wrong with it, Frake?\" \"No, Dutch. I just didn't know anyone could actually wear something like that and, well, get away with it. You're going to outclass the contestants.\" \"Never. They're the gems. We're merely the sets to show them off. Trust us. Our dad taught us well. None of them has ever been more beautiful than they will be tonight. Show us the routine.\" Clete expressed their opinion of the 'usual' show for the pageant. He could feel it was unanimous. \"Dull.\" \"What?\" \"Clete said it was dull. He's right. It's a presentation, not a roll call. You just leave it to us.\" \"Dutch... \" Frake watched from backstage and was astounded. The beauties floated on the arms of the brothers, even the non-anthropoids. The three just knew how to walk with them so the grace of their species was seen. He'd surprised himself when he asked them to join the show, but he was getting sure it was one of the best decisions he'd ever made, real fast. When all thirty finalists were on-stage, the brothers slid from three directions to front center on their knees, threw their arms out to the audience, then turned and threw them out to the contestants. Who had taught them all to drop deep curtsies in unison? And how had they figured out a way for a coni'ith to do it? The house exploded in applause. Frake sighed contentedly. The pageant was a success and it hadn't even gotten past the introductions. Frake watched in awe. They were everywhere. A music board bench repaired, a harp restrung, a riser rebuilt, a nervous hand held, a spotlight replaced, a lightboard rewired, a pushy mother charmed, a coughing judge given water... Everywhere. They took over the final presentation too. They carried flowers, sash and cape and followed the previous year's winner on-stage. Clete smoothly stepped in to assist the tiny othvin to crown her human successor, reshaping the crown she'd worn on her crest to fit in the process. He draped the sash and stepped back. Lane smoothly fastened the cape and Dutch laid the flowers across her arm. They stepped into line, rolled their hats down their arms and bowed her onto the runway. The crowd went wild. Frake went back to divide up the receipts and sighed. They'd demanded sixty percent this time. Perhaps the house had been large enough he would be able to pay for some work on the ship, but he doubted it. He said \"Come in,\" before he thought about it when Dutch knocked. \"What are you doing?\" \"Counting our receipts and paying our bills, Dutch, the last chore before we move on.\" \"That's a very large bill you have laid out, Frake. Are you paying off some real estate? Say, maybe a planet?\" \"It's just one of the bills. Keeps the show on.\" \"Protection. A piece of the gross. A large piece. Getting larger all the time. You pay it, they don't hurt anyone. Stop paying it.\" \"You... guessed it. I can't stop. They showed me I can't. Grabbed two of the girls and addicted them to a drug. Called the police and told them I did it. The police didn't really believe it, but it ruined those poor kid's lives and they asked me not to come back.\" \"Stop paying. We'll take care of them.\" \"Dutch, I can't. They just upped it to sixty percent and I've got no choice. I can't even just shut down the show.\" \"I understand you felt like you didn't have a choice before, but you do now. We're taking the ladies out tonight. They'll be safe.\" \"All of them?!\" \"No, six are engaged or married, just the other twenty-four. Oh! Twenty-five. Last year's winner is coming too. Give me half the protection money. Tell them your new partners have it. Clete's in the mood to show off. So am I. Lane likes an audience of ladies too.\" \"Dutch, you don't know these people.\" \"Tell them we moved in on you, said we were taking half their cut. Be real scared. Tell them who we are. I'm about to give you a black eye. It'll keep you from getting really hurt. We'll fix it when we get back. Won't be late. Most of the girls have a curfew.\" \"OW!\" \"Sorry. There. That's half. Now get the rest of the money put away fast. Don't worry about paying us. Clete needs exercise and gym time costs. Besides, we have trouble finding sparring partners for him.\" Frake did exactly what Dutch told him. He didn't have any trouble acting scared. His black eye was very convincing. He was surprised when the two men took the thirty percent and didn't give him another one. They were mad someone was trying to 'muscle in' on their territory. Frake put an ice pack on his eye. He suddenly smiled. He wondered if the protection collectors had any idea what they were up against. They used some of the money to take the ladies out. They took them several places. Half of every crowd knew who they were. The other half knew who the ladies were. About midway through the evening, eight unpleasant men accosted them on the street. They helped the ladies step over them and continued their evening. They saw each and every lady safely home. Dutch borrowed Clete's medunit and went back to cure Frake's eye. \"Here. We used some to show the ladies a good time. Sorry. We looked over the ship. It needs work. Order these parts. We'll start on it tomorrow. Oh, we need you to pay our hotel bill. We also have one piece of equipment we'll be putting on the ship. We'll keep it in our cabin. We're sentimental about it.\" \"Didn't they find you, Dutch?\" \"Who? Oh, them. Yes. We didn't stay with them long. We were afraid we'd be fined for leaving eight large pieces of trash on the sidewalk. There. That should feel much better.\" Frake started to laugh. They were sorry they had used some of the money, were going to fix the ship, didn't need to be paid, and would he take care of their hotel bill. And they'd left 'trash' on the sidewalk. Just a little. Eight pieces. To top it all off they were incredible showmen. Somebody out there liked him. \"Dutch, you boys are amazing.\" \"True. Oh! Almost forgot. We'll be just a little late tomorrow. We're keeping watch on the ladies' hotels tonight and putting them all on their flights home. Won't be at the spaceport until just before noon. Try to get those parts delivered by then. Goodnight.\" Dutch hurried. Lane had said the first attack would come just about an hour after midnight. They probably wouldn't need him, but he hated to miss the fun. He dashed into the hotel and found them. Just in time. \"Four. Armed. Freight lift. I'll go.\" \"Clete, you can't have all the fun.\" \"There are only four, Dutch, and the lift is small.\" \"All right. Enjoy yourself. What's next, Lane?\" \"Three on the stairs. If we want to do anything, we'd better get there before Clete gets done on the lift.\" \"Let's go! He's probably finished.\" \"No. He'll be polite and put them in the trash bin out back.\" \"Good thinking. We'll do the same. Got to keep the hotel tidy. Oh goody. A banister. Let's slide down.\" \"Sounds like fun. About three flights.\" \"Wheeee! Oops. Hope I didn't break him.\" \"My goodness, Dutch. You have the trash all piled by the back door to go out.\" \"Sorry I forgot to leave you some. Help me carry it out anyway?\" \"Certainly. Hi, Clete. Next stop Hotel Caprice. Good, you got their injector. Here's ours. Clete, that isn't nice. You broke them. Oh, well. They didn't really need them.\" The hotel Caprice was a bit busier and the Ranforth more so. They gathered all the ladies for breakfast and walked them to the spaceport. They saw them off and moved Melissa to the show's ship. The parts were just arriving when they walked out of it. \"Good morning, Frake.\" \"I didn't see you boys get here!\" \"We slipped in quietly. Lane and Clete didn't want to be seen this late still in evening wear. Clete, life support; Lane, computers. I'll take the drive. We'll spread the rest around. Frake, have something ready for lunch in about two hours. We had a late breakfast, but I'm going to be hungry. Get clearance for liftoff in... six hours ought to do it. Ship needs a paint job. We'll get one next stop.\" \"Dutch, the repair estimate was forty hours and eight men.\" \"That sounds about right. Liftoff in six.\" Frake watched them for awhile, then fixed them lunch and scheduled liftoff. They'd be done in six hours. \"Where did you boys learn all this stuff, Dutch?\" \"Let's see. Some from our moms, some from our dad, some from our godfather, some at the academy.\" \"Academy?\" \"Would you believe Dutch was a lieutenant?\" \"So were you, Clete.\" \"Yeah, but I didn't figure he'd have any trouble believing Lane and I were, just you.\" \"You were ALL FLEET OFFICERS?!\" \"Easy, Frake. Small room. Hard on the ears. Yeah. Enjoyed it for awhile. Lane decided we should retire early. He missed us.\" \"True, Dutch, I did. I also decided it was time to move you around a bit. You kept running out of women and places to take them.\" \"That and they kept trying to get him to choose between them.\" \"I never did understand that. I gave all of them plenty of attention. Back to work. The drive was in bad shape. Let's see... cargo lifts. Later.\" \"He can't have the drive work done already!\" \"Sure he can, Frake. He kisses the power generators, tells them they're beautiful and they fix themselves up to please him. Lane, you get the dirty job. I'm too big for half the access shafts.\" \"An excuse, Clete, but one I'll accept. Besides, I just got the computers working properly. I'd rather not have you shoulder through a junction and fry them. Cable check it is. I suppose you're going to fix the galley.\" \"It needs it. I'll take care of surface plumbing too. Dutch can get the stuff behind the panels when he gets done with the lifts. He's already dirty from cleaning the exhaust tubes.\" \"Sounds good. I'll pick up command and nav. Later.\" \"Frake, you'll have to move. I'm about to take this place apart and put it back together. You can come back and make tea for us in a couple hours.\" \"Uh... sure, Clete. I think I'll just go to my cabin and sleep. I'm already dreaming.\" \"Frake, if you think we're fast, you should have seen my commander. He once told me Dutch's mom was faster.\" \"You don't have the same mother?\" \"Nope. All different, but they all had the same... first... name. Got it. Frake, I'm about to remove the deckplate you're standing on. Go.\" \"Uh... later.\" There was only one job left to do by the time they had tea, get everything and everyone else aboard. Frake just stood and watched while they took care of that too. Cargo was stowed, cabins assigned, rehearsal schedules handed out. People walked through the corridors with their mouths open. Even the bed in cabin eight had been fixed. He wasn't at all surprised when they took over the bridge and smoothly lifted off. \"Party time! Let's get acquainted. Cargo hold, I think. I'll get everyone.\" \"All right, Dutch. Clete and I will be there as soon as we get comm and nav clear and get her on auto.\" \"The autopilot doesn't work, Lane. Hasn't since before I bought it. Can't be fixed.\" \"That's why I built a new one, Frake. On course. Auto in. See you in the hold, Clete.\" \"Private ship Merriment out. Wait up. I'll go with you. Coming, Frake?\" \"Uh, you go ahead. I'll be there.\" He sat and stared around him at the smoothly-running ship and started to laugh. He wouldn't be paying any more 'protection' money. He had all the protection he needed. Somebody out there liked him. They'd sent him three guardian angels. He didn't know they were looking for a devil in the cargo hold. They returned to their cabin to talk about what they'd found. All of them were angry, but Dutch was furious. \"Traces everywhere. Everywhere but the bridge and Frake's cabin. Not enough to bully him into paying them off, they use him to smuggle drugs too.\" \"I picked up mean and nervous from a couple stagehands, Dutch. Big one with the bald spot and the little one with, well, shifty eyes. One of the women too. The pretty blond.\" \"Damn. Prettiest thing on the ship and she's dirty. Thanks for the warning, Clete. Anything, Lane?\" \"Clete's picked them. Let's see. Access panel nearest the hold. In the music board. The big costume box. Under the bed I'm laying on. We take it to Frake. He gets real sick. He hates drugs. Wants to space whoever brought them on board. We space the drugs. The blonde's got an injector, Dutch. I can't see any way out of it. She's going to hit you with it. Nasty stuff. Addictive.\" \"Easy, Dutch! Easy! It's not bliss! Lane, help! He wants to kill her. Kill all of them.\" \"Dutch, you trance through it! No effect! None! I promise! She's after someone else. You block. She's after the little brunette with the overbite and freckles. A couple others too. You'll stop her.\" \"Better. Still mad, but not killing mad.\" \"Let's collect drugs. I want them off this ship. I want it now. My skin crawls. Get off that bunk, Lane.\" \"No. We have to wait, Dutch. Just a few hours. Go home. In Melissa. Get away from it. Clete, dump him in the spa.\" \"Right, Lane. In he goes.\" \"Put me down, Clete! OW! Duck a little lower ne--\" Lane smiled as Melissa's door cut off Dutch's voice. Helping nice people get rid of a nasty problem was good for all of them. It was especially good for Clete. Helen had become his most beautiful memory, not an open wound. Clete was going to have trouble keeping Dutch from killing. The shifty fellow had an injector too. Lane knew he was his target. Dutch would teach him how to heal himself. Before the night was over, he and Clete would both learn. He drifted off to sleep. It would be how the shifty man would find him. Clete roared in fury and Dutch screamed his as they raced out of Melissa. Lane stopped them from going after the person, who had just cleared the cabin, with a lift of his hand. It was about all he could do, but he managed it. He had to slow Dutch, turn his anger a bit, focus it on himself to prevent a possible future. Clete would feel the need and help. Dutch's biting words told him he'd succeeded avoiding the first path to catastrophe. \"He knew this was coming, Clete. You know he did. I'm going to kill whoever did this.\" \"Dutch. Dutch! DAMMIT! LISTEN TO ME! He didn't tell you because he knew this is what you'd do, fly apart. You're no good to him or anybody else this way. Pull yourself together. This is the reason we go hunting drugs. He told us where. We take him with us. All the way through.\" \"Yeah, with... no... no...killing. Clete, stop him. Shifty man. Stop him. Bad choice. Bad choice.\" \"Dutch! It's what he doesn't want you to do! There's a reason! He let them hit him for a reason. Dutch?\" \"You're probably going to have to remind me several more times. Let's get him up. We're going drug hunting. This… stuff is fast. Let's get him moving. It should help.\" They collected the drugs. They ran into the shifty man coming out of the hold. Clete grabbed Dutch and yelled. \"STAND STILL! Stand very, very still. If you even breathe hard, I won't be able to keep him from killing you. Drop the weapon. Just let it fall. DO AS I TELL YOU! He can move before the beam hits him. Drop it. DAMMIT! I'm trying to save your life! Good. Now the injector. Dutch. Dutch, he's unarmed. Let him go back in the hold. Back up slowly. Very slowly. He's the fastest man alive. You can't get away from him. He'd really like you to try. You're terrified. That's good. You should be. I would be if he wanted to kill me. Dutch, find the drugs. Come on, Dutch. The drugs are more important. He won't move.\" \"I want him to move. Just move. I want to kill him. I want him to move.\" \"He's not going to. Leave him and find the drugs.\" \"Find the drugs, Dutch. We'll trance. Together. Find them. Don't kill. Bad choice.\" \"Lane, I want... All right. If he stands still, I might not kill him. But I want him to move.\" The shifty man stood very still. He had looked death in the face and it was waiting for him to move. He collapsed on the floor and sobbed his relief when they left and locked him in the hold. They took Lane and the drugs to Frake. He became violently ill. Clete shook his head. If anything, Frake hated drugs more than Dutch did. It was why the threat of their use had been such an effective method of coercion. Dutch went hunting the blond. Clete left Lane with Frake and spaced the drugs. He had to find Dutch before he killed her. He almost didn't make it. \"NO, DUTCH! If you hit her, you'll kill her! You haven't got the control to avoid it. You. Merith. Lock her in the cargo hold. It's the only place she'll be safe. She's drugged him and I might be able to stop him. Come back here. I'll try to keep him here til you get back. If you don't get back soon, he'll come hunting. The drug won't stop him. It just makes it easier for him to kill. Easy, Dutch. She's running for the hold.\" Clete struggled against Dutch's anger and hoped Merith returned quickly. She did. \"She opened it and ran in. There was a man in the hold. He begged me to lock it. He saved me. She was going to inject me. He got his hand in front of the injector before--\" \"Easy, Merith, I know. He's fast. Help me get him moving.\" \"I don't... need help. I need... to kill them.\" \"They're locked up.\" \"There's another.\" \"Not yet. He hasn't done anything yet. Come on. You need to help Lane. He needs you. He can't fight it like you can.\" \"You're right. Lane first. Come on.\" Clete gusted a sigh of relief. He'd barely held against Dutch's anger. He leaned against a bulkhead and dealt with his own. Merith watched Dutch move swiftly down the corridor. \"How can he even walk? He should be out of it.\" \"He's... stubborn. He just refuses to let the drug win. You come too. You don't want to be alone.\" \"You're right, I don't. He's coming back with your brother. Where are they going?\" \"To our cabin. Dutch and Lane are going to fight the drug together. I'll take you to-- Frake, where are you going?\" \"Lane said I was to come along and bring the girl to somebody named Melissa.\" \"Damn. I hope he knows what he's doing. Our cabin. Go on in. I'll show you the door to Melissa.\" He led them into Lissa and through to Melissa. He left them sitting on the floor, holding each other and giggling. He wondered again if Lane knew what he was doing. He found them on his bed. He'd looked everywhere else first. He had such a tight hold on himself, he hadn't been able to hunt for them by feel. He'd been about to head for the depths of the ship when he realized his door was open. \"We're waiting for you. You need to learn. Your bed is big enough. Give me your hand.\" \"All right, Dutch. I just hope... Never mind. Dutch took them into trance and they learned. Clete didn't need it so he surfaced almost immediately, but he now knew how. He went out to Merith and Frake and led them to the kitchen. He made cocoa and sat down in the breakfast nook. \"What is this thing?\" \"Our home, Frake, a ship. Her name is Melissa.\" \"This isn't possible.\" \"Merith, if it wasn't possible, it wouldn't exist.\" \"Clete, that's not what I meant. Or maybe it is what I meant. I don't know.\" \"I'd better get more cocoa ready. They'll want some. They'll probably sleep just a few minutes. Dutch is too keyed up to really rest. We need to make some plans.\" \"They'll be under that drug for hours, then screaming withdrawal for several more. I've seen it before. Horrible.\" \"Easy, Frake. They'd almost rid themselves of it when I left them. Dutch was in a hurry. He didn't like it.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"What's not possible? Hi, Merith. Scoot over.\" \"You're not possible!\" \"Yes I am. Clete and Lane say they might not be, but I definitely am. Ah, cocoa. Thanks, Clete.\" \"Lane?\" \"Sleeping. He won't be long. It was different, Clete. Easier. Just sort of broke it apart and made it... nothing. Lots easier than really healing something. I don't think I even really needed the trance. I started as soon as it hit me.\" \"The trance didn't hurt. It gave Lane and me a chance to learn how.\" \"True. So, Frake, what do you think of Melissa?\" \"I'm trying not to.\" Clete and Dutch laughed and soon Merith and Frake joined in. \"I hate missing nice laughter.\" \"Hello, Lane. Why did you tell Frake and Merith to come to Melissa?\" \"Did I? I guess I remembered them being here.\" \"Remembered?\" \"Lane remembers things that haven't happened yet, Merith. Dutch can link our minds together. Me, I'm just an ordinary empath. Dutch, you're making me warm!\" \"Sorry, Clete. I like sitting next to Merith. Let's take our cocoa to the living room. This may be a bit too cozy.\" \"Definitely!\" \"You know, I never knew guardian angels took heaven with them when they were working.\" \"Frake, you have a wonderful sense of humor. No wonder you're a showman.\" \"I lost it for awhile, Dutch. Thank you for helping me find it again.\" \"It's time to spread this operation out. If they were doing it to Frake, they're doing it to others.\" \"Choice. Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"Dutch, why don't you wait until he's sitting down?\" \"It's all right, Clete. I was waiting for it. We've got a straight path until the next choice. Motorcycles! He's decided he wants motorcycles!\" \"Too bad we don't have Dad to ride with us.\" \"We don't need him. It would be fun though. Dutch, we get a list from Frake. Others he thinks are paying. We take both him and Merith with us. We visit a large number. Space a lot of drugs. Dutch, you must not kill anyone. It's going to be hard not to. Especially the man in gray. He's a key to stopping it all, the link to the bosses. And you're going to want him very, very dead. The girl will be all right. We'll get her through. Oh, this is going to be fun. Clete... Oh, my. Yes. A lot of fun.\" \"Lane, what's the 'Clete, oh my?' It makes me nervous when you do that.\" \"Don't worry. You won't have any problem. Dutch and I can put up with our teeth rattling a few days.\" \"A FEW DAYS?!\" \"A sideline they're in. Yes! We learn the magic! Well, some of it. Not quite the way he did it. That's a function of who he is, but someday... Too bad. We should have kept a little to analyze. Cold turkey is hard, but they'll be grateful. That's it. Let's do it.\" \"Dutch, he got excited about magic and 'someday' was a promise.\" \"That doesn't surprise me, Clete. His eyes lit up every time Dad did a bit of magic. What's first, Lane?\" \"Frake's list. Hmm... Oh, I see. Easy. A horse race. No, two. How about that? Real leathers.\" \"Whoa. You're getting really excited, Lane, and Clete's about to start bouncing off walls. Since you'd probably say you hate to spoil fun surprises if I asked for specifics… Yeah, I thought so. All right, let's do this one step at a time. Frake, make us a list of everyone you know, or think you know, is paying protection, especially traveling shows, like yours. Give us their schedules, if you can. How does Merith fit in, Lane?\" \"She's our accountant, Dutch. She's a genius at estimating a house and keeping track of what money belongs to who. She can also figure out exactly what a show needs; costumes, props, equipment. The best little shopper on the net. You made a smart move when you hired her, Frake.\" \"I didn't. She just sort of attached herself to the company. Said she'd always wanted to be in show business. Promised she'd earn her keep. She looked hungry, so I fed her and said all right.\" \"I was hungry. I was also dodging an injector and one of those 'sidelines' this bunch are in.\" \"Why the blond was after you.\" \"Probably, Dutch. If your man in gray is the same as mine, he doesn't take no for an answer.\" \"Now I know why it's going to be hard not to kill him. I really don't like to kill. I haven't killed anyone since... in a very long time.\" \"Dutch, his bosses take care of him. He leads us to them. If he dies, they may get away.\" \"Remind me of that again when the time comes, Lane.\" \"I won't be there. Neither will Clete. You'll have to make the choice on your own.\" \"Here's the list. About fifteen. All I can think of. I guessed on most. Shows with good draw that are getting dilapidated. Barnard's is the worst. His ship is in worse shape than mine was. Nice old boy.\" \"He's first. They've got his niece. We'll get her and take her to him, then make sure his ship gets to where it's going. Dutch, it's going to break down in flight. We'll use Lissa and do a mayday answer. Replicate parts. Clean house for him. We have to let the two in the hold loose. They're our advertisement.\" \"Damn. Let's do it. Let's get Barnard's niece first. Who stays with Melissa?\" \"I do, but I meet you on the ship. We'll have to work fast. It'll take all of us. Yesterday.\" \"Let's move.\" It wasn't far to where Barnard's niece was being held. Clete went into the big house to get her. It didn't take him long to find her. He just followed the path of most resistance. He smiled at the bright-eyed little girl of about seven and squatted down. \"Hello, Jeannie. I'm Clete. Don't be afraid of me. I'm your friend, or I'd like to be. I've come to take you to your uncle. Wouldn't you like to leave here?\" \"Yes. I'm not afraid of you. I think you're here to rescue me.\" \"That's why.\" \"I was really hoping somebody would. They think I'm so dumb I wouldn't figure out why they won't let me go outside. They said they adopted me because Uncle Barnard didn't want me.\" \"They lied to you. They're making him pay lots of money. They told him they'd hurt you if he didn't.\" \"I guessed that, but I've been careful not to let them know. When Mommy and Daddy got killed, Uncle Barnard came and got me. He told me we're all the family we have and we have to stick together. He wouldn't decide he didn't want me. How did you get in? There's lots of not-nice men and Miss Perldick. She's not nice, either.\" \"Come on. I'll show you.\" He took the hand of the very bright young lady and led her through the house. She asked if the men were dead. He told her he didn't kill people if he could help it. They were just napping. They'd looked tired, so he'd tucked them in. She giggled. He led her into Melissa/Lissa and she sat on his lap on the bridge. Lane dropped Lissa free not far from the ship that had just sounded a mayday. \"Private yacht Lissa responding. We're on our way. Barnard, we have the parts you need and a surprise for you. Frake's on board. He'll fill you in.\" \"Your ship is very fast, Clete.\" \"Yes, Jeannie, she's as fast as any other ship in space. My brother Dutch is also a very good pilot.\" \"Uncle Barnard sounded surprised. He likes Mr. Herpith.\" \"You can call me Frake, Jeannie. You're his big surprise. He's been very worried about you.\" \"I've been worried about him too. He needs me to take care of him, so he can take care of everybody else. Clete, where did your other brother go?\" \"He went in the cargo hold, Jeannie.\" \"Come on, Clete. There isn't much time. We've got to get that ship fixed. That drive is bad. Frake, careful what you say about us. Come on, come on, get the hatch open. Hello, Barnard. I'm Dutch. Talk to Frake. I can hear-- Clete! Come on!\" \"I hear it! Bye, Jeannie.\" \"Who was-- Jeannie? JEANNIE!\" \"Hi, Uncle Barnard. Here's a tissue. You're getting the pretty dress Clete gave me all wet. Now stop crying. I'm safe. You haven't been taking care of yourself. You're a mess, but it'll be better now I'm here.\" \"Yes, Jeannie. Much better. Frake, what's going on?\" \"You've just acquired the best guardian angels in the business. Get your people together and keep them out of their way. And I'll tell you what real protection is. This is Merith. Oops. Wait'll they get by. Now, you get going. We'll meet you in your cabin. Questions later. Go!\" Lane ran into engineering with parts they needed now! They worked fast. After a few minutes, they actually had time to talk. \"Think Frake will be careful when he talks to Barnard?\" \"Yes, Clete, I do. Dutch, hand me that spanner. All right. Life support will hobble along until we get the rest of the parts replicated.\" \"I want to get that drive fixed first, Lane. Clete and I barely got it shut down in time. It was about to blow. We cut it a little fine.\" \"We had to wait for the mayday. You'll need an EVA suit. Don't use one of Barnard's. Get one from Lissa.\" \"Tubes fouled. I just knew it. Nasty job to do in space. Easy to hole a suit.\" \"Dutch, hold your breath and speed up your metabolism. Your body won't decompress. Get in within five minutes.\" \"I'm going to hole the suit. I hope you're right. What am I saying? You're always right. I hope.\" \"Clete, you handle the airlock for him. He's going to cut it fine. Override the automatics. Don't wait for it to pressurize. Make sure you tell me about it when you get him in. That's where the memory comes from. Get started now. He'll be ready to go. I'll replicate drive parts. See you on Lissa.\" \"Done.\" Lane got back with the first load of parts just in time to stop the fellow about to take the housing off the number one power generator. \"Don't touch that! Go find the rest of your people and stay with them. We'll show you what we did when we get done. Dutch is going to give you a very thorough lesson in drive maintenance. Get out of the way!\" Lane watched the man head back to the cargo hold. He was a decent mechanic, but not much of an engineer. He'd been out of his depth. As soon as he'd gone, he headed back to the replicator in Lissa. He had both arms full of parts when Clete joined him. \"Lane, he's in. Holed the suit. Held his breath, sped up his metabolism. Close. About five minutes. I overrode autos on the airlock. Popped it as soon as he got the hatch closed. He's hungry. Engineering.\" \"Bring the rest of the parts and food for him. High carbo content. I'm on my way with these.\" Lane found Dutch waiting for the parts he was carrying. When Clete arrived, he tore into the food like a starving man. They rebuilt drive, generators, life support and the galley. Barnard was a pretty good hand at the computers, comm and nav equipment. The bridge was in fair shape. Dutch, however, was steaming. \"You can come out and let your people know they're safe. Send your man to me in engineering. I'm going to have a long talk with him. Lane is sweeping up your ship. We'll space your extraneous cargo. Fire some people when you land. Clete will tell you which ones. He's on the bridge. Later.\" \"Is he always like that, Frake?\" \"No. Dutch is usually pretty friendly. Except when there are drugs involved. Come on, Barnard, Clete's waiting.\" \"And my ship is already repaired?\" \"No, already rebuilt. I told you. Guardian angels.\" Lane convinced Melissa to be inconspicuous and they landed at a racetrack on twentieth century Earth. He replicated a two dollar bill from a numismatic collection Meister had shared and won the exacta, visited another track and placed his winnings on a long shot. He collected, gave the woman from the IRS the government's cut and they went motorcycle shopping. Dutch decided he wanted outfits like the men at the shop were wearing. They told him they'd have to prove themselves. They didn't have any problems. They were careful not to break anyone. Getting the modified Sportsters through Lissa and into Melissa was a problem, so they took them apart. Water conversion to hydrogen fuel would be too obvious in the time they came from, so they changed them over to alcohol fuel and put them away. There was no point reassembling them, until they were needed. They went through Frake's list and Merith shopped. The money they collected for 'protection' returned the next day as ship parts, sets and costumes. Newly protected show owners happily followed instructions. Drugs were spaced and termination slips arranged. Frake and Merith were returned to the Merriment a few minutes after they'd left. It was time to shut down the sidelines. A few moments later, they were on the world and in the city where they would begin. \"This is where you meet the man in gray, Dutch. You'll tell me about it. It's going to be very hard not to kill him. Just remember, he's not going to get away with it. In fact, if you kill him, you'll be doing him a favor.\" \"I'll remember, Lane. What's the agenda?\" \"Clete and I are going to clean house. You're going to clean the streets. Send all the girls to Eight-three Harman Avenue. I'll start the detox program. Clete's going to take care of everything else.\" \"Terrific. I'll be dying from the heat.\" \"You'll be there before things get too warm out. Dutch, the kid comes through fine. We'll get her home. Get your bike and leathers.\" Dutch rode the city streets. The girls were all addicts, scared and abused. They really wanted his protection. After he removed several 'supervisors,' they believed he could give it to them. He sent them to Clete and Lane, nearly thirty of them. He found the man in gray recruiting, with his fists and an injector. \"Get away from her. Do it now. I'm not supposed to kill you. If you use that injector, I may not be able to keep my promise.\" \"I don't know who you are, but you'd better mind your own business. My boys don't like nosy people.\" \"This is my business. I'm Dutch. One of the Gallant boys. Your operation has just been acquired. You've been fired. Get away from that girl.\" \"Get him boys.\" There were only five of them, hulking brutes and slow. Dutch finished with them just as the man in gray injected the girl of about fifteen. She screamed and he slapped her down. It was nearly the last thing he ever did. Dutch held him in the air and looked in his eyes. He was shaking with rage. He wasn't going to be able to keep his promise. Then the girl whimpered. \"Thank her. I don't want her to see me rip your heart out. Say thank you and run. Run fast.\" \"Th...Thank you.\" He set the man on his feet and he ran. Dutch picked up the sobbing child and put her on the bike. He had to strap her to the backrest. She reached out an unsteady hand, touched the tears on his cheek, then passed out. He rode to the house and through the door Lane opened for him. A path had been cleared for him through the litter on the walk. Ten pieces of litter \"Bring her this way. I've got a room just for her.\" \"I found the man in gray, Lane. He beat her and injected her. I didn't finish with his boys fast enough to stop him. I've never wanted to kill anyone like I did him. She stopped me. She didn't need to see what I would have done. If she hadn't been conscious, I couldn't have stopped myself.\" \"I know, Dutch. Even I felt your pain and anger. It was real rough on Clete. Inject her with this, then use the medunit on her. Both will lessen the effect of the drug in her system. She'll sleep through the worst of it. When you're done, find us. The drug they're on has an additive. The girls you sent and the ones who were here have real needs. Detox takes three days. We have nine more cities on five worlds, then we go back to the show. We'll meet the gray man and his bosses on the second world the show hits. You have to not kill him again on the first. It'll be easier. Door at the top of the stairs when you're done here.\" Dutch nodded and went to work on the child. They couldn't 'reverse' the drug, but they could block the addiction. Lane would tell him when she'd awaken. He would be there and he'd get her home. He'd thought he was prepared when he opened the door. \"Whoa! Easy, easy. I'm here to help. Slowly. Help! Lane, I'm being smothered.\" \"They can't help it, Dutch. Clete's on his way. He synthesized something to help with detox.\" \"Damn! I hope he... hurries.\" \"I did. Here use this on them. Don't worry if you lose track. Extra doses won't hurt. Unh. Did you say three days, Lane?\" \"Yes, and nine... cities.\" \"Done.\" Dutch was sitting beside her when the girl awoke. She was shaking and sweating. She grabbed for him, but he held her off. \"It's the drug they gave you. You're almost through. We got a blocking agent into you to prevent the addiction. I can put you back to sleep if you want me to.\" \"No. Oh! Find me something! Something to do!\" \"Can you cook? There are a lot of women here who need food. They're all the way addicted. My brothers and I are... \" \"Busy, I'll bet. I'll cook. It's better if... I think you should show me the kitchen, then go away. I know what the stuff does. I'll fight it. It'll just be easier if you're not close.\" \"I'm Dutch. I'll show you the kitchen. What's your name?\" \"Chrissa. On second thought, you go on. I'll find the kitchen.\" Dutch grinned. She'd be out from under the influence of both drugs in a few hours. He'd take her home as soon as she was. Until then, he'd stay out of the kitchen. Clete was sleeping. He wished he could sleep, but his teeth felt like they were rattling. Clete purred in his sleep. \"Chrissa is cooking for us all. Some of you. Damn! Some of you go help. Bring... ow... easy... food back for us. Clete! Wake up! Go ahead. Wake him.\" \"Oh. Hello. Take a nap, Dutch.\" \"Lane needs one. I'm... fine.\" \"You heard. I need a nap. Clete, stop purring!\" Dutch needed a rest by the time all the women had been fed. Lane told him Crissa was ready to go home and he smiled as he headed for the kitchen. It was exactly the break he wanted. \"Hi, Chrissa. Ready to go home?\" \"Can you get along without a cook?\" \"Yes, the drugs are wearing off. We'll be making coffee and passing out pain killers for the next day-and-a-half.\" \"Dutch, a lot of these girls aren't much older than I am. That man did the same thing to them as he tried to do to me. He likes to beat them up. He deserves what you wanted to do to him.\" \"I know. It will happen, Chrissa. He won't get any more girls. I promise.\" He took her home and was very surprised when she kissed him. She whispered, \"It wasn't all the drug.\" He grinned as she ran in the front door. Her parents were good ones. She was proof of it. She'd called them, as soon as she awakened. Her father stepped out of the door, as he pulled away, quickly. He felt nice, but he already had all the thank-yous he could handle. He rode back to the house and sighed. His teeth were rattling again. It wasn't fun, but Clete found helping the women very pleasurable and his total understanding, including of what the drug did to them how, assured them of their identity as individuals. There was even laughter and shared humor. The purring was an irritation, but he didn't really resent it, nor look forward to the end of it. Clete would share their suffering, just as he did their pleasure and gratitude. Withdrawal wasn't easy for any of them. The women shook and cried and begged for the drug. Clete held the young ones who were terrified. Dutch and Lane did their best to help, but he was their most effective detox agent. Small doses of pain killer were given to the girls he said needed them badly. None of the girls had been addicts before they were recruited with an injector. There would be no relapses among them. Then they moved and started on a new city. When they rode their bikes back to Melissa after finishing that one, Dutch climbed off his and sighed. Clete raised an eyebrow and Lane smiled and nodded. \"What's the matter, Dutch?\" \"I wish they hadn't been quite so grateful, Lane.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm tired of my teeth rattling.\" \"You're just plain tired. We need rest. Leave the bike and hit the spa. Clete can load it. I'd love to see their faces when they find out we busted their sideline on five different planets on the same three days.\" \"Isn't that telling them something we don't want them to know?\" \"Do you want them to believe the man in gray when he tells them he's seen us in the show on one of the same days?\" \"No. You're right. Who'd believe it? Lane, what's wrong? Clete! Help me with him. The couch. Lane?\" \"He's dizzy, Dutch, but not... in trouble.\" \"I'm... all right. It all came back. I can see... forever again. Most of the dross is gone. Just one path again. All the roads not taken... aren't there. I'm fine. Go on. Get some rest. I'll look a bit.\" They spent forty-two days on five worlds, with recovery time between, all on the same three days, then landed Melissa on the Merriment ten minutes after they'd dropped Frake and Merith off. They started rehearsals and were ready when they landed two days later. Another beauty pageant was about to go on. Clete looked up in surprise when Frake walked over to where they were assembling risers. \"Exasperated? You feel like you're growling under your breath.\" \"Good description, Clete. They haven't done any paring down at all.\" \"I thought the place was too crowded. Left it all to you?\" \"I hope you boys don't mind. You and Merith are going to judge the preliminary rounds. We'll never get this thing on otherwise. No real problem. The scoring sheets are simple. This is all talent and personality. Beauty we leave to the judges picked by the sponsors. This is an all human pageant. You'll even know if the music is good. I'm going to visit the circus and have a look around.\" \"Frake you're going to find out they're paying too. Don't mention us. We have to do this one ourselves. It's very nasty. People will get killed if it's not handled exactly right. There are a whole bunch of bad apples in that barrel.\" \"Understood, Lane. I'll stick to my regular routine of 'Hi, we're the other attraction. How are the crowds?' and leave it at that.\" \"Good. We'll do our best here. Later.\" Merith had to remind them everyone wasn't perfect. They finally started giving realistic scores after they'd had to sit through two very bad performances twice. Merith was very fair. If they handed her something unrealistic, she called the entire group of six for a repeat. She was also good at keeping the contestants from trying to influence them. Dutch thought she was a little too good. He didn't really meet anyone. The contestants were grouped by type of performance, but the groups weren't all singers together, then all dancers. Just as they began to get tired of something, the type of performance changed. The 'personality interviews' were intersprersed with them as well. Merith noted there was a great deal more to Frake's job, and Frake, than was apparent on the surface. They all agreed. He'd set it up so what could have been a tedious task was actually pleasant. \"You know, I'm edgy. My teeth feel, well, funny.\" \"Merith, you're sitting too close to Clete. He's purring. Our teeth have been rattling for days.\" \"Purring? I don't understand, Dutch.\" \"Neither do we. He doesn't even know he's doing it. You must have a fairly high psi rating. Most people don't... That's why you're so good at estimating a house and knowing what people need!\" \"How about that? It's good for something after all. Six more, then I'll tabulate. Uh, oh, three of these list their talent as martial arts. I don't know anything about them.\" \"Don't worry. Just watch for gracefulness. We'll judge competency. That we do know.\" They got to the last contestant and things came to an abrupt halt. Lane expected it, but it didn't surprise Dutch when Clete suddenly stood either. \"Damn. Stop! I'm not going to sit here and watch you injure yourself. What's the matter with your sensei?\" \"Clete, calm down. Oh, well, there he goes.\" \"What's he doing, Dutch? I thought she was pretty good.\" \"She's practiced very hard, Merith, but she's practiced wrong. Give him five minutes. She deserves another chance.\" \"Dutch, a judge can't help a contestant. It's not fair.\" \"Lane?\" \"Merith, he couldn't let her go on. She was causing herself pain. We saw it too. She nearly dislocated her shoulder. She'll do something else. Wait'll you hear this, Dutch. You think Clete's purring. Hi, Clete.\" \"Lane, you knew this was coming.\" \"I also knew she wouldn't hurt herself badly before you stopped her. She needed what you showed her or she might have really damaged herself, Clete.\" \"Probably. She took some private lessons, but hasn't started university classes with a new sensei yet and has been practicing on her own. I told her we'd give her a few minutes. She said she'd actually planned on doing something else, but there were so many singers she changed her mind.\" They waited for her to change and warm up. She came back out and started to sing in a clear, sweet, soprano. She sang the words, \"Someday, my prince will come,\" and Dutch moaned in pleasure. She made the finals and a friend. \"Hi. I'm Dutch. You just sang my favorite song.\" \"I'm Sabitha Berke. Sabbi. I didn't think anyone would know it. It's ancient, but I've always loved it.\" \"Mid-twentieth century Disney; Snow White. We've got a complete collection. Clete's even got a perfectly preserved cel. Fantasia's a close second, but Snow White is my favorite.\" \"You're kidding. I thought I was the only person in existence who thought Snow White was the greatest of the classic animations.\" \"It was the first of it's kind. Look, we're done here. I'm no longer a judge. I don't think there's any rule that says we can't have dinner together. Would you be my guest?\" \"I'd like to, but I doubt it would make my mother happy. She worries about me. She didn't want me to do this. She's outside pacing.\" \"Some people have a low opinion of beauty pageants.\" \"Some worlds only have them for females, don't have a university grade-point minimum for entry and prizes are money. We have one for a six-year sports medicine scholarship called the Junior Apollo Pageant that makes the competition in this one look light. I feel sorry for some of those poor boys. Two years ago a pair of mothers got in a fist fight, when the artistic director said one of two in blue needed to change. My mom just thinks it's too much to do right now, but I want that scholarship for doctoral studies. I'm not counting on it, especially after seeing the competition, but it would certainly be nice not to have to scramble to put together a bunch of little ones for tuition.\" \"Dutch, take her mother too. They need you with them. Try not to break anyone.\" \"Right, Lane. That's it. We're having dinner. Is your mother as beautiful as you are?\" \"More. She's why I like Snow White so much, and she looks like her. When she's not worrying about me, she's a lot of fun.\" \"Let's not keep her waiting. She's probably worried already. By the way, I liked your answers to the questions too. Ah, your daughter is right. You are very beautiful. I'm Dutch. I'm your escort for this evening.\" \"Escort?\" \"Yes. Too many nasty people around. You're Snow White. How did you step out of my dreams?\" \"Snow White was a young girl. I'm almost fifty.\" \"I didn't say off the screen. I said out of my dreams. I like my dream women grown up.\" \"Sabbi, we have an escort. My name's Rose.\" \"It would have to be. Wait. Let me think. Oh, yes. I put them... there.\" Sabbi and Rose stared at the red roses he had pulled from the air and handed to them. Dutch loved it. He had spent days working out the math for the pocket of nontime just above his shoulder and stocking it with roses. He was using it for the first time and was delighted with the effect. \"Just a little trick copied from a real master. Took my brothers and me a long time to figure out how he did it. Now, I think dinner, then a show, a little dancing… Oops, I forgot. Sabbi has a curfew. An early evening then. A concert? There's one in the park a few blocks from here.\" \"The Grennert symphony with Braslerc conducting. I'd decided it probably wasn't a good idea for the two of us and was a bit disappointed we'd miss it.\" \"I'm delighted to be able to assure you don't, Rose. I'm in heaven. A beautiful woman on each arm.\" They had a wonderful time at dinner. Rose was a Disney authority. She taught media history at a small arts college in a distant city. Sabbi was a sociology student at the university in the same city. They were walking to the concert when a gang of young thugs attacked them. Dutch was careful. \"Good. I didn't break any of them. Addicts. Injectors in their pockets. I hate drugs, but they seem to be a symptom of societies that haven't reached the rewarding-work-for-all stage. Improvements in drive design will bring the travel time down and in fifty years you'll be part of the Fed and it just won't be. Sabbi, call the authorities. They'll put them in rehab. Maybe it'll take with one or two. Sabbi?\" \"Where did you learn that? How can you move so fast? There were six of them and they were armed.\" \"Martial arts are a family tradition and I got a lot more training when I attended the academy. I move that fast because my father isn't human. They were carrying weapons, but they really don't know how to use them. Now, let's call the authorities and go to the concert.\" Rose laughed and Sabbi made the call. Dutch took them to the concert and escorted them to their hotel. Rose said she didn't have a curfew. She and Dutch were dancing in the hotel lounge when Lane walked through the doors. He met them at their table. \"You were right, they needed me. Rose, this is my brother, Lane.\" \"Hi, Rose. I'm sorry to end your evening, but we need Dutch.\" \"I know someone who's expecting trouble when I see one. Thank you, Dutch. It was a nice evening.\" \"I enjoyed it immensely. Don't wait outside tomorrow. Come in. I'll see you to your room.\" \"No, I think I'll stay here awhile.\" \"Lane?\" \"She'll be fine. Trouble is other places. Goodnight, Rose. I'll wait, Dutch. Don't be long. We've got a time limit.\" Dutch said goodnight and followed Lane. He caught up with him a few steps down the back stairs of the hotel. \"What's up?\" \"Men with injectors in hotels, with weapons at the theater, sabotage at the circus. A very busy night. Clete is going to get hurt. So am I. Melissa is in the basement. We have to be several places at nearly the same time. There's just enough difference to make it seem possible. This is why we needed to learn the healing technique. Don't worry when we're under for a long time. We come through.\" \"I don't like it.\" \"I won't either. It's going to hurt. I muscled in on the circus earlier. Clete located a dozen roustabouts who needed firing and two performers who are addicts. One of the owners was the dealer. I bought him out. The other two owners were delighted. First stop Radmort Suites.\" They cleared five hotels, then removed six men at the circus. They repaired damaged equipment intended to injure performers and got rid of poisoned feed intended to kill animals. Lane put a hand out to stop them just before they went back into the theater where the pageant was being held. \"This is where things get rough, Dutch. These guys are different. They're pros and they're after us. I don't know how many you have to take alone after Clete and I go down. We get nine together. I sent everyone else away. Get ready. Clete, backstage. I'll take the balcony. Dutch, house. Go!\" Dutch ducked the beam and went after its source. He found him and went after the next. He heard firing on the stage and in the balcony. He started counting. When he got to eight, he felt Clete get hit. At nine, Lane. He took out the tenth and got wary. Everyone left would be looking for him. The tenth man had made a lot of noise. He decided he was in a hurry. He made himself a target. At least five more. He quit being careful with them. He took out four and listened. Nothing. He made himself a target again and someone nearly hit it. Three had fired at him. He found two of them. He heard a door slam and wondered if one had left. He decided it was a trick. He was right. He broke one of the two who had set up a crossfire near Clete. He checked him. He was in trance. He found the last man near Lane. He actually didn't mean to drop him from the balcony. Lane was in trance too. He carried him into Melissa, then got Clete. He put Melissa in flight and wondered where the coordinates Lane had set would take them. He was delighted when she landed at one of their favorite places to fish. He waited for them to come out of trance. It was a full day before Clete smiled at him, drank the water he held for him then went to sleep. Lane did the same about two hours later. Dutch breathed a sigh of relief and went fishing. They'd be hungry when they woke up. He spent about as much time checking on the two of them as he did fishing and kept a mental 'hand' on them the rest of the time, but he had plenty to cook when he built the fire and started frying them. Clete walked out of Melissa as he was cooking the last pan of fillets. \"Mmm. Bass. Enough for three?\" \"Actually, enough for five, Clete. I figured you'd be hungry. I'll bring these in when they're done. Fix something to go with them. I can feel Lane's about to wake up too. I'm sure bass, pan-fried over an open fire, was what he had in mind for breakfast. He's awake.\" \"You've been using a lot of energy monitoring us. Have you slept at all?\" \"Well... \" \"I thought not. Food then bed. I'll finish here. Lane will know. He'll be in the kitchen. Go find him.\" Clete was right. Lane was in the kitchen and had obviously made preparations before they went to find trouble. Dutch followed his nose. \"Eat. The bass will be here before you finish your salad. Fried potatoes coming up. You're out on your feet. You've barely slept in five days.\" \"I guess it has been five days. Didn't realize. Got in a couple hours when I got too groggy working on the math for my pocket. Then I played with it. After that we got busy. No wonder I'm tired.\" \"Bass.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Mmm, hungry too. Hey, you guys are the ones who were hurt. I'm supposed to be taking care of you.\" \"You already did. It's our turn. Clete, get him a hot bath ready. I'll have our plates fixed when you get back.\" \"A bath sounds good.\" \"Dutch, we need recuperation time. We're going to spend ten days here, then go back and clear the theater.\" \"You said you didn't know how many there were.\" \"I don't. Actually, I should have said you and Clete are going to clear the theater. I'm going to disarm the bomb under the stage.\" \"Lane, those people really don't like us.\" \"I know. Ain't it great?\" Dutch laughed, finished his meal and headed for his bath. Clete and Lane ate, then gently lifted him out of the water and tucked him in bed. He didn't awaken. They spent ten days recovering their strength and speed. They weren't quite in peak form, but Lane said they would be before they needed to be. They traveled back to the theater and he went to disarm the bomb. He didn't learn how many men had been left, but Clete did. They had taken nine together. Dutch had gotten the other ten alone and he'd only broken three of them. They left them stacked on the sidewalk with their broken weapons nearby. Dutch called the police and lodged a litter complaint. There were piles of trash in front of hotels, a theater, even in front of the civic arena. They spent the night working on creating and stocking pockets. It had taken them years to figure out their father's trick with the roses. They'd learned a great deal in the process, especially Clete. They'd all put on muscle too. Clete enjoyed math most with a barbell in his hands. Their father had put a reader above the weight bench when he'd complained he didn't have time for both lifting and math, and he'd been combining them ever since. Arguing they could work on the math with him without the barbells didn't work. Dutch had given up trying to change Lane's memory that it never would, while they were still in the academy. They wondered how long it would be before they could throw things into the air and have doves appear, or create showers of flower petals, or tap things into existence. Lane grinned and said awhile, but pulling a rose from the air for every lady escorted would make a nice addition to the show the next night. Frake found them putting the risers in place in the morning. \"Hi, boys. I have a little surprise for you. I had the programs printed up. I hope you like them.\" \"Featuring the Gallants as escorts. How about that? We're featured. Thanks, Frake.\" \"You're the best part of our show, Dutch. I wanted to tell you so. Where it counts.\" \"We'll costume appropriately. All right! You've expanded the show! I've got to find a horse. Later.\" \"A horse?\" \"Don't worry Frake. It'll be great. Merith chose the finalists for your featured performances, didn't she?\" \"Yes, Lane. She said Clete was impressed with the martial arts one. The other four were strictly her choice. Dancer, singer, dramatic reading, and musician. Said they were too good not to use. I need to get ready before the local crew arrive to open the ticket booth and the lobby lounge. My idea of how much is too much and that of bartenders don't always match. See you onstage.\" \"What's up, Lane? I like to know what I'm anticipating with relish.\" \"Well, tonight we costume as fairytale princes. Dutch is going to borrow a white horse from the circus.\" \"And?\" \"Clete, do you really want me to tell you who's going to win?\" \"No, it would be too hard to hold nervous hands and feel them hoping if I know they won't win.\" Dutch wasn't gone long. Lane and Clete were just putting the last riser in place. \"I found one and he's a beauty. Perfect. I know what to wear tonight too. I hope we've got a pattern.\" \"We don't, Dutch, but I'll go get us one. I'll see you in eight days and be back in ten minutes. I'll store a lot of costume patterns. We'll need them eventually.\" Lane knew where he had to go. Only one place would have everything, Earth in the twentieth century. He spent three nights and a morning there; one night in the wardrobe at Disneyland and the others at Universal Studios and Paramount. He copied only two women's costumes. He spent the morning at the floral market in Amsterdam. He spent the return trip storing flowers in nontime. He found Dutch and Clete reassembling the light bank, but they were nearly done. Clete growled his hello. \"I know, Clete, I need a nap. I've got real roses. Interested? I'll show you where I put them and tell you what I've got in mind.\" \"Clete, let's get this together quick. He's about asleep on his feet.\" \"Dutch, if you two don't quit abusing yourselves, we're never going to get back in top form. Lane says we're going to compete next stop. I'd like us to be ready.\" \"We'll be ready if it takes a month. There. Let's go. I want roses that are dew-touched and real.\" Lane showed them the flowers and gave Dutch the codes for the women's costumes. He'd know what to do with them. He laughed when Clete scooped him up, carried him to his room and dropped him on his bed. He'd forgotten it was going to happen. He'd had other things on his mind, like keeping Dutch from going after the gray man when he saw him in the audience. Sabbi just stared at Dutch with her mouth open. Rose laughed in delight. They both recognized the two garments he held. \"The song needed the costume, Sabbi. A lot more people than you realize will recognize it.\" \"Oh, Dutch, thank you! They're wonderful!\" \"I didn't do it. I'm just delivery boy. You have to thank Lane. He put a lot of work into getting them for you.\" \"Where is he?\" \"Asleep. Clete tossed him in bed.\" \"Did he spend all night getting these?\" \"More than all night. Those are the real Disney. The same ones they used at the Disney parks on Earth. He didn't tell me how he got them. Well, the pattern was of the real thing. The gown may be old-fashioned, but it's fairytale princess beautiful.\" \"Dutch, make sure I see him before the show. I want to give him a big kiss.\" \"He'll find you for that. You can bet on it.\" He did. He also told her to make sure to listen for her music and be ready to sing any time she heard it. He was a bit dazed. He had known he would be, but reality was much more intense. He suddenly decided he wanted to make a change. He was about wobbling by the time he found his brothers. \"Dutch, I want to ride the horse. Would you let me?\" \"Oh, boy. Clete, do you feel what I see?\" \"Uh, huh. This is a change. He's nervous about your answer. Doesn't know what you'll say.\" \"I say yes. Whoa!\" \"Nice catch, Dutch. Let's get him over there where he won't get dirty.\" \"Damn. It shouldn't have been that big a change, Clete. What did it do?\" \"Made him incredibly happy. Dutch, our brother's in love.\" \"I'm glad it's her mother I'm interested in. This could have been awkward.\" \"It still will be. I'm quite a bit older. Dutch, thank you. It doesn't change things on our current project, but it makes my future a lot richer. I'm going to marry her.\" \"What's the sadness?\" \"We won't have any children, Clete. Not of our own. She'll have hundreds to love. She's going to do exactly what she said she wanted to do.\" \"Build a place for unwanted children.\" \"Yes, Dutch, we help her. I won't see her enough for me, but a lot of time for her. At least, if nothing changes.\" \"Lane, changes we make other places shouldn't have any effect on her. You see her life. You're in it. We'll keep you from getting killed. You'll be there and so will she.\" \"Thank you, I... I was--\" \"Afraid of change. We'll watch over her. What? What is it?\" \"Clete... later. I'll ask later. I see it. I'll know. Sometimes I get in a hurry. I want it before its time.\" \"You missed this one, Lane. The answer is yes. When the time is right, we'll take Sabbi the son Helen found a way to give me. All you see is asking me when you're ready.\" \"How did you know?\" \"I suddenly realized there would be a place for him. We can't give him one. Now, since we've got her future all planned, don't you think we should get to work on her present?\" Things went smoothly until Dutch saw the gray man. He stood at the front of the stage dressed as a fairytale prince and looked like the hunter he was. Heads turned to see his prey. The gray man saw people looking at him and left quickly. Clete and Lane kept Dutch from following him. It wasn't easy. The incident had a strange effect. It should have made the crowd nervous, made the show tense. It didn't. When the gray man left, the audience stood and cheered. They didn't have any trouble telling heroes from villains. Sabbi's song brought a thunderous ovation. Dutch wondered why Lane hadn't ridden the horse. He suddenly realized why when he saw him talking to the orchestra conductor and smiled. Sabbi would sing again. The production numbers went well and all the performers were wonderful. The girls made their final costume change and the formal presentation in the ball gown competition began. The crowd went wild when roses were plucked from the air and given to each contestant. The presentation ended with the curtsy and the audience roared its approval. Dutch smiled and winked at Rose in the front row. Sabbi's very old-fashioned costume had brought gasps of recognition and whispers throughout the theater. The world was a bit 'arts crazy' in general and media history was a popular hobby. Two of the judges had recognized it, too. The runners-up were named and Clete and Dutch grinned at Lane. He looked like a runner in a race, waiting for the starting gun. Merith was holding the beautiful white horse in the wings and the orchestra conductor whispered instructions. They all knew. It had become obvious to everyone but her. Frake opened the envelope and called out, \"And the winner of the twenty-fifth annual Woman of Our Dreams Pageant is... Sabitha Berke!\" She looked stunned. Frake escorted her to center stage and the previous year's winner crowned her. Clete draped the sash and Dutch fastened the cape. Lane dropped down on one knee before her. There was a flash of light and he held a bouquet of eighteen, dew-fresh, long-stemmed, red roses up to her. He rose and laid them in her arms and they bowed her onto the runway. When she reached the end of it, the orchestra segued into her song. A hush fell over the audience and they watched. Lane rode out onto the runway on the magnificent white horse and lifted his beautiful baritone voice in duet. She turned, saw him, and watched him dismount \"I'm here, if you'll have me.\" He took her in his arms and kissed her. He lifted her onto the saddle and mounted. The crowd went crazy. They rode back to center stage and the other contestants showered them with their flowers. Sabbi settled into Lane's arms and leaned against his chest. Her prince had come. Dutch leapt off the stage, bowed, and offered Rose his arm. He escorted her to the stage and Clete bowed and offered his. Dutch grinned at Clete. \"Since it looks like we're going to be family, why don't you come to dinner in our home tonight?\" Frake cued a spotlight on Sabbi and Lane and brought the stage lights down. The conductor led the orchestra into a soft reprise of her song and the audience began to sing. At first, a soft voice here and there, but soon, a chorus that filled the theater with song and eyes with tears. No one would ever forget the night they saw a fairytale come true. Clete shook his head when Dutch escorted Rose into the kitchen after giving her a tour of Melissa. He'd have known what the headshake meant even if Rose hadn't voiced it as soon as she sat down. \"You do know this isn't possible?\" \"Why does everyone I bring home say that? It's possible or it wouldn't exist, Rose. It's just based on some very complicated physics. It's a dimensional matrix.\" \"Dutch, who are you? Who is my daughter so suddenly in love with? What are you doing with this show?\" \"We're half-brothers. We all have the same father. Gallant, Knight Hero. He's not human. The ship is his creation. We have been accepted as the defenders of life in this universe. Clete is Sir Pericles Buchannon, Knight Guardian. I'm Sir Roberrin Duchelle, Knight Champion. Lane is Sir Apollo Avelaine, Knight Judge. He's the son of two good and powerful beings. He sees the future. We're here to end a very nasty ring of extortion, forced prostitution and drug smuggling. This group of worlds can't become part of the Fed until that's done.\" \"The man tonight?\" \"I was just a bit too late to stop him from beating up a fifteen-year-old girl and injecting her with drugs. He was recruiting. We got her through it. I didn't kill him because Lane said he'll lead us to the bosses.\" \"But you wanted to.\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Good.\" \"Rose, you surprise me.\" \"My husband was a police officer, a detective. Five years ago he stumbled across something really evil. He was murdered on our doorstep. Overdosed with drugs. I didn't see the killer's face, but he wore gray. Now, how do you three cause enough trouble to break up something the size of what he found? It covered most of the unaligned planets in this sector.\" \"By being several places at once. You're in a ship that travels in time and space. Sabbi won't be alone most of the time.\" \"She's very young, Dutch.\" \"Lane knows. It's one of the first things he said. He's patient. He really does see the future. Remembers it.\" \"Why didn't he know about Sabbi before?\" \"You ask hard questions. We change the future. We make choices.\" \"Tell her true, Dutch. You change the future. Lane didn't know about Sabbi until you changed the future. You told him he could ride the horse.\" \"Thanks, Clete, you're a big help.\" \"Rose, each of us brings something to what we are. Lane is the investigator, the inquiring mind. I'm an empath, the feeling and the, might as well say it, passion. Dutch is the driving force, the will. Together, we make a pretty powerful team. We've chosen to make ourselves into a force for good.\" \"And who decides what good is?\" \"You're right, Dutch, she does ask hard questions. He had to earn it first, but Dutch was given the right and responsibility to decide. Don't ask by who. This one you have to take on faith, just as we did. Now, let's have supper. We've had to give this explanation too many times. You deserved it, so we did it again.\" \"Where are Sabbi and Lane?\" \"In his apartments. I'd say she's getting the same explanation you are. Come on, Rose, relax. You trust us in general. Trust Lane. He really is her prince.\" \"How old is he?\" \"Twenty-eight. Give or take a few million years and a universe or two.\" \"That answer was not reassuring.\" \"It wasn't meant to be. Rose, she loves him. He's worthy of it. That's enough. Now, let's eat. I'm starving.\" Clete didn't quite know what to do about her. She was still worried and nervous. Sabbi and Lane solved the problem. They walked in hand-in-hand and so obviously in love, she melted. All her reservations evaporated. Her daughter was happy. It was enough. The little kitchen nook became warm and cozy and they became family. Things even smoothed enough for Rose and Dutch to take notice of their mutual attraction again. Yes, warm and cozy. \"Clete!\" \"What? What did I do? Oh. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens when I feel content. I really can't do anything about it, Dutch.\" \"What's he mean? What's he doing?\" \"Rattling my teeth, Sabbi. He's purring!\"",

I am not going to spend days wondering. What?\" \"Lane. He aches for her. Needs her. Wants her. Wants her so much he's like a caged animal.\" \"No. Not this time. The future is too good. I won't risk it. It's not worth chancing. I think a lot of it is this trip. Two days on this ship with nothing to do but think about her.\" \"He's going to be useless by the time we get to Harvelle, worn ragged. We're supposed to compete. We're going to be out of it.\" \"You just came up with the answer. I'll bet if we spent two full days training, we'd be ready. And it's not really a change. We're still on the ship. Still traveling with the show. We'll give Frake Melissa's call signal. Lane didn't see anything, but it will keep Frake from getting nervous.\" \"Done. Ten minutes. In the gym.\" Lane was waiting for them when they got there. Dutch almost changed his mind. He looked fevered. He was pale and shaky-looking. \"I know. You don't have to tell me. I'm in rough shape. Put me to work. I'm full of tomorrow's memories and I need them to be now.\" Clete put them to work. He worked them every waking hour of the two days. Lane dropped into bed exhausted and slept. It was what he needed. They were ready when they landed. \"Dutch, we are about to turn this world on its ear. This is the base. Where it's all coming from. A pleasant, homey, little ball of vice, crime, corruption, and upright citizen crooks. It starts with the competition we're going to enter and the gray man. He's a mad dog they set loose. We're sending him back to them. This is the one world where they don't want him. He followed us. Now, the competition's fixed. We're about to unfix it.\" \"How do they fix a martial arts competition, Lane? A fight I could see, but this is huge, competitors from everywhere.\" \"They start with referees and judges and supplement with beatings and drugs. We're going to have a lot of very good help. Wait'll you meet Master Pon and Jerona, Clete. Dutch, you'll really like the Perisks. This is team and individual. A large amount of money is wagered. The betting is legal and our bad boys use it to pay off the help.\" \"Tell them who to bet on to collect their pay.\" \"Right, Clete. The first thing we do is find Master Pon. His school is registered. We're about to be students. He's even going to teach us some things. You'll love it. Let's help get the show set up. We're going to be conspicuously present several places at once.\" They helped unload and get things to the concert hall, then slipped quietly back to the ship. It was time to travel. They found Master Pon two days before, settled into lotus position near him on the beach and waited. They greeted the rising sun and moved smoothly into the tai chi ch'uan with him. He began a series of complex katas. They followed. It was quite some time before he found one they didn't know. They knelt and watched. When he had completed it, Clete spoke for them. \"Master, we ask you teach us.\" \"Who are you that I should spend my most valuable time?\" \"We are ones who have learned the value of knowledge.\" \"Do you then think you are wise?\" \"Only in knowing wisdom must be sought.\" \"It is a beginning. I will teach you.\" \"Thank you, Master. We will seek to learn well.\" \"Good. Now, who are you guys and where did you come from? I thought I knew most of the really advanced people in the sector.\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Clete. My brothers Lane and Dutch. We're from outside the sector. We've got wind of something real smelly in the competition coming up. We want to clear the air and we need your help.\" \"Sounds interesting. Let's go find late lunch. I'm starved.\" Master Pon was a delightful little man in his seventies. He had a quick wit and an easy laugh. They took him to Melissa for lunch. He looked around and grinned. When they told him what they planned to do, he smiled widely and officially 'enrolled' them in his school. He was the first person they'd shown Melissa who didn't say she was impossible. They went with him to meet their fellow students and Dutch just shook his head. Lane hadn't told them all Master Pon's other students were female. \"Jerona, Keli, Kera, I want you to meet someone. These are the newest students in our school; Dutch, Clete and Lane.\" \"Pon, I seldom question any decision you make, but aren't they just a bit unusual?\" \"More than you realize, Jerona. They're the best I've ever seen. Except myself, of course. They plan on taking apart a gambling fix on the competition. They also want to put a drug smuggling ring, with a sideline in forced prostitution, out of business in the process. Interested?\" \"This sounds like our kind of fun. Keli, Kera?\" \"You bet. The company's not bad to look at either. Hi, I'm Keli Perisk. The quiet one drooling over there is my sister Kera.\" \"Dutch. The drooling's mutual. I'm crazy about twins. Especially beautiful, red-haired twins. How'd you like to help me blow up a few warehouses and labs?\" \"Oh, I just love fireworks. Tell us all about it.\" \"Hmm, I'll bet I can fit three on my bike.\" Clete and Lane laughed as they watched Dutch walk off with a lady on each arm. He was in absolute heaven. He was telling them all about \"bikes.\" \"Clete, Jerona is my assistant. More than a student. A perfectionist to the core. You want to learn that kata, she can show you.\" \"All right! Lead on, Jerona. I'd follow you anywhere.\" \"You got it, big man. My, you are big. I'm taller than half the men I meet. You make me feel petite. I think I like it.\" \"Well, Lane, looks like we're left out in the cold. Of course, my wife frowns on it if I stay warm.\" \"I think your wife and my fiancé would get along. They seem to have some things in common.\" \"Shall we find a quiet place to talk and make some immediate plans?\" \"A good idea. Uh, oh. Sensei, that little girl in back needs a word.\" \"Damn. She's at it again. She just wants to learn so badly, she tries things more advanced students are doing. I'll... Well, I guess that's taken care of. He's really giving her a lecture.\" \"Don't worry. Clete gives very gentle lectures. I figured he'd see her. Probably felt her hurting herself. He's an empath.\" \"I wondered how he knew. He had his back to her. Are you all empaths?\" \"No, just Clete.\" \"And do you and Dutch have talents?\" \"I suppose you could call them that. I see the future. Dutch changes it.\" \"That must be most intriguing.\" \"It has its moments.\" Lane and Pon worked out logistics and made a list of things they'd need. Pon was delighted with the idea of it all happening during the competition and pageant. He shook his head in sadness when Lane told him the names of the people they were after. They were known and respected. They worked out the arrangements to save spouses and children from suffering shame and humiliation. Pon would add nineteen to his list of staff and students. They would travel to another world and another competition with him. Once there, they would become new people. Wagers on the competition would provide the funds for homes and upkeep. Merith had a list of eight new employees and would make the wagers. Dutch, Keli and Kera were sitting in Lissa happily constructing bombs. They would need a great many. Clete and Jerona were setting up the competition schedule. They were getting along famously. Things were running very smoothly when Clete suddenly groaned. \"Damn, Dutch! Sorry, Jerona, I can't think. I'm going to find a cold shower.\" \"What's the problem? What's happening?\" \"Dutch, Keli, and Kera are what's happening. They're also the problem.\" \"Oh, I see. Come with me.\" Jerona led Clete back to the shower room, but the water she turned on wasn't cold. Lane took a deep breath. \"Pon, I need a drink, a cold shower, and probably an anesthetic.\" \"I feel a bit warm myself. Your brothers?\" \"They have help.\" \"Yes, the ladies are helpful. Come on. Let's grab a few beers and go for a swim. We'll take the kids with us. Nothing like a cold ocean and a batch of little girls to keep things in perspective.\" \"Pon, you're a genius.\" \"Yes, but I've also been married forty-five years and been teaching women for twenty-seven. This genius is based on experience.\" \"I think we should hurry.\" \"Watch this. Salute your sensei! Time to play! Hit the beach!\" Lane watched and grinned. Every student gave formal thanks, then a mad scramble began. In two minutes, he and Pon were strolling behind forty, running, chattering, squealing girls toward the sea. Some were carrying beach chairs and sports equipment. One pair carried a coldkeep between them. By the time they caught up, two chairs, an umbrella and the keep were awaiting them. They laughed, pulled off their shirts and ran for the sea. The next day, Master Pon submitted his lists for the competition. They were stamped approved. They weren't even read. He'd never had male students. No one realized they were there. He hurried to the concert hall where his three students and his three assistants awaited in Melissa. They had a large number of beatings and druggings to prevent. Lane slid Melissa a few hours into the future and they went to work. Groups of men expecting to find one or two sleeping in a room met several awake outside the door. They broke into three teams after they had taken care of the large groups. Clete and Jerona had developed a smooth working relationship. Dutch, Keli and Kera had tremendous fun. Pon and Lane disposed of men who would have abused young people. They got a full day's rest in Melissa. Lane and Pon spent a good deal of time in the cold water of the swimming pool. They returned to the time they'd left. Dutch, Clete and Lane went to work preparing for the \"Our Special Girl\" pageant and Pon and the ladies went back to the dojo to organize students and equipment. Pon commed the masters of other schools in the competition and arranged a meeting. They would eject referees and judges who were unfair. Merith met Pon's brother-in-law and gave him funds and a list of wagers to make. Pon did not wish to know the outcome of the competition. His brother-in-law placed the bets with a very large grin on his face. He'd made a few small wagers of his own the day before. Lane recorded the tips to five honest men; three detective captains, a prosecutor and a news editor. He set the timer to send out the calls. He took Melissa to a restaurant and placed a tiny tracking device in the hem of the gray man's coat. It would lead Dutch, Clete and him to the board meeting and seal the gray man's fate. The murderer of Sabbi's father would die at the hands of his employers. She'd seen that changing that would change who she and her mother had become, without needing to be guided to it. The men on the board would be betrayed by some very unhappy, unpaid, employees, when the honest authorities found them in possession of large quantities of drugs. They'd be sure they'd been set up. They would be, but not by their bosses. Sabbi and he had agreed that would be satisfying too. He smiled as he replicated 'colors' for Pon and the ladies. They would enjoy the leathers and the wild ride. He also installed a set of pegs and built a new seat for Dutch's bike. It was a surprise. It was designed for three. Dutch would be a bit closer to the bars, but he wouldn't mind. He'd still be able to lift the front wheel off the ground. He rested in the past, then returned to the time of his departure. He had a team kata rehearsal. Pon put them to work as soon as he arrived. \"Yes, the appearance is aesthetically pleasing. Now, begin. No. Dutch, you must move a bit more slowly. You complete the moves a fraction too soon, then must pause before beginning the next. Again. Clete, control your power. The punches of all must be equal. Again.\" Pon smiled at the three big, blond men and the three big, red-haired women. They'd take the advanced mixed competition. He still felt the splitting of the competitors by sex was wrong, but Lane had explained it was part of the \"fix\" and very profitable to a pair of unpleasant men who provided bullies for the business. It was why none of his girls were targets. The presence of Clete, Dutch and Lane had placed his school in the overall points event. They had added possible points in a total of seven events. Pon expected his girls to complete a near sweep of their schedule. If the three men did as well as he knew they should, it would be the first overall his school had taken. He'd never had entries in the heavy and super-heavy classes. He longed for the 'old days' when all competitors were grouped only by levels of skill and not broken into age and weight classes. It was a technique of the sponsors and promoters, more events and more wagers. He smiled. He had entered himself in three events. It had been a long time. He expected to add the points for masters' level men to their total. The two men he hadn't been sure he wouldn't break in pieces wouldn't be competing. He'd never doubted his instincts about them, just thought testing his control for a few points that made no difference was foolish. The show people, contestants, escorts and all the students of Pon's school went to dinner together. Frake made the arrangements. A large restaurant became very busy. Lane smiled as Dutch tensed and shook his head. The gray man stood across the street and gazed at them taking seats by the window. He would be on his way to see his bosses. Dutch knew he would be going nowhere else. Ever. Dinner was a great success. Frake had a bill prepared and signed for it. It too would be covered out of Merith's wagers. It delighted him to know the money would come from the coffers of the people who had used him to smuggle drugs. He had noticed the two Lane had released from the hold and the third he had fired were on the planet. Lane had told him one of them would become a fount of information for the prosecutor. He wished he could stay to see it, but the show would move on. He knew Lane, Clete and Dutch would not be going with them. Their work would be done and they would find another who needed guardian angels. Frake and Pon became friends over dinner. The friendship would last until their deaths many years in the future. \"We have to leave. We have something to do tonight. We'll see you all tomorrow. Come on, let's set this thing in motion.\" \"With you in a minute, Lane. I just want to say goodnight to the ladies. OW! All right! I'm going. I'm going.\" Clete grinned, let go of Dutch's ear and followed him out the door, around the corner and into the alley where Lane had 'parked' Melissa. They moved her to an office and walked into the \"Boardroom\" across the hall from it. Dutch smiled at the nine very shocked people and sat on the end of the table. \"Hello, we're the Gallants. This is your notice we're shutting you down. Permanently.\" \"How did you get in here? How did you find this place?\" \"We put a tracker on your man in gray. It's in the hem of his coat. I believe I hear him coming now.\" \"YOU! You can't be here! I just saw you sitting down to dinner. You can't be... You're not natural. You're some kind of spooks.\" \"Oh, we're quite real. You're going to be sorry I didn't kill you. Goodby.\" Dutch laughed as he walked through the door and heard the gray man protesting he couldn't have been followed. He slept well that night. The news headlines the morning of the competition were about the beaten and mutilated body found floating in the bay. Lane would have liked to hear the 'board' trying to figure out how all those chains had come undone. He was rather fond of the little laser knife he carried in his pocket. It worked well on packing crates too. The tournament was interesting, especially when the senseis ejected four referees and three judges. They chose new ones from the expert aficionados in the audience. Pon's school swept through the competition. Two schools dominated most of the events for young males. They did not take any of the men's heavy or super-heavy events. They didn't take the master's either. The team kata competitions drew cheers from the crowd. When the winning men's team and the winning women's team combined and won the mixed event, they went wild. Pon accepted the overall point award for his school with a determinedly humble bow. He received a standing ovation from both the audience and fellow competitors. The day had already been wonderful and the fun was just beginning. Pon and his three assistants had box seats for the pageant. He smiled at the gasps of delight when the escorts in white produced a rose from the air for each contestant. He made a mental note to send flowers to his wife in celebration of their victory, then decided to add \"at first opportunity\" to it. Without her patience and support, it would not have been possible. Frake and Merith took the contestants out for supper. The Gallants would be busy. They started by hopping backward in time. They went from world to world and time to time. They thwarted every attempt made on shows that had come under their protection. It took them eight days. They landed outside Pon's school a few minutes after the pageant was over and Pon introduced the Gallants to his wife Ellith. She smiled in delight when Lane pulled a rose from the air and presented it to her. She mentioned Pon had sent a huge bouquet, which had been delivered moments before. Pon was very pleased he'd called and ordered them during the pageant. Jerona, Keli and Kera received roses as well. Clete pulled one, and Dutch two, from the air. They asked Ellith to put them in water. They would reclaim them in a short while. Pon told his wife he would be back in a few moments and returned with the others to Melissa to begin an evening of fun. He had smiled at his wife's tale of a crime ring's sudden fall during the evening hours. He didn't tell her he was on his way to help make it happen. She might worry. About his sanity. When they landed, Dutch found his present. \"Lane, you're terrific! It's great! Now I really can ride three.\" \"Happy whatever, Dutch. We're going to have to take them apart and put them together a lot. It clips in. Oh! I have other surprises as well. Ladies, these are your colors. Pon, this set is for you. Diamond clips for the ears and mirrored lenses for the eyes. Shall we change and terrorize a crime ring?\" They all smiled in delight as they stood before the mirrored wall Melissa made for them in the living room and looked at their reflections. They put the bikes together and roared into the day. Keli and Kera flipped to see who would sit behind Dutch first. They would take turns, changing places each time they hit another city. The seven of them roared into warehouse after warehouse and lab after lab. They left all the personnel napping outside and blew them up. They 'planted' a large quantity of drug for the police to find when they followed Lane's tips, then rode back to Melissa. They had spent seven hours in the city. They got a good night's rest and spent a pleasant day together. Lane and Pon spent some time swimming and Dutch complained about his teeth rattling at dinner. They landed, assembled the bikes, and spent the same seven hours in another city. In all, they spent sixteen days in the task, all in the same seven hours. They landed back at the school ten minutes after they'd left. They put together the evacuation plan for the innocents and began working on it. When they had everything ready, they went to the first house and Dutch slipped inside and smiled widely at the woman who was too pained to be shocked when he walked into the room. \"Hello, I'm Dutch. I'm here to get you and your children out of this mess. We've got a vehicle out back and a way for you to disappear. Bring your cat and anything you can't bear to part with, but not more than you can carry in one bag. Please, I know it's very hard to trust right now, but we will help.\" \"How did you get in? Can you really get us through all those reporters? And not for... a story?\" \"I got in because you need me. Yes, we can and no story is wanted. We've got transport offplanet and a new home and identities ready for you.\" \"I'll get my cat and coat. Merrie, get your teddy bear. Jord, bring your gliss game. We're leaving.\" No one paid much attention to one more news crew giving up on a locked house. The news vehicle stopped a few blocks away and two children and a woman carrying a cat climbed into a grav car with a lovely redhead driving it. The scene was repeated again and again, twice with dogs and once more with a cat and with various numbers of various-age children. One man struggled not to weep as he hustled four children into a van and left the home his wife's 'inheritance' had bought nine years before. Merith drove a closed vehicle onto the ship's cargo lift and drove it out again moments later. Ellith had a large number of houseguests overnight, then kissed Pon good luck and watched two chartered transports take his staff, chosen students and him to the spaceport for a chartered flight to a competition on a nearby world. Merith collected her winnings, then met Pon's brother-in-law and he gave her his. Lane had explained Harvelle had been the perfect place for the ring's base because there were no income taxes due to the vast mineral wealth. The incident that made it as accessible as it was on Earth wasn't the same, but the result was and the government collected money on every gram exported. It was also why gaming taxes were low. She cheerfully paid the two percent of the gross. She deposited the rest in numbered accounts and purchased real estate on another world by comm. The show was broken down and the ship loaded. Merith realized Frake would have to hire several people to replace the three who were leaving. She brushed tears from her eyes and went back to work. There were furnishings to order and clothes to provide. Kitchens must also be stocked. \"Merith, we're on our way. We'll have everything ready for them when they get there. We'll see you at your destination.\" \"All right, Lane. Lane... \" \"Yes? Come on, Merith, you know how it works. You have to ask before I can have the memory. You ask.\" \"If I tell Frake I'm in love with him, what would he... Would he... Oh, dear.\" \"Save me a dance at your reception. I love dancing with ladies in white.\" He smiled, pulled a white rose from the air and handed it to her. She stared at it in surprise. It was cool and moist with dew. She inhaled the fragrance of the first rose she'd ever held that hadn't been replicated. She laughed in delight as Lane waved and walked away. She took a deep breath and hunted for Frake. She had something to tell him. Lane was smiling when he walked into Melissa. \"All right, that's taken care of. Now, on to our next destination. We're about to become deliverymen. Dutch, here's the list of merchants and items. Set schedules for pickup. You met them all, figure out what should go where and to whom. We need to insert computer records for all the kids in schools so they can be transferred to their new ones. I'll pull their real ones and change the identities. We'll need to do marriage, divorce, etceteras, for every one of them. Clete, you take care of birth and medical records. Here's the list of people and their new identities. Let's get to work.\" \"Lane, why are you so happy? You're just bubbling.\" \"Well, Clete, when we get this chore finished, we're going to a wedding. The bride has just promised me a dance at the reception. You guys will get one too, but you'll enjoy dancing with the bridesmaids more.\" \"Frake and Merith!\" \"You got it. Jerona, Keli and Kera are going to be bridesmaids. Guess who the groomsmen are.\" \"All right! I like being in weddings.\" The sudden wistful look on Clete's face made Dutch wish he hadn't said it. \"It's all right, Dutch. I like being in weddings, too.\" \"Clete, it'll be a little rough in places. Tell Jerona why. She's a good friend. She'll be willing to help.\" \"She always does.\" Clete smiled a slow warm smile. It went with a very nice memory. \"Damn, Lane. He's doing it again!\" \"I noticed. Let's get to work, Dutch.\" \"I hate trying to think when my teeth are rattling!\" A woman was still very nervous when she walked into her new house. The pain of finding out what her husband was hadn't really eased. She stopped and stared around in amazement. It was beautiful. She wandered from room to beautifully furnished room, carrying her cat and dragging her coat unnoticed behind her. She heard her daughter squeal, dropped cat and coat and ran. \"Look, Mommy, toys and dolls and my closet's full. Jord's too. Is yours full too, Mommy?\" She went to check. It was. She found a large packet on her dresser. It contained complete documents for all of them, including school enrollment for Merrie and Jord. Their first names were the same, but the last had been changed. The message light was blinking on the comm unit. It was from the bank and it thanked her for choosing them for her accounts. She pulled up the records and started to laugh. There was an amazing amount all set up as interest-bearing trusts. She would have a comfortable regular income and the children's education was provided for. She began to put the documents away and found a short handwritten note. \"The name on the decree is fictitious, but the divorce is real. Forget the past. Enjoy your new life. P.S. I set the coffeepot to turn on when you answered the comm unit.\" She went to the kitchen and poured herself a cup of coffee. The house didn't have a food synthesizer, but she'd never really liked them. She opened cabinets and found them stocked. She sat down at the table and giggled. Frake had told her not to worry, she had the best guardian angels in the business. He'd been absolutely right. She wondered if one of them was called Dutch. The scene was repeated in eight homes that day. Most homes had synthesizers. Those that didn't were for ladies and the man who preferred to cook. Reporters searched passenger lists for days. The families of the eight men and one woman had just disappeared, including dogs and cats. Frake and Merith didn't wait long. It was a good time for all their real friends to attend, but it was less wait for the Gallants. None of them wanted to wait thirty-two days to go to the wedding. \"Congratulations, Frake, you're a very lucky man.\" \"I know it. Lane, I don't think I'd have ever gotten up the nerve, but she just walked up and said she loved me and what was I going to do about it. I asked her to marry me. Surprised myself. Didn't surprise her though. She handed me a guest list.\" \"Thanks for asking me to be best man. It meant a lot. Barnard and Jeannie looked pleased too.\" \"Well, Merith doesn't have any family. She likes Barnard and decided to ask him to give her away. Jeannie was natural for flower girl. Old Earth traditional all the way. It was those costumes you guys wore. I'm glad Pon and Ellith could come. I've got a lot of old friends here, but Merith... Well, she needed some on her side of the aisle.\" \"Frake, I'm going to dance with your wife. I'm going to give her a kiss too. It's the one time I know my fiancé wouldn't mind.\" \"That's true. I wish Sabbi and Rose could've come. Merith asked them.\" \"Work and school. They just couldn't get away.\" \"Lane, you could've... you know, got them.\" \"No. My life with Sabbi is going to be wonderful. I don't need to make any changes in it. I am looking forward to the next time I see her though. I dream about it.\" \"Special reason?\" \"Yes. Her mother won't be around.\" Frake laughed and Lane went to dance with his wife and give her a kiss. Pon joined him at the punch bowl a short time later. \"It will be a warm night.\" \"Yeah, Clete and Dutch are going to bring Jerona, Keli and Kera home for a late supper. And breakfast.\" \"I'm sorry, my friend, Ellith has decided it will be a warm night too. You'll have to swim alone.\" Lane laughed and clapped him on the back. Clete watched Lane sit down for dinner in Melissa. Dutch grinned widely. They all felt good, but Lane was flying. \"All right, tell us.\" \"Tell you what, Clete?\" \"You know. What's up. Why you're three feet off the ground and humming under your breath. Come on, Lane, tell us.\" \"I'm going to see Sabbi. There's a dance at her university and we're going to it. We're going to make it official. I've just been thinking about it.\" \"There's more.\" \"Yes! Yes, there is. Her mother won't be there! I'm going to whisk her away and spend some time with her. I've been enjoying thinking about you two taking your turn.\" \"Our turn at what?\" \"Doing countless laps in the pool!\" Clete and Dutch burst into laughter. It really was their turn. Lane got more excited as the time drew near. One night Clete hauled him out of bed, carried him, protesting, from his room and dumped him in the pool. Lane sputtered and laughed. Clete shook his head, grinned and went back to bed. Maybe his room wouldn't be quite so warm. Three days later, Lane's memory finally agreed it was time. Clete and Dutch both walked in to his room grinning widely. They'd both felt his sudden surge of excitement and knew exactly what it meant. \"So, how do we dress? Is this formal, informal, a beach party, what?\" \"Homecoming. Called The Queen's Ball.\" \"White tuxes?\" \"Not this time, Dutch. You and Clete wear black tuxes. I'm the only one who wears white.\" \"Oh, ho, you want to outshine us.\" \"I most certainly do.\" \"Going to tell us why?\" \"No, you'll see. You won't be bored or go unnoticed. You'll get all the attention you need. I just want more.\" \"All right, Lane. Clete, black tuxes.\" \"Done.\" Lane smiled, told Melissa to execute the flight plan and began getting ready. Dutch and Clete would wear black tuxes with red satin cummerbunds, ties and roses. He would wear all white including an opera cape. He planned on putting on quite a show. Sabbi would love it. She was a true romantic and so was he. He made his preparations and smiled. Clete hadn't caught on to the purpose of all the equations he'd given him to work on while he lifted weights. He'd just been happy to have some new ones to \"play with,\" while the barbell went up and down. The girl checking tickets at the door didn't ask them if they had them. Dutch handed her a rose and asked her for a dance later. The plain little girl became a beautiful woman in an instant. He was sure she was and she really couldn't doubt it. Lane smiled at Clete's wide grin when love for them both rose in a warm wave in him, then suddenly became a thought of Sabbi and a great deal warmer. They stepped through the doors and Dutch grinned, too. They followed two paces behind Lane as he walked across the dance floor. People stopped to watch and an aisle cleared. Sabbi looked up and saw him. Her face lit with delight. She waited. The gleam in his eye and his smile told her he was up to something. He made a full formal bow and produced a bouquet of white roses from the air. He dropped on one knee before her. His deep rich voice carried through the room. \"I, Sir Apollo Avelaine Gallant, ask for your hand in marriage.\" \"Yes.\" He pulled a ring set with a huge diamond from the air and placed it on her finger. She began to sing her song and he lifted her to her feet. He joined her in duet and they danced. When they finished the song, he kissed her and flower petals drifted down around them. The room erupted in applause. Clete and Dutch grinned. Lane had figured out the flower petal trick and used it to good effect. He'd been spectacular. The prince had crashed the homecoming and walked off with the queen. Clete and Dutch bowed to them and moved toward the refreshment table. Dutch filled two cups and carried them to the girl at the table in the hall. Clete felt the slightly awkward determination of a group of young women who had no special companion for the most romantic event of the year, but weren't about to miss it. He walked into the midst of them. \"Hi. I'm Clete. Can I be your date? I hate being at things like this alone.\" He pulled rose after rose from the air and handed one to each. A chubby young woman with a delightful smile suddenly laughed. \"Absolutely, and I think you're big enough to actually go around.\" \"Oh, I do my best. Would you like to dance?\" Dutch found the shy girls in the hall, the ones who had built the floats and decorated the room. The ones who had worked long and hard, then dressed up and peeked through the door at other people enjoying the fruits of their labors. He sat on the ticket table, gave out roses and gently teased. Before long, he shooed them through the doors ahead of him, found a table and seated each and every one. He bowed and led the little ticket girl onto the floor. Boys next. They'd be harder, but a bit less shy to start. There would also be fewer. For some reason, a pair of very shy girls were likely to talk each other into things and a pair of very shy boys were likely to talk each other out of them. The three women and two men faculty members and the group of alumnus smiled. They had no idea who the big men who had 'crashed the gate' were, but they were very welcome. They had made the night magical and brought the outsiders in. And in the center of the floor, the queen danced with her prince. The last song was announced and couples moved onto the floor to hold each other and move to the slow song. On the last chord, the man in white flipped several things into the air in quick succession. There were sudden flashes of light all over the room and something began to drift down. A botany professor picked one up and gasped in amazement. \"It's real! The rose petals are real! They're not replicated! They're real!\" All over the room, young university students caught drifting petals and tucked them away, memories of a magical, romantic, night. \"Time for supper. Tell me, ladies, where would you like to continue this evening?\" \"Clete, you can't be serious.\" \"Teri, I think you ladies have enjoyed my company. I know I've enjoyed yours. Whyever would you be surprised I want to take you to supper? Choose some place nice. I want to show you off. The boys and I feel quite smug having you all to ourselves. Don't we, Cliff?\" \"Yes. How about Tres Jacque?\" \"Ah, a suggestion. Sounds like a good one. Now, transport?\" \"We can walk. It's about six blocks and I'd love to be seen with a whole bunch of pretty girls.\" \"Ladies, would you walk six blocks on a warm autumn evening so Cliff, Darrell and I can show off?\" \"We'll get our coats.\" \"Teri, please allow us to use it as a way to say we're pleased to be with you. A bunch more people in line getting coats one at a time is silly and it's a nice opportunity.\" They collected the checks and walked to the coat room. \"Clete, you're an absolute master. I'm having a great time learning from you.\" \"No, Cliff. See that man over there? That's my brother Dutch. I always thought he was a master. Tonight, I learned the true master is my brother Lane.\" \"The one who asked Sabbi to marry him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"I see what you mean.\" \"Ah, you really are learning.\" \"Clete?\" \"Yes, Darrell?\" \"Um, well, Tres Jacque is... well... \" \"Don't worry. We'll cover it. It seems someone recently decided he owed me some back pay.\" \"Who? Oops, sorry. I didn't mean to pry.\" \"Then you won't mind if I don't tell you. It's rather embarrassing to be paid to escort the most beautiful women on a planet across a stage.\" \"Hi, Clete. Where are we taking the ladies?\" \"Cliff suggests Tres Jacque, Dutch.\" \"Excellent. Thanks, Cliff. I couldn't get a name from anyone. Just 'anyplace' and 'you choose.' I take it we're within strolling distance.\" \"Yes. Dutch, make sure you reassure student budgets.\" \"True. We were pretty spoiled at the academy, in the Federation in general. I may never get used to the idea of needing to carry money. I'll comm ahead. Get us the center of the room. Lane and Sabbi?\" \"Yes, definitely. Check. He may have already made the reservations.\" \"You're right. I'll bet he did. Weeks ago. Hang on, Kip. I'll take some of those. Ah, Lane. Reservations Tres Jacque?\" \"Weeks ago. Hi, Clete, Cliff, Darrell. You lost a coat check. Teri's. Middle of the dance floor.\" \"Got it. Here, guys, be right back.\" \"How'd you know?\" \"What?\" \"About the coat check and our names.\" \"Easy, Cliff. Sabbi told me your names and Clete tells me about the coat check.\" \"Teri's coat check. In the middle of the dance floor.\" \"See?\" \"Lane, not fair. You're making them nervous.\" \"You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just showing off. Like the lights and flower petals. I asked the girl of my dreams to marry me and she said yes. I'm feeling pretty smug.\" \"There's a lot of that going around. I came all alone tonight and I'm leaving with at least a girl on each arm. I'm feeling pretty good.\" \"Cliff, I like you. Ah. No, this won't do. Too drab for tonight. She needs something special.\" \"Lane, what are you going to do?\" \"Just watch, Clete.\" \"Hand her the tickets, guys. This we want to see. Dutch!\" Dutch turned from aiding young ladies with coats and Clete nodded toward Lane. They watched as he reached her, looked at her, looked at the coat, back at her and shook his head. He tossed the coat in the air. There was a flash of light and a full-length, snowy-white satin cape dropped onto his arm. When he lifted it to drape around her shoulders, the way the light glinted from it identified it as Carenna Satin. She laughed and kissed him. Clete laughed when Cliff said he thought he'd keep learning from him because he was too awed to ask Lane questions. When he turned, the two girls from the coat room were standing behind him, still holding the tickets. \"Lane! Two more for supper!\" \"Done!\" \"Do you mean... us?\" \"I most certainly do. You're almost done here. You've worked hard all evening to help make this night special and raise funds for your organization. You definitely deserve supper.\" \"Yes! I mean thanks. Come on, Jen. Let's get these coats.\" They were nearly the last to leave. Lane and Sabbi led the way. They were followed by a large group of happy girls carrying roses. Amidst the girls were five near ecstatic boys, Dutch and Clete. Tres Jacque was awaiting them. The maitre d' bowed to them. \"The queen's party has arrived!\" Suddenly every waiter and busperson was aiding with coats. The maitre d' led them to the center of the restaurant and bowed deeply. Lane removed Sabbi's cape and handed it to him. He pulled a chair out for her and every other girl found herself with a chair held for her. They were all seated and handed menus. Everyone but the maitre d' vanished. \"May I suggest?\" \"That would be most kind.\" Sabbi was having a wonderful time. She knew Lane had set everything up. The kitchen would even know what to prepare. She listened in near rapture to the delights Lane had chosen as the maitre d' named them. Mouths dropped open around the table when she nodded. \"Yes, I think that would be suitable, but do see if anyone prefers something lighter.\" \"Ladies, gentlemen, do you prefer something other?\" Dutch grinned at Clete and folded his menu. Lane was flying and neither of them was firmly on the ground. \"No, I believe the queen has spoken for us all. Thank you, Milady.\" \"Very well. It will be but a few moments.\" As soon as he'd left, Sabbi burst into giggles. \"Oh, Lane, what a meal. They don't even serve half the things he named.\" \"They do tonight. Well, at least at this table.\" \"That's another thing. A table for twenty-seven?\" \"I had them build it. The U shape was the most efficient use of space. Kept us all close enough to chat.\" The feast started arriving in minutes. It was wonderful. The chef came out and thanked them for allowing her to prepare such a wonderful menu. Sabbi said they thanked her for preparing it superbly. When the evening ended, each coat was held for the right person. No bill was presented. Cliff worried privately to Clete about it. He reassured him everything, including very generous tips, had been arranged. Cliff nodded. \"A master.\" \"Lane, we're going to see the ladies home. We'll see you shortly.\" \"I doubt that, Clete. Have a nice swim.\" Dutch and Clete both burst into laughter. When asked what they were laughing about, they just shook their heads and grinned. They escorted the girls to dorms and co-op houses and said goodnight to the boys. Clete and Dutch looked at each other and laughed. They ran back to Melissa. They were going for a swim. It was a very long one, but Clete was very happily fixing breakfast when Sabbi walked into the kitchen rather early the next morning. \"Hi. Mmm, smells good.\" \"Good morning, Sabbi. Breakfast in about five. Coffee's ready.\" \"Why do you cook?\" \"What?\" \"I mean, you have a food synthesizer, but you don't use it much. You prepare most of your own meals. Why?\" \"Well, I suppose because we enjoy doing it. We use the synth if we're in a hurry. Or if Dutch cooks. Most of the things we cook come from it. Maybe it just seems too easy.\" \"I think part of it is you're olfactory oriented.\" \"What?\" \"The smell of cooking food makes you hungrier, more appreciative. Makes a home more homey. Do you remember the smells of your boyhood?\" \"Oh, yes. Prairie grasses on a hot summer day, spring rain, a wood fire, my mother's skin when she gave me a hug.\" \"Lane's the same way. Real roses, because replicated ones don't smell fresh. Tells me every ocean smells different. Recognizes places by smell. Dutch too?\" \"Dutch too what?\" \"Oh, hi, Dutch. Recognize places by their smell.\" \"Maybe not smell so much as a... gestalt of things. Light, sound, the feel of the air, the smell and taste. I guess smell plays a very big part in it. Why?\" \"It all started when she asked me why we cooked instead of using the synth.\" \"Sabbi, I think you've hit something. I grew up in space. Starships and space stations. Clete and Lane didn't. I suppose I notice all the things I mentioned because my environment was so controlled. I collect clothes made of real materials when we go into the past because I like the way they feel on my skin. And, as for the cooking, a synthesizer doesn't make my mouth water the way Clete and Lane's cooking does. That looks great, Clete.\" \"Simple and fast, but sometimes bacon and eggs are just perfect. Enjoy. Where's Lane, Sabbi?\" \"I'm not quite sure. He handed me this dressing gown, gave me a kiss, and said to tell you he'd be here before his eggs got cold.\" \"I am. Ah, breakfast. I was looking for where we're going. Comparing star charts with my memories.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"Tenepeth, Dutch. It's a beautiful place. Rich and green. Warm seas and beautiful beaches. Yellow sun and three moons. Earth-like without all the people.\" \"Just how many people is it without?\" \"Don't worry. I'm not taking us anywhere totally uninhabited. You'll find playmates. Clete, this world will be very interesting for you. The people are empathic. Makes it a very peaceful place.\" \"I hate to mention this, Lane, but I have to get back to the university. I have classes tomorrow.\" \"Sabbi, this is a timeship. You could be gone years and make your next class. We're only going for three days. You won't forget your subjects. We're going to Tenepeth for a reason. About ten years before we'll arrive, a disease devastated the planet. Children under the age of about five weren't hit very hard. A mild fever and a quick recovery. Older kids had it quite a bit worse. About sixty percent of them died. The adults were decimated. I want you to see how they cared for all those children. Hundreds of them to four or five adults and thirty or so older kids.\" \"Oh, Lane, it's perfect! Yes, take me there.\" \"We're on our way. We'll be very welcome, especially Clete.\" \"Why me?\" \"They're trying to rebuild their population. Ten months after we leave, the birth rate doubles.\" \"Wait a minute! I'm not responsible for that!\" \"Not directly. Your presence just warms things up a bit. Look at it this way, at least you won't look like a prune from spending three days in the swimming pool.\" Sabbi suddenly realized what he meant and blushed. \"I didn't think about... I forgot... I just--\" \"Sabbi, we don't think about it either. Lane's spent a lot of time in that pool. Lots more than three days. Dutch and I are very happy for you two. Love is a wonderful thing to be near. You're family. You've become a piece of what makes us what we are. A part of the love.\" \"Clete's right. You belong with Lane. We both feel it. I'd be absolutely ecstatic about it if it weren't for one thing. Clete's so damn happy about it my teeth are rattling!\" \"Rattling? Oh, that's right. You've said that before.\" \"Happens every time things get really nice. We're not even sure exactly what it is he's doing. He doesn't seem to be able to control it. It bothers Dutch more than it does me. I find it a mild distraction, but it drives Dutch crazy.\" \"It's like... Have you ever rested your head against a cat when it's purring?\" \"Hmm, yes, but it didn't rattle my teeth, Dutch.\" \"Imagine what it would have been like if the cat was Clete's size.\" \"Oh, my.\" \"Yes, oh my. You're extremely welcome here, Sabbi. The proof is in my head. I'd be walking on air if Clete would just stop purring!\" \"Dutch, I'd stop if I could. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens.\" Sabbi looked at the three of them. Dutch looked disgusted. Clete looked chagrined. Lane was wearing a wide grin. She burst into laughter. They were family and she was part of it. She wondered if she was purring too. Lane suggested they give her a martial arts lesson. She had been working quite hard and it showed. Clete was delighted with the progress she'd made. One day she'd be very good. Lane told them they'd be landing shortly after lunch and he and Sabbi would prepare it. Sabbi decided she liked to cook, but wasn't fond of doing dishes. \"We've landed. Come on, Sabbi. Let's go look around. This is one of the havens the people built for the children. It's still in use, but most of the kids are in their teens. Don't be surprised by young-looking pregnant girls. They're watched over carefully. There's a real gap between generations. A lot of young teenagers, but very few kids between two and nine. Remember, there are a hundred empty cities out there and every child is needed.\" \"All right, Lane. I'll remember. Oh! It's beautiful!\" The sun seemed to shine softly on low, tree-shaded, buildings of a soft tan color. Bright-colored playground equipment dotted large grassy lawns. There were clusters of buildings scattered across a huge area. Each cluster enclosed a play area for very small children. Lane led her to a cluster where happy toddlers played. They introduced themselves to two girls, who looked about fifteen, who were watching the children and one of them called for someone to show them their home. Each building was designed to house about a dozen young children and one or two young adults. Rooms were large and comfortable. Bedrooms were shared by two or three children of the same sex, but not quite the same age. Oldest being furthest from the adults, youngest closest. There were playrooms and study rooms, dining rooms and kitchens. Three small rooms puzzled Sabbi until she learned they were included so there were places children could go to be alone. One room was called the \"thinking room.\" It was furnished simply and had nice windows, but no toys or other forms of entertainment. She learned it was where children were taken when they had badly misbehaved. It was a place to think things over. One young boy was sitting by a window and looking out. The girl guiding their tour asked him if he'd thought about why he was there. When he told her he had, she gave him a hug and sent him out to play. Sabbi was impressed with the affection that was obvious. Each building was a real home, warm and nurturing. \"Lane, I want to do this. Even on my very-civilized world, there are people who have children and really don't want them. They think they do, but find out later they didn't. I want to make a place they're wanted.\" \"You will, Sabbi. We'll help. I'll help. Clete will be a wonder with the kids and Dutch will be everyone's favorite uncle. You'll find others who have enough love to give it to lots of children. You're going to be Mom to dozens of wonderful people and I'm going to love being called 'Daddy.' Come on, let's find a place by ourselves. I want to tell you a story about a very special child and how he came to be. We need to get a ways away from Clete. This is the best place to tell you. The people here will help him deal with your sadness.\" \"Lane, he is sad, isn't he? Somewhere inside he's been terribly hurt. He has too much depth not to have known great pain.\" \"Sabbi, you will always amaze me. You care so deeply about others. Clete's caring is easy for me to understand. He feels other's feelings. Yours is a wonder to me and always will be. You work to know how others feel. Your love is boundless. I'm going to bask in it and wonder at it all our lives together.\" \"Hi, you headed for the beach?\" \"No, Dutch, a walk through the forest. Find Clete. Find some people for him to be around. I'm going to tell Sabbi about Helen.\" \"Give me a few minutes to find him and meet some people. I saw a group of young women sitting on the beach. I'll take him there, then make myself scarce.\" \"Find yourself some company too, Dutch. Clete's pretty attuned to Sabbi right now. It'll hit you hard too.\" \"Yeah. Later.\" \"Why is Clete attuned to me?\" \"Catnip \" \"What!?\" \"Having you around makes us all happy. Your presence makes him purr.\" \"Because of you.\" \"Some, but a lot of it's you. You radiate warmth and caring. It delights him. I'm going to tell you how much.\" Dutch 'tracked' Clete and moved fast. He wanted to find him before he started hunting for them to find out what was wrong. \"Come on, Clete.\" \"Where to, Dutch?\" \"Down the beach a ways. You're about to make some friends. Lane sent me.\" \"Oh. All right.\" \"I'm going to take you where you're going and take off. I have some friends of my own to make.\" \"This is all rather mysterious.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"Dutch, you're hurting.\" \"Yeah. A bit. I'm going to find somebody to help make it go away. You've stopped purring. First time I was ever sorry my teeth weren't rattling. There are your friends. Later.\" \"Hello, I'm Talla. What has you puzzled and worried?\" \"My brother. He just led me here and said make friends. He's hurting and didn't tell me why. My other brother is sad too. NO! Not... Oh, Lane, I'm not ready.\" \"Peli! Tiva! Help me! Oh, such pain! Such sadness. His loss is too great. Help me comfort him.\" They cradled him and cried with him. They shared the story that had pained Sabbi so deeply. They held Clete as Lane held Sabbi, helping ease the pain by sharing it. Dutch hadn't been so lucky. Two girls found him curled on the ground crying. \"Please, let us help you.\" \"It'll pass. I'll be all right. I'm sorry. I know I'm hurting you.\" \"Yes, you are hurting us. Stop being foolish and let us help us all feel better. Lethe, what shall we do with him?\" \"Make him forget about it, Dida. We know how.\" \"Yes. Oh! I've shocked him. That wasn't what I had in mind at all.\" \"You're children!\" \"No. Not on this world. We know the way it was. It must be different now. Come on, Lethe. He'll get over the silliness. Tell us your name.\" \"Dutch. Stop! You don't know what you're doing!\" \"Oh, Dutch! We know exactly what we're doing. Lethe, he's beautiful.\" \"All right, I believe you! You know what you're doing. Now, stop it!\" \"Dida, kiss him, then he'll stop shouting. Oh! That's better. His mind is still protesting, but his body is most definitely not.\" Dutch surrendered. He didn't really have a choice in the matter. The two empaths felt his response to every touch, each caress. He moaned as Lane's passion suddenly burned through the link he had with his brothers. When Clete caught fire, he was lost. Suddenly, there were more of them. Dozens of them. Touching him. Loving him. He knew when Clete loosed the tight hold he kept on his passion. The world caught fire. The moons were rising when he began to think coherently. He was surrounded by children. \"Stop that! You're embarrassed. Just stop it! No one of us is a child. Children don't respond. You're on our world. We'll show you again we're not children.\" Dutch started to laugh. He was used to the intimacy of sharing his brothers' passion. Lane had landed him on a world where all shared that intimacy. He was trying to impose his values in a place they just didn't work. The age of adulthood was different. There was no struggling with misunderstood feelings. No fears of being different or unliked. No loneliness. No frightening adolescence. It was still a struggle not think of those around him as children, but his reason told him they were adults. There didn't seem to be any nudity taboos either. \"Ooh, your skin is so white in the moonslight. And so soft. Especially, here... and here. You're shocked again. You're just going to have to get over that. I'm Teli and I just won't stand for it. I'm going to stop it right now.\" \"Teli! Leave him alone. There are lots of silly taboos where he comes from and you're breaking dozens of them. You're being mean! This is more than cultural. He just doesn't want you. He's totally hetero. You aren't going to change it.\" \"You're right, Dida. I'm sorry, Dutch. I wasn't paying attention to what you were really feeling. You're just so beautiful, I got carried away. I hope we can be friends. All right! I'm forgiven. Too bad though, I'd really--\" \"Teli!\" \"Yeah, yeah. Behave myself. I'm going for a swim. Anybody else?\" \"We'll all go. Come on, Dutch. Teli will be good. I promise. If not, I'll get mad.\" \"Oh, I'll be good. The last time Dida got mad at me, my head rang for a fiveday. I felt singed for twenty. Half my friends wouldn't talk to me. When Dida gets mad, everbody gets singed.\" \"I've got a brother like that.\" \"We noticed your brother. Everyone on the planet noticed your brother. We're still noticing him. What is he doing? My teeth feel... \" \"Like they're rattling. Yeah, I know. Do you know what a cat is, Dida? Do you have an animal... How do I explain it? It's just Clete. He's content. He's purring. It drives me crazy!\" They laughed and pulled him toward the sea. He looked around for things, but couldn't find them. He gave it up as hopeless. When on Tenepeth... He hadn't been skinny-dipping in a warm sea in a long time. \"Hello, Dutch. Nice night.\" \"It would be if you'd stop rattling my teeth!\" \"I can't help it. You know I can't.\" \"This is obviously your brother, Clete.\" \"Yes. Clete, this is Dida. You're making her teeth rattle too.\" \"Oh, sorry. I really wish I knew how to stop it. It... just happens.\" \"Don't worry about it. Oh, my. You're huge. Everywhere.\" \"Uh, Dutch, they're kids.\" \"No, Clete, they're not. Believe me. They're just small adults. I've gotten a very long lecture about it. And a rather effective demonstra-- CLETE!\" \"Dutch, she's making me warm. Very warm.\" \"Hi. I'm Lethe. That's just Dida. She makes everybody warm, but not as warm as you do. You are the most magnificent male I have ever seen. Go away Teli. This one's the same.\" \"Not fair!\" \"Dutch, I'm going to have real problems in this place. How long did... Lane say we're... staying?\" \"About two more days.\" Clete groaned and Dutch laughed. They had a too-good time for the two days, but they learned a great deal too. Dutch 'won' his battle with himself to accept what he knew was the truth of the culture, but Clete knew he was still working on it a bit when Lane was saying farewell to Sabbi. \"I suppose I didn't really get over it til I found out Dida was a mother, Dutch. It helped when I met Carva.\" \"Nothing like having a seventy-year-old patriarch treat them as adults to make it easier to accept them as such. Clete, we've got to ask Lane some things.\" \"Like what, Dutch?\" \"Tiva didn't seem to have any doubts about you and I fathering children on her world. The gestation period is about right and the physiology is similar.\" \"Well, two hearts is a start. Helen got help. Decided before I married her. Just made up her mind and got medical assistance.\" \"Like my mom. 'I want a baby. You're going to be the father.' Clete, I want to know. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I've never even thought about it before. And they're so young.\" \"Do you know how old Dida was?\" \"Not old enough.\" \"You're wrong. They're a small people. You got a lecture because she thought you needed it. She made me promise not to tell you til we left.\" \"Tell me what?\" \"Dutch, Dida has three children. The oldest is four. She's twenty-three. Not one of those kids was under eighteen. They mature fairly slowly. Puberty hits between seventeen and eighteen. Tiva's in her thirties.\" Dutch started to laugh. She'd told him children didn't respond. He hadn't asked her at what age they stopped being children. She'd told him her world was different and he'd forced himself to accept it, but he hadn't really understood it. He'd still thought of them as being the same. No wonder she'd been surprised at his shock. He hadn't explained he came from a place where puberty began at twelve or thirteen, in many people. Some even younger. He realized communication was more than just being able to speak and understand the language. \"Hi. That was really hard to do. I don't suppose saying... I can't even say the word. I couldn't even say farewell. I ended up with, 'See you soon.' It'll never get easier, but I will see her again fairly soon. Now ask me.\" \"Lane, will any of those women on Tenepeth bear our children?\" \"I don't know.\" \"TERRIFIC!\" \"Easy, Dutch. I don't. They don't really know either. Paternity isn't really important to them. Every child is loved and needed. If a male and female pairbond, they take her children and seven or eight more and set up a household. Your friend Teli was pairbonded. He just saw you as a very attractive, non-threatening, diversion. He wasn't interested in the women. He has a heterosexual mate. They'll probably find another male to bond with eventually, since he seems to be so inclined.\" \"But he was on the beach with us.\" \"So was she. I doubt you were exactly aware of what was going on around you. Why do you think Sabbi and I were left alone?\" \"Because you were pairbonded.\" \"Exactly. You and Clete weren't. Teli is nearly as old as we are. Pairbonding doesn't usually take place until the mid twenties. Sometimes never.\" \"That explains what Dida said about you, Dutch.\" \"What did she say?\" \"You stirred her too much. She stayed away from you because you would not be ready when she was. You might never be. I was safer. I had been mated.\" \"Tenepethans bond for life, Dutch. If one of them dies, they never bond again. That's why Carva didn't have a mate. Once in a while a bond forms one way. It's a sad thing. One loving the other and knowing that one does not love in return. Only responsive to one person and that person wanting more. It's less common than a three-way bond. Dida was falling in love with you, so she turned to Clete to stop the process. I hope it worked.\" \"Lane, don't you ever get me into something like that again! There's a woman I may have injured and children who may be mine. And I won't ever know. Don't let it happen again!\" \"Dutch, it had to be. You had to grow up sometime. You're a heartbreaker. Women have fallen in love with you before. You never even noticed. Just kissed them goodby and went on your merry way. Now maybe you'll think about it before you turn on the charm and fill some poor girl with dreams she learns, the hard way, won't come true. Humans don't usually bond for life. If a heart breaks, it mends and loves again. Usually. And you're too different biologically to father children unless a woman seeks help. You don't catch or carry diseases. Tenepeth was for you. Clete was something that helped them, but you were the reason we were there. I could have taken Sabbi to other places that were good examples. I won't do it again. I won't have to. You'll accept responsibility for your actions. Oh, sometimes women will fall in love with you and you'll hurt them. It happens to Dad. But you'll never just blithely ignore their feelings again.\" \"I do, don't I? Assume they're into having a good time just like I am and never look deeper.\" \"Dutch, most of them are. You just have to notice when it gets beyond that point. Ask Clete why Riss just suddenly disappeared. He knows. Even in the midst of his falling in love, he felt her pain when she said, 'Well, Dutch, it's been fun,' and walked off. I saw it too.\" \"And I didn't. Damn. I feel like a complete heel.\" \"You aren't or you wouldn't feel like one. You'll always love women, and they'll always love you. Don't stop charming them and loving them. Just be aware if you're hurting them and be gentle.\" \"Thanks, Lane. I learned a lot of lessons on Tenepeth. I want to go back there someday. But not until Dida's bonded.\" \"Did you have to do that? Oh!\" \"Do what? What did I do?\" \"Decide to go back. Lord, what a mess. Well, it's not that bad. The answer is you think so. Some of the kids are pretty big, but you don't ask Clete to check. In their culture, it's just not important and it's a very healthy one for kids.\" \"Yes, Lane, I got that part of the lesson too.\" \"I was sure you had. Let's go fishing. I'm in the mood for Rocky Mountain trout and the smell of pines.\" \"Good idea. Let's go. Clete, get your hip boots on. Fresh fish tonight.\" The last evening of the fishing trip, Clete suddenly looked up from cleaning up after dinner. \"Dutch, you're tense. What's wrong?\" \"I don't know. I feel watched. Icy breath on the back of my neck. A feeling of... being plotted against. Evil intent. Directed at us, Clete. Lane, do you see anything? Any changes?\" \"No. Fishing trip is over. We're headed for the future to explore. We find interesting people and places. We head back and I take Sabbi to the winter formal. Nothing new. Including this conversation. It... isn't there.\" \"Let's finish cleaning our cooking area and get going. This forest just doesn't feel as friendly as it did.\" \"Done. I'll load the fishing gear. You put the fire out. Lane, lay in the coordinates. I'm ready to get out of here too. Dutch? Dutch?\" \"Like laughter. Cold and mocking.\" \"Lane, get the fire. I'm going to get him in.\" \"Got it. Out. Place looks good. Damn. Here, give me the gear. Clete?\" \"Yeah. I've got him. Push. He's not moving.\" \"What? Oh. We're ready. Good. Let's get out of here. Why are you two pushing me?\" \"Because you stopped moving. Inside fast. Lane and I want away. Whatever you're picking up, we don't like it either. Door closed. Better?\" \"Yeah. Still feel... wary. Lane, get us on our way.\" \"Coordinates in. We're gone.\" They sat and talked for awhile and Dutch relaxed. The fire and the feel of home lulled them. They went to bed settled and comfortable. Clete jerked awake with Lane's raging loss burning through him. Suddenly, Dutch was enraged, then shocked cold. He ran for Dutch' s room and pulled Lane off him and held him as he screamed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?! SHE'S GONE!! YOU CHANGED IT!! SHE'S GONE!!\" \"CLETE, I ALMOST KILLED HIM! HE WAS AT MY THROAT! I ALMOST KILLED HIM!\" \"SHUT UP!! Damn!\" Clete slugged Lane. He couldn't hold him. He was incoherent and wild. He dropped him and grabbed Dutch. He was collapsing in near hysteria. \"Easy. Easy. You were under attack and you weren't awake. Dutch, you weren't even fighting him.\" \"I couldn't. I almost killed him in the first instant. I was afraid to. I was afraid I'd kill him. He couldn't have known what he was doing or I'd be dead. What happened, Clete? What did he mean?\" \"Come on. Let's get to neutral ground. I'm going to drop him in the pool. If he doesn't wake up, we'll have to pull him out. I'm going to hang onto him until he's coherent. I want you to help.\" \"I can't. Clete, I nearly killed him.\" \"YOU SAID THAT BEFORE!! NOW MOVE!!\" Clete shook him. It was a very dangerous thing to do. Dutch was nearly as wild as Lane had been. He sighed in relief when the crazed look went out of his eyes and he nodded. \"Good. 'She' can only be Sabbi. Let's find out what happened.\" \"He thought I'd made a change, Clete. Made a decision that took her from him. He's still going to think that when he wakes up.\" \"Did you?\" \"No. Nothing. I've been searching my mind for something I might have done subconsciously. There's nothing there. Except... \" \"Except what?\" \"The memory of mocking laughter.\" \"Dutch, we've been attacked. Personally. And very badly injured. A healing trance won't cure this. Get in the pool. I'll drop him in and be right behind you.\" \"I don't... All right. Do it.\" Dutch grabbed Lane and shoved him against the wall. The shock of the cold water brought him to. Clete jumped in and they held him as he started to fight. \"Lane! He didn't do it! Dutch didn't do it! Dutch didn't change things! Easy. Easy. Now tell us. Tell us, Lane. Dutch didn't make a change. You said there was one. Tell us.\" \"I... I woke up with my head spinning with change. Real deep change. I couldn't do anything but lay there and wait for it to clear. When it did, she was gone. My life with Sabbi was gone. No home. No love. Gone. I guess I went a little crazy.\" \"No, you went a lot crazy. Do you remember trying to kill Dutch?\" \"I... No. Yes. I guess. I wanted him to change it back. To make him... bring her back.\" \"Lane, I didn't make any changes. None. Not even subconsciously. You've been attacked. We've been attacked. What I felt in the forest. It has to be.\" \"We've been hurt. Bad. Not just you. All of us. And it was set up well. Your long future memory came back just in time for your meeting with her. Just in time for you to see a future and have it ripped away. You nearly killed Dutch. He nearly killed you. The attack came close to completely destroying us. It nearly defeated us with one stroke. We were totally defenseless against it. We love her too. If she's gone from your life, she's gone from ours, Dutch's, mine and my son's. If one of you had killed the other, could that one have lived with it? Could I? It knocked us down, but we can get up.\" \"You're right. Oh, Clete. Your son. I only saw my pain, my emptiness. I'm sorry. Dutch--\" \"You don't even need to say it. Let's get out of here. I'm shivering and I'm not even sure I'm cold.\" \"Reaction. I'll get towels. Sorry about the punch, Lane. I couldn't think of anything else to do.\" \"It's probably the only thing you could do. A week in a healing trance should make my jaw feel normal again.\" \"Weak humor, but better. Here. Hand up. Towel. Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. I'm weak in the knees. They feel like jelly.\" \"Let's go to the kitchen. I'm ordering cocoa with something in it for us all. I'm wobbly too. Adrenaline reaction. Things went crazy in a hurry. Come on, Lane.\" Clete and Dutch each put an arm around Lane and guided him to the kitchen. Clete got them both down at the table and fixed them a hot drink. Both were shivering. He put a bit of liqueur in the cocoa and sat down with them. \"Drink. Let's talk. Something out there is out to get us. It made a change. I don't know if we can unmake it, but we can try.\" \"No, Clete. I don't think we can. It changed something and I think we're stuck with it.\" \"Why not, Lane? Why can't we change it?\" \"Because Sabbi's going to marry someone else. Elope. She's very sorry, but I was so romantic she thought she was in love with me. As soon as she met him, she realized she was wrong. Maybe that's true. Maybe she was always supposed to marry him and the real attack came when I fell in love with her. He's a nice guy. He'll make her a wonderful husband. A builder. Widower with two kids. Wants to build her dream for her. We'll see them again. Won't be long for us, but about twenty years for them. He'll build it. Clete, they offer to give your son a home.\" \"No. We'll find another way. Tell them thanks for offering.\" \"I will. Let's get this over with. I want it done. This round to the enemy. Score one zip.\" \"Wrong, Lane. We're ahead on points. This just feels worse. It was a knockdown. Almost a knockout. It's the first round we've lost and it was a hit below the belt. We fight fair. We always will. It doesn't. Doesn't know how. Wouldn't want to. That's why it's the enemy.\" \"You're right, Dutch. Definitely below the belt. At least we don't have to take turns in the swimming pool.\" Dutch and Clete laughed. Soon Lane joined in. It was weak and edged with hysteria, but it was laughter. \"Now what? What did you mean you wanted to get it over with?\" \"I'm setting the coordinates to go back to see Sabbi, Dutch. Let her tell me goodby.\" \"Lane, we could go back and get her right after we left her. Stop her from meeting him. Make a change.\" \"No, Dutch, that would be using its methods. We don't do that. You don't do that. But thanks for offering. I'll survive. Like Clete, I'll have some wonderful memories. They aren't enough, but they're what I have. I'm going to set the coordinates. Clete, would you make us another drink and bring it to the living room? I don't feel much like sleeping.\" \"Done. Go on, Dutch. Keep him company. He'll want to be alone later, but right now he needs us.\" Clete fixed more cocoa with the mint liqueur and carried it to the living room. They sat and watched the fire in silence until Lane went to dress. Clete decided he didn't want him going alone and Dutch agreed. They dressed and were waiting for him when he returned. \"I want to go to the door alone, but I'd like you with me as far as the lift to her apartment. She's moving out. You'll meet him. He'll know who you are. Clete, he hurts for me, but he loves her. You'll feel it. Let's go.\" They walked with him as far as the building lobby and waited. A fellow carrying a chair came out of the lift Lane had taken up. \"Hi, I'm Mike Renfield. Damn, this is awkward. Look, I... \" \"It's all right, Mike. We love her too. Take good care of her.\" \"She's an impossible dream come true. I really do love her. You're Clete, right? I don't know how I could have gotten so lucky. She's right. I'd have known you guys anywhere. Rose called you the three most beautiful men there are. Hair like that. She said the big strawberry blond was Clete. Lane was the one with hair like moonlight and Dutch's was of spun gold. Supposed to tell you Snow White will see you in her dreams, Dutch. I don't think she quite knows what Sabbi sees in a chubby fellow like me without enough hair to cover. Neither do I. I'm babbling. Sorry.\" \"That's all right, Mike. We understand. Let me help you with that chair.\" \"Nah, I'll get it. You wait for your brother. The chair doesn't need you.\" Dutch watched Mike struggle through the door with the chair, then turned back to the lift. They both knew Lane was coming down. \"Lane was right, Clete, a nice guy.\" \"And he does love her. Feels real... almost ashamed about hurting Lane.\" \"Yes, and he'll be with her more than I would have been. Let's go.\" \"You all right, Lane?\" \"No, Dutch, but I'll limp along. One more hurdle.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"Yeah, Mike. I know. We'll stop by in about twenty years to look at how you make her dreams come true.\" \"I'll do it, Lane. I really will. Oh, oh, here come the kids. Ice cream everywhere.\" \"Here, take my handkerchief. We'll see you when you've built her dream. Good-by.\" \"Good-by, Lane. I hope... Well, you know.\" \"Yeah. I know.\" Lane shook his hand and they walked away from where he was laughing and wiping ice cream off the faces of two pretty little girls. \"Take me to a bar. A loud, obnoxious, beer and whiskey bar. Several of them. Get me drunk and in a half dozen brawls. I promise I won't break anyone. No one will break me either. Unfortunately, that's already been done. I want a lady who's not one on each arm and one in my lap. I want to pass out sometime tomorrow and not dream. I want to wake up with such a bad hangover I can't think. Then I want to laugh at the thing that laughed at us. Dutch, I know where we're going. Adith. Pirates. Bad ones. Insane. The enemy is there. Got a strong hold on them.\" \"Sounds like it needs to be changed. Let's do it.\" \"I found a bar. A whole bunch of them. I can feel the wildness.\" \"Lead on, Clete. The three Gallant boys are going to cut loose.\" \"Done.\"",

      "content": "Chapter One \"That one?\" \"Yes, My Lord. A pretty thing.\" \"Yes, and he seems to have more spirit than the others. Do you suppose it's their long lives that make them weak?\" \"They call themselves civilized. I find them boring. They live millennia and never live at all. Lord, the instruments say his mind is worth harnessing.\" \"Excellent. Buy him.\" \"He is expensive. He's the scion of one of their great houses.\" \"Very nice. I've never owned a king before. I think I'll just take the one. He will fill all three roles. That should make Lord Rorisk take note.\" \"A charming idea. He'll require intense physical training. It will reduce his useful time in the mind/comp link.\" \"And enhance his beauty. A fair trade. Stim him.\" \"Temporary?\" \"No. In fact, give him all four of the stimulation's. Let's see if they work on this weak-willed race.\" \"Do you wish the experiment documented?\" \"Of course. Wipe his name carefully, Demisk.\" \"And what shall I put in its place?\" \"Nothing. Leave him nameless. Leave his knowledge of his station among his people, if possible.\" \"A nameless, wanton, king. My Lord, you have a wonderful humor.\" **** \"Gallant.\" He moaned softly in his sleep. She had come again. \"Take heart, Gallant. You will free them all. Learn, my gallant one. Do all they ask. Build for them. That which they seek is their destruction and freedom for this world. Build. Come to me.\" He awoke in desperate need of her. The emptiness she left, he could only suffer. He carefully hid the name she called him. He would not share the gift she had given until his people were free. He grasped her promise of freedom and fought to stay alive. He heard them coming again. \"Well, Demisk?\" \"Amazing! He's stronger! My Lord, none of the others have been successful. He's the only one that's lived through the first stim.\" \"I've made several large wagers he'll survive all four. Give him his reward for surviving. Document it carefully. I'll show the record at the banquet.\" \"Take him to room three. How many, Lord?\" \"Ten of the stimmed oriki. Hungry ones.\" He lowered his fevered body into the swirling waters of the pool set in one corner of the room. The chain on the collar he wore was just long enough to reach it. A reward for surviving? What were oriki? What were the multitude of holographic lenses set in the walls and ceiling to record? He hated the collar and its chain. He wondered if they knew. He'd never hated before the stim. He smiled softly. It was probably a side effect. Side effects were dangerous. He intended they learn the fact well. \"Hello, pretty thing. Come out of the pool.\" \"I'd rather not.\" \"We are in need of you. Won't you aid us?\" \"Who are you?\" \"We are women of the oriki. Help us.\" \"I'm currently not much help to myself.\" \"Oh, but you will be of great aid to us. Come.\" He really didn't have any choice. Three of the women were pulling on the chain on his collar. There were ten of them. They were quite beautiful; long dark hair, large green eyes, and skin of pale aqua. He didn't understand what was happening to his body. It must be due to the stim. One of the women touched him. \"Please, I don't understand what's happening. Please, don't touch me.\" \"Foolish boy, you are a slave. As are we. You have no choices.\" **** \"Where did you find him?\" \"In the market.\" \"Then he's of high rank. Responds well.\" \"He's been stimmed, Rorisk.\" \"Stimmed?! Hensk, none of these soft people survive stim.\" \"This one has. It's fully documented. I'll arrange a private showing for you.\" \"Hensk, you're after a favor. What is it?\" \"I'm going to enter him in the combats, if he survives the entire set of stims. I want your trainer to teach him.\" \"Leave him while I watch the documentation. If he survives, I'll lend you my trainer.\" \"Demisk, have him prepared for Lord Rorisk.\" **** \"He has potential, Master Demisk.\" \"My lord believes so. He has survived all the stims.\" \"Good. Too often, I'm given ones to train that have only had the body stimmed. Combat is as much of the mind. Do I have his full time, or is he in other use?\" \"He is, but my lord will reduce his link time with the computers to three hours per day during his training.\" \"Reduce?! How much is he on now?\" \"Twenty-two hours. He is given four of rest.\" \"He may be interesting to train. I ask the lord schedule his link time with regularity. It will aid his training.\" \"He has already done so. You have him but the first three hours of the day.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk. Good. Now that he's gone, let's get acquainted. Do you have a name?\" \"No. It was taken.\" \"Sounds like Hensk. Been pretty heavily used, haven't you, boy?\" \"Since I haven't had a chance to compare notes with anyone, I've got no basis to judge, but I definitely have been busy.\" \"Hold still. I'm going to look you over. Now, now, don't tense. I won't hurt... Oh, I see. A blush. You've not been broken by it. You'll learn control.\" \"That would be much appreciated. Just once I'd like to... \" \"Not respond to every touch instantly.\" \"It would be pleasant not to have my body temperature rise at a tap on the shoulder.\" \"And if I teach you to fight, what will you do?\" \"Fight.\" \"Yes, you'll do.\" They became friends. The old trainer had been seeking someone like him for a very long time. He held his dream of freedom in his heart and trained the boy. Lord Hensk had made an error. He had created a hero. The old trainer would teach him to be a warrior. **** \"What effect did the last three stims have on you?\" \"None that I could tell. No, one. I'm faster, but that may be due to the training. \"Yes. I don't think any of them worked. Well, the first lowered your thresholds, but that's all. Have you always been different from the rest of your people? \"Trainer, I am a child. I don't know. I have no other children to compare myself with, though I know I am quite large for my age.\" \"A child?\" \"Yes, I am but... I do not know my years, but perhaps I can give you information which is useful to you. Ah, I know. The first stim. It nearly killed me. I was far too young to have sexual maturity forced on me.\" \"You were prepubescent?!\" \"Very. At what age does your species mature?\" \"About fourteen.\" \"Then I was a child of... This is difficult. I lost so much when my name was taken. I am of a great house. None would have spoken to me without my name and title and the taking of it... I know that I am very young. Perhaps, between twenty and thirty. In comparison with your people... physically nine or ten. I had no body hair until the stim. I'm still a bit smug about it.\" \"Oh, my son, the cruelty of what was done to you makes me ache.\" \"Don't. There's already too much pain around me.\" \"Boy, I've seen the documentation of the first stim.\" \"That was an interesting experience. I had no idea what those women wanted.\" \"It didn't take you long to learn.\" \"I learn fast. Trainer, I like this weapon. Its simplicity... attracts me.\" \"The staff? Yes, I like it too. A simple wooden shaft. Boy, I can't pretend to teach you longer. You know all I know.\" \"Thank you. I'll use it well.\" \"You know I won't return. My master is already unhappy he gave Hensk my use.\" \"Strange. At the time, he seemed to feel your use for mine was a fair exchange.\" \"Lean near. When you destroy them, let me kill Rorisk for what he did to you.\" He smiled at his only friend. \"I love you too. And I promise I'll remember. Thank you.\" **** \"Master, the direct mind link obstructs my work.\" \"In what way?\" \"It tells me the lord seeks the impossible. I know it is incorrect. I can vision it, but in the link, I know the vision is incorrect. I ask to use the physical station. I cannot override the computational limits while the matrices hold my mind.\" \"The link has been known to limit creativity. I will put your request to the lord.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk.\" \"He is pleased with you. Your sweep of the combats has made him the envy of his peers. They have requested you be provided at tonight's banquet. Entertain them well. Go to the preparation chamber. The attendants await you. Now, boy!\" \"Yes, Master.\" He ran to the chamber. He'd hesitated. That kind of mistake could cost him his life. \"Entertain them\" meant Rorisk was coming. He was so close to the answer. He had to get out of the link. He didn't intend his master to have what he would build. Or, not all of what he would build. The link would give him away, note the discrepancy in his request. She had come again and told him to build the twelve plus one. The plus-one was to be his. The attendants prepared him and he learned he had been right. Rorisk was at the banquet. \"He doesn't respond as well.\" \"Rorisk, he was fresh stimmed. Although, it may be the link. It is draining.\" \"Better. It just took a bit. How much time does he spend in it?\" \"Twenty-two per day.\" \"That's twice recommended!\" \"Yes, but other than slowing his response, it's had no ill effects. I have him on project three. I expect results within a twelveday.\" \"If you get them, you'll get a ministry.\" \"I'd get one eventually without it. I'm more interested in the project itself. I need a very rare element to complete it. I wish an interview with your uncle.\" \"The emperor?! You must be very sure you'll succeed.\" \"This one is. Aren't you, boy.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Hensk, project three is a dream. No one really expects it to be completed. The tools don't exist.\" \"You are touching the tool I created to build it. His mind is like no other. Before the stim, he was over the tenth rank of intelligence.\" \"OVER! Impossible! Nothing in existence is over the tenth rank.\" \"He is. On both scales, physical and mental. Unique in the universe. Are you pleased to know that, boy?\" \"No, Lord Master.\" \"Why not?\" \"It means I am alone.\" \"Very good. Yes, without another of your kind, but I shall solve that for you. I'm having females of your species prepared. You wish to speak?\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Speak.\" \"There are no females of my species. My Lord Master has told me I am unique.\" \"Very good. Very good. Consider yourself as being bred to another species.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" **** \"I will return, Kirel.\" \"From the photosphere of a star? And if you do succeed, why would you come back? You could be free.\" \"And leave my children?\" \"Are they yours? They're not like you. They're merely children of my race. You've never even seen them. They're just a few among many. A failed breeding. You couldn't find them if you searched.\" \"Then I will claim all children as mine.\" \"You'll claim nothing. You're a nameless slave. Haven't the ten years you've been one taught you anything?\" \"Yes. They've taught me patience.\" **** \"Hensk, you're a fool. He'll never return.\" \"Wrong, Rorisk. He thinks he has children here. He believes, if he succeeds, I'll give them to him.\" \"And he has no children?\" \"None. He's not mature yet. The physicians estimate it will be hundreds of years before he's capable of siring offspring. I had them change his genetic structure. His children will ripen far sooner, but it will still be hundreds of years before he sires them. The first thing I shall do with project three is collect them. Perhaps, I'll give them to him. Did your uncle grant my request?\" \"Yes. Five point two akits of the element will be sent to you. In return, he will receive eleven of the machines.\" \"I shall need only one. Did he speak of his plans for them?\" \"Yes. He'll use them to direct the evolution of the recalcitrant worlds.\" \"Excellent. The yumari are beautiful. I shall enjoy having them as obedient slaves.\" \"His thought exactly. When we decide we want them, they'll surrender without a struggle. He's already chosen his agents.\" \"The priests of Denskarra?\" \"Hensk, you astound me. Yes, the dark brothers. They have pledged to do as he requests in this galaxy if he gives them freedom to do as they wish in the others.\" \"The servants of the Dark One will cleanse the universe of life. I am not sure I trust them to allow life in this one.\" \"He pointed out, if they destroyed it here, they would not exist and would be unable to cleanse it elsewhere.\" \"Our emperor is a wise and devious man.\" \"Yes. My uncle serves the Dark One well.\" **** \"Lord Master, the time ships are complete.\" \"You wish a reward. Speak it.\" \"I ask for my children, Lord Master.\" \"With this ship, I have the power to grant your request. You have no children in this time. So I shall find them in another and bring them to you. You are a nameless slave. Your children shall be the same.\" \"NO!\" He broke free of his guards and ran. He heard Hensk's laughter mocking him. Slaves could not escape. There was nowhere to escape to. He ran by the keyboard and triggered the mechanism. He had little time before it engaged. He dove into the corner and laughed, as he closed the matrix. He had an escape. The thirteenth ship formed around him. Now to free a world and distract the dark brothers. The mechanism engaged. The oldest race stepped from their suddenly opened cells and walked away from the guards holding useless weapons. The power satellites were torches in the sky. The densk fled the crumbling city. Fled to ships that would not fly. The one they had been given to free them had completed his task. They were really very proud of him. They hadn't expected him to accomplish it for several hundred years. The child had freed his foster parents while still an infant. The slaves of other races extracted revenge. An old man happily told Rorisk why he was strangling him. The densk disappeared from the planet. One scream at a time. When they were gone, the elder race sent four to restore the ships. The freed of other races had transport home. They would free their worlds. All that would remain of the servants of the Dark One that had infested their galaxy were the eleven priests and the one lord. The child would keep them from inflicting great harm. They tapped the energy source he had created and engaged the great defenses that had been awaiting it. They reached into the mind of the child with the key they had been given and freed his powers. **** \"Gallant, you are not forever alone. I await beyond time. You will find my aspects, but you must search. Each will give you love, but you will leave two and one shall leave you. They do not know I am within them. I await you. My fathers love you. Look for me. Know me by my name. Athena.\" \"ATHENA!\" He awoke at the sound of his own shout. He pulled himself to the console. He must complete the ship. The formless space around him was dizzying. He began programming a reality within it. He wanted much more than he had given the other twelve ships he'd created. He wondered if those who had them would ever realize he had deliberately made them small, boxy, and very noisy. Would they ever know infinity lay behind the noisy walls of the inaccessible engine room? The thought of Hensk trying to sleep in the tiny cabin with the roar of the engines ringing in his ears pleased him. He poured his dreams into the program. All the rooms he'd dreamed. All the gardens he'd only imagined. All the laboratories, studios, pools, the libraries and the banks and banks of computer storage he would someday fill. He gave his ship an exterior reality, then built the program to dematerialize it to land. He smiled. He doubted any of the twelve in the timeships he'd built would look beyond to see what the power to dematerialize truly meant. He laughed when he noticed he'd found a way to create little pockets of timelessness. They'd be very handy. He began programming the life support structure and gravity. He'd found he didn't care for weightlessness. He entered the last command. The ship would gather information from all available sources. He leapt onto the console. It would be the only stable item. Even the floor, chair, and bubble of atmosphere he'd created would be changed. He leaned down and tapped the pad to run the program. He wandered through the ship. He kept getting lost. He loved it. His existence had been limited to a corridor of cells, an arena, link room, preparation room and Hensk's banquet halls. He vaguely remembered wide streets and green lands. He tried to remember his mother, but no image would come. He had one clear memory of learning at a station and a man's smile and nod he had done well. He knew he was very young and from a great house, but that was all. Hensk had taken his name, and with it, every voice that had ever spoken it. **** \"Hey! You're stepping on my tulips!\" \"Oh! I'm sorry. I was looking at--\" \"Whoa! Are you all right?\" \"I really doubt it. Can you understand me?\" \"That's a very strange question. Of course I can. Look you'd better sit down. Here. Lawn chair. Would a glass of water help?\" \"Thank you, Mistress.\" \"You sit right there and I'll go in and get you one.\" Julie sighed as she walked into the house. An angel had just tromped her tulips, swayed dizzily when she spoke to him, then been totally amazed when she offered him a chair and a glass of water. Typical Saturday in LA. Too bad he was on something. When she carried the water out, he was staring down at the city from the middle of her tulip bed again. \"You're in my tulips.\" \"I've been very careful not to step on them. It's murky. Smells awful.\" \"The air or the water?\" \"The air, but I think the water may qualify as well.\" \"Out of towner. Tourist?\" \"Definitely.\" \"Yeah, the LA smog is pretty intense the first time. You get used to it. Today's not bad. Pretty good onshore flow.\" \"You've got to be joking! The hydrocarbon by-products are absolutely noxious! Fossil fuel?\" \"You're beginning to make me nervous.\" \"Probably not half as nervous as I am. I'm sorry. I'll leave. Your tulips attracted me, then I saw the view... Yes, I should definitely leave. Would you answer one more very strange question? What's the name of this world?\" \"You're the most gorgeous man I've ever seen and you're crazy. Just my luck. The world is Earth. Now go before your keepers tromp my tulips trying to catch you.\" \"Yes, I should get back to my ship. She'll have most of the information I need by now. Thank you for your kindness, Lady.\" \"Hold it. You're bleeding.\" \"Yes, but it's minor. One of the dark brothers found me too far from my ship. It's the first time I ever made that mistake. I shall not make it again.\" \"Sit down. I'll clean it up. Who'd you run into? One of the Bloods? I've seen them in the neighborhood.\" \"Bloods?\" \"Gangs. Where are you from, anyway?\" \"Somehow, I doubt you'd believe me.\" \"Try me.\" \"Well, I'm eight galaxies and several hundred years from my home world.\" \"You're right. I don't believe you. That knock on the head shook something loose. I'll probably be sorry I did this, but come inside and I'll get you... What are you doing?\" \"Listening. RUN! Don't argue!\" He grabbed her hand, then scooped her up and carried her. They'd found him already. Somehow, they were tracking him. He dodged the beam fire and ran for his ship. The Earth girl was hardly a hindrance. She was very light. He thanked the Powers he hadn't locked his ship. He ran through the door, slammed it and dematerialized. Since they were tracking him, it made no sense to leave. \"LOOK OUT!\" He spun and saw the girl on the back of the hooded figure of a dark brother. She'd saved his life. Now he needed to save hers. She'd kept the brother from using his weapon, but she was merely a temporary hindrance. He ran to aid her. When the dark one struck her, something happened inside him. He screamed in rage and killed it. He began to shake in reaction and shock. Julie was kind of surprised she woke up. The guy in the hood didn't look like he was going to. Necks didn't bend like that. She realized she was hearing whimpering. Soft, terrified, crying. It was her angel. He was curled in a corner. \"Shh. It's all right. You got him. He can't hurt us now.\" \"I... I killed him. I didn't intend it, but he hit you. I lost control. He really didn't have a chance. He was helpless and I killed him.\" \"Helpless?! He was trying very hard to fry you with that gun! If I hadn't yelled, he'd have succeeded! You saved your life and probably mine! You've... never killed anything before, have you? Nothing.\" \"I've never seen anything die.\" \"I hope I wake up and find out this is all pepperoni pizza. Look, I'm Julie. What's your name.\" \"I haven't got one. They took it.\" She decided to call it pepperoni pizza and get on with it. It was either that or have screaming meemies. \"Who took it?\" \"The Lord Master's servants. He never allowed me to have one. It pleased him to use me nameless.\" \"All right. From the top. Where are we?\" \"My ship.\" \"And where did you get the ship?\" \"I built it. I built all the ships.\" \"Who did you build the ships for?\" \"My master. It was my labor of twelve years.\" \"And who was this master?\" \"Lord Hensk.\" \"The one who took your name? So, why'd you work for him?\" \"The question is meaningless to me?\" \"Why'd you work for some creep that... took your name?\" \"I was too young to wish to die. Nameless ones were only fed if the master remembered to order it. My master usually remembered.\" \"Wait a minute. Are you talking about... slavery?\" \"Yes, but I ended it. I burned out the power satellites. I fed the power of the star I harnessed through them. Without power, weapons would not work and locks would open. The servants of the Dark One could not have stopped my people leaving.\" \"So you started a slave revolt and your people got rid of these servant guys.\" \"No. They would have just left. Although, some of the other imprisoned species may have destroyed them. My trainer wanted to kill his master. Perhaps I am guilty of two deaths. I told him thank you, instead of no.\" \"If you freed them, why didn't you stay?\" \"I had set twelve servants of the Dark One loose in the universe. I decided, if they were chasing me, they'd be too busy to destroy unsuspecting worlds. I must find his ship and destroy it.\" \"I was right the first time. You're an angel. A complete innocent. Well, LA can change that in a hurry. Why am I doing this? Come on. Let's get you some survival skills. Wait a minute. I'm not thinking straight. Where are his friends?\" \"Friends?\" \"Yeah. You know. The ones that took potshots at us on the hill.\" \"Oh, that was him. He just kept landing a few seconds further in the future and trying again, then he went back to the past and laid an ambush in here.\" \"I see. He had a time machine.\" \"That's what the ships are. It's why I have to keep the dark brothers busy.\" She giggled. She just couldn't help it. She was sitting on the floor of a good-size room, that couldn't be in her yard, talking in calm tones about a dead man that hopped around in a time machine, built by an angel, who... Too much. \"All right. Are any more likely to show up?\" \"No. I don't know how he followed me. When I locate his ship, I hope to learn.\" \"OK, let's find his ship. What do you want to do with him?\" \"Leave him. My ship will dispose of him. He is a... contaminant. She'll feel the evil and rid herself of it.\" \"She didn't before.\" \"But he was alive then. He isn't now.\" \"Now stop that. No more crying. Ship, get that thing out of here. WOW! Did I do that?\" \"I think she agreed with you.\" \"I feel like Alice in Wonderland. Come on, little white wabbit. Let's find a ship and then you'll only have eleven chasing you.\" \"I hadn't thought of that. What's a wabbit?\" She had pepperoni pizza delivered. It just seemed appropriate. He loved it. **** \"You have to have a name.\" \"I like Wabbit.\" \"No. That's just between us. Hasn't anyone ever called you anything but--ooh, I hate this-- slave, or boy?\" \"Only in a dream. I once said I would use the name if I freed my world.\" \"Well, don't you think it's time you dusted it off and stuck it on?\" \"Julie, I like this world. Your people have wonderful ways to say things. 'Yo, bro.' 'Hey, dude.' 'What's shakin'?' So many greetings.\" \"The name.\" \"I've never said it before.\" \"And you never will, at this rate. Say it.\" \"Gallant.\" \"Yes! Perfect! It fits you. Belongs. See, you did know your name. OK, Gallant, you've watched four days of TV. You understand the difference between fiction and reality and you have a name. Want to meet some people? Don't look so shocked. I'm dying to show you off. You're an incredible blond hunk. Just one thing. Don't dance slow with anyone but me. Two heartbeats would land you in some government research lab. Probably in pieces.\" \"E.T.\" \"Yeah, E.T. all the way. Did you figure it out? Why we understand each other?\" \"Yes, but I'm afraid to tell you.\" \"Why?\" \"E.T.\" \"Gallant, I doubt you'll send me running to the gov at this point.\" \"I'm a telepath.\" \"Yeah. Makes sense. Why haven't you... read anyone?\" \"That would be very impolite!\" \"Yep. Gallant. Change clothes. Not here! In the bedroom.\" She shook her head and laughed. Carla would never believe she'd stopped a beautiful man from stripping in front of her. She wasn't sure she believed it. It was the innocence. It made him seem like a child. \"Wow! I think I bought those jeans a bit small. They look like they were sprayed on.\" \"They said, 'shrink to fit,' so I used hot water and air to make them smaller. Perhaps I should have stopped after the first wash, but they didn't look like the ones you wear.\" \"Caught. Come on, gorgeous, let's go strut our tight pants.\" **** \"Get away from him, or I'll break your limp wrist.\" \"Ooh, aren't you the possessive one.\" \"Gallant? Hey, you! Come back here a minute!\" \"Look, Missy, I am not… He looks like he's in shock.\" \"I think he was badly abused.\" \"I think you're right. Let's see if this works. Take his hand and gently massage it. See if you can get his attention.\" The rather attractive man sat down on the floor in Gallant's line of sight. It was obviously for a reason. It was going to leave a large dirty smudge on his immaculate white pants. It surprised her a bit when he assumed lotus position and closed his eyes. They were beginning to attract attention. Gallant suddenly blinked and turned to look at her and she sighed in relief. \"Gallant! Are you OK?\" \"Yes. Just a bad memory.\" \"I'm sorry I brought it back. I'm Chuck.\" \"Gallant, tell Chuck he's forgiven.\" \"Forgiven. No, wait. Thank you for the compliment, Chuck, but I like girls.\" \"Thanks, Chuck.\" \"You're more than welcome, Julie. I have a friend to tell her 'technique' worked. I'll have some friends help watch pushy types don't head this way. There are a few.\" \"I like this world.\" \"World?\" \"L.A.'s pretty far out, Chuck. Different world.\" \"Especially this part of it. Julie, the Boulevard might not have been the best place to bring him.\" \"Yes it was, Chuck. Anyplace else, we wouldn't have met you. Right, Gallant?\" \"Yes. It was nice meeting you, Chuck.\" \"Never met anyone whose name fit better. Later.\" \"He liked my name, Julie. He thought it fit.\" \"Yeah. He liked the way your pants fit, too.\" \"Yes. That too.\" She burst into giggles and he smiled. \"I felt you both calling me, Julie. He was… very focused.\" \"I noticed that lotus position was practiced.\" \"Dance with me. I've watched. I know who you think looks well. I won't look foolish and embarrass you.\" \"You peeked.\" \"Only at your face as you watched them. You see? It made you mistrust me.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Forgive me?\" \"I will, if you dance with me.\" \"Blackmail. I love it.\" \"I learn quickly. **** \"Gallant, get your head back in the van.\" \"Your moon is so beautiful. I've never seen a more beautiful world.\" \"How many have you seen?\" \"Hundreds, but this is the first I landed on with people. I'm glad. Humans are wonderful!\" \"You're bombed out of your mind.\" \"Julie, can we stop? I want to walk in the moonlight by the sea.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind. There's a beach I like just ahead, Leo Carillo. We'll go home through Topanga Canyon after daybreak. Want to show you some forest. We'll nap in the back of the van. Gallant, I've got to go back to work Monday. My vacation's over.\" \"I know. You've been looking at the calendar and sighing for two days. I'm glad I tromped your tulips on your vacation. You've been a wonderful teacher. YES!\" She laughed and turned the lights off. He'd been out and running for the beach before she'd gotten the brake on. She grabbed a jacket for herself and a blanket for him. She just knew he was going to get wet. She ran after him. His laughter stopped her cold. It was... wild. She sat down in the sand and cried for him. He'd been caged for so long. His spirit was just learning to be free. \"You're crying. What did I do?\" \"Not you, Gallant. The past.\" \"My past. Your tears are for me. May I kiss you?\" \"I'd like it very much.\" \"You'll... \" \"What is it?\" \"You'll have to teach me how.\" She decided he had a gift for understatement. He learned very fast. **** \"Julie... \" \"You're leaving.\" \"I never said good-by before. It hurts.\" \"Yes, it does. Gallant, don't forget me.\" \"Never. Julie, may I come back someday? Take you dancing? Show you all I've learned?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"One year from the day I tromped your tulips. Is it a date?\" \"I'll mark it on the calendar. See you March Eighth, Nineteen Ninety-one.\" \"In your tulips.\" \"I'll be there.\" **** Gallant knew how much he still had to learn. Of course he chose Earth as the place to learn it. \"All right, Mike, what are you laughing about?\" \"Clara, I've been drafted. It seems I'm about to go to war.\" \"You're the last decent young man in this neighborhood. The young ladies will miss you.\" \"Oh, I'll be back. The war won't last too much longer. We'll beat them.\" \"When do you report?\" \"By the day after tomorrow, but I'm going to the recruiter today.\" \"Give the Kaiser a punch on the nose for me.\" \"I will, Clara. Would it be all right if I left my things here?\" \"Of course. You've become more like family than a boarder in the last two years. The only family I've got. Outlived all the others. Mike, if I'm not here when you get back, the place is yours.\" \"Clara... \" \"Now don't argue. I did it months ago. I've got no one else to give it to.\" \"Thank you. I love you, too.\" \"Oh, go on. Say good-by to all the pretty young things you squire around.\" She died before he got back to the big house in Chicago. He signed the documents that had been awaiting the return of 'Sergeant Gallant' and took possession. He aired out the closed house, repaired the damage two years of emptiness had caused and settled into life in the time known as the roaring twenties. He began establishing the identity of a nephew. He'd need it before too many years passed. He talked about his nephew a great deal to the others at his place of employment and the people on his beat. He'd gotten the job by a bit of hypnosis. The physician who checked him hadn't noticed his two hearts. He became one of Chicago's finest and helped fight the lawlessness of the gangs. **** He dragged himself from the lake and sought shelter from the biting wind. They'd disposed of the 'body' of Detective Gallant in their usual effective manner. He almost hadn't gotten out of the chains they'd weighted him with in time. It had been very close. He dragged his shattered body to the shelter of an empty beach house and sank into trance. He hadn't been hurt as badly since Hensk had dropped a building on him. When he left the house more than a month later, he was nearly an inch taller. He carefully replaced all the food he'd used, then went to collect his inheritance. Mitchell Gallant looked a lot like his uncle Mike. He needed a place to live. So many had lost everything when the great drought had turned dreams to dust. **** \"Mitch, that laugh of yours sends chills through me. It's... I don't know. Wild. Crazy.\" \"Yeah, I've been told that before. You guys stay here. I'm going to see if I can get close enough to lob a grenade into that machine gun nest. You'll know if I make it.\" \"Sarge, be careful.\" \"Always am. I like being alive.\" \"Jesus, Joey, do you think he really believes that?\" \"Mac, I gave up second guessing the sarge a year ago. I just wait for his eyes to go glittery, then duck.\" \"Sometimes I think he's crazy. Especially when he laughs like that.\" \"If he's crazy, it's the best kind. We've been in practically every battle in Europe and he's kept all of us alive. All but Smitty.\" \"The guy I replaced?\" \"Yeah, kid. The only one the sarge ever lost. Sat and cried when he got hit, then took apart the patrol that got him. Never seen anything like it. Look, one thing you gotta' know. None of us talk about the sarge. We don't mention the things he does. He wants it that way. He'll keep you alive, kid. So just you don't say nothin' about him. Ever.\" \"But he's a hero. He should get promoted and decorated.\" \"You make a fuss, someone'll check him out. He don't want that and, if you're smart, neither do you.\" \"Why? What's wrong with him?\" \"Nothin's wrong with him. He's as good a man as ever lived. Better than any I ever met. Just don't talk about him.\" \"Man, you're serious, aren't you? Why, Joey?\" \"'Cause he ain't human. We all know. We seen him get near blown apart. We kept quiet and hid him 'til he healed. Took near a month, but we managed to cover for him. You don't believe me. OK, watch. Go on. You ever seen a man run that fast?\" \"Jesus! What is he?!\" \"An angel. Our very own guardian angel. Anzio to Omaha. Now, kid, you gonna' keep quiet?\" Mac looked around at the men in the ditch with him. They were waiting for his answer. \"I didn't see anything to talk about. Just a real good sergeant I was lucky to get.\" He smiled as the men around him grinned and turned back to watch \"a real good sergeant\" take out the enemy gun emplacement that had them pinned down. **** He loved the post-war years. Right up until the time 'Manny Gallant' was drafted. He sat down and laughed until he cried. The war was in Korea and they called it a \"police action.\" Another group of men agreed he was just a real good sergeant. He grew another half inch, but he didn't lose any men. He saw it coming, but didn't try to avoid it, just kept traveling with the Daredevils. He'd found a shape he and his ship both liked. She was a small silver travel trailer. He loved riding motorcycles and traveling the country with the show. It was one of the happiest times he'd ever known. All the Daredevils were fond of the 'kid' who had joined them. His name was Murray Gallant and he was a 'sixteen-year-old orphan' when he joined them. He was 'twenty-three' when he was drafted to go to Vietnam. Butch settled down and let him park the trailer he called \"Alice\" in his garage. The kid had grown a bit when he came back. **** He left the world he'd called home for nearly a hundred years and set out to explore other worlds. He spent nearly two thousand years learning the ways of other worlds and fighting to keep them safe. He became a student. On Earth. He smiled in satisfaction when he burned his draft card in front of the campus administration building in nineteen sixty-nine. Alex Gallant would not go. **** \"Gallant!\" \"Hello, Julie. You feel just as good as I remember.\" \"Been a lot longer than a year for you, hasn't it?\" \"Yes. I had a great deal to learn. I brought you some presents. Let's go in. Your tulips need the rain. We don't.\" \"Do they ever. It was dry again this winter. I'm afraid it's going to be a bad year for forest fires. You look wonderful, Gallant, but I don't think those jeans would fit you now.\" \"I don't think they would either. I've planned our evening. Do you mind?\" \"Not at all.\" \"Money is always a problem for me. I set up an account in your name a bit in the past. It's a trust. It matures today. Would you draw funds from it for this evening, please?\" \"Sure. How?\" \"Just call the bank. Here. This is the paperwork.\" \"Uh, I don't think I'll ask how you just made that appear like that.\" \"It's just math.\" \"Math?\" \"A lot of math. I never seem to have enough pockets, so I made a few extra.\" \"Yeah. OK. Right. Gallant, you set this up a hundred forty years ago!\" \"Yes. It seemed the most reasonable time to deposit a small amount of gold.\" \"How much should I draw?\" \"Twenty thousand should be enough. Oops. Steady.\" \"Twenty thousand?!\" \"You're quite right, fifty thousand. One shouldn't short oneself in Las Vegas.\" \"Gallant, you're grinning at me. Just how much is in this account?\" \"I don't really know, but it should make you give serious thought as to how well you really like your job. Call the bank. I'd rather not use Alice to get there before they close.\" \"Alice?\" \"You named her.\" \"Alice in Wonderland!\" \"I thought you'd remember. Call the bank.\" **** \"Monte Carlo?!\" \"Why not? You won so much in Las Vegas, you might as well play with it somewhere else.\" \"Gallant, you won it.\" \"Did I put the chips on the table?\" \"No, but you played the cards.\" \"Team effort. Let's stop in New York. I want to see Phantom of the Opera.\" \"For which you already have tickets. Just like the ballet, and the opera, and the Comedy Club. And probably dinner reservations just like Spago's\" \"Opening night would be nice. Julie, you're the only one who can appreciate how much I've learned. You weren't my first teacher, but you were the one who taught me I was free. I'm showing off for my teacher. And feeling exceptionally smug.\" \"How long, Gallant?\" \"Julie, please don't ask. You really want to know, don't you? The answer will shock you. Two thousand one hundred years.\" \"Uh, I need to sit down.\" \"I told you not to ask.\" \"Next time I'll listen. You remembered a date with me for two thousand years?!\" \"It was the first I ever made. I took my time getting ready for it.\" \"Uh, huh, and I thought I took a long time in front of the mirror.\" \"Julie, I was a very young boy when I came here the first time. Call me eleven. Now I'm about twenty-two.\" \"Childlike innocence. I ignored it.\" \"Julie, yours was my first kiss. I still remember it. I'd been used for years, but never kissed. I had escaped, but you taught me I was free.\" \"Gallant, if you were that young... \" \"They call it stim. My reward for living through it was a rather abrupt introduction to a large group.\" \"There are a lot of things you haven't forgotten.\" \"I'm working on creating dusty corners for them in the attic. You, I keep on the piano in the parlor. Monte Carlo?\" \"Why not?\" **** \"You won't be back again.\" \"I don't know. Yes I do. I'll be back some day to meet your children.\" \"Be Godfather?\" \"Yes. Thank you. I love you, too. Julie, have pepperoni pizza on March eighth once in a while.\" \"Done. Thanks, Gallant. I needed something.\" \"You know, I think I'll just stop saying good-by.\" \"Not yet, but someday, I think you will.\" **** \"GALLANT!\" \"Hello, Julie. Brrr. March Eighth is a lot colder here.\" \"Hurry. Get inside. You'll freeze your ears. How did you find me? Dumb question.\" \"How did you end up in Fairbanks, Alaska?\" \"Jim. He loves it here. It's home. Now, you've got something bothering you. Tell Aunt Julie.\" He smiled. She still knew him. She'd matured well. She was even more beautiful at forty-eight than she had been at twenty-four. He told her about the dreams, but he didn't tell her how long they'd been haunting him. \"Athena. Gallant, is this the dream that gave you your name?\" \"Perceptive as ever. Yes. It's become insistent. I'm about to start in ancient Greece and look up every Athena who ever lived!\" \"You're sure she's human?\" \"Never found the name in any other culture.\" \"Wait a minute! Knew I heard a bell. Jim said something about an Athena. Last night... Yes! A lecturer at the University. No, she can't be the one. She's a geneticist. Plump and seventy-ish. Maybe she's got a granddaughter. Silly. There must be thousands of Athenas.\" \"True, but I had to come here. Now. Ah, hello, you must be Jim.\" \"And you can only be Gallant. Welcome. I've been waiting to meet you for a very long time. You're responsible for my meeting Julie.\" \"I am?!\" \"Yes. I delivered a pepperoni pizza to her on March eighth in ninety-two and stayed to find out why she was smiling and crying. Never left. She was the most beautiful girl I ever met and her best friend was an angel named Gallant. She was either crazy or special. Took me at least two seconds to decide which.\" \"Took him two hours to propose.\" \"Took you two hours to get dressed.\" \"We got married March Eighth, Gallant. Twenty-three years ago. In Las Vegas.\" \"That's the most wonderful story I ever heard.\" \"WOW! It's him, isn't it?\" \"Yes Alice, it's him. Gallant, our daughter Alice. Your oldest Godchild.\" \"You, my dear, are as beautiful as your mother.\" \"You're right, Mom. He definitely knows how to deliver a compliment. So, Gallant, how are you at hugs?\" \"Come here and I'll let you decide.\" **** \"Anyway, she's got this project going, Gallant. Long term thing. Genetic selection. No real meddling. Just pick the best. You know; long life, strong bones, good teeth. With current life expec running about eighty in healthy enviros, she figures two cen by proj culm. Bout one cen from now.\" \"Despite the verbal shorthand, I got all that. And you signed up for it.\" \"Shh, don't tell Mom and Dad.\" \"Tell us what, Alice? Oh, the project. Well, it makes me a bit nervous, but your father says it sounds reasonable.\" \"You know, Mom, I bet they find a gene for mind reading when they run mine. Where's Ben?\" \"Brenda called to say she'd be late. Study group.\" \"I don't believe it. Mom, she's out with that guy again. Yeah, you think so too. Dad?\" \"Trying just as hard as I am to trust her.\" \"Well I'm not a parent. I don't have to. I'm going looking. He gives me the crawlies. And he's the best of that crowd he runs with. Uh, oh. Mom, what'd I do? Why's he staring--\" \"Shh! He's listening.\" \"Alice, get your vehicle. I'm coming with you. Let's go. Julie, we'll find her. Move, Alice!\" The place Alice thought Brenda had gone, with the boy she didn't like, was just a few blocks away. When she stopped the car, the stench of evil was so strong, Gallant couldn't feel the direction it was coming from. \"Where?\" \"That house.\" \"Stay here.\" \"No way, Gallant. I don't have the gas to sit and run it and I'd freeze.\" \"All right, but stay behind me and be prepared to duck. Alice, if I find what I think I will, don't watch. That's an order, not a request.\" \"One of those dark brother things.\" \"I don't give orders for other reasons.\" \"Understood.\" Now he knew why he was in Fairbanks, why Athena had sent him. She'd sent him eight times before. There were three left. One of them was Hensk, but not this one. He went through the door. It would probably have been locked anyway. The stench of evil sickened him. Somewhere in here was his Godchild. Alice watched him go through about ten people, then ducked and turned away. He was right. She didn't want to watch. She knew when it was over, but she didn't turn around. She could feel he didn't want her to. \"Alice, get her home. I'll be there soon. She's asleep. She won't remember anything after she left school. Tell her she hit her head.\" \"How will you get there?\" \"I'll run. It's cold. Go on. You can carry her.\" \"I know that. She weighs less than I do. Thanks, Gallant.\" \"Thank Athena. She sent me. Now go. I've got to get these boys out. When I destroy the ship, it'll take the house with it. Go!\" He carried them out quickly. He could already hear sirens. Someone had called the authorities. The two blankets he'd found would be enough. They wouldn't freeze. He slipped the medunit back in his pocket and checked every room to make sure he hadn't missed anyone. That's when he found the kittens. He knew Mama was dead. He tucked the three tiny things in his shirt, put in the destruct code he'd programmed nearly nine thousand years before and ran for the door. He ran through the night, holding the kittens in his shirt with one hand to keep them from being bounced. He was delighted to see the lights of Julie's house. It was cold. The run hadn't been long enough to really warm him. He ran in the kitchen door. He didn't realize someone had been following him. \"Get me warm milk and an eyedropper or something. They're starving.\" \"I know better. Five min, Gallant.\" \"All right, Jim. Julie, your entire family speaks shorthand.\" \"Do? Yeah. Guess. Comes of closeness.\" \"It's more than that. Alice may be right. They may find something very interesting in her genes. How is she?\" \"Which one?\" \"I know how Brenda is. Alice.\" \"Fine. Waiting by Brenda to give her your story. How bad was she?\" \"Julie, she's fine now.\" \"In other words, you'd rather not tell me and I ought to have sense enough not to push it. All right. She's fine now. Her godfather fixed her.\" \"Yes. I'm hoping to get a hug from her mother for it. Shh. Julie, it's over. All the kittens are safe at home.\" \"How many left, Gallant?\" \"Two.\" \"Yes, but it doesn't end there does it? You could still be killed by one of the ones you killed in your future. I mean... \" \"Yes, but I have it on good authority I won't be.\" \"Athena again.\" \"She's waiting for me. Four times. As four different people. You know, Alice's project... I'm not sure.\" \"Bad?\" \"No, not really important in the long run, but no problem.\" \"Don't tell her that. She has designs on an MD and a slot on it. Loves genetics. Intensely curious about yours.\" \"Tell her I have an extra pair of chromosomes. And no one else on my home planet does.\" \"Oh, Gallant!\" \"I've known a long time. I'm as different from them as I am from you. And I like you better. They're boring!\" \"Here. Hit up Bill Aikens. Vet. Caught him as he was pulling in the drive. He said twenty cc's every two til they're stuffed. Form mixes with warm water.\" \"Thank you, Jim. All right, little one. Let's get you stuffed. Yes, hungry. Poor baby.\" Julie went to find Alice and discovered Brenda was awake. She laid a finger to her lips, smiled and led them to the kitchen. They stood quietly in the doorway and watched Gallant feed the three tiny kittens. He held the tiny life so gently in his big, beautiful, hands. And his smile was so soft. **** \"Mom, he's gone.\" \"I know, Alice.\" \"He didn't even say good-by.\" \"Alice, it hurts him terribly to say it. He's said it far too often.\" \"Yeah, too often. I understand. Will he be back?\" \"I don't know, but we'll make sure we have pepperoni pizza on March eighth. Just in case he shows up for a slice.\" The dark brother was angered at the loss of another of his kind. He traced the woman back though time. He would find the escaped one at their first meeting and destroy him before any of his brethren died. He laughed. The foolish slave had even left the door to his ship open. He would herd him to it and be waiting within.",

Do you suppose it's their long lives that make them weak?\" \"They call themselves civilized. I find them boring. They live millennia and never live at all. Lord, the instruments say his mind is worth harnessing.\" \"Excellent. Buy him.\" \"He is expensive. He's the scion of one of their great houses.\" \"Very nice. I've never owned a king before. I think I'll just take the one. He will fill all three roles. That should make Lord Rorisk take note.\" \"A charming idea. He'll require intense physical training. It will reduce his useful time in the mind/comp link.\" \"And enhance his beauty. A fair trade. Stim him.\" \"Temporary?\" \"No. In fact, give him all four of the stimulation's. Let's see if they work on this weak-willed race.\" \"Do you wish the experiment documented?\" \"Of course. Wipe his name carefully, Demisk.\" \"And what shall I put in its place?\" \"Nothing. Leave him nameless. Leave his knowledge of his station among his people, if possible.\" \"A nameless, wanton, king. My Lord, you have a wonderful humor.\" **** \"Gallant.\" He moaned softly in his sleep. She had come again. \"Take heart, Gallant. You will free them all. Learn, my gallant one. Do all they ask. Build for them. That which they seek is their destruction and freedom for this world. Build. Come to me.\" He awoke in desperate need of her. The emptiness she left, he could only suffer. He carefully hid the name she called him. He would not share the gift she had given until his people were free. He grasped her promise of freedom and fought to stay alive. He heard them coming again. \"Well, Demisk?\" \"Amazing! He's stronger! My Lord, none of the others have been successful. He's the only one that's lived through the first stim.\" \"I've made several large wagers he'll survive all four. Give him his reward for surviving. Document it carefully. I'll show the record at the banquet.\" \"Take him to room three. How many, Lord?\" \"Ten of the stimmed oriki. Hungry ones.\" He lowered his fevered body into the swirling waters of the pool set in one corner of the room. The chain on the collar he wore was just long enough to reach it. A reward for surviving? What were oriki? What were the multitude of holographic lenses set in the walls and ceiling to record? He hated the collar and its chain. He wondered if they knew. He'd never hated before the stim. He smiled softly. It was probably a side effect. Side effects were dangerous. He intended they learn the fact well. \"Hello, pretty thing. Come out of the pool.\" \"I'd rather not.\" \"We are in need of you. Won't you aid us?\" \"Who are you?\" \"We are women of the oriki. Help us.\" \"I'm currently not much help to myself.\" \"Oh, but you will be of great aid to us. Come.\" He really didn't have any choice. Three of the women were pulling on the chain on his collar. There were ten of them. They were quite beautiful; long dark hair, large green eyes, and skin of pale aqua. He didn't understand what was happening to his body. It must be due to the stim. One of the women touched him. \"Please, I don't understand what's happening. Please, don't touch me.\" \"Foolish boy, you are a slave. As are we. You have no choices.\" **** \"Where did you find him?\" \"In the market.\" \"Then he's of high rank. Responds well.\" \"He's been stimmed, Rorisk.\" \"Stimmed?! Hensk, none of these soft people survive stim.\" \"This one has. It's fully documented. I'll arrange a private showing for you.\" \"Hensk, you're after a favor. What is it?\" \"I'm going to enter him in the combats, if he survives the entire set of stims. I want your trainer to teach him.\" \"Leave him while I watch the documentation. If he survives, I'll lend you my trainer.\" \"Demisk, have him prepared for Lord Rorisk.\" **** \"He has potential, Master Demisk.\" \"My lord believes so. He has survived all the stims.\" \"Good. Too often, I'm given ones to train that have only had the body stimmed. Combat is as much of the mind. Do I have his full time, or is he in other use?\" \"He is, but my lord will reduce his link time with the computers to three hours per day during his training.\" \"Reduce?! How much is he on now?\" \"Twenty-two hours. He is given four of rest.\" \"He may be interesting to train. I ask the lord schedule his link time with regularity. It will aid his training.\" \"He has already done so. You have him but the first three hours of the day.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk. Good. Now that he's gone, let's get acquainted. Do you have a name?\" \"No. It was taken.\" \"Sounds like Hensk. Been pretty heavily used, haven't you, boy?\" \"Since I haven't had a chance to compare notes with anyone, I've got no basis to judge, but I definitely have been busy.\" \"Hold still. I'm going to look you over. Now, now, don't tense. I won't hurt... Oh, I see. A blush. You've not been broken by it. You'll learn control.\" \"That would be much appreciated. Just once I'd like to... \" \"Not respond to every touch instantly.\" \"It would be pleasant not to have my body temperature rise at a tap on the shoulder.\" \"And if I teach you to fight, what will you do?\" \"Fight.\" \"Yes, you'll do.\" They became friends. The old trainer had been seeking someone like him for a very long time. He held his dream of freedom in his heart and trained the boy. Lord Hensk had made an error. He had created a hero. The old trainer would teach him to be a warrior. **** \"What effect did the last three stims have on you?\" \"None that I could tell. No, one. I'm faster, but that may be due to the training. \"Yes. I don't think any of them worked. Well, the first lowered your thresholds, but that's all. Have you always been different from the rest of your people? \"Trainer, I am a child. I don't know. I have no other children to compare myself with, though I know I am quite large for my age.\" \"A child?\" \"Yes, I am but... I do not know my years, but perhaps I can give you information which is useful to you. Ah, I know. The first stim. It nearly killed me. I was far too young to have sexual maturity forced on me.\" \"You were prepubescent?!\" \"Very. At what age does your species mature?\" \"About fourteen.\" \"Then I was a child of... This is difficult. I lost so much when my name was taken. I am of a great house. None would have spoken to me without my name and title and the taking of it... I know that I am very young. Perhaps, between twenty and thirty. In comparison with your people... physically nine or ten. I had no body hair until the stim. I'm still a bit smug about it.\" \"Oh, my son, the cruelty of what was done to you makes me ache.\" \"Don't. There's already too much pain around me.\" \"Boy, I've seen the documentation of the first stim.\" \"That was an interesting experience. I had no idea what those women wanted.\" \"It didn't take you long to learn.\" \"I learn fast. Trainer, I like this weapon. Its simplicity... attracts me.\" \"The staff? Yes, I like it too. A simple wooden shaft. Boy, I can't pretend to teach you longer. You know all I know.\" \"Thank you. I'll use it well.\" \"You know I won't return. My master is already unhappy he gave Hensk my use.\" \"Strange. At the time, he seemed to feel your use for mine was a fair exchange.\" \"Lean near. When you destroy them, let me kill Rorisk for what he did to you.\" He smiled at his only friend. \"I love you too. And I promise I'll remember. Thank you.\" **** \"Master, the direct mind link obstructs my work.\" \"In what way?\" \"It tells me the lord seeks the impossible. I know it is incorrect. I can vision it, but in the link, I know the vision is incorrect. I ask to use the physical station. I cannot override the computational limits while the matrices hold my mind.\" \"The link has been known to limit creativity. I will put your request to the lord.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk.\" \"He is pleased with you. Your sweep of the combats has made him the envy of his peers. They have requested you be provided at tonight's banquet. Entertain them well. Go to the preparation chamber. The attendants await you. Now, boy!\" \"Yes, Master.\" He ran to the chamber. He'd hesitated. That kind of mistake could cost him his life. \"Entertain them\" meant Rorisk was coming. He was so close to the answer. He had to get out of the link. He didn't intend his master to have what he would build. Or, not all of what he would build. The link would give him away, note the discrepancy in his request. She had come again and told him to build the twelve plus one. The plus-one was to be his. The attendants prepared him and he learned he had been right. Rorisk was at the banquet. \"He doesn't respond as well.\" \"Rorisk, he was fresh stimmed. Although, it may be the link. It is draining.\" \"Better. It just took a bit. How much time does he spend in it?\" \"Twenty-two per day.\" \"That's twice recommended!\" \"Yes, but other than slowing his response, it's had no ill effects. I have him on project three. I expect results within a twelveday.\" \"If you get them, you'll get a ministry.\" \"I'd get one eventually without it. I'm more interested in the project itself. I need a very rare element to complete it. I wish an interview with your uncle.\" \"The emperor?! You must be very sure you'll succeed.\" \"This one is. Aren't you, boy.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Hensk, project three is a dream. No one really expects it to be completed. The tools don't exist.\" \"You are touching the tool I created to build it. His mind is like no other. Before the stim, he was over the tenth rank of intelligence.\" \"OVER! Impossible! Nothing in existence is over the tenth rank.\" \"He is. On both scales, physical and mental. Unique in the universe. Are you pleased to know that, boy?\" \"No, Lord Master.\" \"Why not?\" \"It means I am alone.\" \"Very good. Yes, without another of your kind, but I shall solve that for you. I'm having females of your species prepared. You wish to speak?\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Speak.\" \"There are no females of my species. My Lord Master has told me I am unique.\" \"Very good. Very good. Consider yourself as being bred to another species.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" **** \"I will return, Kirel.\" \"From the photosphere of a star? And if you do succeed, why would you come back? You could be free.\" \"And leave my children?\" \"Are they yours? They're not like you. They're merely children of my race. You've never even seen them. They're just a few among many. A failed breeding. You couldn't find them if you searched.\" \"Then I will claim all children as mine.\" \"You'll claim nothing. You're a nameless slave. Haven't the ten years you've been one taught you anything?\" \"Yes. They've taught me patience.\" **** \"Hensk, you're a fool. He'll never return.\" \"Wrong, Rorisk. He thinks he has children here. He believes, if he succeeds, I'll give them to him.\" \"And he has no children?\" \"None. He's not mature yet. The physicians estimate it will be hundreds of years before he's capable of siring offspring. I had them change his genetic structure. His children will ripen far sooner, but it will still be hundreds of years before he sires them. The first thing I shall do with project three is collect them. Perhaps, I'll give them to him. Did your uncle grant my request?\" \"Yes. Five point two akits of the element will be sent to you. In return, he will receive eleven of the machines.\" \"I shall need only one. Did he speak of his plans for them?\" \"Yes. He'll use them to direct the evolution of the recalcitrant worlds.\" \"Excellent. The yumari are beautiful. I shall enjoy having them as obedient slaves.\" \"His thought exactly. When we decide we want them, they'll surrender without a struggle. He's already chosen his agents.\" \"The priests of Denskarra?\" \"Hensk, you astound me. Yes, the dark brothers. They have pledged to do as he requests in this galaxy if he gives them freedom to do as they wish in the others.\" \"The servants of the Dark One will cleanse the universe of life. I am not sure I trust them to allow life in this one.\" \"He pointed out, if they destroyed it here, they would not exist and would be unable to cleanse it elsewhere.\" \"Our emperor is a wise and devious man.\" \"Yes. My uncle serves the Dark One well.\" **** \"Lord Master, the time ships are complete.\" \"You wish a reward. Speak it.\" \"I ask for my children, Lord Master.\" \"With this ship, I have the power to grant your request. You have no children in this time. So I shall find them in another and bring them to you. You are a nameless slave. Your children shall be the same.\" \"NO!\" He broke free of his guards and ran. He heard Hensk's laughter mocking him. Slaves could not escape. There was nowhere to escape to. He ran by the keyboard and triggered the mechanism. He had little time before it engaged. He dove into the corner and laughed, as he closed the matrix. He had an escape. The thirteenth ship formed around him. Now to free a world and distract the dark brothers. The mechanism engaged. The oldest race stepped from their suddenly opened cells and walked away from the guards holding useless weapons. The power satellites were torches in the sky. The densk fled the crumbling city. Fled to ships that would not fly. The one they had been given to free them had completed his task. They were really very proud of him. They hadn't expected him to accomplish it for several hundred years. The child had freed his foster parents while still an infant. The slaves of other races extracted revenge. An old man happily told Rorisk why he was strangling him. The densk disappeared from the planet. One scream at a time. When they were gone, the elder race sent four to restore the ships. The freed of other races had transport home. They would free their worlds. All that would remain of the servants of the Dark One that had infested their galaxy were the eleven priests and the one lord. The child would keep them from inflicting great harm. They tapped the energy source he had created and engaged the great defenses that had been awaiting it. They reached into the mind of the child with the key they had been given and freed his powers. **** \"Gallant, you are not forever alone. I await beyond time. You will find my aspects, but you must search. Each will give you love, but you will leave two and one shall leave you. They do not know I am within them. I await you. My fathers love you. Look for me. Know me by my name. Athena.\" \"ATHENA!\" He awoke at the sound of his own shout. He pulled himself to the console. He must complete the ship. The formless space around him was dizzying. He began programming a reality within it. He wanted much more than he had given the other twelve ships he'd created. He wondered if those who had them would ever realize he had deliberately made them small, boxy, and very noisy. Would they ever know infinity lay behind the noisy walls of the inaccessible engine room? The thought of Hensk trying to sleep in the tiny cabin with the roar of the engines ringing in his ears pleased him. He poured his dreams into the program. All the rooms he'd dreamed. All the gardens he'd only imagined. All the laboratories, studios, pools, the libraries and the banks and banks of computer storage he would someday fill. He gave his ship an exterior reality, then built the program to dematerialize it to land. He smiled. He doubted any of the twelve in the timeships he'd built would look beyond to see what the power to dematerialize truly meant. He laughed when he noticed he'd found a way to create little pockets of timelessness. They'd be very handy. He began programming the life support structure and gravity. He'd found he didn't care for weightlessness. He entered the last command. The ship would gather information from all available sources. He leapt onto the console. It would be the only stable item. Even the floor, chair, and bubble of atmosphere he'd created would be changed. He leaned down and tapped the pad to run the program. He wandered through the ship. He kept getting lost. He loved it. His existence had been limited to a corridor of cells, an arena, link room, preparation room and Hensk's banquet halls. He vaguely remembered wide streets and green lands. He tried to remember his mother, but no image would come. He had one clear memory of learning at a station and a man's smile and nod he had done well. He knew he was very young and from a great house, but that was all. Hensk had taken his name, and with it, every voice that had ever spoken it. **** \"Hey! You're stepping on my tulips!\" \"Oh! I'm sorry. I was looking at--\" \"Whoa! Are you all right?\" \"I really doubt it. Can you understand me?\" \"That's a very strange question. Of course I can. Look you'd better sit down. Here. Lawn chair. Would a glass of water help?\" \"Thank you, Mistress.\" \"You sit right there and I'll go in and get you one.\" Julie sighed as she walked into the house. An angel had just tromped her tulips, swayed dizzily when she spoke to him, then been totally amazed when she offered him a chair and a glass of water. Typical Saturday in LA. Too bad he was on something. When she carried the water out, he was staring down at the city from the middle of her tulip bed again. \"You're in my tulips.\" \"I've been very careful not to step on them. It's murky. Smells awful.\" \"The air or the water?\" \"The air, but I think the water may qualify as well.\" \"Out of towner. Tourist?\" \"Definitely.\" \"Yeah, the LA smog is pretty intense the first time. You get used to it. Today's not bad. Pretty good onshore flow.\" \"You've got to be joking! The hydrocarbon by-products are absolutely noxious! Fossil fuel?\" \"You're beginning to make me nervous.\" \"Probably not half as nervous as I am. I'm sorry. I'll leave. Your tulips attracted me, then I saw the view... Yes, I should definitely leave. Would you answer one more very strange question? What's the name of this world?\" \"You're the most gorgeous man I've ever seen and you're crazy. Just my luck. The world is Earth. Now go before your keepers tromp my tulips trying to catch you.\" \"Yes, I should get back to my ship. She'll have most of the information I need by now. Thank you for your kindness, Lady.\" \"Hold it. You're bleeding.\" \"Yes, but it's minor. One of the dark brothers found me too far from my ship. It's the first time I ever made that mistake. I shall not make it again.\" \"Sit down. I'll clean it up. Who'd you run into? One of the Bloods? I've seen them in the neighborhood.\" \"Bloods?\" \"Gangs. Where are you from, anyway?\" \"Somehow, I doubt you'd believe me.\" \"Try me.\" \"Well, I'm eight galaxies and several hundred years from my home world.\" \"You're right. I don't believe you. That knock on the head shook something loose. I'll probably be sorry I did this, but come inside and I'll get you... What are you doing?\" \"Listening. RUN! Don't argue!\" He grabbed her hand, then scooped her up and carried her. They'd found him already. Somehow, they were tracking him. He dodged the beam fire and ran for his ship. The Earth girl was hardly a hindrance. She was very light. He thanked the Powers he hadn't locked his ship. He ran through the door, slammed it and dematerialized. Since they were tracking him, it made no sense to leave. \"LOOK OUT!\" He spun and saw the girl on the back of the hooded figure of a dark brother. She'd saved his life. Now he needed to save hers. She'd kept the brother from using his weapon, but she was merely a temporary hindrance. He ran to aid her. When the dark one struck her, something happened inside him. He screamed in rage and killed it. He began to shake in reaction and shock. Julie was kind of surprised she woke up. The guy in the hood didn't look like he was going to. Necks didn't bend like that. She realized she was hearing whimpering. Soft, terrified, crying. It was her angel. He was curled in a corner. \"Shh. It's all right. You got him. He can't hurt us now.\" \"I... I killed him. I didn't intend it, but he hit you. I lost control. He really didn't have a chance. He was helpless and I killed him.\" \"Helpless?! He was trying very hard to fry you with that gun! If I hadn't yelled, he'd have succeeded! You saved your life and probably mine! You've... never killed anything before, have you? Nothing.\" \"I've never seen anything die.\" \"I hope I wake up and find out this is all pepperoni pizza. Look, I'm Julie. What's your name.\" \"I haven't got one. They took it.\" She decided to call it pepperoni pizza and get on with it. It was either that or have screaming meemies. \"Who took it?\" \"The Lord Master's servants. He never allowed me to have one. It pleased him to use me nameless.\" \"All right. From the top. Where are we?\" \"My ship.\" \"And where did you get the ship?\" \"I built it. I built all the ships.\" \"Who did you build the ships for?\" \"My master. It was my labor of twelve years.\" \"And who was this master?\" \"Lord Hensk.\" \"The one who took your name? So, why'd you work for him?\" \"The question is meaningless to me?\" \"Why'd you work for some creep that... took your name?\" \"I was too young to wish to die. Nameless ones were only fed if the master remembered to order it. My master usually remembered.\" \"Wait a minute. Are you talking about... slavery?\" \"Yes, but I ended it. I burned out the power satellites. I fed the power of the star I harnessed through them. Without power, weapons would not work and locks would open. The servants of the Dark One could not have stopped my people leaving.\" \"So you started a slave revolt and your people got rid of these servant guys.\" \"No. They would have just left. Although, some of the other imprisoned species may have destroyed them. My trainer wanted to kill his master. Perhaps I am guilty of two deaths. I told him thank you, instead of no.\" \"If you freed them, why didn't you stay?\" \"I had set twelve servants of the Dark One loose in the universe. I decided, if they were chasing me, they'd be too busy to destroy unsuspecting worlds. I must find his ship and destroy it.\" \"I was right the first time. You're an angel. A complete innocent. Well, LA can change that in a hurry. Why am I doing this? Come on. Let's get you some survival skills. Wait a minute. I'm not thinking straight. Where are his friends?\" \"Friends?\" \"Yeah. You know. The ones that took potshots at us on the hill.\" \"Oh, that was him. He just kept landing a few seconds further in the future and trying again, then he went back to the past and laid an ambush in here.\" \"I see. He had a time machine.\" \"That's what the ships are. It's why I have to keep the dark brothers busy.\" She giggled. She just couldn't help it. She was sitting on the floor of a good-size room, that couldn't be in her yard, talking in calm tones about a dead man that hopped around in a time machine, built by an angel, who... Too much. \"All right. Are any more likely to show up?\" \"No. I don't know how he followed me. When I locate his ship, I hope to learn.\" \"OK, let's find his ship. What do you want to do with him?\" \"Leave him. My ship will dispose of him. He is a... contaminant. She'll feel the evil and rid herself of it.\" \"She didn't before.\" \"But he was alive then. He isn't now.\" \"Now stop that. No more crying. Ship, get that thing out of here. WOW! Did I do that?\" \"I think she agreed with you.\" \"I feel like Alice in Wonderland. Come on, little white wabbit. Let's find a ship and then you'll only have eleven chasing you.\" \"I hadn't thought of that. What's a wabbit?\" She had pepperoni pizza delivered. It just seemed appropriate. He loved it. **** \"You have to have a name.\" \"I like Wabbit.\" \"No. That's just between us. Hasn't anyone ever called you anything but--ooh, I hate this-- slave, or boy?\" \"Only in a dream. I once said I would use the name if I freed my world.\" \"Well, don't you think it's time you dusted it off and stuck it on?\" \"Julie, I like this world. Your people have wonderful ways to say things. 'Yo, bro.' 'Hey, dude.' 'What's shakin'?' So many greetings.\" \"The name.\" \"I've never said it before.\" \"And you never will, at this rate. Say it.\" \"Gallant.\" \"Yes! Perfect! It fits you. Belongs. See, you did know your name. OK, Gallant, you've watched four days of TV. You understand the difference between fiction and reality and you have a name. Want to meet some people? Don't look so shocked. I'm dying to show you off. You're an incredible blond hunk. Just one thing. Don't dance slow with anyone but me. Two heartbeats would land you in some government research lab. Probably in pieces.\" \"E.T.\" \"Yeah, E.T. all the way. Did you figure it out? Why we understand each other?\" \"Yes, but I'm afraid to tell you.\" \"Why?\" \"E.T.\" \"Gallant, I doubt you'll send me running to the gov at this point.\" \"I'm a telepath.\" \"Yeah. Makes sense. Why haven't you... read anyone?\" \"That would be very impolite!\" \"Yep. Gallant. Change clothes. Not here! In the bedroom.\" She shook her head and laughed. Carla would never believe she'd stopped a beautiful man from stripping in front of her. She wasn't sure she believed it. It was the innocence. It made him seem like a child. \"Wow! I think I bought those jeans a bit small. They look like they were sprayed on.\" \"They said, 'shrink to fit,' so I used hot water and air to make them smaller. Perhaps I should have stopped after the first wash, but they didn't look like the ones you wear.\" \"Caught. Come on, gorgeous, let's go strut our tight pants.\" **** \"Get away from him, or I'll break your limp wrist.\" \"Ooh, aren't you the possessive one.\" \"Gallant? Hey, you! Come back here a minute!\" \"Look, Missy, I am not… He looks like he's in shock.\" \"I think he was badly abused.\" \"I think you're right. Let's see if this works. Take his hand and gently massage it. See if you can get his attention.\" The rather attractive man sat down on the floor in Gallant's line of sight. It was obviously for a reason. It was going to leave a large dirty smudge on his immaculate white pants. It surprised her a bit when he assumed lotus position and closed his eyes. They were beginning to attract attention. Gallant suddenly blinked and turned to look at her and she sighed in relief. \"Gallant! Are you OK?\" \"Yes. Just a bad memory.\" \"I'm sorry I brought it back. I'm Chuck.\" \"Gallant, tell Chuck he's forgiven.\" \"Forgiven. No, wait. Thank you for the compliment, Chuck, but I like girls.\" \"Thanks, Chuck.\" \"You're more than welcome, Julie. I have a friend to tell her 'technique' worked. I'll have some friends help watch pushy types don't head this way. There are a few.\" \"I like this world.\" \"World?\" \"L.A.'s pretty far out, Chuck. Different world.\" \"Especially this part of it. Julie, the Boulevard might not have been the best place to bring him.\" \"Yes it was, Chuck. Anyplace else, we wouldn't have met you. Right, Gallant?\" \"Yes. It was nice meeting you, Chuck.\" \"Never met anyone whose name fit better. Later.\" \"He liked my name, Julie. He thought it fit.\" \"Yeah. He liked the way your pants fit, too.\" \"Yes. That too.\" She burst into giggles and he smiled. \"I felt you both calling me, Julie. He was… very focused.\" \"I noticed that lotus position was practiced.\" \"Dance with me. I've watched. I know who you think looks well. I won't look foolish and embarrass you.\" \"You peeked.\" \"Only at your face as you watched them. You see? It made you mistrust me.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Forgive me?\" \"I will, if you dance with me.\" \"Blackmail. I love it.\" \"I learn quickly. **** \"Gallant, get your head back in the van.\" \"Your moon is so beautiful. I've never seen a more beautiful world.\" \"How many have you seen?\" \"Hundreds, but this is the first I landed on with people. I'm glad. Humans are wonderful!\" \"You're bombed out of your mind.\" \"Julie, can we stop? I want to walk in the moonlight by the sea.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind. There's a beach I like just ahead, Leo Carillo. We'll go home through Topanga Canyon after daybreak. Want to show you some forest. We'll nap in the back of the van. Gallant, I've got to go back to work Monday. My vacation's over.\" \"I know. You've been looking at the calendar and sighing for two days. I'm glad I tromped your tulips on your vacation. You've been a wonderful teacher. YES!\" She laughed and turned the lights off. He'd been out and running for the beach before she'd gotten the brake on. She grabbed a jacket for herself and a blanket for him. She just knew he was going to get wet. She ran after him. His laughter stopped her cold. It was... wild. She sat down in the sand and cried for him. He'd been caged for so long. His spirit was just learning to be free. \"You're crying. What did I do?\" \"Not you, Gallant. The past.\" \"My past. Your tears are for me. May I kiss you?\" \"I'd like it very much.\" \"You'll... \" \"What is it?\" \"You'll have to teach me how.\" She decided he had a gift for understatement. He learned very fast. **** \"Julie... \" \"You're leaving.\" \"I never said good-by before. It hurts.\" \"Yes, it does. Gallant, don't forget me.\" \"Never. Julie, may I come back someday? Take you dancing? Show you all I've learned?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"One year from the day I tromped your tulips. Is it a date?\" \"I'll mark it on the calendar. See you March Eighth, Nineteen Ninety-one.\" \"In your tulips.\" \"I'll be there.\" **** Gallant knew how much he still had to learn. Of course he chose Earth as the place to learn it. \"All right, Mike, what are you laughing about?\" \"Clara, I've been drafted. It seems I'm about to go to war.\" \"You're the last decent young man in this neighborhood. The young ladies will miss you.\" \"Oh, I'll be back. The war won't last too much longer. We'll beat them.\" \"When do you report?\" \"By the day after tomorrow, but I'm going to the recruiter today.\" \"Give the Kaiser a punch on the nose for me.\" \"I will, Clara. Would it be all right if I left my things here?\" \"Of course. You've become more like family than a boarder in the last two years. The only family I've got. Outlived all the others. Mike, if I'm not here when you get back, the place is yours.\" \"Clara... \" \"Now don't argue. I did it months ago. I've got no one else to give it to.\" \"Thank you. I love you, too.\" \"Oh, go on. Say good-by to all the pretty young things you squire around.\" She died before he got back to the big house in Chicago. He signed the documents that had been awaiting the return of 'Sergeant Gallant' and took possession. He aired out the closed house, repaired the damage two years of emptiness had caused and settled into life in the time known as the roaring twenties. He began establishing the identity of a nephew. He'd need it before too many years passed. He talked about his nephew a great deal to the others at his place of employment and the people on his beat. He'd gotten the job by a bit of hypnosis. The physician who checked him hadn't noticed his two hearts. He became one of Chicago's finest and helped fight the lawlessness of the gangs. **** He dragged himself from the lake and sought shelter from the biting wind. They'd disposed of the 'body' of Detective Gallant in their usual effective manner. He almost hadn't gotten out of the chains they'd weighted him with in time. It had been very close. He dragged his shattered body to the shelter of an empty beach house and sank into trance. He hadn't been hurt as badly since Hensk had dropped a building on him. When he left the house more than a month later, he was nearly an inch taller. He carefully replaced all the food he'd used, then went to collect his inheritance. Mitchell Gallant looked a lot like his uncle Mike. He needed a place to live. So many had lost everything when the great drought had turned dreams to dust. **** \"Mitch, that laugh of yours sends chills through me. It's... I don't know. Wild. Crazy.\" \"Yeah, I've been told that before. You guys stay here. I'm going to see if I can get close enough to lob a grenade into that machine gun nest. You'll know if I make it.\" \"Sarge, be careful.\" \"Always am. I like being alive.\" \"Jesus, Joey, do you think he really believes that?\" \"Mac, I gave up second guessing the sarge a year ago. I just wait for his eyes to go glittery, then duck.\" \"Sometimes I think he's crazy. Especially when he laughs like that.\" \"If he's crazy, it's the best kind. We've been in practically every battle in Europe and he's kept all of us alive. All but Smitty.\" \"The guy I replaced?\" \"Yeah, kid. The only one the sarge ever lost. Sat and cried when he got hit, then took apart the patrol that got him. Never seen anything like it. Look, one thing you gotta' know. None of us talk about the sarge. We don't mention the things he does. He wants it that way. He'll keep you alive, kid. So just you don't say nothin' about him. Ever.\" \"But he's a hero. He should get promoted and decorated.\" \"You make a fuss, someone'll check him out. He don't want that and, if you're smart, neither do you.\" \"Why? What's wrong with him?\" \"Nothin's wrong with him. He's as good a man as ever lived. Better than any I ever met. Just don't talk about him.\" \"Man, you're serious, aren't you? Why, Joey?\" \"'Cause he ain't human. We all know. We seen him get near blown apart. We kept quiet and hid him 'til he healed. Took near a month, but we managed to cover for him. You don't believe me. OK, watch. Go on. You ever seen a man run that fast?\" \"Jesus! What is he?!\" \"An angel. Our very own guardian angel. Anzio to Omaha. Now, kid, you gonna' keep quiet?\" Mac looked around at the men in the ditch with him. They were waiting for his answer. \"I didn't see anything to talk about. Just a real good sergeant I was lucky to get.\" He smiled as the men around him grinned and turned back to watch \"a real good sergeant\" take out the enemy gun emplacement that had them pinned down. **** He loved the post-war years. Right up until the time 'Manny Gallant' was drafted. He sat down and laughed until he cried. The war was in Korea and they called it a \"police action.\" Another group of men agreed he was just a real good sergeant. He grew another half inch, but he didn't lose any men. He saw it coming, but didn't try to avoid it, just kept traveling with the Daredevils. He'd found a shape he and his ship both liked. She was a small silver travel trailer. He loved riding motorcycles and traveling the country with the show. It was one of the happiest times he'd ever known. All the Daredevils were fond of the 'kid' who had joined them. His name was Murray Gallant and he was a 'sixteen-year-old orphan' when he joined them. He was 'twenty-three' when he was drafted to go to Vietnam. Butch settled down and let him park the trailer he called \"Alice\" in his garage. The kid had grown a bit when he came back. **** He left the world he'd called home for nearly a hundred years and set out to explore other worlds. He spent nearly two thousand years learning the ways of other worlds and fighting to keep them safe. He became a student. On Earth. He smiled in satisfaction when he burned his draft card in front of the campus administration building in nineteen sixty-nine. Alex Gallant would not go. **** \"Gallant!\" \"Hello, Julie. You feel just as good as I remember.\" \"Been a lot longer than a year for you, hasn't it?\" \"Yes. I had a great deal to learn. I brought you some presents. Let's go in. Your tulips need the rain. We don't.\" \"Do they ever. It was dry again this winter. I'm afraid it's going to be a bad year for forest fires. You look wonderful, Gallant, but I don't think those jeans would fit you now.\" \"I don't think they would either. I've planned our evening. Do you mind?\" \"Not at all.\" \"Money is always a problem for me. I set up an account in your name a bit in the past. It's a trust. It matures today. Would you draw funds from it for this evening, please?\" \"Sure. How?\" \"Just call the bank. Here. This is the paperwork.\" \"Uh, I don't think I'll ask how you just made that appear like that.\" \"It's just math.\" \"Math?\" \"A lot of math. I never seem to have enough pockets, so I made a few extra.\" \"Yeah. OK. Right. Gallant, you set this up a hundred forty years ago!\" \"Yes. It seemed the most reasonable time to deposit a small amount of gold.\" \"How much should I draw?\" \"Twenty thousand should be enough. Oops. Steady.\" \"Twenty thousand?!\" \"You're quite right, fifty thousand. One shouldn't short oneself in Las Vegas.\" \"Gallant, you're grinning at me. Just how much is in this account?\" \"I don't really know, but it should make you give serious thought as to how well you really like your job. Call the bank. I'd rather not use Alice to get there before they close.\" \"Alice?\" \"You named her.\" \"Alice in Wonderland!\" \"I thought you'd remember. Call the bank.\" **** \"Monte Carlo?!\" \"Why not? You won so much in Las Vegas, you might as well play with it somewhere else.\" \"Gallant, you won it.\" \"Did I put the chips on the table?\" \"No, but you played the cards.\" \"Team effort. Let's stop in New York. I want to see Phantom of the Opera.\" \"For which you already have tickets. Just like the ballet, and the opera, and the Comedy Club. And probably dinner reservations just like Spago's\" \"Opening night would be nice. Julie, you're the only one who can appreciate how much I've learned. You weren't my first teacher, but you were the one who taught me I was free. I'm showing off for my teacher. And feeling exceptionally smug.\" \"How long, Gallant?\" \"Julie, please don't ask. You really want to know, don't you? The answer will shock you. Two thousand one hundred years.\" \"Uh, I need to sit down.\" \"I told you not to ask.\" \"Next time I'll listen. You remembered a date with me for two thousand years?!\" \"It was the first I ever made. I took my time getting ready for it.\" \"Uh, huh, and I thought I took a long time in front of the mirror.\" \"Julie, I was a very young boy when I came here the first time. Call me eleven. Now I'm about twenty-two.\" \"Childlike innocence. I ignored it.\" \"Julie, yours was my first kiss. I still remember it. I'd been used for years, but never kissed. I had escaped, but you taught me I was free.\" \"Gallant, if you were that young... \" \"They call it stim. My reward for living through it was a rather abrupt introduction to a large group.\" \"There are a lot of things you haven't forgotten.\" \"I'm working on creating dusty corners for them in the attic. You, I keep on the piano in the parlor. Monte Carlo?\" \"Why not?\" **** \"You won't be back again.\" \"I don't know. Yes I do. I'll be back some day to meet your children.\" \"Be Godfather?\" \"Yes. Thank you. I love you, too. Julie, have pepperoni pizza on March eighth once in a while.\" \"Done. Thanks, Gallant. I needed something.\" \"You know, I think I'll just stop saying good-by.\" \"Not yet, but someday, I think you will.\" **** \"GALLANT!\" \"Hello, Julie. Brrr. March Eighth is a lot colder here.\" \"Hurry. Get inside. You'll freeze your ears. How did you find me? Dumb question.\" \"How did you end up in Fairbanks, Alaska?\" \"Jim. He loves it here. It's home. Now, you've got something bothering you. Tell Aunt Julie.\" He smiled. She still knew him. She'd matured well. She was even more beautiful at forty-eight than she had been at twenty-four. He told her about the dreams, but he didn't tell her how long they'd been haunting him. \"Athena. Gallant, is this the dream that gave you your name?\" \"Perceptive as ever. Yes. It's become insistent. I'm about to start in ancient Greece and look up every Athena who ever lived!\" \"You're sure she's human?\" \"Never found the name in any other culture.\" \"Wait a minute! Knew I heard a bell. Jim said something about an Athena. Last night... Yes! A lecturer at the University. No, she can't be the one. She's a geneticist. Plump and seventy-ish. Maybe she's got a granddaughter. Silly. There must be thousands of Athenas.\" \"True, but I had to come here. Now. Ah, hello, you must be Jim.\" \"And you can only be Gallant. Welcome. I've been waiting to meet you for a very long time. You're responsible for my meeting Julie.\" \"I am?!\" \"Yes. I delivered a pepperoni pizza to her on March eighth in ninety-two and stayed to find out why she was smiling and crying. Never left. She was the most beautiful girl I ever met and her best friend was an angel named Gallant. She was either crazy or special. Took me at least two seconds to decide which.\" \"Took him two hours to propose.\" \"Took you two hours to get dressed.\" \"We got married March Eighth, Gallant. Twenty-three years ago. In Las Vegas.\" \"That's the most wonderful story I ever heard.\" \"WOW! It's him, isn't it?\" \"Yes Alice, it's him. Gallant, our daughter Alice. Your oldest Godchild.\" \"You, my dear, are as beautiful as your mother.\" \"You're right, Mom. He definitely knows how to deliver a compliment. So, Gallant, how are you at hugs?\" \"Come here and I'll let you decide.\" **** \"Anyway, she's got this project going, Gallant. Long term thing. Genetic selection. No real meddling. Just pick the best. You know; long life, strong bones, good teeth. With current life expec running about eighty in healthy enviros, she figures two cen by proj culm. Bout one cen from now.\" \"Despite the verbal shorthand, I got all that. And you signed up for it.\" \"Shh, don't tell Mom and Dad.\" \"Tell us what, Alice? Oh, the project. Well, it makes me a bit nervous, but your father says it sounds reasonable.\" \"You know, Mom, I bet they find a gene for mind reading when they run mine. Where's Ben?\" \"Brenda called to say she'd be late. Study group.\" \"I don't believe it. Mom, she's out with that guy again. Yeah, you think so too. Dad?\" \"Trying just as hard as I am to trust her.\" \"Well I'm not a parent. I don't have to. I'm going looking. He gives me the crawlies. And he's the best of that crowd he runs with. Uh, oh. Mom, what'd I do? Why's he staring--\" \"Shh! He's listening.\" \"Alice, get your vehicle. I'm coming with you. Let's go. Julie, we'll find her. Move, Alice!\" The place Alice thought Brenda had gone, with the boy she didn't like, was just a few blocks away. When she stopped the car, the stench of evil was so strong, Gallant couldn't feel the direction it was coming from. \"Where?\" \"That house.\" \"Stay here.\" \"No way, Gallant. I don't have the gas to sit and run it and I'd freeze.\" \"All right, but stay behind me and be prepared to duck. Alice, if I find what I think I will, don't watch. That's an order, not a request.\" \"One of those dark brother things.\" \"I don't give orders for other reasons.\" \"Understood.\" Now he knew why he was in Fairbanks, why Athena had sent him. She'd sent him eight times before. There were three left. One of them was Hensk, but not this one. He went through the door. It would probably have been locked anyway. The stench of evil sickened him. Somewhere in here was his Godchild. Alice watched him go through about ten people, then ducked and turned away. He was right. She didn't want to watch. She knew when it was over, but she didn't turn around. She could feel he didn't want her to. \"Alice, get her home. I'll be there soon. She's asleep. She won't remember anything after she left school. Tell her she hit her head.\" \"How will you get there?\" \"I'll run. It's cold. Go on. You can carry her.\" \"I know that. She weighs less than I do. Thanks, Gallant.\" \"Thank Athena. She sent me. Now go. I've got to get these boys out. When I destroy the ship, it'll take the house with it. Go!\" He carried them out quickly. He could already hear sirens. Someone had called the authorities. The two blankets he'd found would be enough. They wouldn't freeze. He slipped the medunit back in his pocket and checked every room to make sure he hadn't missed anyone. That's when he found the kittens. He knew Mama was dead. He tucked the three tiny things in his shirt, put in the destruct code he'd programmed nearly nine thousand years before and ran for the door. He ran through the night, holding the kittens in his shirt with one hand to keep them from being bounced. He was delighted to see the lights of Julie's house. It was cold. The run hadn't been long enough to really warm him. He ran in the kitchen door. He didn't realize someone had been following him. \"Get me warm milk and an eyedropper or something. They're starving.\" \"I know better. Five min, Gallant.\" \"All right, Jim. Julie, your entire family speaks shorthand.\" \"Do? Yeah. Guess. Comes of closeness.\" \"It's more than that. Alice may be right. They may find something very interesting in her genes. How is she?\" \"Which one?\" \"I know how Brenda is. Alice.\" \"Fine. Waiting by Brenda to give her your story. How bad was she?\" \"Julie, she's fine now.\" \"In other words, you'd rather not tell me and I ought to have sense enough not to push it. All right. She's fine now. Her godfather fixed her.\" \"Yes. I'm hoping to get a hug from her mother for it. Shh. Julie, it's over. All the kittens are safe at home.\" \"How many left, Gallant?\" \"Two.\" \"Yes, but it doesn't end there does it? You could still be killed by one of the ones you killed in your future. I mean... \" \"Yes, but I have it on good authority I won't be.\" \"Athena again.\" \"She's waiting for me. Four times. As four different people. You know, Alice's project... I'm not sure.\" \"Bad?\" \"No, not really important in the long run, but no problem.\" \"Don't tell her that. She has designs on an MD and a slot on it. Loves genetics. Intensely curious about yours.\" \"Tell her I have an extra pair of chromosomes. And no one else on my home planet does.\" \"Oh, Gallant!\" \"I've known a long time. I'm as different from them as I am from you. And I like you better. They're boring!\" \"Here. Hit up Bill Aikens. Vet. Caught him as he was pulling in the drive. He said twenty cc's every two til they're stuffed. Form mixes with warm water.\" \"Thank you, Jim. All right, little one. Let's get you stuffed. Yes, hungry. Poor baby.\" Julie went to find Alice and discovered Brenda was awake. She laid a finger to her lips, smiled and led them to the kitchen. They stood quietly in the doorway and watched Gallant feed the three tiny kittens. He held the tiny life so gently in his big, beautiful, hands. And his smile was so soft. **** \"Mom, he's gone.\" \"I know, Alice.\" \"He didn't even say good-by.\" \"Alice, it hurts him terribly to say it. He's said it far too often.\" \"Yeah, too often. I understand. Will he be back?\" \"I don't know, but we'll make sure we have pepperoni pizza on March eighth. Just in case he shows up for a slice.\" The dark brother was angered at the loss of another of his kind. He traced the woman back though time. He would find the escaped one at their first meeting and destroy him before any of his brethren died. He laughed. The foolish slave had even left the door to his ship open. He would herd him to it and be waiting within.",

Do you suppose it's their long lives that make them weak?\" \"They call themselves civilized. I find them boring. They live millennia and never live at all. Lord, the instruments say his mind is worth harnessing.\" \"Excellent. Buy him.\" \"He is expensive. He's the scion of one of their great houses.\" \"Very nice. I've never owned a king before. I think I'll just take the one. He will fill all three roles. That should make Lord Rorisk take note.\" \"A charming idea. He'll require intense physical training. It will reduce his useful time in the mind/comp link.\" \"And enhance his beauty. A fair trade. Stim him.\" \"Temporary?\" \"No. In fact, give him all four of the stimulation's. Let's see if they work on this weak-willed race.\" \"Do you wish the experiment documented?\" \"Of course. Wipe his name carefully, Demisk.\" \"And what shall I put in its place?\" \"Nothing. Leave him nameless. Leave his knowledge of his station among his people, if possible.\" \"A nameless, wanton, king. My Lord, you have a wonderful humor.\" **** \"Gallant.\" He moaned softly in his sleep. She had come again. \"Take heart, Gallant. You will free them all. Learn, my gallant one. Do all they ask. Build for them. That which they seek is their destruction and freedom for this world. Build. Come to me.\" He awoke in desperate need of her. The emptiness she left, he could only suffer. He carefully hid the name she called him. He would not share the gift she had given until his people were free. He grasped her promise of freedom and fought to stay alive. He heard them coming again. \"Well, Demisk?\" \"Amazing! He's stronger! My Lord, none of the others have been successful. He's the only one that's lived through the first stim.\" \"I've made several large wagers he'll survive all four. Give him his reward for surviving. Document it carefully. I'll show the record at the banquet.\" \"Take him to room three. How many, Lord?\" \"Ten of the stimmed oriki. Hungry ones.\" He lowered his fevered body into the swirling waters of the pool set in one corner of the room. The chain on the collar he wore was just long enough to reach it. A reward for surviving? What were oriki? What were the multitude of holographic lenses set in the walls and ceiling to record? He hated the collar and its chain. He wondered if they knew. He'd never hated before the stim. He smiled softly. It was probably a side effect. Side effects were dangerous. He intended they learn the fact well. \"Hello, pretty thing. Come out of the pool.\" \"I'd rather not.\" \"We are in need of you. Won't you aid us?\" \"Who are you?\" \"We are women of the oriki. Help us.\" \"I'm currently not much help to myself.\" \"Oh, but you will be of great aid to us. Come.\" He really didn't have any choice. Three of the women were pulling on the chain on his collar. There were ten of them. They were quite beautiful; long dark hair, large green eyes, and skin of pale aqua. He didn't understand what was happening to his body. It must be due to the stim. One of the women touched him. \"Please, I don't understand what's happening. Please, don't touch me.\" \"Foolish boy, you are a slave. As are we. You have no choices.\" **** \"Where did you find him?\" \"In the market.\" \"Then he's of high rank. Responds well.\" \"He's been stimmed, Rorisk.\" \"Stimmed?! Hensk, none of these soft people survive stim.\" \"This one has. It's fully documented. I'll arrange a private showing for you.\" \"Hensk, you're after a favor. What is it?\" \"I'm going to enter him in the combats, if he survives the entire set of stims. I want your trainer to teach him.\" \"Leave him while I watch the documentation. If he survives, I'll lend you my trainer.\" \"Demisk, have him prepared for Lord Rorisk.\" **** \"He has potential, Master Demisk.\" \"My lord believes so. He has survived all the stims.\" \"Good. Too often, I'm given ones to train that have only had the body stimmed. Combat is as much of the mind. Do I have his full time, or is he in other use?\" \"He is, but my lord will reduce his link time with the computers to three hours per day during his training.\" \"Reduce?! How much is he on now?\" \"Twenty-two hours. He is given four of rest.\" \"He may be interesting to train. I ask the lord schedule his link time with regularity. It will aid his training.\" \"He has already done so. You have him but the first three hours of the day.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk. Good. Now that he's gone, let's get acquainted. Do you have a name?\" \"No. It was taken.\" \"Sounds like Hensk. Been pretty heavily used, haven't you, boy?\" \"Since I haven't had a chance to compare notes with anyone, I've got no basis to judge, but I definitely have been busy.\" \"Hold still. I'm going to look you over. Now, now, don't tense. I won't hurt... Oh, I see. A blush. You've not been broken by it. You'll learn control.\" \"That would be much appreciated. Just once I'd like to... \" \"Not respond to every touch instantly.\" \"It would be pleasant not to have my body temperature rise at a tap on the shoulder.\" \"And if I teach you to fight, what will you do?\" \"Fight.\" \"Yes, you'll do.\" They became friends. The old trainer had been seeking someone like him for a very long time. He held his dream of freedom in his heart and trained the boy. Lord Hensk had made an error. He had created a hero. The old trainer would teach him to be a warrior. **** \"What effect did the last three stims have on you?\" \"None that I could tell. No, one. I'm faster, but that may be due to the training. \"Yes. I don't think any of them worked. Well, the first lowered your thresholds, but that's all. Have you always been different from the rest of your people? \"Trainer, I am a child. I don't know. I have no other children to compare myself with, though I know I am quite large for my age.\" \"A child?\" \"Yes, I am but... I do not know my years, but perhaps I can give you information which is useful to you. Ah, I know. The first stim. It nearly killed me. I was far too young to have sexual maturity forced on me.\" \"You were prepubescent?!\" \"Very. At what age does your species mature?\" \"About fourteen.\" \"Then I was a child of... This is difficult. I lost so much when my name was taken. I am of a great house. None would have spoken to me without my name and title and the taking of it... I know that I am very young. Perhaps, between twenty and thirty. In comparison with your people... physically nine or ten. I had no body hair until the stim. I'm still a bit smug about it.\" \"Oh, my son, the cruelty of what was done to you makes me ache.\" \"Don't. There's already too much pain around me.\" \"Boy, I've seen the documentation of the first stim.\" \"That was an interesting experience. I had no idea what those women wanted.\" \"It didn't take you long to learn.\" \"I learn fast. Trainer, I like this weapon. Its simplicity... attracts me.\" \"The staff? Yes, I like it too. A simple wooden shaft. Boy, I can't pretend to teach you longer. You know all I know.\" \"Thank you. I'll use it well.\" \"You know I won't return. My master is already unhappy he gave Hensk my use.\" \"Strange. At the time, he seemed to feel your use for mine was a fair exchange.\" \"Lean near. When you destroy them, let me kill Rorisk for what he did to you.\" He smiled at his only friend. \"I love you too. And I promise I'll remember. Thank you.\" **** \"Master, the direct mind link obstructs my work.\" \"In what way?\" \"It tells me the lord seeks the impossible. I know it is incorrect. I can vision it, but in the link, I know the vision is incorrect. I ask to use the physical station. I cannot override the computational limits while the matrices hold my mind.\" \"The link has been known to limit creativity. I will put your request to the lord.\" \"Thank you, Master Demisk.\" \"He is pleased with you. Your sweep of the combats has made him the envy of his peers. They have requested you be provided at tonight's banquet. Entertain them well. Go to the preparation chamber. The attendants await you. Now, boy!\" \"Yes, Master.\" He ran to the chamber. He'd hesitated. That kind of mistake could cost him his life. \"Entertain them\" meant Rorisk was coming. He was so close to the answer. He had to get out of the link. He didn't intend his master to have what he would build. Or, not all of what he would build. The link would give him away, note the discrepancy in his request. She had come again and told him to build the twelve plus one. The plus-one was to be his. The attendants prepared him and he learned he had been right. Rorisk was at the banquet. \"He doesn't respond as well.\" \"Rorisk, he was fresh stimmed. Although, it may be the link. It is draining.\" \"Better. It just took a bit. How much time does he spend in it?\" \"Twenty-two per day.\" \"That's twice recommended!\" \"Yes, but other than slowing his response, it's had no ill effects. I have him on project three. I expect results within a twelveday.\" \"If you get them, you'll get a ministry.\" \"I'd get one eventually without it. I'm more interested in the project itself. I need a very rare element to complete it. I wish an interview with your uncle.\" \"The emperor?! You must be very sure you'll succeed.\" \"This one is. Aren't you, boy.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Hensk, project three is a dream. No one really expects it to be completed. The tools don't exist.\" \"You are touching the tool I created to build it. His mind is like no other. Before the stim, he was over the tenth rank of intelligence.\" \"OVER! Impossible! Nothing in existence is over the tenth rank.\" \"He is. On both scales, physical and mental. Unique in the universe. Are you pleased to know that, boy?\" \"No, Lord Master.\" \"Why not?\" \"It means I am alone.\" \"Very good. Yes, without another of your kind, but I shall solve that for you. I'm having females of your species prepared. You wish to speak?\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" \"Speak.\" \"There are no females of my species. My Lord Master has told me I am unique.\" \"Very good. Very good. Consider yourself as being bred to another species.\" \"Yes, Lord Master.\" **** \"I will return, Kirel.\" \"From the photosphere of a star? And if you do succeed, why would you come back? You could be free.\" \"And leave my children?\" \"Are they yours? They're not like you. They're merely children of my race. You've never even seen them. They're just a few among many. A failed breeding. You couldn't find them if you searched.\" \"Then I will claim all children as mine.\" \"You'll claim nothing. You're a nameless slave. Haven't the ten years you've been one taught you anything?\" \"Yes. They've taught me patience.\" **** \"Hensk, you're a fool. He'll never return.\" \"Wrong, Rorisk. He thinks he has children here. He believes, if he succeeds, I'll give them to him.\" \"And he has no children?\" \"None. He's not mature yet. The physicians estimate it will be hundreds of years before he's capable of siring offspring. I had them change his genetic structure. His children will ripen far sooner, but it will still be hundreds of years before he sires them. The first thing I shall do with project three is collect them. Perhaps, I'll give them to him. Did your uncle grant my request?\" \"Yes. Five point two akits of the element will be sent to you. In return, he will receive eleven of the machines.\" \"I shall need only one. Did he speak of his plans for them?\" \"Yes. He'll use them to direct the evolution of the recalcitrant worlds.\" \"Excellent. The yumari are beautiful. I shall enjoy having them as obedient slaves.\" \"His thought exactly. When we decide we want them, they'll surrender without a struggle. He's already chosen his agents.\" \"The priests of Denskarra?\" \"Hensk, you astound me. Yes, the dark brothers. They have pledged to do as he requests in this galaxy if he gives them freedom to do as they wish in the others.\" \"The servants of the Dark One will cleanse the universe of life. I am not sure I trust them to allow life in this one.\" \"He pointed out, if they destroyed it here, they would not exist and would be unable to cleanse it elsewhere.\" \"Our emperor is a wise and devious man.\" \"Yes. My uncle serves the Dark One well.\" **** \"Lord Master, the time ships are complete.\" \"You wish a reward. Speak it.\" \"I ask for my children, Lord Master.\" \"With this ship, I have the power to grant your request. You have no children in this time. So I shall find them in another and bring them to you. You are a nameless slave. Your children shall be the same.\" \"NO!\" He broke free of his guards and ran. He heard Hensk's laughter mocking him. Slaves could not escape. There was nowhere to escape to. He ran by the keyboard and triggered the mechanism. He had little time before it engaged. He dove into the corner and laughed, as he closed the matrix. He had an escape. The thirteenth ship formed around him. Now to free a world and distract the dark brothers. The mechanism engaged. The oldest race stepped from their suddenly opened cells and walked away from the guards holding useless weapons. The power satellites were torches in the sky. The densk fled the crumbling city. Fled to ships that would not fly. The one they had been given to free them had completed his task. They were really very proud of him. They hadn't expected him to accomplish it for several hundred years. The child had freed his foster parents while still an infant. The slaves of other races extracted revenge. An old man happily told Rorisk why he was strangling him. The densk disappeared from the planet. One scream at a time. When they were gone, the elder race sent four to restore the ships. The freed of other races had transport home. They would free their worlds. All that would remain of the servants of the Dark One that had infested their galaxy were the eleven priests and the one lord. The child would keep them from inflicting great harm. They tapped the energy source he had created and engaged the great defenses that had been awaiting it. They reached into the mind of the child with the key they had been given and freed his powers. **** \"Gallant, you are not forever alone. I await beyond time. You will find my aspects, but you must search. Each will give you love, but you will leave two and one shall leave you. They do not know I am within them. I await you. My fathers love you. Look for me. Know me by my name. Athena.\" \"ATHENA!\" He awoke at the sound of his own shout. He pulled himself to the console. He must complete the ship. The formless space around him was dizzying. He began programming a reality within it. He wanted much more than he had given the other twelve ships he'd created. He wondered if those who had them would ever realize he had deliberately made them small, boxy, and very noisy. Would they ever know infinity lay behind the noisy walls of the inaccessible engine room? The thought of Hensk trying to sleep in the tiny cabin with the roar of the engines ringing in his ears pleased him. He poured his dreams into the program. All the rooms he'd dreamed. All the gardens he'd only imagined. All the laboratories, studios, pools, the libraries and the banks and banks of computer storage he would someday fill. He gave his ship an exterior reality, then built the program to dematerialize it to land. He smiled. He doubted any of the twelve in the timeships he'd built would look beyond to see what the power to dematerialize truly meant. He laughed when he noticed he'd found a way to create little pockets of timelessness. They'd be very handy. He began programming the life support structure and gravity. He'd found he didn't care for weightlessness. He entered the last command. The ship would gather information from all available sources. He leapt onto the console. It would be the only stable item. Even the floor, chair, and bubble of atmosphere he'd created would be changed. He leaned down and tapped the pad to run the program. He wandered through the ship. He kept getting lost. He loved it. His existence had been limited to a corridor of cells, an arena, link room, preparation room and Hensk's banquet halls. He vaguely remembered wide streets and green lands. He tried to remember his mother, but no image would come. He had one clear memory of learning at a station and a man's smile and nod he had done well. He knew he was very young and from a great house, but that was all. Hensk had taken his name, and with it, every voice that had ever spoken it. **** \"Hey! You're stepping on my tulips!\" \"Oh! I'm sorry. I was looking at--\" \"Whoa! Are you all right?\" \"I really doubt it. Can you understand me?\" \"That's a very strange question. Of course I can. Look you'd better sit down. Here. Lawn chair. Would a glass of water help?\" \"Thank you, Mistress.\" \"You sit right there and I'll go in and get you one.\" Julie sighed as she walked into the house. An angel had just tromped her tulips, swayed dizzily when she spoke to him, then been totally amazed when she offered him a chair and a glass of water. Typical Saturday in LA. Too bad he was on something. When she carried the water out, he was staring down at the city from the middle of her tulip bed again. \"You're in my tulips.\" \"I've been very careful not to step on them. It's murky. Smells awful.\" \"The air or the water?\" \"The air, but I think the water may qualify as well.\" \"Out of towner. Tourist?\" \"Definitely.\" \"Yeah, the LA smog is pretty intense the first time. You get used to it. Today's not bad. Pretty good onshore flow.\" \"You've got to be joking! The hydrocarbon by-products are absolutely noxious! Fossil fuel?\" \"You're beginning to make me nervous.\" \"Probably not half as nervous as I am. I'm sorry. I'll leave. Your tulips attracted me, then I saw the view... Yes, I should definitely leave. Would you answer one more very strange question? What's the name of this world?\" \"You're the most gorgeous man I've ever seen and you're crazy. Just my luck. The world is Earth. Now go before your keepers tromp my tulips trying to catch you.\" \"Yes, I should get back to my ship. She'll have most of the information I need by now. Thank you for your kindness, Lady.\" \"Hold it. You're bleeding.\" \"Yes, but it's minor. One of the dark brothers found me too far from my ship. It's the first time I ever made that mistake. I shall not make it again.\" \"Sit down. I'll clean it up. Who'd you run into? One of the Bloods? I've seen them in the neighborhood.\" \"Bloods?\" \"Gangs. Where are you from, anyway?\" \"Somehow, I doubt you'd believe me.\" \"Try me.\" \"Well, I'm eight galaxies and several hundred years from my home world.\" \"You're right. I don't believe you. That knock on the head shook something loose. I'll probably be sorry I did this, but come inside and I'll get you... What are you doing?\" \"Listening. RUN! Don't argue!\" He grabbed her hand, then scooped her up and carried her. They'd found him already. Somehow, they were tracking him. He dodged the beam fire and ran for his ship. The Earth girl was hardly a hindrance. She was very light. He thanked the Powers he hadn't locked his ship. He ran through the door, slammed it and dematerialized. Since they were tracking him, it made no sense to leave. \"LOOK OUT!\" He spun and saw the girl on the back of the hooded figure of a dark brother. She'd saved his life. Now he needed to save hers. She'd kept the brother from using his weapon, but she was merely a temporary hindrance. He ran to aid her. When the dark one struck her, something happened inside him. He screamed in rage and killed it. He began to shake in reaction and shock. Julie was kind of surprised she woke up. The guy in the hood didn't look like he was going to. Necks didn't bend like that. She realized she was hearing whimpering. Soft, terrified, crying. It was her angel. He was curled in a corner. \"Shh. It's all right. You got him. He can't hurt us now.\" \"I... I killed him. I didn't intend it, but he hit you. I lost control. He really didn't have a chance. He was helpless and I killed him.\" \"Helpless?! He was trying very hard to fry you with that gun! If I hadn't yelled, he'd have succeeded! You saved your life and probably mine! You've... never killed anything before, have you? Nothing.\" \"I've never seen anything die.\" \"I hope I wake up and find out this is all pepperoni pizza. Look, I'm Julie. What's your name.\" \"I haven't got one. They took it.\" She decided to call it pepperoni pizza and get on with it. It was either that or have screaming meemies. \"Who took it?\" \"The Lord Master's servants. He never allowed me to have one. It pleased him to use me nameless.\" \"All right. From the top. Where are we?\" \"My ship.\" \"And where did you get the ship?\" \"I built it. I built all the ships.\" \"Who did you build the ships for?\" \"My master. It was my labor of twelve years.\" \"And who was this master?\" \"Lord Hensk.\" \"The one who took your name? So, why'd you work for him?\" \"The question is meaningless to me?\" \"Why'd you work for some creep that... took your name?\" \"I was too young to wish to die. Nameless ones were only fed if the master remembered to order it. My master usually remembered.\" \"Wait a minute. Are you talking about... slavery?\" \"Yes, but I ended it. I burned out the power satellites. I fed the power of the star I harnessed through them. Without power, weapons would not work and locks would open. The servants of the Dark One could not have stopped my people leaving.\" \"So you started a slave revolt and your people got rid of these servant guys.\" \"No. They would have just left. Although, some of the other imprisoned species may have destroyed them. My trainer wanted to kill his master. Perhaps I am guilty of two deaths. I told him thank you, instead of no.\" \"If you freed them, why didn't you stay?\" \"I had set twelve servants of the Dark One loose in the universe. I decided, if they were chasing me, they'd be too busy to destroy unsuspecting worlds. I must find his ship and destroy it.\" \"I was right the first time. You're an angel. A complete innocent. Well, LA can change that in a hurry. Why am I doing this? Come on. Let's get you some survival skills. Wait a minute. I'm not thinking straight. Where are his friends?\" \"Friends?\" \"Yeah. You know. The ones that took potshots at us on the hill.\" \"Oh, that was him. He just kept landing a few seconds further in the future and trying again, then he went back to the past and laid an ambush in here.\" \"I see. He had a time machine.\" \"That's what the ships are. It's why I have to keep the dark brothers busy.\" She giggled. She just couldn't help it. She was sitting on the floor of a good-size room, that couldn't be in her yard, talking in calm tones about a dead man that hopped around in a time machine, built by an angel, who... Too much. \"All right. Are any more likely to show up?\" \"No. I don't know how he followed me. When I locate his ship, I hope to learn.\" \"OK, let's find his ship. What do you want to do with him?\" \"Leave him. My ship will dispose of him. He is a... contaminant. She'll feel the evil and rid herself of it.\" \"She didn't before.\" \"But he was alive then. He isn't now.\" \"Now stop that. No more crying. Ship, get that thing out of here. WOW! Did I do that?\" \"I think she agreed with you.\" \"I feel like Alice in Wonderland. Come on, little white wabbit. Let's find a ship and then you'll only have eleven chasing you.\" \"I hadn't thought of that. What's a wabbit?\" She had pepperoni pizza delivered. It just seemed appropriate. He loved it. **** \"You have to have a name.\" \"I like Wabbit.\" \"No. That's just between us. Hasn't anyone ever called you anything but--ooh, I hate this-- slave, or boy?\" \"Only in a dream. I once said I would use the name if I freed my world.\" \"Well, don't you think it's time you dusted it off and stuck it on?\" \"Julie, I like this world. Your people have wonderful ways to say things. 'Yo, bro.' 'Hey, dude.' 'What's shakin'?' So many greetings.\" \"The name.\" \"I've never said it before.\" \"And you never will, at this rate. Say it.\" \"Gallant.\" \"Yes! Perfect! It fits you. Belongs. See, you did know your name. OK, Gallant, you've watched four days of TV. You understand the difference between fiction and reality and you have a name. Want to meet some people? Don't look so shocked. I'm dying to show you off. You're an incredible blond hunk. Just one thing. Don't dance slow with anyone but me. Two heartbeats would land you in some government research lab. Probably in pieces.\" \"E.T.\" \"Yeah, E.T. all the way. Did you figure it out? Why we understand each other?\" \"Yes, but I'm afraid to tell you.\" \"Why?\" \"E.T.\" \"Gallant, I doubt you'll send me running to the gov at this point.\" \"I'm a telepath.\" \"Yeah. Makes sense. Why haven't you... read anyone?\" \"That would be very impolite!\" \"Yep. Gallant. Change clothes. Not here! In the bedroom.\" She shook her head and laughed. Carla would never believe she'd stopped a beautiful man from stripping in front of her. She wasn't sure she believed it. It was the innocence. It made him seem like a child. \"Wow! I think I bought those jeans a bit small. They look like they were sprayed on.\" \"They said, 'shrink to fit,' so I used hot water and air to make them smaller. Perhaps I should have stopped after the first wash, but they didn't look like the ones you wear.\" \"Caught. Come on, gorgeous, let's go strut our tight pants.\" **** \"Get away from him, or I'll break your limp wrist.\" \"Ooh, aren't you the possessive one.\" \"Gallant? Hey, you! Come back here a minute!\" \"Look, Missy, I am not… He looks like he's in shock.\" \"I think he was badly abused.\" \"I think you're right. Let's see if this works. Take his hand and gently massage it. See if you can get his attention.\" The rather attractive man sat down on the floor in Gallant's line of sight. It was obviously for a reason. It was going to leave a large dirty smudge on his immaculate white pants. It surprised her a bit when he assumed lotus position and closed his eyes. They were beginning to attract attention. Gallant suddenly blinked and turned to look at her and she sighed in relief. \"Gallant! Are you OK?\" \"Yes. Just a bad memory.\" \"I'm sorry I brought it back. I'm Chuck.\" \"Gallant, tell Chuck he's forgiven.\" \"Forgiven. No, wait. Thank you for the compliment, Chuck, but I like girls.\" \"Thanks, Chuck.\" \"You're more than welcome, Julie. I have a friend to tell her 'technique' worked. I'll have some friends help watch pushy types don't head this way. There are a few.\" \"I like this world.\" \"World?\" \"L.A.'s pretty far out, Chuck. Different world.\" \"Especially this part of it. Julie, the Boulevard might not have been the best place to bring him.\" \"Yes it was, Chuck. Anyplace else, we wouldn't have met you. Right, Gallant?\" \"Yes. It was nice meeting you, Chuck.\" \"Never met anyone whose name fit better. Later.\" \"He liked my name, Julie. He thought it fit.\" \"Yeah. He liked the way your pants fit, too.\" \"Yes. That too.\" She burst into giggles and he smiled. \"I felt you both calling me, Julie. He was… very focused.\" \"I noticed that lotus position was practiced.\" \"Dance with me. I've watched. I know who you think looks well. I won't look foolish and embarrass you.\" \"You peeked.\" \"Only at your face as you watched them. You see? It made you mistrust me.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Forgive me?\" \"I will, if you dance with me.\" \"Blackmail. I love it.\" \"I learn quickly. **** \"Gallant, get your head back in the van.\" \"Your moon is so beautiful. I've never seen a more beautiful world.\" \"How many have you seen?\" \"Hundreds, but this is the first I landed on with people. I'm glad. Humans are wonderful!\" \"You're bombed out of your mind.\" \"Julie, can we stop? I want to walk in the moonlight by the sea.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind. There's a beach I like just ahead, Leo Carillo. We'll go home through Topanga Canyon after daybreak. Want to show you some forest. We'll nap in the back of the van. Gallant, I've got to go back to work Monday. My vacation's over.\" \"I know. You've been looking at the calendar and sighing for two days. I'm glad I tromped your tulips on your vacation. You've been a wonderful teacher. YES!\" She laughed and turned the lights off. He'd been out and running for the beach before she'd gotten the brake on. She grabbed a jacket for herself and a blanket for him. She just knew he was going to get wet. She ran after him. His laughter stopped her cold. It was... wild. She sat down in the sand and cried for him. He'd been caged for so long. His spirit was just learning to be free. \"You're crying. What did I do?\" \"Not you, Gallant. The past.\" \"My past. Your tears are for me. May I kiss you?\" \"I'd like it very much.\" \"You'll... \" \"What is it?\" \"You'll have to teach me how.\" She decided he had a gift for understatement. He learned very fast. **** \"Julie... \" \"You're leaving.\" \"I never said good-by before. It hurts.\" \"Yes, it does. Gallant, don't forget me.\" \"Never. Julie, may I come back someday? Take you dancing? Show you all I've learned?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"One year from the day I tromped your tulips. Is it a date?\" \"I'll mark it on the calendar. See you March Eighth, Nineteen Ninety-one.\" \"In your tulips.\" \"I'll be there.\" **** Gallant knew how much he still had to learn. Of course he chose Earth as the place to learn it. \"All right, Mike, what are you laughing about?\" \"Clara, I've been drafted. It seems I'm about to go to war.\" \"You're the last decent young man in this neighborhood. The young ladies will miss you.\" \"Oh, I'll be back. The war won't last too much longer. We'll beat them.\" \"When do you report?\" \"By the day after tomorrow, but I'm going to the recruiter today.\" \"Give the Kaiser a punch on the nose for me.\" \"I will, Clara. Would it be all right if I left my things here?\" \"Of course. You've become more like family than a boarder in the last two years. The only family I've got. Outlived all the others. Mike, if I'm not here when you get back, the place is yours.\" \"Clara... \" \"Now don't argue. I did it months ago. I've got no one else to give it to.\" \"Thank you. I love you, too.\" \"Oh, go on. Say good-by to all the pretty young things you squire around.\" She died before he got back to the big house in Chicago. He signed the documents that had been awaiting the return of 'Sergeant Gallant' and took possession. He aired out the closed house, repaired the damage two years of emptiness had caused and settled into life in the time known as the roaring twenties. He began establishing the identity of a nephew. He'd need it before too many years passed. He talked about his nephew a great deal to the others at his place of employment and the people on his beat. He'd gotten the job by a bit of hypnosis. The physician who checked him hadn't noticed his two hearts. He became one of Chicago's finest and helped fight the lawlessness of the gangs. **** He dragged himself from the lake and sought shelter from the biting wind. They'd disposed of the 'body' of Detective Gallant in their usual effective manner. He almost hadn't gotten out of the chains they'd weighted him with in time. It had been very close. He dragged his shattered body to the shelter of an empty beach house and sank into trance. He hadn't been hurt as badly since Hensk had dropped a building on him. When he left the house more than a month later, he was nearly an inch taller. He carefully replaced all the food he'd used, then went to collect his inheritance. Mitchell Gallant looked a lot like his uncle Mike. He needed a place to live. So many had lost everything when the great drought had turned dreams to dust. **** \"Mitch, that laugh of yours sends chills through me. It's... I don't know. Wild. Crazy.\" \"Yeah, I've been told that before. You guys stay here. I'm going to see if I can get close enough to lob a grenade into that machine gun nest. You'll know if I make it.\" \"Sarge, be careful.\" \"Always am. I like being alive.\" \"Jesus, Joey, do you think he really believes that?\" \"Mac, I gave up second guessing the sarge a year ago. I just wait for his eyes to go glittery, then duck.\" \"Sometimes I think he's crazy. Especially when he laughs like that.\" \"If he's crazy, it's the best kind. We've been in practically every battle in Europe and he's kept all of us alive. All but Smitty.\" \"The guy I replaced?\" \"Yeah, kid. The only one the sarge ever lost. Sat and cried when he got hit, then took apart the patrol that got him. Never seen anything like it. Look, one thing you gotta' know. None of us talk about the sarge. We don't mention the things he does. He wants it that way. He'll keep you alive, kid. So just you don't say nothin' about him. Ever.\" \"But he's a hero. He should get promoted and decorated.\" \"You make a fuss, someone'll check him out. He don't want that and, if you're smart, neither do you.\" \"Why? What's wrong with him?\" \"Nothin's wrong with him. He's as good a man as ever lived. Better than any I ever met. Just don't talk about him.\" \"Man, you're serious, aren't you? Why, Joey?\" \"'Cause he ain't human. We all know. We seen him get near blown apart. We kept quiet and hid him 'til he healed. Took near a month, but we managed to cover for him. You don't believe me. OK, watch. Go on. You ever seen a man run that fast?\" \"Jesus! What is he?!\" \"An angel. Our very own guardian angel. Anzio to Omaha. Now, kid, you gonna' keep quiet?\" Mac looked around at the men in the ditch with him. They were waiting for his answer. \"I didn't see anything to talk about. Just a real good sergeant I was lucky to get.\" He smiled as the men around him grinned and turned back to watch \"a real good sergeant\" take out the enemy gun emplacement that had them pinned down. **** He loved the post-war years. Right up until the time 'Manny Gallant' was drafted. He sat down and laughed until he cried. The war was in Korea and they called it a \"police action.\" Another group of men agreed he was just a real good sergeant. He grew another half inch, but he didn't lose any men. He saw it coming, but didn't try to avoid it, just kept traveling with the Daredevils. He'd found a shape he and his ship both liked. She was a small silver travel trailer. He loved riding motorcycles and traveling the country with the show. It was one of the happiest times he'd ever known. All the Daredevils were fond of the 'kid' who had joined them. His name was Murray Gallant and he was a 'sixteen-year-old orphan' when he joined them. He was 'twenty-three' when he was drafted to go to Vietnam. Butch settled down and let him park the trailer he called \"Alice\" in his garage. The kid had grown a bit when he came back. **** He left the world he'd called home for nearly a hundred years and set out to explore other worlds. He spent nearly two thousand years learning the ways of other worlds and fighting to keep them safe. He became a student. On Earth. He smiled in satisfaction when he burned his draft card in front of the campus administration building in nineteen sixty-nine. Alex Gallant would not go. **** \"Gallant!\" \"Hello, Julie. You feel just as good as I remember.\" \"Been a lot longer than a year for you, hasn't it?\" \"Yes. I had a great deal to learn. I brought you some presents. Let's go in. Your tulips need the rain. We don't.\" \"Do they ever. It was dry again this winter. I'm afraid it's going to be a bad year for forest fires. You look wonderful, Gallant, but I don't think those jeans would fit you now.\" \"I don't think they would either. I've planned our evening. Do you mind?\" \"Not at all.\" \"Money is always a problem for me. I set up an account in your name a bit in the past. It's a trust. It matures today. Would you draw funds from it for this evening, please?\" \"Sure. How?\" \"Just call the bank. Here. This is the paperwork.\" \"Uh, I don't think I'll ask how you just made that appear like that.\" \"It's just math.\" \"Math?\" \"A lot of math. I never seem to have enough pockets, so I made a few extra.\" \"Yeah. OK. Right. Gallant, you set this up a hundred forty years ago!\" \"Yes. It seemed the most reasonable time to deposit a small amount of gold.\" \"How much should I draw?\" \"Twenty thousand should be enough. Oops. Steady.\" \"Twenty thousand?!\" \"You're quite right, fifty thousand. One shouldn't short oneself in Las Vegas.\" \"Gallant, you're grinning at me. Just how much is in this account?\" \"I don't really know, but it should make you give serious thought as to how well you really like your job. Call the bank. I'd rather not use Alice to get there before they close.\" \"Alice?\" \"You named her.\" \"Alice in Wonderland!\" \"I thought you'd remember. Call the bank.\" **** \"Monte Carlo?!\" \"Why not? You won so much in Las Vegas, you might as well play with it somewhere else.\" \"Gallant, you won it.\" \"Did I put the chips on the table?\" \"No, but you played the cards.\" \"Team effort. Let's stop in New York. I want to see Phantom of the Opera.\" \"For which you already have tickets. Just like the ballet, and the opera, and the Comedy Club. And probably dinner reservations just like Spago's\" \"Opening night would be nice. Julie, you're the only one who can appreciate how much I've learned. You weren't my first teacher, but you were the one who taught me I was free. I'm showing off for my teacher. And feeling exceptionally smug.\" \"How long, Gallant?\" \"Julie, please don't ask. You really want to know, don't you? The answer will shock you. Two thousand one hundred years.\" \"Uh, I need to sit down.\" \"I told you not to ask.\" \"Next time I'll listen. You remembered a date with me for two thousand years?!\" \"It was the first I ever made. I took my time getting ready for it.\" \"Uh, huh, and I thought I took a long time in front of the mirror.\" \"Julie, I was a very young boy when I came here the first time. Call me eleven. Now I'm about twenty-two.\" \"Childlike innocence. I ignored it.\" \"Julie, yours was my first kiss. I still remember it. I'd been used for years, but never kissed. I had escaped, but you taught me I was free.\" \"Gallant, if you were that young... \" \"They call it stim. My reward for living through it was a rather abrupt introduction to a large group.\" \"There are a lot of things you haven't forgotten.\" \"I'm working on creating dusty corners for them in the attic. You, I keep on the piano in the parlor. Monte Carlo?\" \"Why not?\" **** \"You won't be back again.\" \"I don't know. Yes I do. I'll be back some day to meet your children.\" \"Be Godfather?\" \"Yes. Thank you. I love you, too. Julie, have pepperoni pizza on March eighth once in a while.\" \"Done. Thanks, Gallant. I needed something.\" \"You know, I think I'll just stop saying good-by.\" \"Not yet, but someday, I think you will.\" **** \"GALLANT!\" \"Hello, Julie. Brrr. March Eighth is a lot colder here.\" \"Hurry. Get inside. You'll freeze your ears. How did you find me? Dumb question.\" \"How did you end up in Fairbanks, Alaska?\" \"Jim. He loves it here. It's home. Now, you've got something bothering you. Tell Aunt Julie.\" He smiled. She still knew him. She'd matured well. She was even more beautiful at forty-eight than she had been at twenty-four. He told her about the dreams, but he didn't tell her how long they'd been haunting him. \"Athena. Gallant, is this the dream that gave you your name?\" \"Perceptive as ever. Yes. It's become insistent. I'm about to start in ancient Greece and look up every Athena who ever lived!\" \"You're sure she's human?\" \"Never found the name in any other culture.\" \"Wait a minute! Knew I heard a bell. Jim said something about an Athena. Last night... Yes! A lecturer at the University. No, she can't be the one. She's a geneticist. Plump and seventy-ish. Maybe she's got a granddaughter. Silly. There must be thousands of Athenas.\" \"True, but I had to come here. Now. Ah, hello, you must be Jim.\" \"And you can only be Gallant. Welcome. I've been waiting to meet you for a very long time. You're responsible for my meeting Julie.\" \"I am?!\" \"Yes. I delivered a pepperoni pizza to her on March eighth in ninety-two and stayed to find out why she was smiling and crying. Never left. She was the most beautiful girl I ever met and her best friend was an angel named Gallant. She was either crazy or special. Took me at least two seconds to decide which.\" \"Took him two hours to propose.\" \"Took you two hours to get dressed.\" \"We got married March Eighth, Gallant. Twenty-three years ago. In Las Vegas.\" \"That's the most wonderful story I ever heard.\" \"WOW! It's him, isn't it?\" \"Yes Alice, it's him. Gallant, our daughter Alice. Your oldest Godchild.\" \"You, my dear, are as beautiful as your mother.\" \"You're right, Mom. He definitely knows how to deliver a compliment. So, Gallant, how are you at hugs?\" \"Come here and I'll let you decide.\" **** \"Anyway, she's got this project going, Gallant. Long term thing. Genetic selection. No real meddling. Just pick the best. You know; long life, strong bones, good teeth. With current life expec running about eighty in healthy enviros, she figures two cen by proj culm. Bout one cen from now.\" \"Despite the verbal shorthand, I got all that. And you signed up for it.\" \"Shh, don't tell Mom and Dad.\" \"Tell us what, Alice? Oh, the project. Well, it makes me a bit nervous, but your father says it sounds reasonable.\" \"You know, Mom, I bet they find a gene for mind reading when they run mine. Where's Ben?\" \"Brenda called to say she'd be late. Study group.\" \"I don't believe it. Mom, she's out with that guy again. Yeah, you think so too. Dad?\" \"Trying just as hard as I am to trust her.\" \"Well I'm not a parent. I don't have to. I'm going looking. He gives me the crawlies. And he's the best of that crowd he runs with. Uh, oh. Mom, what'd I do? Why's he staring--\" \"Shh! He's listening.\" \"Alice, get your vehicle. I'm coming with you. Let's go. Julie, we'll find her. Move, Alice!\" The place Alice thought Brenda had gone, with the boy she didn't like, was just a few blocks away. When she stopped the car, the stench of evil was so strong, Gallant couldn't feel the direction it was coming from. \"Where?\" \"That house.\" \"Stay here.\" \"No way, Gallant. I don't have the gas to sit and run it and I'd freeze.\" \"All right, but stay behind me and be prepared to duck. Alice, if I find what I think I will, don't watch. That's an order, not a request.\" \"One of those dark brother things.\" \"I don't give orders for other reasons.\" \"Understood.\" Now he knew why he was in Fairbanks, why Athena had sent him. She'd sent him eight times before. There were three left. One of them was Hensk, but not this one. He went through the door. It would probably have been locked anyway. The stench of evil sickened him. Somewhere in here was his Godchild. Alice watched him go through about ten people, then ducked and turned away. He was right. She didn't want to watch. She knew when it was over, but she didn't turn around. She could feel he didn't want her to. \"Alice, get her home. I'll be there soon. She's asleep. She won't remember anything after she left school. Tell her she hit her head.\" \"How will you get there?\" \"I'll run. It's cold. Go on. You can carry her.\" \"I know that. She weighs less than I do. Thanks, Gallant.\" \"Thank Athena. She sent me. Now go. I've got to get these boys out. When I destroy the ship, it'll take the house with it. Go!\" He carried them out quickly. He could already hear sirens. Someone had called the authorities. The two blankets he'd found would be enough. They wouldn't freeze. He slipped the medunit back in his pocket and checked every room to make sure he hadn't missed anyone. That's when he found the kittens. He knew Mama was dead. He tucked the three tiny things in his shirt, put in the destruct code he'd programmed nearly nine thousand years before and ran for the door. He ran through the night, holding the kittens in his shirt with one hand to keep them from being bounced. He was delighted to see the lights of Julie's house. It was cold. The run hadn't been long enough to really warm him. He ran in the kitchen door. He didn't realize someone had been following him. \"Get me warm milk and an eyedropper or something. They're starving.\" \"I know better. Five min, Gallant.\" \"All right, Jim. Julie, your entire family speaks shorthand.\" \"Do? Yeah. Guess. Comes of closeness.\" \"It's more than that. Alice may be right. They may find something very interesting in her genes. How is she?\" \"Which one?\" \"I know how Brenda is. Alice.\" \"Fine. Waiting by Brenda to give her your story. How bad was she?\" \"Julie, she's fine now.\" \"In other words, you'd rather not tell me and I ought to have sense enough not to push it. All right. She's fine now. Her godfather fixed her.\" \"Yes. I'm hoping to get a hug from her mother for it. Shh. Julie, it's over. All the kittens are safe at home.\" \"How many left, Gallant?\" \"Two.\" \"Yes, but it doesn't end there does it? You could still be killed by one of the ones you killed in your future. I mean... \" \"Yes, but I have it on good authority I won't be.\" \"Athena again.\" \"She's waiting for me. Four times. As four different people. You know, Alice's project... I'm not sure.\" \"Bad?\" \"No, not really important in the long run, but no problem.\" \"Don't tell her that. She has designs on an MD and a slot on it. Loves genetics. Intensely curious about yours.\" \"Tell her I have an extra pair of chromosomes. And no one else on my home planet does.\" \"Oh, Gallant!\" \"I've known a long time. I'm as different from them as I am from you. And I like you better. They're boring!\" \"Here. Hit up Bill Aikens. Vet. Caught him as he was pulling in the drive. He said twenty cc's every two til they're stuffed. Form mixes with warm water.\" \"Thank you, Jim. All right, little one. Let's get you stuffed. Yes, hungry. Poor baby.\" Julie went to find Alice and discovered Brenda was awake. She laid a finger to her lips, smiled and led them to the kitchen. They stood quietly in the doorway and watched Gallant feed the three tiny kittens. He held the tiny life so gently in his big, beautiful, hands. And his smile was so soft. **** \"Mom, he's gone.\" \"I know, Alice.\" \"He didn't even say good-by.\" \"Alice, it hurts him terribly to say it. He's said it far too often.\" \"Yeah, too often. I understand. Will he be back?\" \"I don't know, but we'll make sure we have pepperoni pizza on March eighth. Just in case he shows up for a slice.\" The dark brother was angered at the loss of another of his kind. He traced the woman back though time. He would find the escaped one at their first meeting and destroy him before any of his brethren died. He laughed. The foolish slave had even left the door to his ship open. He would herd him to it and be waiting within.",

Professor, I don't think it's... I think they're alien.\" \"Oh, my. Let me see that corder. Hmm. You may be right. Exhume them carefully, then we'll take them for a full scan at the university.\" \"I'd really rather you didn't.\" \"Who are you?\" \"My name is Gallant.\" \"Uh, Alan, leave it.\" \"Professor, you've got to be kidding!\" \"No, I'm not. Please don't ask questions. Go back to camp and send Mick to me. Don't talk about it, Alan.\" Gallant smiled at the confused young man. \"Alan, come here. I'll explain. Those bones are why I'm here. They have no business being on Earth. In a moment, they won't be. You're on your way back to camp to send Mick to the professor. It's been a long day. You've enjoyed it, but didn't find anything unusual.\" \"You hypnotized him.\" \"Yes, I did. How did you know who I was? You recognized my name instantly.\" \"Pepperoni pizza has been a March Eighth tradition in my family for five generations.\" \"Ah, I see. And who is Mick?\" \"My son, Miklos. I've got a thing for ancient Greece. I think it began with my name.\" \"Your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Professor Athena Buchannon. Oh, dear! What did I do?!\" She sat down next to the big, beautiful, blond, family legend and watched him. He looked pretty stunned. She wondered why she wasn't. Maybe because it was March Eighth. Or would have been by the old calendar. Suddenly an intense wave of mingled emotions washed over her. Foremost was a kind of ironic joy. \"Whoa! Warn me if you're going to let loose with a blast like that, please.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I'm a very strong empath. You just about flattened me. All right, what's with the bones?\" \"I'm not sure. Athena, are you a... I'm not sure how to ask this. Are you gene selected?\" \"Great-great-grandmother Alice's project. Yes, though it ended a while back. I didn't pick my husband from stus at the U in Alaska. They were still a bit disappointed. I'm the cream of the crop they tell me. I'm fifty-two. Got three PhD's, an MD and I'm continental martial arts champion. In the Olympics twice in biathlon. Medaled both times. My son Mick's on his way. Curious. Real curious.\" \"Hi, Mom. Uh, huh. Well, from the way you're brimming, I'd say Gallant showed up for pepperoni pizza. Hi, Gallant. I'm Mick.\" \"I take it you're an empath too.\" \"Not really. Just with Mom. Dad before he died. High psi, but no breakthrough. Just poten. What's that?\" Gallant turned the small unit over in his hands. He'd built it because Athena had told him it would be needed. \"It will give me the genetic code of the bones, their age, then destroy them. One of the dark brothers seems to have decided to meddle in Earth's distant past. The bones indicate I might have a chance at stopping him.\" \"You mean they indicate you will stop him.\" \"No, Mick, I don't. Chance exists. The course of life in the universe can be changed. Earth could become a barren ball and have always been that way. Or be totally changed. The bones merely mean I can succeed. Keyed. Stand back a bit. You too, Athena. I've never used this before and I'd rather not learn it's too wide a band by having you two disappear.\" \"Oh, terrific. Come on, Mom. Let's get uphill.\" Gallant smiled. He really liked the pair of them. He wondered where the bright coppery hair had come from. Julie's family had all had hair in varying shades of soft brown. He waited until they were some distance away, keyed the unit, then ran to join them. They watched as the ground sank very slightly in the area. \"Good. Now, let's see how I did.\" \"Gallant, I've found more bones. Hmm... NO! This gets changed! Mick, pack us. We're going with him. Do it! Send resigs to the foundation. Get a super out here for the kids.\" \"Mom, Elaine?\" \"Up to you, Mick.\" \"Athena, you aren't coming with me! I never take anyone with me!\" \"You do this time, Gallant. I'm going to do my bit to change the universe. This is probably why I was born. The other bones are yours. I'm going to see to it they're not here.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, oh.\" \"It's still too dangerous. Athena, I won't trade your lives for mine. It's been incredibly long and full. I'm sorry, I won't take you. I'll be careful.\" \"No. You'll take us or I'll hunt for your ship. It's got to be around here someplace. I'll look for it until I find it, then I'll follow. Probably take me a hundred years to figure it out, but I will. If I don't, my son, or my grandkids, or my great-grandkids, or however many it takes, will. You are not going to die in Earth's past.\" \"One of those selected genes was for stubborn!\" \"Yeah, that too. I like it when you yell at me. It's loud, but it's all exasperated 'I care' underneath.\" \"You're really determined to go with me.\" \"Yes, Gallant. There's more to it. I'm bored. I have skills that I can't use for anything but play-acting. I'm a trained researcher in a half-dozen fields that are dying out or have too many in them already. The world is a delightfully peaceful and prosperous place and it's driving me crazy.\" \"And Mick?\" \"Inseparable. Too closely linked. Elaine's his love. I can't imagine her allowing herself to be left behind. You'll like her. Gallant, she's family already and she doesn't really have other. She said she'd recognize her mother, because she's seen her on vid. We don't even need to come back. The three of us can say farewell and no one will hunt us. She's making pepperoni pizza. She loved the idea. Right in the middle of modern Greece, she's making an old Italian dish American style. Come on. She's a great cook. Almost as good as Mick. Have to say you look like you appreciate good cooking.\" \"I'm comfortable this way.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm putting us all on a training program. We're all going to be in top form when we... Gallant, you just decided to take us along, didn't you?\" \"Yes. Your empathic powers are strong.\" \"It's not that. Look at the dig, Gallant. Look close.\" \"They're gone!\" \"Yeah, both sets. There's no settled earth. We've got a chance! Come on! Let's eat!\" **** \"Damn, you're just about too gorgeous to exist. Now I see why Great-great-great-grandmother Julie called you an angel. You look like you walked out of a Renaissance painting. Gallant, we're going to tower over these people. You know, no one ever mentioned how tall you are.\" \"I wasn't. I grow a bit once in a while.\" \"Explain that. You got a real weird feeling. Come on, Gallant. You know I'm too curious to drop it.\" \"I discovered it a few thousand years ago. Now, you see, I haven't even begun explaining and you're already shocked.\" \"No, but a 'few thousand' did knock me a bit.\" \"You're sure? Well, I'd never really been hurt badly. I'd learned my body could heal itself. I drop into a trance state, light enough I can find water and food if I must, during it. It's not restful. I sleep an approximately equal time afterward. This particular occasion, I tranced nine days. Yes, a lot. It was the first time I'd run into Hensk. I had him. Or thought I did. I chased him into a building on Apboretha. His ship was on the ground floor. It was a trap. He took off and dropped the building on me. I'd never had a broken bone. I made up for it. Multiple fractures. Arms, legs, ribs. I'd nearly gotten out. Somehow, the building missed my head. An old female dug me out and stayed by me. She gave me water and cared for me. I think she set the bones. My body grew. It strengthened itself by becoming taller and thicker. I'm incredibly dense. I weigh half again as much as a human my size. After that I came back to Earth. I needed to learn a lot more about just staying alive in an environment that... Anyway, that's why I'm about six-four and massive.\" \"Six-four? Gallant, we haven't used those terms for... a couple of cens. Well, a cen-and-a-half.\" \"Athena, I spent more than a century on Earth. The twentieth. I kept getting drafted. I hate being drafted.\" \"You went to war?\" \"Four of them. Two world wars, Korea and Vietnam. Grew a bit in all but the first. I was a very good sergeant. I only lost one man. Smitty. Right after we hit Omaha beach. I went back to the sixties later and marched for civil rights, then was a war protester.\" \"You were a hippie!\" \"That too.\" The last of the dark brothers had chosen to destroy the world and people he loved. He'd chosen the birthplace of western culture, Athens. Athena, Mick and Elaine had crammed to learn ancient Greek. They had Gallant to help with accent. Athena had been right. He liked Elaine. She was very proficient in the martial arts, but no one he'd ever seen was as good as Athena. Except himself. Mick was almost as good as his mother. \"Who's he after, Gallant?\" \"At a guess, Plato.\" \"Not Socrates?\" \"No, Athena, I don't think so. Plato would still have written his dialogues. They're the true treasure. Athena, you know the culture. You and Elaine are going to stand out even more than I do.\" \"I've given thought to that. Gallant, I'm gray-eyed Athena. You are Apollo. Mick and Elaine are minor divinities.\" \"Athena, that could seriously change the mythology of the period. We can't risk that. This time is pivotal in the development of your own civilization.\" \"It's just an expedient. You can use hypnosis to clear it. I got the idea when we landed atop Acropolis. There's another reason I chose this way. As gods, we won't be... pursued.\" \"Athena, I learned to handle male advances thousands of years ago. Your three times great-grandmother and a nice fellow named Chuck taught me.\" \"Hey, not just you. You may be super-gorgeous now that I've got you in shape, but Elaine, Mick and I are not mashed potatoes.\" \"No, you are champagne and caviar. All of you, but you most of all. Although, I'm not sure how I feel about your haircut.\" \"Short is practical. Cut it to a cen before every comp I was ever in. Call it battle dress. I'll be wearing a helm. At first anyway. Come on, Gallant. I can feel you've decided to go with my plan. Let's roll. Mick and Elaine are ready. Kiss for luck?\" It shocked them both. The sudden blending of their minds and the heat between them. He'd found the first Athena and she knew it too. \"Gallant, I don't quite know what to say. Nothing... Nothing like that ever... Not even with my husband.\" \"Athena, I've searched ten thousand years for you. Lead me, My Lady.\" \"Oh, Gallant, that's why I made you Apollo. We lead together. Let's go find Plato. Before I start trying to talk you into putting Alice on hover for a couple cens. Uh, hi, Mick, Elaine.\" \"Hi yourself, Mom. Very high. Grats, Gallant. You found your girl. And she's a beaut.\" \"That she is, Mick. Now, I have suddenly developed an acute desire to come out of this alive. Shall we see if we can accomplish it?\" **** \"Evil has come among you. Lo, Socrates, your students are endangered. I, Athena, seek Plato. Apollo has seen his destiny. One seeks to alter it.\" \"Oh, beautiful Goddess, he absents himself this day. His loves are not among these either. I had believed they sported on the slopes of Lykavittos. Now, I fear for them.\" \"Fear not. He is mine and in my keeping. Apollo, it pleases me to walk through my city. Will you speak to these? I would not change your vision with my presence.\" \"Yes, Athena, I shall touch each that the tale not be told. Come, Socrates, your words ring through the ages. Plato records them well. I would not have them changed. They guide the young of the future.\" \"Then I ask you take this vision.\" \"Socrates, I give you this day to remember us. On the morrow, you will awake, remembering all but our presence here and your trepidation over the fate of Plato. I bid you continue your discourse and pass this day as others. Speak not of us to those I have not touched.\" He gave each of them the same command, then ran after Athena. The speed of his run would convince Socrates and the young men they were, indeed, who they claimed to be. Athena was an excellent tactician. He struggled to calm himself. If he could keep his mind on the job at hand, he would have what he so desperately wanted. He could smell the evil. The dark brother was nearby. \"GALLANT!\" She saved his life. The dark brother had sprung from ambush and nearly shot him down. He suddenly knew the future she had changed. He would have been injured to dying, but would have killed the brother before death. It had been a trap. Plato wasn't the target. He was. \"NO! ATHENA!\" The sudden tears almost blinded him. The dark brother had shot her down. Mick and Elaine were headed toward the hooded figure at a run. He screamed in rage as he saw him shoot first Mick, then Elaine. He pulled the unit he'd built out and turned it on. It was still keyed to the dark brother's genetic code. He smiled as he listened to his death screams. It shocked him a bit. He had killed, but he had never enjoyed it before. He ran to Athena. She was alive! So were Mick and Elaine, but all were badly injured. Mick and Elaine he could save. Athena... No! She would not die! He needed Alice. Desperately. She wouldn't live through the journey to the ship. He laughed wildly as Alice materialized around them. Somehow, she had heard his need. And answered. He changed a decimal on the coordinates and threw her into flight. He had no idea where they were going, but the decimal point would insure a long flight. He did something he'd never done before. He placed Athena in nontime. She was the first living thing he'd ever risked suspending. He turned to Mick and Elaine, pulled out the medunit, and went to work on them. **** \"I can't find them, Elaine. I know they're here. I can feel it, but I can't find them.\" \"Mick, the note he left said he was going to try to heal her. You can feel she's still alive.\" \"Yeah, and still unconscious. This ship is huge. I only found my way back because I could feel you.\" \"What?\" \"Surprised me too. The link just grew with the love. Elaine, they're thirsty. At least she is. Terribly thirsty.\" \"Mick, this may sound weird, but ask the ship to help you find them. Told you it was weird.\" \"No, you're right. Come with me, Elaine. Pack food. I'm not kidding. We could end up dozens of Ks from here.\" \"All right. Give me five. Find a pack.\" They packed food. Mick said no to water. Gallant wouldn't have taken his mother anywhere they couldn't find it. He took Elaine's hand, then a deep breath. \"Alice, they need us. Please, help us find them.\" They set out hand in hand. Elaine squeezed his and smiled. All the corridors, but one, were dark. **** \"Mick, is she... out again?\" \"Just sleeping, Elaine. Gallant. Gallant, drink a bit of broth, then sleep. I know how it works. Mom told me.\" Mick sat back and smiled. They were both tired, but his mother's injuries were healed. \"Elaine, I'm going to trek back and check to see if Alice has anything she wants to tell us. I'll bring more food too. Stay with them?\" \"Naturally. Mick, this is a... bower. A beautiful clear pool, flowering trees, soft deep grass, roses on trellises... A bower in the middle of the ship.\" \"Not half the middle. You should see some of the... rooms. There's a meadow and a forest of strange trees. There's something that can only be a racecourse of some kind. There's a room full of nothing but labels hanging in the air, all with names of musical instruments. Bedrooms in a hundred different styles... Thousands of rooms. Told you I got lost. I keep looking for a kitchen closer to us, but haven't found one. Well, it's only a little more than a K. Not bad. Be back. Love.\" \"Love. Mick! How long?\" \"Sleep? Same as trance. Five days. Want a book or three?\" \"Yes. No, bring my pack. Might as well work on my thesis. I might get to deliver it.\" \"Bother you?\" \"No. Truth is, I'm as excited as I've been about anything in my life. You?\" \"About. Right up there with you saying yes when I asked you out the first time. Elaine, marry me.\" \"Gee, I thought I was going to have to ask you.\" **** \"Hensk. I can feel him. He's teamed up with the bel-Nathans. Nasty combo. Those people don't stand a chance. Wonder why he's so interested... Telepaths! A whole race of telepaths! I've got to help them. I'll get you somewhere safe, Athena.\" \"Gallant, you're not going into battle without me to watch your back.\" \"Athena, I don't want you in danger!! I want you safe!!\" \"Yell at me some more. I love it. Hey, I love you. Don't expect to keep you, but intend to have more than so far. Much more. Hensk is the last one, Gallant. And he scares you. Bad. He's got you... programmed. How many times have you met up with him?\" \"Seven.\" \"And?\" \"He got away.\" \"And you got hurt.\" \"That too.\" It happened the same way again, but it took nearly seven years. Seven years of running, fighting, running... The telepaths helped. So did the augmented horses Athena and Gallant gave them for transport. They all fell in love with the people, especially their leader Chervan. Communication wasn't difficult. The telepaths, some of them, learned to vocalize, in English. Gallant taught 'finger speech' to the others. He was uncomfortable communicating telepathically. The concussion he sustained, when Hensk blew out a mountainside trying to kill him, kept Gallant from going into trance. Athena never left his side the twelve weeks it took him to heal. She'd never let go of his hand the two weeks he lay unconscious. He spent four more months with her. \"The dreams.\" \"Yes, Athena, the dreams. She's come back.\" \"You're going alone, aren't you, Gallant?\" \"Athena... \" \"I've always known the time would come.\" \"Do you want to go home?\" \"This is home. There's nothing on Earth for me. Mick and Elaine feel the same. Our skills are needed here. Besides, Chervan and I together are an unbeatable combo. We'll get this world out of the stone age and on the road back to tech civ in nothing flat. Gallant, I want... Before you go... \" \"Tell me, Athena.\" \"I want all of you. I want the whole thing that I got just a taste of the first time we kissed. Drop your barriers with me just once. It's the one memory I want I don't have.\" She recoiled in shock when he opened his mind to her. He dropped his arms to his sides and turned away. He should have known better. \"No, Gallant! Stop! Again. Slowly this time. It was just too much all at once. You carry so much loneliness and pain. It hurts me to feel it. Show me the love and joy too. I want to know all of you. Love all of you.\" He stood with his back to her, desperately trying to rebuild his barriers. \"No, Athena. Even I don't want to know all of it. I put it all away and forget as much as I can. I surprised myself too. Chervan is scolding me. It seems I knocked half the paths on the planet to their knees. She's not really angry, just upset I didn't give them enough warning to get their barriers up.\" \"Warn them now. Don't argue, Gallant. I won't listen and I won't let you win.\" \"I don't really want to win. I want this memory too.\" **** He wandered. The dreams had sent him from Athena, but not to anywhere. He restlessly searched for Hensk, dodged a few attacks by dark brethren he'd already destroyed, and wandered. \"Find her, my gallant one. Find the second who bears my name. Build the door.\" He awoke aching with loneliness. A door? A door to where? He stumbled to the comp station. He was being driven. He avoided looking in a mirror. He knew what he'd see. Knew because his clothes hung on him. Knew because he couldn't eat or rest. A door to where? A door to beyond where he was? Where was he? He began again. From where he was. If he defined that, he would, perhaps, know what was beyond. The name Hrune. It came to his mind again. Hrune... He tapped Alice's memory banks. Hrune... Yes! Orbel Hrune, Lahathan mathematician. Theory of infinite universes. He patted the console. \"Thank you, Alice. Now I know what door I'm to build. Let's see if you and I can figure out how to build it. I hope you're in the mood to help.\" She was, but it still required months of work. Most at the comp station. He found a red giant to power it and began the work of building it. Athena hadn't come to his dreams since he'd begun the work. She came the night before he opened the door and whispered, \"The second Athena.\" Gallant cautiously explored the universe he'd created a way into. It shocked him when he discovered it was 'the same' as his. He was sure it shouldn't be. He was stunned when he learned his own people didn't exist in it. There was a race as old as his in another galaxy, but very different. He wasn't surprised to discover he actually liked them better. He set coordinates for Earth. It was home in his emotions and humans were the people he truly needed to know existed in this universe. Alice flashed \"Well it's about time, Nervous Nellie!\" on her screen and he laughed. \"You're right, Alice. I've been avoiding it, just as I avoided visiting Earth after the twentieth century, for several thousand years, because I was afraid it would change too much. This universe shouldn't be at all like ours, but it is. And telling myself it doesn't matter if there aren't humans in it is not working.\" He hopped through time. Humans not only existed, they flourished. By the twenty-second century, they'd put all their boundless energy into exploring their galaxy. Earth was the home of the Orion Arm Federation of Free Worlds and the base of the highly regarded Exploration Fleet, but they had a problem. It was called the Durcassin Empire. He hopped forward and saw the Federation and the Empire settle into an uneasy truce. The Federation grew on one side of the wide 'Zone of Neutrality,' by inviting space-faring peoples to join. The Empire grew on the other side, by conquest. Gallant decided he was lonesome and wanted people to talk to. He laughed when Alice gave him the location of a group of humans. She knew him very well. She flashed, \"And it's a dangerous place.\" He told her to give him data and hurry. He knew what 'kind' of danger when she landed. The fact she landed close, told him she was worried. He walked around a small outcropping and introduced himself. \"Hello, I'm Gallant.\" \"You have no business being here!\" \"Hey! The weapon is hardly necessary. I'm unarmed and intend injury to no one.\" \"Commander Telas?\" \"He's as unarmed as he claims, Captain. My sensors detect nothing that could be construed as dangerous.\" \"Cybernetic augmentation. Isn't that a bit unusual?\" Gallant smiled and cautiously lowered his hands. \"It wasn't a choice. Captain, he's not human. Very advanced physiology. Two hearts and a unique cell structure. Slow continual replacement. He probably has a life span of thousands of years.\" \"Thank you, Commander. Now, Mr. Gallant, why don't you tell me what you're doing on a planet that's, basically, falling apart under our feet.\" \"Looking for someone to talk to. Your scientific teams attracted my attention. I just decided to be friendly and say hello. Hello.\" The captain laughed and Gallant's smile widened. He'd missed humans. \"You've picked a pretty unstable setting for a chat. I'm Justin Merris, captain of the Federation Exploration Vessel Curie. We're trying to find out why this is the fourth planet in this region that's disintegrating.\" \"I think I know what's happening to the planet. If I'm right, it will spread. I'll give you the data I've collected.\" \"Thank you. It'll probably give my security chief fits, but why don't you come back to the ship and have a cup of coffee with me?\" \"I'd love to. With your permission, I'll land my craft in your shuttle bay. Captain, I'm going to take a very unusual step and invite Commander Telas aboard my ship, to make the journey with me. He's already deduced more than I really want known about me. I'd like the opportunity to convince him not to reveal everything he learns. The best way to do that is let him know everything, then choose not to reveal it.\" \"Commander?\" \"It's rather convoluted logic, Captain, but a very accurate judgment of my personality. I believe Lt. Ochis would feel a great deal more comfortable about having both his craft and him aboard if I arrived in it.\" \"Agreed. Commander Duchelle!\" \"Yes, Sir! Where did he come from?\" \"A ship. Mr. Gallant, Lieutenant Commander Athena Duchelle.\" \"Athena?! How interesting. Just Gallant. Now, Commander, if you'll come this way, I'll show you my ship.\" Gallant just turned and walked off. He couldn't think of anything to say to her. He noticed Telas followed at a nod from his captain, but he was a bit surprised he did. He wasn't surprised by what the woman named Athena said behind him. \"Well! I've never had quite that reaction to my name before. Or quite that response to an introduction. Not the politest person I've ever met.\" \"Commander Duchelle, your greeting was not exactly fleet protocol. He's not human. Telas seems to find him more than a little intriguing. He also seems to have some idea what's happening to this world. Finish your tests, then report to me aboard the ship.\" \"Yes, Captain. Non-human. Hmm.\" \"Commander, your intense interest in non-human anthros almost got you left behind on Base Six Four. This is not the place to be thinking of other things. I'd like as much information as we can get before this world becomes an asteroid belt.\" \"I know, I know. Curb my curiosity and get on with the job at hand. Yes, Captain. Still, he's very interesting.\" \"Yes, and he has data to add to yours, so I suggest you assemble some.\" \"Yes, Sir. We're about done.\" Gallant didn't take Telas directly to the Curie. It was nearly three months before he took him there. Of course, it was only ten minutes as far as the captain was concerned. In those months, they became very good friends. They had a great deal in common. Telas' cyber augmentation had been done by an alien scientific group when he was a child. He had been, basically, a slave to the computer that ran their ship. A fleet ship had tracked the abducted human children and freed them, but too late for Telas. Federation medical knowledge was incapable of reversing the augmentation. Telas would live for thousands of years as part man, part computer. He laughed when he told Gallant Alice was the first girl he'd ever truly loved. Gallant smiled and ached for him. The laugh was real, but tinged with longing. Gallant showed Telas what was causing the breakup. The device was small and nearly undetectable in the vast reaches of the neutral territory. The Empire had invented a new weapon. Soon it would begin to destabilize stars. Soon after, it would affect inhabited worlds. They landed on the Curie and Gallant joined the captain for coffee. They'd just begun to chat when Telas' voice came over the com. \"Gallant! Now!\" Gallant ran from the captain's ready room. Telas had a man in his arms and was stepping into a lift. Gallant leapt consoles and people and dove into it just as the doors began to close. \"Emergency one, shuttle bay two. Emergency two, medical. He's a mess inside. I don't know how he got from the pad to the lift. 'Something' destabilized the transport system. You stunned the bridge crew.\" \"If I didn't know better, I'd think you planned it. You timed it perfectly. Shuttle bay first.\" \"Doctor Marsh says we can save him, but Commander Duchelle is still on the planet and it's coming apart. I couldn't get her on comm.\" \"Damn! Telas, convince him he must violate neutral space. Destroy that thing.\" \"I will.\" Gallant ran for Alice as soon as the lift doors opened. He hadn't given the captain an easy job. The Curie would take a real beating just getting close enough to blast the device. He'd take a real beating saving Commander Duchelle. He didn't quite reach her before it began. Athena got a shoulder under him and got him to his feet. The landslide had rolled him about three hundred meters, then near buried him. She was amazed he was alive and astounded he was conscious. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" \"Would you believe rescuing you? My ship's over that cliff that used to be a ridge. Your transporter is nonfunctional.\" \"This job would be easier if you weren't quite so... \" \"Comfortable. I'd still weigh more than a human. This won't work. There just isn't time. Here. Go. Take this. It's the key to my ship. Push the green button on the navigation console. It'll take you to the nearest inhabited planet.\" \"Look, big, blond, and 'comfortable', you'll get out of this with me, or we'll not get out of it together. Don't argue! Just keep going.\" \"Why do I keep meeting stubborn women named Athena?!\" \"Explain that statement while I 'stubborn' us to a bit more stable ground. If there is any.\" \"There isn't. This whole planet is about to crumble around us. LOOK OUT!!\" She cried as she rigged a travois. He'd pushed her out of the way, then thrown himself between her and the falling, bouncing rock. It would have killed her. She didn't know why it hadn't killed him. She reminded herself the travois \"put basic physics to work\" and she knew she could do it, dragged him to a spot that didn't have tumbling cliffs on both sides and dropped to the ground, exhausted. The planet was coming apart, but she had to rest. Gallant awoke and looked around. Athena Duchelle was curled on the ground near where he lay. She'd gotten him a long way while he was unconscious. He decided it was probably his turn. He assessed his condition and smiled. He'd always liked a challenge. He struggled to his knees, waited for his head to stop spinning and his vision to clear, then got to his feet. She was small and ordinarily he'd have found her weight an easy load, but this wasn't ordinarily. He decided she'd been asleep when the rock hit her. She'd probably regain consciousness in a few hours. But they didn't have a few hours. He got his bearings, put her on the travois and set out. He faced the hill and laid down the travois. He'd have to carry her. He begged for just a little luck. If the hill would stay stable just a few minutes, he thought he could make it to Alice with her. He picked her up and started up the hill. He got about two-thirds of the way before the hill began to disintegrate. Suddenly, Alice was around him. He laughed, told her he loved her, gently laid Commander Duchelle on the floor and collapsed, before he could get his healing unit out of his pocket. **** Athena looked around. They had to be in his ship. She felt a faint vibration, so she knew they were in flight. How had they gotten there and where was he? She found him. He was unconscious on the floor not far from her. She rolled him over gently and began to examine him. Broken clavicle, scapula, ribs, badly bruised leg, she thought his sternum might be cracked and his mass of blond curly hair was matted with blood. And somehow, he'd gotten her to his ship and off the disintegrating planet. She'd found the one she'd been looking for. She smiled at the thought her little-girl white-knight dreams fit with grown-up girl plan, after all, even if he was a bit plump for the armor. Now to keep him alive to accomplish it. She gave up hunting for medical supplies after she'd gotten lost twice and nearly didn't find her way back to the control center. She settled for a small basin of water and a soft cloth. \"Hello.\" \"Hello, Gallant. How'd we get here?\" \"We staggered, until a beautiful lady performed an impossible rescue.\" \"What?\" \"My ship just does the impossible now and then. Neither of us can figure out how. Unh. There seem to be pieces of me where there shouldn't.\" \"Broken ribs. Several. How in hell did you pull that travois with a broken clavicle and scapula?\" \"I didn't pull it far. Couldn't get it up the hill.\" \"You carried me?!\" \"You don't weigh much. Probably not more than a hundred twenty pounds, soaking wet.\" \"Pounds?! Gallant, you use some amazing terms; weeks, months, pounds.\" \"Showing my age. Still hovering. The Curie may be in trouble. Alice needs my help to find her. I need yours to get to the controls. Push that chair over here, then help me into it.\" \"At least you have sense enough not to try to stand. Lord! You're heavy!\" \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lean on you that much. I weigh near three times what you do. Did I hurt you?\" \"No. I knew it and was prepared to help. I just didn't expect you to need it that fast. Concussion too. Had to be with that smack you got. You didn't expect dizzy to make slow assist fast support, either.\" \"I do know how strong you are. You pulled me a long way.\" \"We wouldn't have made it without both of us. Gallant gestures are wonderful. Teamwork is practical. What are you doing?\" \"Helping Alice find the Curie. The course was plotted by Telas, a person, not a computer. There wasn't time to input the data.\" \"Computers can't play hunches and Telas has the most data as a base for his. You know the data he's got.\" \"Precisely. Got her. Put us in her engineering section, Alice. I think Telas and I can hold her together long enough to destroy that disrupter. Athena, how well do you know her systems?\" \"I helped design them. She's a prototype. I hitched a ride on her for this mission. Pulled 'Mama's baby' and they let me get away with it.\" \"We're landing. Get someone to help me to the Curie's engineering console, then let Telas know I want him on the ops station.\" She ran for help. She barked, \"Work now, questions later!\" at the two open-mouthed crewmen who stopped and stared at the room too big to be in the little travel trailer. They got Gallant to the main engineering console of the shaking ship and held him up while he worked. Athena worked on the secondary station and implemented the commands that flashed across her screen. Telas did the same thing on the bridge. They tuned the shields, dampened the oscillation, the ship steadied and damage control began to catch up. The captain gave the order and the device was destroyed. The Curie raced for Federation space. Gallant smiled and collapsed. \"Get him to Medical. Now! STOP! You can't carry him like that! Telas! Am I glad to see you! He's got a broken clavicle and scapula and ribs and a concussion. Probably a half dozen other--\" \"I'll carry him. Get a lift and notify Dr. Marsh we're coming. He's his own best healer, but with a concussion, he'll need help.\" As soon as they got on the lift, Telas had Athena get Gallant's healing unit out of his pocket. He looked at the readings, then told her to put it back in the pocket. She raised an eyebrow. \"He doesn't need more help than we can give him. That unit isn't a great deal better than ours, just enough faster to make the med techs too curious.\" \"His ship is going to drive me crazy. It's smaller than it was in the shuttle bay.\" \"Only the physical interface. The ship is still infinite.\" \"Mathematical construct.\" \"Yes, a programmed set of dimensions. There's a very rare non-replicable isotope at the heart of it, but the rest is all a program he wrote. He called it the mathematics of finite infinity. I managed not to say that was a contradiction.\" \"It exists, so it's not impossible. Of course, I'll probably spend the rest of my life reminding myself of it. Get him to teach you why it's not, someday. He has enough time, too.\" \"Thank you, for understanding knowing someone who does means a great deal to me.\" \"I also know there's far too much caring there for a few minutes. It exists, so it's not impossible. Lynn!\" \"Him there. You there. Now, Lieutenant!\" \"Yes, Commander.\" Gallant was unconscious for two days. Dr. Marsh told them it was actually some kind of trance state. Once she'd healed his concussion, his own system had taken over and begun healing his other injuries. She complained about tripping over people every time she turned around, but smiled when she groused. Athena, Telas and Captain Merris smiled back. He awoke and asked for water, drank deeply and drifted off to sleep. Lynn Marsh sighed and tripped over people for two more days. Midday of the second day, Athena asked for her help. \"I think you're crazy.\" \"We've talked about this before, Lynn.\" \"Theoretically, not as a course of action.\" \"I'm going to the Pauling. She's got the finest medical facilities in space. I want this and I do know what I'm doing.\" \"I'm not sure it will work. Athena, he's very, very different.\" \"Yes. And very, very special.\" \"You're in love with him!\" \"Oh, yes, since I was eight. I always helped the white knight rescue me in my fantasies, but I know he's going to leave. Lynn, he's not even from this universe. Came through a 'doorway,' he called it.\" \"Two hearts, continual cell replacement, another set of chromosomes, for heaven's sake!\" \"And two arms, two legs, blond curly hair, beautiful voice, the gentlest smile.\" \"I give up. If gray-eyed Athena, connoisseur of the fleet, thinks a slightly plump alien is the most perfect male in existence, who am I to argue?\" \"Did you notice? He has gray eyes too. Sort of a sea mist blue-green gray and the fairest skin--\" \"Stop, already. I'm convinced. Climb on the table and let's get this started before I regain my sanity. But I get to be there for the finale. If it works.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it will.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it probably could, maybe.\" \"You don't really doubt it will, either.\" \"I'm a doctor. I believe in good science and miracles.\" **** \"You mean you can cook?!\" \"Gallant, I can do almost anything. Following a recipe isn't that different from following a chemical formula. Not that I need a recipe. Traditional New Orleans fare. Seven bells. My quarters. See you then.\" \"I'll be there.\" Telas watched Athena walk away and grinned. \"Gallant, you're in for a treat. Athena grew up in New Orleans. Everyone in the fleet has tried to talk her into cooking dinner at one time or another. Every man has tried to get an invitation to her quarters.\" \"Uh, oh.\" \"Relax. You're not really her type, too comfortable. She likes slender with lots of muscle.\" \"More than half the reason I'm the way I am is to avoid being someone's type.\" \"Gallant, you've had thousands of years of experience. Women shouldn't make you that nervous.\" \"Telas, those thousands of years of experience are why women make me nervous.\" He decided he was in trouble right after he pulled a rose from a nontime pocket and gave it to her at her door. Her smile was warm enough to raise the ship's ambient temperature two degrees and his a bit more than that. She'd looked so lovely framed in the doorway with the glow of candlelight behind her, he'd done it without thinking about it first. He was too lost in her smile to notice she hadn't asked how he'd made the rose appear. Dinner was superb. He enjoyed it, the soft jazz playing in the background and her company. He also enjoyed the excellent wine she served him. \"Athena, thank you. It's been a very pleasant evening. Dinner was wonderful. I enjoyed it immensely.\" \"Good, then you'll stay a bit longer.\" \"I really should go.\" \"Can you dance?\" \"Of course I can dance.\" \"Here, one glass each of wine left. And a dance before you leave. Gallant, I know you're going to slip off to Alice and leave for wonderland.\" \"Not many people catch that allusion. Yes, Athena, it's time for me to return to my own universe. Oops! My, you're quick.\" \"Fastest reflexes in the fleet. Other than Telas. Barely spilled a drop. Why don't you drink it instead of wearing it? Would you believe I represented the Americas in the pan-Federation games? Hundred meter sprint. Took the silver. I was still in the academy at the time.\" \"You really are a very surprising young woman. I was told you attained the rank of Lt. Commander faster than anyone else had ever done it.\" \"That probably won't stand long. The Fleet's growing. Rank's going to come a bit faster for some of the bright young looies. I'm glad to see it.\" \"You asked about my 'stubborn' comment. I knew another beautiful woman named Athena once. She didn't have the Fleet to give her a place to use her skills.\" \"You found her one, then left her behind. Miss her. Loved her. Still do.\" \"You are entirely too perceptive. And far too beautiful by candlelight. I don't think I should have had that last glass of wine.\" \"Dance with me.\" She was soft and warm in his arms. Before he quite realized what he was doing, he was kissing her. As he scooped her up in his arms and carried her deeper into her quarters, he decided the last glass of wine had definitely been a mistake. He was very glad he'd made it. Gallant returned to his own universe, but she haunted his memory and his dreams. He'd fallen in love. He knew it and that he'd never love another woman in quite the same way again. He longed to return to her, but the other 'dream' Athena had gently told him he must not. He decided on a fishing trip. He was not expecting company. The tall, slender, extremely fair boy with near white hair, who walked out of the woods on his right, appeared to be in his mid-teens. He liked his smile, but wasn't feeling particularly sociable or he'd have chosen somewhere else for his fishing trip. \"Hello.\" \"Hello. Who are you?\" \"I'm Apollo Avelaine. Lane. How's the fishing?\" \"Quite good. It usually is on uninhabited planets.\" \"Pretty good if you go far enough into the past on inhabited ones too.\" \"Are you going to tell me who you are and why you're here, or just keep dropping obscure hints?\" \"Look at me. I've given you my name. My mother is gray-eyed Athena. Not one of the human ones. My hair is lighter than yours, but I look too much like you for you not to know me. Feel who I am. I traveled here from another time in a ship named Alice. You brought me. I've come to help you find my brothers.\" Gallant stared at him in shock. Lane laughed. \"You said you felt pretty strange when I told you. Hello, Dad. I'm from your future, but you've got me now. Just be glad you didn't get the girls too. \"Girls?\" \"You spend almost thirty years raising a family. I'm sixteen and the only boy of the group. You're taking most of the girls to your home world. I'm officially the youngest of three boys and three girls. You and I are going to find my brothers.\" \"Six… children. I told you all this?\" \"No. I'm Athena's child. I'm the timewalker. All my life exists within my memory. I'm Apollo. I see the future.\" He knew the boy was his without doubt. He could feel it. He didn't doubt he saw the future either. It was too clear in his eyes. \"That's a terrible burden to carry. Why did I bring you to me?\" \"To get my brothers. And to meet our Godfather.\" \"Your Godfather?\" \"Telas. You're about to hook our supper. You clean. I'll cook.\" **** The place looked very different than when he'd left it, but he'd expected it would. He smiled when he saw her, stopped and waited for her to feel him. She almost dropped the bundle she was carrying in the street. \"Hello, Athena.\" \"GALLANT! You've come for him. I think I've always known you would. Oh! Who are you?\" \"Lane. I told him to come. He didn't know. You forgot to mention what you were planning.\" \"'Forgot' probably isn't the operable term. I figured he'd argue about it. In fact, I knew he'd argue about it. Come on, Gallant. You know the paths all know you're here. Mick will know by now too.\" \"Chervan has already informed me, in no uncertain terms, I'm staying for dinner.\" \"Being one of three humans on a world of telepaths has been a very interesting experience. One I wouldn't trade. Mick and Elaine have four kids. Seven full humans on this world now, but with a bit of telekinetic assistance, the human strain will blend in within two generations.\" \"I had assumed that was how you'd overcome the inter-species differences. It hurt me to learn my last night with you was... shared, Athena.\" \"Oh, Gallant! It wasn't! Don't think that! I... Chervan and I... Before I came to find you, then after you'd gone. We... I wanted... \" \"Athena, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Don't cry. I'm not angry, nor hurt any longer. Feel.\" He held her a moment and then stepped back from her. She would know why. Leaving her had been very hard the first time. Now he would have to do it again. \"What's his name?\" \"Pericles. We call him Clete. Biggest kid on the planet. Strong as an ox and almost as fast as you are. Gentle and deadly. Strawberry blond curls. Looks just... Lane's your son.\" \"From somewhere far in the future. In my future. He tells me his mother's name is also Athena.\" \"Dad, we're staying for five days. It's important.\" \"He also tells me he sees the future. Handy if you're wondering if you're going to catch dinner. Not a bad cook either.\" \"That was a hint. All right. I'll cook dinner one of the days you're here. One of the days.\" Gallant laughed. She hadn't changed. She was a terrific cook, but she disliked it. In the near eight years they'd trained, then fought side by side against Hensk and the bel-Nathans, she'd cooked no more than a dozen times. Always as a special treat for him. \"Gallant, you're taller. How long have you been gone?\" \"Am I? I hadn't noticed. Not long. Just a few years.\" \"That means you got hurt and spent major time healing yourself. What happened?\" \"I fell down a hill and most of it came along. I had pretty good help healing. Must have put more energy into it than I needed.\" \"No, it means you broke a whole bunch of bones and your body strengthened itself by getting bigger. And thicker.\" \"Athena, I'm comfortable this way. Although, I've a feeling I'm about to get in very good shape. It seems I'm about to take on the job of training my sons.\" \"Well, Lane looks like he's in good shape and I've been training Clete since he was two.\" \"TWO?!\" \"It was either that or let him hurt himself trying to copy the older kids. To be honest, I was afraid he'd hurt someone else. He's massive, Gallant. Nearly a hundred ninety centimeters and about a hundred ten kilos of muscle and still getting bigger.\" \"He'll top out at one ninety-five and one fifty K. It'll always be all muscle. He likes to work-out.\" \"Lane!\" \"Sorry, Dad, but Athena doesn't mind.\" \"He's right, Gallant. I'm kind of pleased to know.\" \"Let's see, that's about six-four-and-a-half and three hundred thirty pounds. Whew! That is big.\" \"He's like you, Dad. All of us are. We're heavier than humans. He'll look like about one-thirty K. Two hundred eighty pounds for you.\" \"That's still big.\" \"Yes, it'll drive Dutch crazy. So will his purring.\" \"PURRING?!\" \"In the future. Shouldn't have mentioned it. You're about to meet him.\" \"Lane, you're going to drive me crazy.\" \"Always did.\" \"Hi, Mom, I just heard. You must be Gallant. I've heard a lot... Mother?\" \"You never asked.\" \"You mean you didn't tell him either?! ATHENA, YOU'RE HOPELESS!\" \"Gee, Gallant. You haven't yelled at me in seventeen years. Feels great.\" He groaned, Athena grinned and Lane and Clete sat on the ground and laughed. Five days passed and he had to leave her again. **** The trip through the doorway and to Earth in the time of the Federation was rather short. Athena's world was very near it, as he thought of it. But when he got there, he ran into unexpected difficulty. He tried to remember the man across the desk wasn't just being difficult, but it wasn't easy. \"He's my son and I want him!\" \"He's a Federation ward, Mr. Gallant, and you will have to prove your status.\" \"Dad, get Telas. He's expecting it. You set it up years ago. Remember?\" \"Oh. All right, Lane. Anything has to be easier than this.\" Gallant stormed out of the office and down the steps. Clete was having a bit of difficulty not kicking something in response to what he was feeling. What he got from Lane was too mixed to define, but it was predominantly anticipation, so strong it was a hunger. It was almost as strong as his father's frustration. \"Why, after all these years, did they make him a ward of the state?! Lane, when did I set this up with Telas?\" \"I don't know. Just that you do.\" \"Why don't you know and why didn't you tell me sooner?\" \"There he is. Right on time.\" \"Telas! It's good to see you!\" \"Hi, Gallant. Hello, Clete, Lane. Let's see, you're here to pick up Roberrin. That means this is the first time my godsons have met me.\" \"You mean I'm your godson too?\" \"You are now, Clete, but not yet. That even confuses me. Let's see... Your dad asked me a long time ago, but he hasn't... The simple answer is: Yes, and now that he knows, he will. I have a file on the duties and, more relevant, the privileges of my duty station. I believe this is the time to invoke my hugging privilege. I've watched over your son, Gallant. I gave him his first hug. Lynn Marsh states she was not really hugging him when she handed him to me. We were there. The Pauling was Athena's ship and they loved him too. We're quite smug. Athena trusted us to build her son into the person he could be. It's time he knew his father and his brothers.\" \"Telas, I can't prove I'm a Fed citizen. I'm not. They refuse to take straight paternity without a long involved court proceeding. I'm... two steps from just grabbing him.\" \"That's what I'm here to help you do. You want him to disappear from this time period. There are others helping. Lynn Marsh is Fleet Chief Med Officer. She's just had all his medical records put in a coded file and sealed under Fleet Med Command. The captain of the Pauling just 'lost' all his records at Admiral Merris' request. The only one left to 'hit' is Social.\" \"There's a sweet little old lady who will help at the school. Dad will charm her socks off and she'll 'forget' to refile Dutch's records. She thinks it's dumb to put a kid with an obviously caring parent in an institution. Clete and I will get him. It'll take him all of ten seconds to figure out who we are. It'll take us about two hours to convince him he doesn't need to say good-by to about forty girls. Come on, Clete. He'll be on the field for track practice by the time we get there. Dad, remember to tell me about sweet little old Ms. Brown.\" \"Telas, they're going to drive me crazy.\" \"You're going to turn them into outstanding young men and it'll break your heart to part with them.\" \"That too. I can already see it coming and I haven't even met Roberrin. Three sons, Telas. Three beautiful women gave me sons. And I already ache to hold... Lane calls him Dutch. His eyes light when he says it. I would have gone anywhere and done nearly anything to see... Telas, Social? I want my son.\" \"Back to the office you just left. You get that man to get into Dutch's file. As soon as he does, I'll key in an erase command from the outer office. I've got the Fed's pri-one override command. As soon as he closes the file, it will cease to have ever existed.\" \"Pri-one? Override?\" \"You have friends in high places. So will the boys when they reach this time. Gallant, you put them in the academy sixteen years ago.\" \"Wait! Don't tell me any more. I don't want to know the future, but I do want to know what happened to Athena.\" \"She saved a world and lost her life. Highest commendation the Fed can give. One of six ever awarded. She stopped a war. No one knows how she did it. The defense shield she threw up around a defenseless world fused into a lump of metal. It lasted just long enough to deflect the incomings. When it blew, she died. She was the only one who didn't live through the attack. Nearly two billion people owe her their lives. Every city on that planet has an Athena Boulevard or Athena Duchelle park. Half the girls under ten are named Athena. She's one of the Federation's greatest heroes.\" \"Sounds like the girl I knew.\" \"Ooh, it hasn't been very long, has it?\" \"No. Not long enough to forget the fragrance she wore or the way she felt in my arms. A minute, Telas. I need a minute.\" \"Gallant, she loved you. You were the last man she invited 'in' for dinner.\" \"Telas, there are four Athenas.\" \"I'd say the explanation lies in your future and in those three boys.\" \"I'll wait for it. There are three girls too, but Lane says they're close to each other, but not to him or me. Family, but not really friends. I don't understand it, but I don't think he does either. It may be the only thing that confuses him. I may have to do something about that. I'm not sure it's healthy. Teenage boys are supposed to be a bit confused.\" \"The only thing that confuses Dutch is girls. He never forgets a comm number, but he gets the names that go with them mixed up.\" \"Lane says he doesn't understand why they think he should choose between them either. He loves him incredibly, like he's been waiting for this moment his whole life, living for it. Let's go. I want my son.\" He insisted the man check the files to make sure he wasn't named as father, all files. He wasn't, just unspecified non-human. He made a hasty exit. He'd made such a fuss the man was going to go through them again. Telas led him to the school and he almost collapsed in mirth. He set about charming Ms. Brown and charmed himself right into trouble. Lane was near giggles before they got to the field. Clete wasn't far behind. He had no idea what was so funny to Lane, but he'd never felt anyone as strongly as he did him and his near giggly mood felt wonderful. He could have found his brother on the field with his eyes closed. It didn't take him long to notice them. He watched him come across the field and made an estimate from the ease and speed at which he did it. He could see Lane's description of 'fast' was an understatement. Lane's intense surge of excitement when he ran up to them didn't at all agree with his casual posture, but he didn't say anything, just stood and smiled. \"Hi, Dutch.\" \"Who are you?\" \"You've already figured out the answer. Come on, we're breaking you out of this place. Dad's finishing off your computer tracks now. He's Lane. I'm Clete. Apollo Avelaine and Pericles Buchannon. Our dad's Gallant. So's yours. Let's go.\" \"I need to say good-by to some people. I can't leave without telling them.\" \"Dutch, the important ones are helping. We haven't time for farewells to every girl in a ten kilometer radius.\" \"Just Rosalind and Jackie. Oh, and Carol and Diane. How did you know I wanted to say good-by to girls?\" \"He remembers the future. Pretty strange, but I'm starting to get used to it. Dutch, relax. You're starting to make me tense.\" \"He's wondering why Dad didn't come for him before, Clete. It's worrying him.\" \"Exactly. Well, why didn't he?\" \"Because, until I told him eighteen days ago, he didn't know either one of you existed. He didn't know I did until I walked up and introduced myself. NO! You can't tell her good-by.\" \"But she's right across... You really do know what's going to happen. Wow! That must be great.\" \"Dutch, you're not dense. Think about it a minute. Lane will never have a surprise, not even a happy one. Yeah, better. You're still doing dips emotionally, but your brain's getting back in gear. Oh, I'm an empath.\" \"A big one.\" \"Yes, and he'll get bigger, but so will we. Primarily because he makes us work at it. Yes, we're all the same age. You need to know Dad, so you understand who you are, Dutch.\" \"We're all the same age? Dumb question. You just said that.\" \"Not dumb. I wouldn't have known what you were going to ask if you didn't ask it. That's how it works. Dad's going to tell us how 'little old Ms. Brown' helped clear your files later.\" \"Little!? Old!? Corinne Brown may be the most beautiful redhead who ever walked a planet!\" \"Yeah. Make sure you don't let on you knew it. I worked very hard setting him up for it.\" \"Ooh. Does he do this often, Clete?\" \"I haven't been around him long enough to know, but from the way he's enjoying it, I'd say as often as he thinks he can get away with it.\" \"Ms. Brown. Our dad must really be something.\" Gallant got back to Alice quite late. He very carefully told Lane about 'sweet little old Ms. Brown' helping get rid of Dutch's files. He could have cheerfully strangled Telas when he added, \"Yes, your dad charmed her socks off.\" He began to realize he'd been had when the three boys collapsed in giggles in a corridor just beyond the main control room. **** \"DAD! Lane's having a nightmare and it's bad! Real bad.\" \"Where, Clete? I don't even know which room he chose.\" \"Come on. Hurry. That one.\" He pulled him out of sleep and into his arms. It was the first time he'd truly held one of his children. The rightness of it washed over him. \"Easy, Lane, easy. Tell me.\" \"I can't. It'll come and it'll pass, but I can't talk about it now.\" \"Not a nightmare, a future event.\" \"That's what all my nightmares are.\" \"Do you have them often?\" \"Too often. The closer the event, the worse they get. I know one day they'll stop. Well, they won't happen very often. Sorry, Clete, bad enough I have them. You waking up in a cold sweat and terror that isn't even your own isn't fair. But I can't do anything about it.\" \"Yes you can. Break the cycle. Do something to change it.\" \"Dad, I can't.\" \"You can and someday you will.\" \"If he doesn't, I will.\" \"Hello, Dutch. Woke you too.\" \"Something did. Something like cold breath on the back of my neck.\" \"WHEN?!\" \"Just now. Dad, what is it?\" \"We're leaving. This minute. TELAS! Clete, find him and see where he wants to go. We're out of here. NOW!\" He knew what the cold breath meant. Something about his sons was enough force for change the powers were involved. He fought the Dark One as the personification of anti-life in his own universe, but he was not the power of the destructive force. Like a ship cutting through water, his sons were increasing the possibilities for life to exist in some way and the bow wave of circumstance was exerting more pressure. There was no Dark One in Dutch's universe. The cold breath said, \"Chance is aligning against you. The 'dark power' has taken a hand.\" **** \"You have to give us Alice for a few days.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"There's something we have to do.\" \"Lane, I'm not giving you my ship without more explanation than that.\" \"We have to find the third Athena.\" \"Where is she?!\" \"Easy, Dad. She's my mother. We'll take her to you, but it's a long way in your future.\" \"I want to go with you.\" \"Sorry, it has to be just us. You have something else to do.\" \"Which is?\" \"Save a world.\" How had he let Lane talk him into this? He didn't like cold damp places. Especially cold damp places with bars and chains. He sighed and wondered how he was supposed to save this world. He'd gone straight from a stroll in the forest to a dungeon in chains. Not a great deal of world-saving opportunity in a journey of less than ten minutes with thirty guards. Oh, my. Dark-haired and beautiful! \"Visitors. How nice. Excuse me, but I'd like to discuss these chains.\" \"Be quiet! Where was he found?\" \"He walked out of the sacred grove.\" \"Then why is he alive?\" \"Because, Lady, he didn't walk into it.\" \"Get him down! Now! Attire him appropriately and bring him to me.\" Well, step one. He was being unchained. He wasn't extremely pleased with all the touching that seemed to be involved in the process, but the women were removing the... chains. He found it very difficult to concentrate on the architecture of the interesting building. The occupants were very distracting and all seemed to be female. He didn't have any difficulty paying attention when he was guided before the woman who had ordered him freed. \"Yes, I can see it now.\" \"Would someone please tell me what you're all muttering about?\" \"You have been prophesied. You will save us.\" \"Well, that's what I was told I was supposed to be doing. Close that window, please. I'm cold. Your idea of appropriate attire and mine seem to be quite different. Oh! Now, wait a minute!\" He didn't quite know what to do. He couldn't bring himself to hit any of them. They were so much smaller than he was. It would have been like hitting half-grown girls. Some of them were half-grown girls. Just before he stopped thinking about anything, she appeared in his mind, laughed and said, \"Save them, Gallant. Only you can. They will save their world.\" **** Lane grinned when his father walked through the door. The scenery he saw through it when it opened was lovely. He wouldn't tell him all of where they'd been or what they'd done. None of them ever would. Neither would Alice. She understood he wouldn't really want to know. \"Hello, Dad. I see you saved them.\" \"They say I did, Lane, but I don't really know.\" \"Dad, if you hadn't, that grove would not be standing.\" \"Rather an unusual way to... save a sacred grove. Where are Clete and Dutch?\" \"We're on our way to get them. Clete's preventing a murder.\" \"Whose murder?\" \"Auri, Aurora, got herself into a mess. He's going to be in rough shape when we get him.\" \"Injured?\" \"Not yet.\" \"You've lost me.\" \"It's his culture. He's going to fall apart on us. Dutch will do his best, but he won't be able to stop him.\" Gallant stared after the boy who had laughed wildly, then run into the corridors of the part of Alice he called the maze. The wild laugh had been startling, but hadn't bothered him near as much as the deep sobs that he'd heard as Lane had disappeared into the vast labyrinth of the ship. She was landing. Dutch ran in, pulling Clete behind him. \"Help me with him. It was the only way to save her, but he's almost catatonic. She told him you'd come for her before they made up their minds what to do about it.\" \"Do about what?!\" \"The sacrifice. He kept her from being sacrificed.\" \"How?\" \"How do you keep a woman from playing the role of virgin sacrifice?\" \"Oh, I see. But why is he in such bad shape?\" \"Just before we left, she told him who she is.\" \"Terrific. Now, if you'll tell me who she is, we'll all know.\" \"Lane's sister. Our sister.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"It gets worse. She told him she'd name their son Connell.\" \"Oh, brother. His culture has very strict taboos about these things, with good reason. Now I know why Lane ran. I need to find him.\" \"Dad, he said good-by to us. He said you'd send him away. It's not his fault. CLETE! Damn! I'll go after him.\" Gallant finished putting in the coordinates for the most peaceful place he knew. He had a mess on his hands and Lane had as much as said it would get worse. He needed to know what that 'worse' was. He'd barely begun to look for him when he heard Clete, then Dutch, scream in his mind. He'd wondered if they could at need. He ran for them. He suddenly realized Lane was right behind him. Dutch was near incoherent. \"I couldn't stop him!\" \"Give me that!\" He grabbed the medunit from Lane and went to work on the son who had tried to kill himself. It was going to be close. He spared just enough attention to notice Lane holding Dutch and calming him. So, he knew he'd be sent away, did he? The nightmares! He now knew what they were about. Within a few minutes, he was sure his son would live. When he finished repairing the damage he'd done to himself with a knife, he stepped back, took a deep breath and realized Lane was no longer in the room. \"Dutch, where's Lane?\" \"He said he had to get ready. Dad, he told me to tell Clete he'd miss him. And Auri had always known. Change things. Please, Dad.\" \"Dutch, he set Clete up for this. He knew this would happen.\" Dutch grabbed his arm and as he turned for the door. He was so angry he almost threw him aside. It shocked him enough to stop him. \"Dad, think! It's not like that. He's carried it inside his whole life. He doesn't think anything can change. Auri didn't either. Dad, he thinks he'll spend fifty years in Earth's past. Alone, Dad, until Clete and I find him. I'm not supposed to tell you.\" \"Yes, that's where I'd take him. About mid-twentieth century. I always liked it there. You can let go, Dutch. My mind is working. I'm going to move Clete to the surgery. I'm going to put restraints on him. I want you to stay with him.\" It didn't take him long to find Lane. He was lying on the floor of the command center, curled around a pack. \"Were you planning on going somewhere?\" \"Please, just do it. I've already reset the coordinates.\" \"Hmm. Earth. Nineteen forty-two. Oh! You're planning on helping build the Alaska highway. Too bad. They'll just have to manage without you.\" \"What?\" Gallant sat down on the floor next to his son. He looked terribly confused. It was an improvement. \"You're not leaving. It would probably be easier than facing Clete, but I think it's necessary you do so.\" \"You can't... change the future.\" \"I already have. Several times. Done a bit of past changing too. Come here, Son.\" Gallant pulled Lane into his arms and held him as he cried. He was very thankful Dutch had stopped him and 'thumped' him for being so angry. He was also thankful Telas had told him just enough to assure he paid attention to the thump. He didn't pursue the thought there had to be a reason he'd allowed Clete to be injured. Why hadn't he done something to change it before? Hadn't he known? Why had Clete been so overwhelmed by the culture of his world that he'd tried to kill himself? His mother was human and flat practical about such things. There had to be something adding to the horror. Something his strongly empathic son had felt from someone else? From Lane? His sister? Or him? Who had added just enough shock to make him grasp the knife? He was only sure it hadn't been Dutch. \"Dad... I'm... It's all changing. Dizzy.\" \"Easy, Lane, open your mind to me. I'll help you ride it out.\" He entered his son's mind and saw the wild spirit beneath the tightly controlled and slightly cool surface. He withdrew when the images began to settle. He didn't want to know the future. \"Thank you.\" \"Lane, you're very much my son. You're also as much a victim of this as Clete is. Now, we'd better get to him. Alice isn't going to put us down anywhere until we're ready, then she'll take us to a favorite spot of mine.\" \"Disneyland. Nineteen fifty-nine. Is that why Alice looks like a little silver travel trailer most of the time?\" \"I don't know. It's her choice. I do rather like it though. Rolled awning, wheels and all. I spent nearly a hundred years on Earth once. Towed her behind a car and explored North America.\" \"Motorcycles!\" \"Yes, those too. I have several of different types. Racing and doing stunt shows was a good excuse to travel and paid enough I didn't constantly have to worry about running out of money.\" \"Easier than the rock shoveling I thought I'd be doing. I couldn't even have gone to school. The first time someone got a stethoscope on me... \" \"Yes. You'd have spent all your time hiding what you are. You don't have my power. I just hypnotized doctors into forgetting I had two hearts.\" \"You fought in their wars.\" \"Several of them. Seemed like every time I changed identities, I got drafted. Very long ago, but I still remember. Especially Korea and Vietnam. Not good memories.\" \"Why did you do it?\" \"I could save lives. Some that lived through those wars wouldn't have if I hadn't been their sergeant. But I took lives too. Too many.\" \"You once told me you were a hippie.\" \"I went back and joined protests against racism and Vietnam. I didn't like the drug scene, but I liked the ideals of love and peace. Liked the music too.\" \"A red Gibson Les Paul and a clear Dan Armstrong bass. I've seen them.\" \"That bass put blisters on my fingers, but it has the most incredible tone. Lane, when do I find her?\" \"Dad, Mom's not the girl of your dreams, but she'll make you incredibly happy. She dies, but it's not really death. She has to go back to where we found her.\" \"But you said… I don't understand.\" \"I can't explain it. She's... something else, but she came to you as a woman, a human woman.\" \"The girl of my dreams. She's going to haunt me for another ten thousand years, isn't she?\" \"No, Dad, forever. But always with the promise of someday. She comes again right after Mom leaves.\" \"Admitting that's reassuring feels distinctly odd. Clete's going to wake up soon.\" \"Dad, open yourself to Clete and Dutch. They need to know you. Just as I did.\" \"I want to know them too.\" Gallant took them to Disneyland, then to other places he loved. He began to get into very good condition as he helped Clete get back into it. Then he took them fishing and relaxed just a bit too much. \"NO!\" \"Ah, the slave. You see slave, I have found your children. I've spent nearly one hundred years hunting you. Since you have children, I know it's been longer for you. You should have stayed away. I wouldn't have pursued you. You meant nothing. I had those telepaths at my feet. They were mine! Then you came. Three boys. They'll ease the irritation I felt the times I thought I'd killed you, then discovered you were still alive.\" \"Please, Hensk, Lord Master, spare them. I beg you. I will give my pledge to serve you and never seek escape.\" \"Don't be foolish. I already have you. We will return to the world I left a hundred years ago. They will hold you. The Dark One shall reign. Nothing will stop it. Rorisk will love your pretty boys. I think I'll loan you all to him.\" \"No, I won't allow you to do that.\" \"Did you know I had you altered? I won't have to wait long for these. They're probably capable of siring children now. I'll have them stimmed and try them with females of other species until I find one cross-fertile. You obviously did. It should be a very interesting process. Now, what is the best way to do this? Ah, I have it. You three put these chains on, or I will kill your father.\" Turning the weapon on Gallant was a mistake. He charged it. He expected to die, but Hensk would never get another shot off. His sons would kill him. He wondered how he'd found them. He felt the shot. Clete held on against the storm of emotion. He had to get through to the brother who was the source of it. \"Kill him! Do it now. Do it, Lane. Think about who he is. What he is. What he did to Dad. Kill him.\" \"Clete, I--\" \"DO IT!\" \"Yes. For my father.\" \"All right. Now, you check Dutch. I'll... Oh, damn. Lane, try to get over the changes. Past them. Whatever. I need you. They're both alive, but that's all I know.\" \"Go. They're not settling. It's uncertain. Dad. Help Dad. I'll... check Dutch. Medunit. Get unit. Call Alice. She'll--\" \"ALICE! Alice, help me!\" Clete said thank you many times in the not quite hour that seemed like many. Most of the thanks were to his mother. He knew when Lane began to regain consciousness and was beside him with a nourishing broth she'd taught him to make when he opened his eyes. \"Fishing trip. Vacation. Some vacation. Drink.\" \"Clete?\" \"Check your memories, Lane. They're both going to make it. Good thing I ran out of things to read and got into Mom's medical texts.\" \"Dad's in trance.\" \"Yeah. I used the medunit on him to help him along. Dutch knocked the blaster down just enough. Missed his head. Ah, Dutch is coming around. I'm in love with Alice. Aren't I, Sweetheart? She came. Just... materialized around us. Left Hensk outside. Still there I guess. Drink the rest. It's a good vitamin and mineral mix with more calories than you'd think. Got to get to Dutch. He'll wake up screaming for Dad.\" \"Let him know he saved him. Fastest move I've ever seen anyone make. Other than Dad.\" \"Yeah. Other than Dad. Later.\" Clete walked into Dutch's room and took his hand. He forced himself to calm. Dutch wasn't even fully conscious yet and he was already desperately worried. \"Dad's alive! He'll make it! Take it easy. You saved him. He's hurt, but he'll live.\" \"I couldn't let him die, Clete. I... love him so much.\" \"That is obvious. Dutch, you moved faster than humanly possible. Much faster.\" \"I've always been fast. They say Mom was.\" \"No, Dutch. We've been training together for weeks. You never moved at anything like that speed. You may be as fast as Dad. How's your head?\" \"Brother empath, you know. Thumping. Tell me the story.\" \"You hit the barrel and he creamed you with the stock.\" \"Hensk?\" \"Lane took the weapon and killed him. Wasn't easy. He finally went all cool and did it. Said, \"For my father.\" Went clear out afterward. Pretty heavy change, I guess. Surprised he held up as long as he did. He went dizzy as soon as that creep came out of the trees.\" \"Weird, Clete. Didn't that guy know it wouldn't work? If Dad hadn't escaped, he wouldn't have us. If he didn't have us, Hensk couldn't take us.\" \"I don't think he cared. Dutch, all he wanted was to have Dad beg for us. He planned on killing him anyway. Just wanted him to grovel at his feet.\" \"And he did.\" \"For us. Offered himself up in bondage in exchange, then tried to give his life. Yeah. Tried. He charged straight in. I felt him intend to die. He was too scared for us to think. If he died, Lane wouldn't exist. I'd still be at home. You'd still be in a Fed school.\" \"Would we? Or do we sort of exist in our own timestream? We took Lane's mother to Dad. What if... What if I couldn't... get her? Would he have just disappeared from between us?\" \"No answers, Dutch. Maybe it was always supposed to happen this way. As for his mother, she was trying desperately to break through. Never felt anyone... thing, whatever, want someone like she wanted Dad.\" \"Even I could feel it. Well, now what?\" \"We wait for Dad to wake up surprised to wake up.\" \"Yeah, the nicest kind of surprise. How… \" \"Pretty bad. He'll be under awhile.\" Gallant was as surprised as Clete expected. He made sure they were all leaning over him, right where he'd see them as soon as he opened his eyes, but he almost landed on him when the rush of relief hit him. \"You're all here.\" \"Yes. And so are you. Hensk isn't. The last one is gone, Dad. Lane 'remembered' you telling him the code and blew the ship. Dutch yelped and we lit out. Said he felt something.\" \"Where are we, Clete?\" \"Ask Lane. He set the coordinates.\" \"Ophidus sector. Nice and quiet.\" \"My home world is near here.\" \"That's why it's quiet. Safest place I could think of.\" \"OK. Enough. Sleep. You're exhausted.\" \"Not yet, Clete. How?\" \"Seems Dutch inherited more than your good looks. He moves fast.\" \"Who killed Hensk?\" \"I did.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"I'm not, but I didn't enjoy it.\" \"Good. I'm afraid I would have.\" \"Damn it, Dad. Sleep!\" \"Yes, Clete, and well. But hugs first. Dutch?\" \"Wow, first even. Sleep, Dad. We love you.\" He did. Soundly. For six days. Strangely, it was almost two full days longer than he'd tranced. He deserved it. He'd spent his life pursuing the servants of the Dark One he'd allowed into the universe. He'd still run into them now and again, but he could reverse any damage they did and run. He knew they would all be destroyed. Now he was truly free to begin fighting the Dark One himself. **** Dutch didn't know how he knew what the sudden shock had been, but he did. He ran out of his room yelling. \"Lane! Something's happened to Dad! Damn! Clete! Lane's out cold! Bring him! We've got to find Dad!\" They found him deep in Alice beside a small pool of clear water. Dutch wasn't sure how he'd found him either. He'd just run in the direction that 'felt' right, but he'd been to the pool before. \"He came to the pool, Dutch. I could swear... Dutch, I looked for this the other day. I swear it wasn't--\" \"There are a lot of odd things in this ship, Clete. Lane's told me about a few of them. He even told me where some of them were. I didn't find a meadow he talked about either. He's out cold too. Doesn't seem to be... Clete, he has a sword in his hand. He's holding it tight, but it's too cold for me to touch. Both shoulders of his shirt just crumbled when I moved him.\" \"Like they were dipped in liquid nitro. Dutch, he's ice cold.\" \"His hearts are beating steady.\" \"He's coming around.\" \"Dad! Dad, wake up! What happened?\" \"Hello. Did you hear them?\" \"Hear?\" \"The voices, Dutch. The music. I followed it here, then... NO! I don't want to be... Too late. I already gave my oath. Made the choice. Did it ten thousand years ago. Never expected to have it made official. I hate being drafted!\" \"You may hate being drafted, but you're extremely proud and rather overawed at the moment.\" \"Too accurate, Clete. My shoulders hurt. How's Lane?\" \"Coming around. Could you please give us an explanation?\" \"Someone, who called himself my father-in-law, just knighted me. Informed me I was Knight Hero and had been chosen to protect this universe. Said I'd been doing it long enough to prove I was capable of it. Hello, Lane, I think I just met your grandfather.\" He kept them with him for more than a year. Taught them and trained them to fight at his side. Laughed with them and shouted at them. And learned to love them too well. Not long after he nearly lost Dutch to a horror even he couldn't have survived, he took them to Dutch's universe, where it didn't exist, and left them on the Curie. Captain Merris was rather surprised, but promised to get them into the academy. He hunted Telas. He had a gift he wanted him to give them. He returned to his own universe aching with the pain of farewell.",

Professor, I don't think it's... I think they're alien.\" \"Oh, my. Let me see that corder. Hmm. You may be right. Exhume them carefully, then we'll take them for a full scan at the university.\" \"I'd really rather you didn't.\" \"Who are you?\" \"My name is Gallant.\" \"Uh, Alan, leave it.\" \"Professor, you've got to be kidding!\" \"No, I'm not. Please don't ask questions. Go back to camp and send Mick to me. Don't talk about it, Alan.\" Gallant smiled at the confused young man. \"Alan, come here. I'll explain. Those bones are why I'm here. They have no business being on Earth. In a moment, they won't be. You're on your way back to camp to send Mick to the professor. It's been a long day. You've enjoyed it, but didn't find anything unusual.\" \"You hypnotized him.\" \"Yes, I did. How did you know who I was? You recognized my name instantly.\" \"Pepperoni pizza has been a March Eighth tradition in my family for five generations.\" \"Ah, I see. And who is Mick?\" \"My son, Miklos. I've got a thing for ancient Greece. I think it began with my name.\" \"Your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Professor Athena Buchannon. Oh, dear! What did I do?!\" She sat down next to the big, beautiful, blond, family legend and watched him. He looked pretty stunned. She wondered why she wasn't. Maybe because it was March Eighth. Or would have been by the old calendar. Suddenly an intense wave of mingled emotions washed over her. Foremost was a kind of ironic joy. \"Whoa! Warn me if you're going to let loose with a blast like that, please.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I'm a very strong empath. You just about flattened me. All right, what's with the bones?\" \"I'm not sure. Athena, are you a... I'm not sure how to ask this. Are you gene selected?\" \"Great-great-grandmother Alice's project. Yes, though it ended a while back. I didn't pick my husband from stus at the U in Alaska. They were still a bit disappointed. I'm the cream of the crop they tell me. I'm fifty-two. Got three PhD's, an MD and I'm continental martial arts champion. In the Olympics twice in biathlon. Medaled both times. My son Mick's on his way. Curious. Real curious.\" \"Hi, Mom. Uh, huh. Well, from the way you're brimming, I'd say Gallant showed up for pepperoni pizza. Hi, Gallant. I'm Mick.\" \"I take it you're an empath too.\" \"Not really. Just with Mom. Dad before he died. High psi, but no breakthrough. Just poten. What's that?\" Gallant turned the small unit over in his hands. He'd built it because Athena had told him it would be needed. \"It will give me the genetic code of the bones, their age, then destroy them. One of the dark brothers seems to have decided to meddle in Earth's distant past. The bones indicate I might have a chance at stopping him.\" \"You mean they indicate you will stop him.\" \"No, Mick, I don't. Chance exists. The course of life in the universe can be changed. Earth could become a barren ball and have always been that way. Or be totally changed. The bones merely mean I can succeed. Keyed. Stand back a bit. You too, Athena. I've never used this before and I'd rather not learn it's too wide a band by having you two disappear.\" \"Oh, terrific. Come on, Mom. Let's get uphill.\" Gallant smiled. He really liked the pair of them. He wondered where the bright coppery hair had come from. Julie's family had all had hair in varying shades of soft brown. He waited until they were some distance away, keyed the unit, then ran to join them. They watched as the ground sank very slightly in the area. \"Good. Now, let's see how I did.\" \"Gallant, I've found more bones. Hmm... NO! This gets changed! Mick, pack us. We're going with him. Do it! Send resigs to the foundation. Get a super out here for the kids.\" \"Mom, Elaine?\" \"Up to you, Mick.\" \"Athena, you aren't coming with me! I never take anyone with me!\" \"You do this time, Gallant. I'm going to do my bit to change the universe. This is probably why I was born. The other bones are yours. I'm going to see to it they're not here.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, oh.\" \"It's still too dangerous. Athena, I won't trade your lives for mine. It's been incredibly long and full. I'm sorry, I won't take you. I'll be careful.\" \"No. You'll take us or I'll hunt for your ship. It's got to be around here someplace. I'll look for it until I find it, then I'll follow. Probably take me a hundred years to figure it out, but I will. If I don't, my son, or my grandkids, or my great-grandkids, or however many it takes, will. You are not going to die in Earth's past.\" \"One of those selected genes was for stubborn!\" \"Yeah, that too. I like it when you yell at me. It's loud, but it's all exasperated 'I care' underneath.\" \"You're really determined to go with me.\" \"Yes, Gallant. There's more to it. I'm bored. I have skills that I can't use for anything but play-acting. I'm a trained researcher in a half-dozen fields that are dying out or have too many in them already. The world is a delightfully peaceful and prosperous place and it's driving me crazy.\" \"And Mick?\" \"Inseparable. Too closely linked. Elaine's his love. I can't imagine her allowing herself to be left behind. You'll like her. Gallant, she's family already and she doesn't really have other. She said she'd recognize her mother, because she's seen her on vid. We don't even need to come back. The three of us can say farewell and no one will hunt us. She's making pepperoni pizza. She loved the idea. Right in the middle of modern Greece, she's making an old Italian dish American style. Come on. She's a great cook. Almost as good as Mick. Have to say you look like you appreciate good cooking.\" \"I'm comfortable this way.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm putting us all on a training program. We're all going to be in top form when we... Gallant, you just decided to take us along, didn't you?\" \"Yes. Your empathic powers are strong.\" \"It's not that. Look at the dig, Gallant. Look close.\" \"They're gone!\" \"Yeah, both sets. There's no settled earth. We've got a chance! Come on! Let's eat!\" **** \"Damn, you're just about too gorgeous to exist. Now I see why Great-great-great-grandmother Julie called you an angel. You look like you walked out of a Renaissance painting. Gallant, we're going to tower over these people. You know, no one ever mentioned how tall you are.\" \"I wasn't. I grow a bit once in a while.\" \"Explain that. You got a real weird feeling. Come on, Gallant. You know I'm too curious to drop it.\" \"I discovered it a few thousand years ago. Now, you see, I haven't even begun explaining and you're already shocked.\" \"No, but a 'few thousand' did knock me a bit.\" \"You're sure? Well, I'd never really been hurt badly. I'd learned my body could heal itself. I drop into a trance state, light enough I can find water and food if I must, during it. It's not restful. I sleep an approximately equal time afterward. This particular occasion, I tranced nine days. Yes, a lot. It was the first time I'd run into Hensk. I had him. Or thought I did. I chased him into a building on Apboretha. His ship was on the ground floor. It was a trap. He took off and dropped the building on me. I'd never had a broken bone. I made up for it. Multiple fractures. Arms, legs, ribs. I'd nearly gotten out. Somehow, the building missed my head. An old female dug me out and stayed by me. She gave me water and cared for me. I think she set the bones. My body grew. It strengthened itself by becoming taller and thicker. I'm incredibly dense. I weigh half again as much as a human my size. After that I came back to Earth. I needed to learn a lot more about just staying alive in an environment that... Anyway, that's why I'm about six-four and massive.\" \"Six-four? Gallant, we haven't used those terms for... a couple of cens. Well, a cen-and-a-half.\" \"Athena, I spent more than a century on Earth. The twentieth. I kept getting drafted. I hate being drafted.\" \"You went to war?\" \"Four of them. Two world wars, Korea and Vietnam. Grew a bit in all but the first. I was a very good sergeant. I only lost one man. Smitty. Right after we hit Omaha beach. I went back to the sixties later and marched for civil rights, then was a war protester.\" \"You were a hippie!\" \"That too.\" The last of the dark brothers had chosen to destroy the world and people he loved. He'd chosen the birthplace of western culture, Athens. Athena, Mick and Elaine had crammed to learn ancient Greek. They had Gallant to help with accent. Athena had been right. He liked Elaine. She was very proficient in the martial arts, but no one he'd ever seen was as good as Athena. Except himself. Mick was almost as good as his mother. \"Who's he after, Gallant?\" \"At a guess, Plato.\" \"Not Socrates?\" \"No, Athena, I don't think so. Plato would still have written his dialogues. They're the true treasure. Athena, you know the culture. You and Elaine are going to stand out even more than I do.\" \"I've given thought to that. Gallant, I'm gray-eyed Athena. You are Apollo. Mick and Elaine are minor divinities.\" \"Athena, that could seriously change the mythology of the period. We can't risk that. This time is pivotal in the development of your own civilization.\" \"It's just an expedient. You can use hypnosis to clear it. I got the idea when we landed atop Acropolis. There's another reason I chose this way. As gods, we won't be... pursued.\" \"Athena, I learned to handle male advances thousands of years ago. Your three times great-grandmother and a nice fellow named Chuck taught me.\" \"Hey, not just you. You may be super-gorgeous now that I've got you in shape, but Elaine, Mick and I are not mashed potatoes.\" \"No, you are champagne and caviar. All of you, but you most of all. Although, I'm not sure how I feel about your haircut.\" \"Short is practical. Cut it to a cen before every comp I was ever in. Call it battle dress. I'll be wearing a helm. At first anyway. Come on, Gallant. I can feel you've decided to go with my plan. Let's roll. Mick and Elaine are ready. Kiss for luck?\" It shocked them both. The sudden blending of their minds and the heat between them. He'd found the first Athena and she knew it too. \"Gallant, I don't quite know what to say. Nothing... Nothing like that ever... Not even with my husband.\" \"Athena, I've searched ten thousand years for you. Lead me, My Lady.\" \"Oh, Gallant, that's why I made you Apollo. We lead together. Let's go find Plato. Before I start trying to talk you into putting Alice on hover for a couple cens. Uh, hi, Mick, Elaine.\" \"Hi yourself, Mom. Very high. Grats, Gallant. You found your girl. And she's a beaut.\" \"That she is, Mick. Now, I have suddenly developed an acute desire to come out of this alive. Shall we see if we can accomplish it?\" **** \"Evil has come among you. Lo, Socrates, your students are endangered. I, Athena, seek Plato. Apollo has seen his destiny. One seeks to alter it.\" \"Oh, beautiful Goddess, he absents himself this day. His loves are not among these either. I had believed they sported on the slopes of Lykavittos. Now, I fear for them.\" \"Fear not. He is mine and in my keeping. Apollo, it pleases me to walk through my city. Will you speak to these? I would not change your vision with my presence.\" \"Yes, Athena, I shall touch each that the tale not be told. Come, Socrates, your words ring through the ages. Plato records them well. I would not have them changed. They guide the young of the future.\" \"Then I ask you take this vision.\" \"Socrates, I give you this day to remember us. On the morrow, you will awake, remembering all but our presence here and your trepidation over the fate of Plato. I bid you continue your discourse and pass this day as others. Speak not of us to those I have not touched.\" He gave each of them the same command, then ran after Athena. The speed of his run would convince Socrates and the young men they were, indeed, who they claimed to be. Athena was an excellent tactician. He struggled to calm himself. If he could keep his mind on the job at hand, he would have what he so desperately wanted. He could smell the evil. The dark brother was nearby. \"GALLANT!\" She saved his life. The dark brother had sprung from ambush and nearly shot him down. He suddenly knew the future she had changed. He would have been injured to dying, but would have killed the brother before death. It had been a trap. Plato wasn't the target. He was. \"NO! ATHENA!\" The sudden tears almost blinded him. The dark brother had shot her down. Mick and Elaine were headed toward the hooded figure at a run. He screamed in rage as he saw him shoot first Mick, then Elaine. He pulled the unit he'd built out and turned it on. It was still keyed to the dark brother's genetic code. He smiled as he listened to his death screams. It shocked him a bit. He had killed, but he had never enjoyed it before. He ran to Athena. She was alive! So were Mick and Elaine, but all were badly injured. Mick and Elaine he could save. Athena... No! She would not die! He needed Alice. Desperately. She wouldn't live through the journey to the ship. He laughed wildly as Alice materialized around them. Somehow, she had heard his need. And answered. He changed a decimal on the coordinates and threw her into flight. He had no idea where they were going, but the decimal point would insure a long flight. He did something he'd never done before. He placed Athena in nontime. She was the first living thing he'd ever risked suspending. He turned to Mick and Elaine, pulled out the medunit, and went to work on them. **** \"I can't find them, Elaine. I know they're here. I can feel it, but I can't find them.\" \"Mick, the note he left said he was going to try to heal her. You can feel she's still alive.\" \"Yeah, and still unconscious. This ship is huge. I only found my way back because I could feel you.\" \"What?\" \"Surprised me too. The link just grew with the love. Elaine, they're thirsty. At least she is. Terribly thirsty.\" \"Mick, this may sound weird, but ask the ship to help you find them. Told you it was weird.\" \"No, you're right. Come with me, Elaine. Pack food. I'm not kidding. We could end up dozens of Ks from here.\" \"All right. Give me five. Find a pack.\" They packed food. Mick said no to water. Gallant wouldn't have taken his mother anywhere they couldn't find it. He took Elaine's hand, then a deep breath. \"Alice, they need us. Please, help us find them.\" They set out hand in hand. Elaine squeezed his and smiled. All the corridors, but one, were dark. **** \"Mick, is she... out again?\" \"Just sleeping, Elaine. Gallant. Gallant, drink a bit of broth, then sleep. I know how it works. Mom told me.\" Mick sat back and smiled. They were both tired, but his mother's injuries were healed. \"Elaine, I'm going to trek back and check to see if Alice has anything she wants to tell us. I'll bring more food too. Stay with them?\" \"Naturally. Mick, this is a... bower. A beautiful clear pool, flowering trees, soft deep grass, roses on trellises... A bower in the middle of the ship.\" \"Not half the middle. You should see some of the... rooms. There's a meadow and a forest of strange trees. There's something that can only be a racecourse of some kind. There's a room full of nothing but labels hanging in the air, all with names of musical instruments. Bedrooms in a hundred different styles... Thousands of rooms. Told you I got lost. I keep looking for a kitchen closer to us, but haven't found one. Well, it's only a little more than a K. Not bad. Be back. Love.\" \"Love. Mick! How long?\" \"Sleep? Same as trance. Five days. Want a book or three?\" \"Yes. No, bring my pack. Might as well work on my thesis. I might get to deliver it.\" \"Bother you?\" \"No. Truth is, I'm as excited as I've been about anything in my life. You?\" \"About. Right up there with you saying yes when I asked you out the first time. Elaine, marry me.\" \"Gee, I thought I was going to have to ask you.\" **** \"Hensk. I can feel him. He's teamed up with the bel-Nathans. Nasty combo. Those people don't stand a chance. Wonder why he's so interested... Telepaths! A whole race of telepaths! I've got to help them. I'll get you somewhere safe, Athena.\" \"Gallant, you're not going into battle without me to watch your back.\" \"Athena, I don't want you in danger!! I want you safe!!\" \"Yell at me some more. I love it. Hey, I love you. Don't expect to keep you, but intend to have more than so far. Much more. Hensk is the last one, Gallant. And he scares you. Bad. He's got you... programmed. How many times have you met up with him?\" \"Seven.\" \"And?\" \"He got away.\" \"And you got hurt.\" \"That too.\" It happened the same way again, but it took nearly seven years. Seven years of running, fighting, running... The telepaths helped. So did the augmented horses Athena and Gallant gave them for transport. They all fell in love with the people, especially their leader Chervan. Communication wasn't difficult. The telepaths, some of them, learned to vocalize, in English. Gallant taught 'finger speech' to the others. He was uncomfortable communicating telepathically. The concussion he sustained, when Hensk blew out a mountainside trying to kill him, kept Gallant from going into trance. Athena never left his side the twelve weeks it took him to heal. She'd never let go of his hand the two weeks he lay unconscious. He spent four more months with her. \"The dreams.\" \"Yes, Athena, the dreams. She's come back.\" \"You're going alone, aren't you, Gallant?\" \"Athena... \" \"I've always known the time would come.\" \"Do you want to go home?\" \"This is home. There's nothing on Earth for me. Mick and Elaine feel the same. Our skills are needed here. Besides, Chervan and I together are an unbeatable combo. We'll get this world out of the stone age and on the road back to tech civ in nothing flat. Gallant, I want... Before you go... \" \"Tell me, Athena.\" \"I want all of you. I want the whole thing that I got just a taste of the first time we kissed. Drop your barriers with me just once. It's the one memory I want I don't have.\" She recoiled in shock when he opened his mind to her. He dropped his arms to his sides and turned away. He should have known better. \"No, Gallant! Stop! Again. Slowly this time. It was just too much all at once. You carry so much loneliness and pain. It hurts me to feel it. Show me the love and joy too. I want to know all of you. Love all of you.\" He stood with his back to her, desperately trying to rebuild his barriers. \"No, Athena. Even I don't want to know all of it. I put it all away and forget as much as I can. I surprised myself too. Chervan is scolding me. It seems I knocked half the paths on the planet to their knees. She's not really angry, just upset I didn't give them enough warning to get their barriers up.\" \"Warn them now. Don't argue, Gallant. I won't listen and I won't let you win.\" \"I don't really want to win. I want this memory too.\" **** He wandered. The dreams had sent him from Athena, but not to anywhere. He restlessly searched for Hensk, dodged a few attacks by dark brethren he'd already destroyed, and wandered. \"Find her, my gallant one. Find the second who bears my name. Build the door.\" He awoke aching with loneliness. A door? A door to where? He stumbled to the comp station. He was being driven. He avoided looking in a mirror. He knew what he'd see. Knew because his clothes hung on him. Knew because he couldn't eat or rest. A door to where? A door to beyond where he was? Where was he? He began again. From where he was. If he defined that, he would, perhaps, know what was beyond. The name Hrune. It came to his mind again. Hrune... He tapped Alice's memory banks. Hrune... Yes! Orbel Hrune, Lahathan mathematician. Theory of infinite universes. He patted the console. \"Thank you, Alice. Now I know what door I'm to build. Let's see if you and I can figure out how to build it. I hope you're in the mood to help.\" She was, but it still required months of work. Most at the comp station. He found a red giant to power it and began the work of building it. Athena hadn't come to his dreams since he'd begun the work. She came the night before he opened the door and whispered, \"The second Athena.\" Gallant cautiously explored the universe he'd created a way into. It shocked him when he discovered it was 'the same' as his. He was sure it shouldn't be. He was stunned when he learned his own people didn't exist in it. There was a race as old as his in another galaxy, but very different. He wasn't surprised to discover he actually liked them better. He set coordinates for Earth. It was home in his emotions and humans were the people he truly needed to know existed in this universe. Alice flashed \"Well it's about time, Nervous Nellie!\" on her screen and he laughed. \"You're right, Alice. I've been avoiding it, just as I avoided visiting Earth after the twentieth century, for several thousand years, because I was afraid it would change too much. This universe shouldn't be at all like ours, but it is. And telling myself it doesn't matter if there aren't humans in it is not working.\" He hopped through time. Humans not only existed, they flourished. By the twenty-second century, they'd put all their boundless energy into exploring their galaxy. Earth was the home of the Orion Arm Federation of Free Worlds and the base of the highly regarded Exploration Fleet, but they had a problem. It was called the Durcassin Empire. He hopped forward and saw the Federation and the Empire settle into an uneasy truce. The Federation grew on one side of the wide 'Zone of Neutrality,' by inviting space-faring peoples to join. The Empire grew on the other side, by conquest. Gallant decided he was lonesome and wanted people to talk to. He laughed when Alice gave him the location of a group of humans. She knew him very well. She flashed, \"And it's a dangerous place.\" He told her to give him data and hurry. He knew what 'kind' of danger when she landed. The fact she landed close, told him she was worried. He walked around a small outcropping and introduced himself. \"Hello, I'm Gallant.\" \"You have no business being here!\" \"Hey! The weapon is hardly necessary. I'm unarmed and intend injury to no one.\" \"Commander Telas?\" \"He's as unarmed as he claims, Captain. My sensors detect nothing that could be construed as dangerous.\" \"Cybernetic augmentation. Isn't that a bit unusual?\" Gallant smiled and cautiously lowered his hands. \"It wasn't a choice. Captain, he's not human. Very advanced physiology. Two hearts and a unique cell structure. Slow continual replacement. He probably has a life span of thousands of years.\" \"Thank you, Commander. Now, Mr. Gallant, why don't you tell me what you're doing on a planet that's, basically, falling apart under our feet.\" \"Looking for someone to talk to. Your scientific teams attracted my attention. I just decided to be friendly and say hello. Hello.\" The captain laughed and Gallant's smile widened. He'd missed humans. \"You've picked a pretty unstable setting for a chat. I'm Justin Merris, captain of the Federation Exploration Vessel Curie. We're trying to find out why this is the fourth planet in this region that's disintegrating.\" \"I think I know what's happening to the planet. If I'm right, it will spread. I'll give you the data I've collected.\" \"Thank you. It'll probably give my security chief fits, but why don't you come back to the ship and have a cup of coffee with me?\" \"I'd love to. With your permission, I'll land my craft in your shuttle bay. Captain, I'm going to take a very unusual step and invite Commander Telas aboard my ship, to make the journey with me. He's already deduced more than I really want known about me. I'd like the opportunity to convince him not to reveal everything he learns. The best way to do that is let him know everything, then choose not to reveal it.\" \"Commander?\" \"It's rather convoluted logic, Captain, but a very accurate judgment of my personality. I believe Lt. Ochis would feel a great deal more comfortable about having both his craft and him aboard if I arrived in it.\" \"Agreed. Commander Duchelle!\" \"Yes, Sir! Where did he come from?\" \"A ship. Mr. Gallant, Lieutenant Commander Athena Duchelle.\" \"Athena?! How interesting. Just Gallant. Now, Commander, if you'll come this way, I'll show you my ship.\" Gallant just turned and walked off. He couldn't think of anything to say to her. He noticed Telas followed at a nod from his captain, but he was a bit surprised he did. He wasn't surprised by what the woman named Athena said behind him. \"Well! I've never had quite that reaction to my name before. Or quite that response to an introduction. Not the politest person I've ever met.\" \"Commander Duchelle, your greeting was not exactly fleet protocol. He's not human. Telas seems to find him more than a little intriguing. He also seems to have some idea what's happening to this world. Finish your tests, then report to me aboard the ship.\" \"Yes, Captain. Non-human. Hmm.\" \"Commander, your intense interest in non-human anthros almost got you left behind on Base Six Four. This is not the place to be thinking of other things. I'd like as much information as we can get before this world becomes an asteroid belt.\" \"I know, I know. Curb my curiosity and get on with the job at hand. Yes, Captain. Still, he's very interesting.\" \"Yes, and he has data to add to yours, so I suggest you assemble some.\" \"Yes, Sir. We're about done.\" Gallant didn't take Telas directly to the Curie. It was nearly three months before he took him there. Of course, it was only ten minutes as far as the captain was concerned. In those months, they became very good friends. They had a great deal in common. Telas' cyber augmentation had been done by an alien scientific group when he was a child. He had been, basically, a slave to the computer that ran their ship. A fleet ship had tracked the abducted human children and freed them, but too late for Telas. Federation medical knowledge was incapable of reversing the augmentation. Telas would live for thousands of years as part man, part computer. He laughed when he told Gallant Alice was the first girl he'd ever truly loved. Gallant smiled and ached for him. The laugh was real, but tinged with longing. Gallant showed Telas what was causing the breakup. The device was small and nearly undetectable in the vast reaches of the neutral territory. The Empire had invented a new weapon. Soon it would begin to destabilize stars. Soon after, it would affect inhabited worlds. They landed on the Curie and Gallant joined the captain for coffee. They'd just begun to chat when Telas' voice came over the com. \"Gallant! Now!\" Gallant ran from the captain's ready room. Telas had a man in his arms and was stepping into a lift. Gallant leapt consoles and people and dove into it just as the doors began to close. \"Emergency one, shuttle bay two. Emergency two, medical. He's a mess inside. I don't know how he got from the pad to the lift. 'Something' destabilized the transport system. You stunned the bridge crew.\" \"If I didn't know better, I'd think you planned it. You timed it perfectly. Shuttle bay first.\" \"Doctor Marsh says we can save him, but Commander Duchelle is still on the planet and it's coming apart. I couldn't get her on comm.\" \"Damn! Telas, convince him he must violate neutral space. Destroy that thing.\" \"I will.\" Gallant ran for Alice as soon as the lift doors opened. He hadn't given the captain an easy job. The Curie would take a real beating just getting close enough to blast the device. He'd take a real beating saving Commander Duchelle. He didn't quite reach her before it began. Athena got a shoulder under him and got him to his feet. The landslide had rolled him about three hundred meters, then near buried him. She was amazed he was alive and astounded he was conscious. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" \"Would you believe rescuing you? My ship's over that cliff that used to be a ridge. Your transporter is nonfunctional.\" \"This job would be easier if you weren't quite so... \" \"Comfortable. I'd still weigh more than a human. This won't work. There just isn't time. Here. Go. Take this. It's the key to my ship. Push the green button on the navigation console. It'll take you to the nearest inhabited planet.\" \"Look, big, blond, and 'comfortable', you'll get out of this with me, or we'll not get out of it together. Don't argue! Just keep going.\" \"Why do I keep meeting stubborn women named Athena?!\" \"Explain that statement while I 'stubborn' us to a bit more stable ground. If there is any.\" \"There isn't. This whole planet is about to crumble around us. LOOK OUT!!\" She cried as she rigged a travois. He'd pushed her out of the way, then thrown himself between her and the falling, bouncing rock. It would have killed her. She didn't know why it hadn't killed him. She reminded herself the travois \"put basic physics to work\" and she knew she could do it, dragged him to a spot that didn't have tumbling cliffs on both sides and dropped to the ground, exhausted. The planet was coming apart, but she had to rest. Gallant awoke and looked around. Athena Duchelle was curled on the ground near where he lay. She'd gotten him a long way while he was unconscious. He decided it was probably his turn. He assessed his condition and smiled. He'd always liked a challenge. He struggled to his knees, waited for his head to stop spinning and his vision to clear, then got to his feet. She was small and ordinarily he'd have found her weight an easy load, but this wasn't ordinarily. He decided she'd been asleep when the rock hit her. She'd probably regain consciousness in a few hours. But they didn't have a few hours. He got his bearings, put her on the travois and set out. He faced the hill and laid down the travois. He'd have to carry her. He begged for just a little luck. If the hill would stay stable just a few minutes, he thought he could make it to Alice with her. He picked her up and started up the hill. He got about two-thirds of the way before the hill began to disintegrate. Suddenly, Alice was around him. He laughed, told her he loved her, gently laid Commander Duchelle on the floor and collapsed, before he could get his healing unit out of his pocket. **** Athena looked around. They had to be in his ship. She felt a faint vibration, so she knew they were in flight. How had they gotten there and where was he? She found him. He was unconscious on the floor not far from her. She rolled him over gently and began to examine him. Broken clavicle, scapula, ribs, badly bruised leg, she thought his sternum might be cracked and his mass of blond curly hair was matted with blood. And somehow, he'd gotten her to his ship and off the disintegrating planet. She'd found the one she'd been looking for. She smiled at the thought her little-girl white-knight dreams fit with grown-up girl plan, after all, even if he was a bit plump for the armor. Now to keep him alive to accomplish it. She gave up hunting for medical supplies after she'd gotten lost twice and nearly didn't find her way back to the control center. She settled for a small basin of water and a soft cloth. \"Hello.\" \"Hello, Gallant. How'd we get here?\" \"We staggered, until a beautiful lady performed an impossible rescue.\" \"What?\" \"My ship just does the impossible now and then. Neither of us can figure out how. Unh. There seem to be pieces of me where there shouldn't.\" \"Broken ribs. Several. How in hell did you pull that travois with a broken clavicle and scapula?\" \"I didn't pull it far. Couldn't get it up the hill.\" \"You carried me?!\" \"You don't weigh much. Probably not more than a hundred twenty pounds, soaking wet.\" \"Pounds?! Gallant, you use some amazing terms; weeks, months, pounds.\" \"Showing my age. Still hovering. The Curie may be in trouble. Alice needs my help to find her. I need yours to get to the controls. Push that chair over here, then help me into it.\" \"At least you have sense enough not to try to stand. Lord! You're heavy!\" \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lean on you that much. I weigh near three times what you do. Did I hurt you?\" \"No. I knew it and was prepared to help. I just didn't expect you to need it that fast. Concussion too. Had to be with that smack you got. You didn't expect dizzy to make slow assist fast support, either.\" \"I do know how strong you are. You pulled me a long way.\" \"We wouldn't have made it without both of us. Gallant gestures are wonderful. Teamwork is practical. What are you doing?\" \"Helping Alice find the Curie. The course was plotted by Telas, a person, not a computer. There wasn't time to input the data.\" \"Computers can't play hunches and Telas has the most data as a base for his. You know the data he's got.\" \"Precisely. Got her. Put us in her engineering section, Alice. I think Telas and I can hold her together long enough to destroy that disrupter. Athena, how well do you know her systems?\" \"I helped design them. She's a prototype. I hitched a ride on her for this mission. Pulled 'Mama's baby' and they let me get away with it.\" \"We're landing. Get someone to help me to the Curie's engineering console, then let Telas know I want him on the ops station.\" She ran for help. She barked, \"Work now, questions later!\" at the two open-mouthed crewmen who stopped and stared at the room too big to be in the little travel trailer. They got Gallant to the main engineering console of the shaking ship and held him up while he worked. Athena worked on the secondary station and implemented the commands that flashed across her screen. Telas did the same thing on the bridge. They tuned the shields, dampened the oscillation, the ship steadied and damage control began to catch up. The captain gave the order and the device was destroyed. The Curie raced for Federation space. Gallant smiled and collapsed. \"Get him to Medical. Now! STOP! You can't carry him like that! Telas! Am I glad to see you! He's got a broken clavicle and scapula and ribs and a concussion. Probably a half dozen other--\" \"I'll carry him. Get a lift and notify Dr. Marsh we're coming. He's his own best healer, but with a concussion, he'll need help.\" As soon as they got on the lift, Telas had Athena get Gallant's healing unit out of his pocket. He looked at the readings, then told her to put it back in the pocket. She raised an eyebrow. \"He doesn't need more help than we can give him. That unit isn't a great deal better than ours, just enough faster to make the med techs too curious.\" \"His ship is going to drive me crazy. It's smaller than it was in the shuttle bay.\" \"Only the physical interface. The ship is still infinite.\" \"Mathematical construct.\" \"Yes, a programmed set of dimensions. There's a very rare non-replicable isotope at the heart of it, but the rest is all a program he wrote. He called it the mathematics of finite infinity. I managed not to say that was a contradiction.\" \"It exists, so it's not impossible. Of course, I'll probably spend the rest of my life reminding myself of it. Get him to teach you why it's not, someday. He has enough time, too.\" \"Thank you, for understanding knowing someone who does means a great deal to me.\" \"I also know there's far too much caring there for a few minutes. It exists, so it's not impossible. Lynn!\" \"Him there. You there. Now, Lieutenant!\" \"Yes, Commander.\" Gallant was unconscious for two days. Dr. Marsh told them it was actually some kind of trance state. Once she'd healed his concussion, his own system had taken over and begun healing his other injuries. She complained about tripping over people every time she turned around, but smiled when she groused. Athena, Telas and Captain Merris smiled back. He awoke and asked for water, drank deeply and drifted off to sleep. Lynn Marsh sighed and tripped over people for two more days. Midday of the second day, Athena asked for her help. \"I think you're crazy.\" \"We've talked about this before, Lynn.\" \"Theoretically, not as a course of action.\" \"I'm going to the Pauling. She's got the finest medical facilities in space. I want this and I do know what I'm doing.\" \"I'm not sure it will work. Athena, he's very, very different.\" \"Yes. And very, very special.\" \"You're in love with him!\" \"Oh, yes, since I was eight. I always helped the white knight rescue me in my fantasies, but I know he's going to leave. Lynn, he's not even from this universe. Came through a 'doorway,' he called it.\" \"Two hearts, continual cell replacement, another set of chromosomes, for heaven's sake!\" \"And two arms, two legs, blond curly hair, beautiful voice, the gentlest smile.\" \"I give up. If gray-eyed Athena, connoisseur of the fleet, thinks a slightly plump alien is the most perfect male in existence, who am I to argue?\" \"Did you notice? He has gray eyes too. Sort of a sea mist blue-green gray and the fairest skin--\" \"Stop, already. I'm convinced. Climb on the table and let's get this started before I regain my sanity. But I get to be there for the finale. If it works.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it will.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it probably could, maybe.\" \"You don't really doubt it will, either.\" \"I'm a doctor. I believe in good science and miracles.\" **** \"You mean you can cook?!\" \"Gallant, I can do almost anything. Following a recipe isn't that different from following a chemical formula. Not that I need a recipe. Traditional New Orleans fare. Seven bells. My quarters. See you then.\" \"I'll be there.\" Telas watched Athena walk away and grinned. \"Gallant, you're in for a treat. Athena grew up in New Orleans. Everyone in the fleet has tried to talk her into cooking dinner at one time or another. Every man has tried to get an invitation to her quarters.\" \"Uh, oh.\" \"Relax. You're not really her type, too comfortable. She likes slender with lots of muscle.\" \"More than half the reason I'm the way I am is to avoid being someone's type.\" \"Gallant, you've had thousands of years of experience. Women shouldn't make you that nervous.\" \"Telas, those thousands of years of experience are why women make me nervous.\" He decided he was in trouble right after he pulled a rose from a nontime pocket and gave it to her at her door. Her smile was warm enough to raise the ship's ambient temperature two degrees and his a bit more than that. She'd looked so lovely framed in the doorway with the glow of candlelight behind her, he'd done it without thinking about it first. He was too lost in her smile to notice she hadn't asked how he'd made the rose appear. Dinner was superb. He enjoyed it, the soft jazz playing in the background and her company. He also enjoyed the excellent wine she served him. \"Athena, thank you. It's been a very pleasant evening. Dinner was wonderful. I enjoyed it immensely.\" \"Good, then you'll stay a bit longer.\" \"I really should go.\" \"Can you dance?\" \"Of course I can dance.\" \"Here, one glass each of wine left. And a dance before you leave. Gallant, I know you're going to slip off to Alice and leave for wonderland.\" \"Not many people catch that allusion. Yes, Athena, it's time for me to return to my own universe. Oops! My, you're quick.\" \"Fastest reflexes in the fleet. Other than Telas. Barely spilled a drop. Why don't you drink it instead of wearing it? Would you believe I represented the Americas in the pan-Federation games? Hundred meter sprint. Took the silver. I was still in the academy at the time.\" \"You really are a very surprising young woman. I was told you attained the rank of Lt. Commander faster than anyone else had ever done it.\" \"That probably won't stand long. The Fleet's growing. Rank's going to come a bit faster for some of the bright young looies. I'm glad to see it.\" \"You asked about my 'stubborn' comment. I knew another beautiful woman named Athena once. She didn't have the Fleet to give her a place to use her skills.\" \"You found her one, then left her behind. Miss her. Loved her. Still do.\" \"You are entirely too perceptive. And far too beautiful by candlelight. I don't think I should have had that last glass of wine.\" \"Dance with me.\" She was soft and warm in his arms. Before he quite realized what he was doing, he was kissing her. As he scooped her up in his arms and carried her deeper into her quarters, he decided the last glass of wine had definitely been a mistake. He was very glad he'd made it. Gallant returned to his own universe, but she haunted his memory and his dreams. He'd fallen in love. He knew it and that he'd never love another woman in quite the same way again. He longed to return to her, but the other 'dream' Athena had gently told him he must not. He decided on a fishing trip. He was not expecting company. The tall, slender, extremely fair boy with near white hair, who walked out of the woods on his right, appeared to be in his mid-teens. He liked his smile, but wasn't feeling particularly sociable or he'd have chosen somewhere else for his fishing trip. \"Hello.\" \"Hello. Who are you?\" \"I'm Apollo Avelaine. Lane. How's the fishing?\" \"Quite good. It usually is on uninhabited planets.\" \"Pretty good if you go far enough into the past on inhabited ones too.\" \"Are you going to tell me who you are and why you're here, or just keep dropping obscure hints?\" \"Look at me. I've given you my name. My mother is gray-eyed Athena. Not one of the human ones. My hair is lighter than yours, but I look too much like you for you not to know me. Feel who I am. I traveled here from another time in a ship named Alice. You brought me. I've come to help you find my brothers.\" Gallant stared at him in shock. Lane laughed. \"You said you felt pretty strange when I told you. Hello, Dad. I'm from your future, but you've got me now. Just be glad you didn't get the girls too. \"Girls?\" \"You spend almost thirty years raising a family. I'm sixteen and the only boy of the group. You're taking most of the girls to your home world. I'm officially the youngest of three boys and three girls. You and I are going to find my brothers.\" \"Six… children. I told you all this?\" \"No. I'm Athena's child. I'm the timewalker. All my life exists within my memory. I'm Apollo. I see the future.\" He knew the boy was his without doubt. He could feel it. He didn't doubt he saw the future either. It was too clear in his eyes. \"That's a terrible burden to carry. Why did I bring you to me?\" \"To get my brothers. And to meet our Godfather.\" \"Your Godfather?\" \"Telas. You're about to hook our supper. You clean. I'll cook.\" **** The place looked very different than when he'd left it, but he'd expected it would. He smiled when he saw her, stopped and waited for her to feel him. She almost dropped the bundle she was carrying in the street. \"Hello, Athena.\" \"GALLANT! You've come for him. I think I've always known you would. Oh! Who are you?\" \"Lane. I told him to come. He didn't know. You forgot to mention what you were planning.\" \"'Forgot' probably isn't the operable term. I figured he'd argue about it. In fact, I knew he'd argue about it. Come on, Gallant. You know the paths all know you're here. Mick will know by now too.\" \"Chervan has already informed me, in no uncertain terms, I'm staying for dinner.\" \"Being one of three humans on a world of telepaths has been a very interesting experience. One I wouldn't trade. Mick and Elaine have four kids. Seven full humans on this world now, but with a bit of telekinetic assistance, the human strain will blend in within two generations.\" \"I had assumed that was how you'd overcome the inter-species differences. It hurt me to learn my last night with you was... shared, Athena.\" \"Oh, Gallant! It wasn't! Don't think that! I... Chervan and I... Before I came to find you, then after you'd gone. We... I wanted... \" \"Athena, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Don't cry. I'm not angry, nor hurt any longer. Feel.\" He held her a moment and then stepped back from her. She would know why. Leaving her had been very hard the first time. Now he would have to do it again. \"What's his name?\" \"Pericles. We call him Clete. Biggest kid on the planet. Strong as an ox and almost as fast as you are. Gentle and deadly. Strawberry blond curls. Looks just... Lane's your son.\" \"From somewhere far in the future. In my future. He tells me his mother's name is also Athena.\" \"Dad, we're staying for five days. It's important.\" \"He also tells me he sees the future. Handy if you're wondering if you're going to catch dinner. Not a bad cook either.\" \"That was a hint. All right. I'll cook dinner one of the days you're here. One of the days.\" Gallant laughed. She hadn't changed. She was a terrific cook, but she disliked it. In the near eight years they'd trained, then fought side by side against Hensk and the bel-Nathans, she'd cooked no more than a dozen times. Always as a special treat for him. \"Gallant, you're taller. How long have you been gone?\" \"Am I? I hadn't noticed. Not long. Just a few years.\" \"That means you got hurt and spent major time healing yourself. What happened?\" \"I fell down a hill and most of it came along. I had pretty good help healing. Must have put more energy into it than I needed.\" \"No, it means you broke a whole bunch of bones and your body strengthened itself by getting bigger. And thicker.\" \"Athena, I'm comfortable this way. Although, I've a feeling I'm about to get in very good shape. It seems I'm about to take on the job of training my sons.\" \"Well, Lane looks like he's in good shape and I've been training Clete since he was two.\" \"TWO?!\" \"It was either that or let him hurt himself trying to copy the older kids. To be honest, I was afraid he'd hurt someone else. He's massive, Gallant. Nearly a hundred ninety centimeters and about a hundred ten kilos of muscle and still getting bigger.\" \"He'll top out at one ninety-five and one fifty K. It'll always be all muscle. He likes to work-out.\" \"Lane!\" \"Sorry, Dad, but Athena doesn't mind.\" \"He's right, Gallant. I'm kind of pleased to know.\" \"Let's see, that's about six-four-and-a-half and three hundred thirty pounds. Whew! That is big.\" \"He's like you, Dad. All of us are. We're heavier than humans. He'll look like about one-thirty K. Two hundred eighty pounds for you.\" \"That's still big.\" \"Yes, it'll drive Dutch crazy. So will his purring.\" \"PURRING?!\" \"In the future. Shouldn't have mentioned it. You're about to meet him.\" \"Lane, you're going to drive me crazy.\" \"Always did.\" \"Hi, Mom, I just heard. You must be Gallant. I've heard a lot... Mother?\" \"You never asked.\" \"You mean you didn't tell him either?! ATHENA, YOU'RE HOPELESS!\" \"Gee, Gallant. You haven't yelled at me in seventeen years. Feels great.\" He groaned, Athena grinned and Lane and Clete sat on the ground and laughed. Five days passed and he had to leave her again. **** The trip through the doorway and to Earth in the time of the Federation was rather short. Athena's world was very near it, as he thought of it. But when he got there, he ran into unexpected difficulty. He tried to remember the man across the desk wasn't just being difficult, but it wasn't easy. \"He's my son and I want him!\" \"He's a Federation ward, Mr. Gallant, and you will have to prove your status.\" \"Dad, get Telas. He's expecting it. You set it up years ago. Remember?\" \"Oh. All right, Lane. Anything has to be easier than this.\" Gallant stormed out of the office and down the steps. Clete was having a bit of difficulty not kicking something in response to what he was feeling. What he got from Lane was too mixed to define, but it was predominantly anticipation, so strong it was a hunger. It was almost as strong as his father's frustration. \"Why, after all these years, did they make him a ward of the state?! Lane, when did I set this up with Telas?\" \"I don't know. Just that you do.\" \"Why don't you know and why didn't you tell me sooner?\" \"There he is. Right on time.\" \"Telas! It's good to see you!\" \"Hi, Gallant. Hello, Clete, Lane. Let's see, you're here to pick up Roberrin. That means this is the first time my godsons have met me.\" \"You mean I'm your godson too?\" \"You are now, Clete, but not yet. That even confuses me. Let's see... Your dad asked me a long time ago, but he hasn't... The simple answer is: Yes, and now that he knows, he will. I have a file on the duties and, more relevant, the privileges of my duty station. I believe this is the time to invoke my hugging privilege. I've watched over your son, Gallant. I gave him his first hug. Lynn Marsh states she was not really hugging him when she handed him to me. We were there. The Pauling was Athena's ship and they loved him too. We're quite smug. Athena trusted us to build her son into the person he could be. It's time he knew his father and his brothers.\" \"Telas, I can't prove I'm a Fed citizen. I'm not. They refuse to take straight paternity without a long involved court proceeding. I'm... two steps from just grabbing him.\" \"That's what I'm here to help you do. You want him to disappear from this time period. There are others helping. Lynn Marsh is Fleet Chief Med Officer. She's just had all his medical records put in a coded file and sealed under Fleet Med Command. The captain of the Pauling just 'lost' all his records at Admiral Merris' request. The only one left to 'hit' is Social.\" \"There's a sweet little old lady who will help at the school. Dad will charm her socks off and she'll 'forget' to refile Dutch's records. She thinks it's dumb to put a kid with an obviously caring parent in an institution. Clete and I will get him. It'll take him all of ten seconds to figure out who we are. It'll take us about two hours to convince him he doesn't need to say good-by to about forty girls. Come on, Clete. He'll be on the field for track practice by the time we get there. Dad, remember to tell me about sweet little old Ms. Brown.\" \"Telas, they're going to drive me crazy.\" \"You're going to turn them into outstanding young men and it'll break your heart to part with them.\" \"That too. I can already see it coming and I haven't even met Roberrin. Three sons, Telas. Three beautiful women gave me sons. And I already ache to hold... Lane calls him Dutch. His eyes light when he says it. I would have gone anywhere and done nearly anything to see... Telas, Social? I want my son.\" \"Back to the office you just left. You get that man to get into Dutch's file. As soon as he does, I'll key in an erase command from the outer office. I've got the Fed's pri-one override command. As soon as he closes the file, it will cease to have ever existed.\" \"Pri-one? Override?\" \"You have friends in high places. So will the boys when they reach this time. Gallant, you put them in the academy sixteen years ago.\" \"Wait! Don't tell me any more. I don't want to know the future, but I do want to know what happened to Athena.\" \"She saved a world and lost her life. Highest commendation the Fed can give. One of six ever awarded. She stopped a war. No one knows how she did it. The defense shield she threw up around a defenseless world fused into a lump of metal. It lasted just long enough to deflect the incomings. When it blew, she died. She was the only one who didn't live through the attack. Nearly two billion people owe her their lives. Every city on that planet has an Athena Boulevard or Athena Duchelle park. Half the girls under ten are named Athena. She's one of the Federation's greatest heroes.\" \"Sounds like the girl I knew.\" \"Ooh, it hasn't been very long, has it?\" \"No. Not long enough to forget the fragrance she wore or the way she felt in my arms. A minute, Telas. I need a minute.\" \"Gallant, she loved you. You were the last man she invited 'in' for dinner.\" \"Telas, there are four Athenas.\" \"I'd say the explanation lies in your future and in those three boys.\" \"I'll wait for it. There are three girls too, but Lane says they're close to each other, but not to him or me. Family, but not really friends. I don't understand it, but I don't think he does either. It may be the only thing that confuses him. I may have to do something about that. I'm not sure it's healthy. Teenage boys are supposed to be a bit confused.\" \"The only thing that confuses Dutch is girls. He never forgets a comm number, but he gets the names that go with them mixed up.\" \"Lane says he doesn't understand why they think he should choose between them either. He loves him incredibly, like he's been waiting for this moment his whole life, living for it. Let's go. I want my son.\" He insisted the man check the files to make sure he wasn't named as father, all files. He wasn't, just unspecified non-human. He made a hasty exit. He'd made such a fuss the man was going to go through them again. Telas led him to the school and he almost collapsed in mirth. He set about charming Ms. Brown and charmed himself right into trouble. Lane was near giggles before they got to the field. Clete wasn't far behind. He had no idea what was so funny to Lane, but he'd never felt anyone as strongly as he did him and his near giggly mood felt wonderful. He could have found his brother on the field with his eyes closed. It didn't take him long to notice them. He watched him come across the field and made an estimate from the ease and speed at which he did it. He could see Lane's description of 'fast' was an understatement. Lane's intense surge of excitement when he ran up to them didn't at all agree with his casual posture, but he didn't say anything, just stood and smiled. \"Hi, Dutch.\" \"Who are you?\" \"You've already figured out the answer. Come on, we're breaking you out of this place. Dad's finishing off your computer tracks now. He's Lane. I'm Clete. Apollo Avelaine and Pericles Buchannon. Our dad's Gallant. So's yours. Let's go.\" \"I need to say good-by to some people. I can't leave without telling them.\" \"Dutch, the important ones are helping. We haven't time for farewells to every girl in a ten kilometer radius.\" \"Just Rosalind and Jackie. Oh, and Carol and Diane. How did you know I wanted to say good-by to girls?\" \"He remembers the future. Pretty strange, but I'm starting to get used to it. Dutch, relax. You're starting to make me tense.\" \"He's wondering why Dad didn't come for him before, Clete. It's worrying him.\" \"Exactly. Well, why didn't he?\" \"Because, until I told him eighteen days ago, he didn't know either one of you existed. He didn't know I did until I walked up and introduced myself. NO! You can't tell her good-by.\" \"But she's right across... You really do know what's going to happen. Wow! That must be great.\" \"Dutch, you're not dense. Think about it a minute. Lane will never have a surprise, not even a happy one. Yeah, better. You're still doing dips emotionally, but your brain's getting back in gear. Oh, I'm an empath.\" \"A big one.\" \"Yes, and he'll get bigger, but so will we. Primarily because he makes us work at it. Yes, we're all the same age. You need to know Dad, so you understand who you are, Dutch.\" \"We're all the same age? Dumb question. You just said that.\" \"Not dumb. I wouldn't have known what you were going to ask if you didn't ask it. That's how it works. Dad's going to tell us how 'little old Ms. Brown' helped clear your files later.\" \"Little!? Old!? Corinne Brown may be the most beautiful redhead who ever walked a planet!\" \"Yeah. Make sure you don't let on you knew it. I worked very hard setting him up for it.\" \"Ooh. Does he do this often, Clete?\" \"I haven't been around him long enough to know, but from the way he's enjoying it, I'd say as often as he thinks he can get away with it.\" \"Ms. Brown. Our dad must really be something.\" Gallant got back to Alice quite late. He very carefully told Lane about 'sweet little old Ms. Brown' helping get rid of Dutch's files. He could have cheerfully strangled Telas when he added, \"Yes, your dad charmed her socks off.\" He began to realize he'd been had when the three boys collapsed in giggles in a corridor just beyond the main control room. **** \"DAD! Lane's having a nightmare and it's bad! Real bad.\" \"Where, Clete? I don't even know which room he chose.\" \"Come on. Hurry. That one.\" He pulled him out of sleep and into his arms. It was the first time he'd truly held one of his children. The rightness of it washed over him. \"Easy, Lane, easy. Tell me.\" \"I can't. It'll come and it'll pass, but I can't talk about it now.\" \"Not a nightmare, a future event.\" \"That's what all my nightmares are.\" \"Do you have them often?\" \"Too often. The closer the event, the worse they get. I know one day they'll stop. Well, they won't happen very often. Sorry, Clete, bad enough I have them. You waking up in a cold sweat and terror that isn't even your own isn't fair. But I can't do anything about it.\" \"Yes you can. Break the cycle. Do something to change it.\" \"Dad, I can't.\" \"You can and someday you will.\" \"If he doesn't, I will.\" \"Hello, Dutch. Woke you too.\" \"Something did. Something like cold breath on the back of my neck.\" \"WHEN?!\" \"Just now. Dad, what is it?\" \"We're leaving. This minute. TELAS! Clete, find him and see where he wants to go. We're out of here. NOW!\" He knew what the cold breath meant. Something about his sons was enough force for change the powers were involved. He fought the Dark One as the personification of anti-life in his own universe, but he was not the power of the destructive force. Like a ship cutting through water, his sons were increasing the possibilities for life to exist in some way and the bow wave of circumstance was exerting more pressure. There was no Dark One in Dutch's universe. The cold breath said, \"Chance is aligning against you. The 'dark power' has taken a hand.\" **** \"You have to give us Alice for a few days.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"There's something we have to do.\" \"Lane, I'm not giving you my ship without more explanation than that.\" \"We have to find the third Athena.\" \"Where is she?!\" \"Easy, Dad. She's my mother. We'll take her to you, but it's a long way in your future.\" \"I want to go with you.\" \"Sorry, it has to be just us. You have something else to do.\" \"Which is?\" \"Save a world.\" How had he let Lane talk him into this? He didn't like cold damp places. Especially cold damp places with bars and chains. He sighed and wondered how he was supposed to save this world. He'd gone straight from a stroll in the forest to a dungeon in chains. Not a great deal of world-saving opportunity in a journey of less than ten minutes with thirty guards. Oh, my. Dark-haired and beautiful! \"Visitors. How nice. Excuse me, but I'd like to discuss these chains.\" \"Be quiet! Where was he found?\" \"He walked out of the sacred grove.\" \"Then why is he alive?\" \"Because, Lady, he didn't walk into it.\" \"Get him down! Now! Attire him appropriately and bring him to me.\" Well, step one. He was being unchained. He wasn't extremely pleased with all the touching that seemed to be involved in the process, but the women were removing the... chains. He found it very difficult to concentrate on the architecture of the interesting building. The occupants were very distracting and all seemed to be female. He didn't have any difficulty paying attention when he was guided before the woman who had ordered him freed. \"Yes, I can see it now.\" \"Would someone please tell me what you're all muttering about?\" \"You have been prophesied. You will save us.\" \"Well, that's what I was told I was supposed to be doing. Close that window, please. I'm cold. Your idea of appropriate attire and mine seem to be quite different. Oh! Now, wait a minute!\" He didn't quite know what to do. He couldn't bring himself to hit any of them. They were so much smaller than he was. It would have been like hitting half-grown girls. Some of them were half-grown girls. Just before he stopped thinking about anything, she appeared in his mind, laughed and said, \"Save them, Gallant. Only you can. They will save their world.\" **** Lane grinned when his father walked through the door. The scenery he saw through it when it opened was lovely. He wouldn't tell him all of where they'd been or what they'd done. None of them ever would. Neither would Alice. She understood he wouldn't really want to know. \"Hello, Dad. I see you saved them.\" \"They say I did, Lane, but I don't really know.\" \"Dad, if you hadn't, that grove would not be standing.\" \"Rather an unusual way to... save a sacred grove. Where are Clete and Dutch?\" \"We're on our way to get them. Clete's preventing a murder.\" \"Whose murder?\" \"Auri, Aurora, got herself into a mess. He's going to be in rough shape when we get him.\" \"Injured?\" \"Not yet.\" \"You've lost me.\" \"It's his culture. He's going to fall apart on us. Dutch will do his best, but he won't be able to stop him.\" Gallant stared after the boy who had laughed wildly, then run into the corridors of the part of Alice he called the maze. The wild laugh had been startling, but hadn't bothered him near as much as the deep sobs that he'd heard as Lane had disappeared into the vast labyrinth of the ship. She was landing. Dutch ran in, pulling Clete behind him. \"Help me with him. It was the only way to save her, but he's almost catatonic. She told him you'd come for her before they made up their minds what to do about it.\" \"Do about what?!\" \"The sacrifice. He kept her from being sacrificed.\" \"How?\" \"How do you keep a woman from playing the role of virgin sacrifice?\" \"Oh, I see. But why is he in such bad shape?\" \"Just before we left, she told him who she is.\" \"Terrific. Now, if you'll tell me who she is, we'll all know.\" \"Lane's sister. Our sister.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"It gets worse. She told him she'd name their son Connell.\" \"Oh, brother. His culture has very strict taboos about these things, with good reason. Now I know why Lane ran. I need to find him.\" \"Dad, he said good-by to us. He said you'd send him away. It's not his fault. CLETE! Damn! I'll go after him.\" Gallant finished putting in the coordinates for the most peaceful place he knew. He had a mess on his hands and Lane had as much as said it would get worse. He needed to know what that 'worse' was. He'd barely begun to look for him when he heard Clete, then Dutch, scream in his mind. He'd wondered if they could at need. He ran for them. He suddenly realized Lane was right behind him. Dutch was near incoherent. \"I couldn't stop him!\" \"Give me that!\" He grabbed the medunit from Lane and went to work on the son who had tried to kill himself. It was going to be close. He spared just enough attention to notice Lane holding Dutch and calming him. So, he knew he'd be sent away, did he? The nightmares! He now knew what they were about. Within a few minutes, he was sure his son would live. When he finished repairing the damage he'd done to himself with a knife, he stepped back, took a deep breath and realized Lane was no longer in the room. \"Dutch, where's Lane?\" \"He said he had to get ready. Dad, he told me to tell Clete he'd miss him. And Auri had always known. Change things. Please, Dad.\" \"Dutch, he set Clete up for this. He knew this would happen.\" Dutch grabbed his arm and as he turned for the door. He was so angry he almost threw him aside. It shocked him enough to stop him. \"Dad, think! It's not like that. He's carried it inside his whole life. He doesn't think anything can change. Auri didn't either. Dad, he thinks he'll spend fifty years in Earth's past. Alone, Dad, until Clete and I find him. I'm not supposed to tell you.\" \"Yes, that's where I'd take him. About mid-twentieth century. I always liked it there. You can let go, Dutch. My mind is working. I'm going to move Clete to the surgery. I'm going to put restraints on him. I want you to stay with him.\" It didn't take him long to find Lane. He was lying on the floor of the command center, curled around a pack. \"Were you planning on going somewhere?\" \"Please, just do it. I've already reset the coordinates.\" \"Hmm. Earth. Nineteen forty-two. Oh! You're planning on helping build the Alaska highway. Too bad. They'll just have to manage without you.\" \"What?\" Gallant sat down on the floor next to his son. He looked terribly confused. It was an improvement. \"You're not leaving. It would probably be easier than facing Clete, but I think it's necessary you do so.\" \"You can't... change the future.\" \"I already have. Several times. Done a bit of past changing too. Come here, Son.\" Gallant pulled Lane into his arms and held him as he cried. He was very thankful Dutch had stopped him and 'thumped' him for being so angry. He was also thankful Telas had told him just enough to assure he paid attention to the thump. He didn't pursue the thought there had to be a reason he'd allowed Clete to be injured. Why hadn't he done something to change it before? Hadn't he known? Why had Clete been so overwhelmed by the culture of his world that he'd tried to kill himself? His mother was human and flat practical about such things. There had to be something adding to the horror. Something his strongly empathic son had felt from someone else? From Lane? His sister? Or him? Who had added just enough shock to make him grasp the knife? He was only sure it hadn't been Dutch. \"Dad... I'm... It's all changing. Dizzy.\" \"Easy, Lane, open your mind to me. I'll help you ride it out.\" He entered his son's mind and saw the wild spirit beneath the tightly controlled and slightly cool surface. He withdrew when the images began to settle. He didn't want to know the future. \"Thank you.\" \"Lane, you're very much my son. You're also as much a victim of this as Clete is. Now, we'd better get to him. Alice isn't going to put us down anywhere until we're ready, then she'll take us to a favorite spot of mine.\" \"Disneyland. Nineteen fifty-nine. Is that why Alice looks like a little silver travel trailer most of the time?\" \"I don't know. It's her choice. I do rather like it though. Rolled awning, wheels and all. I spent nearly a hundred years on Earth once. Towed her behind a car and explored North America.\" \"Motorcycles!\" \"Yes, those too. I have several of different types. Racing and doing stunt shows was a good excuse to travel and paid enough I didn't constantly have to worry about running out of money.\" \"Easier than the rock shoveling I thought I'd be doing. I couldn't even have gone to school. The first time someone got a stethoscope on me... \" \"Yes. You'd have spent all your time hiding what you are. You don't have my power. I just hypnotized doctors into forgetting I had two hearts.\" \"You fought in their wars.\" \"Several of them. Seemed like every time I changed identities, I got drafted. Very long ago, but I still remember. Especially Korea and Vietnam. Not good memories.\" \"Why did you do it?\" \"I could save lives. Some that lived through those wars wouldn't have if I hadn't been their sergeant. But I took lives too. Too many.\" \"You once told me you were a hippie.\" \"I went back and joined protests against racism and Vietnam. I didn't like the drug scene, but I liked the ideals of love and peace. Liked the music too.\" \"A red Gibson Les Paul and a clear Dan Armstrong bass. I've seen them.\" \"That bass put blisters on my fingers, but it has the most incredible tone. Lane, when do I find her?\" \"Dad, Mom's not the girl of your dreams, but she'll make you incredibly happy. She dies, but it's not really death. She has to go back to where we found her.\" \"But you said… I don't understand.\" \"I can't explain it. She's... something else, but she came to you as a woman, a human woman.\" \"The girl of my dreams. She's going to haunt me for another ten thousand years, isn't she?\" \"No, Dad, forever. But always with the promise of someday. She comes again right after Mom leaves.\" \"Admitting that's reassuring feels distinctly odd. Clete's going to wake up soon.\" \"Dad, open yourself to Clete and Dutch. They need to know you. Just as I did.\" \"I want to know them too.\" Gallant took them to Disneyland, then to other places he loved. He began to get into very good condition as he helped Clete get back into it. Then he took them fishing and relaxed just a bit too much. \"NO!\" \"Ah, the slave. You see slave, I have found your children. I've spent nearly one hundred years hunting you. Since you have children, I know it's been longer for you. You should have stayed away. I wouldn't have pursued you. You meant nothing. I had those telepaths at my feet. They were mine! Then you came. Three boys. They'll ease the irritation I felt the times I thought I'd killed you, then discovered you were still alive.\" \"Please, Hensk, Lord Master, spare them. I beg you. I will give my pledge to serve you and never seek escape.\" \"Don't be foolish. I already have you. We will return to the world I left a hundred years ago. They will hold you. The Dark One shall reign. Nothing will stop it. Rorisk will love your pretty boys. I think I'll loan you all to him.\" \"No, I won't allow you to do that.\" \"Did you know I had you altered? I won't have to wait long for these. They're probably capable of siring children now. I'll have them stimmed and try them with females of other species until I find one cross-fertile. You obviously did. It should be a very interesting process. Now, what is the best way to do this? Ah, I have it. You three put these chains on, or I will kill your father.\" Turning the weapon on Gallant was a mistake. He charged it. He expected to die, but Hensk would never get another shot off. His sons would kill him. He wondered how he'd found them. He felt the shot. Clete held on against the storm of emotion. He had to get through to the brother who was the source of it. \"Kill him! Do it now. Do it, Lane. Think about who he is. What he is. What he did to Dad. Kill him.\" \"Clete, I--\" \"DO IT!\" \"Yes. For my father.\" \"All right. Now, you check Dutch. I'll... Oh, damn. Lane, try to get over the changes. Past them. Whatever. I need you. They're both alive, but that's all I know.\" \"Go. They're not settling. It's uncertain. Dad. Help Dad. I'll... check Dutch. Medunit. Get unit. Call Alice. She'll--\" \"ALICE! Alice, help me!\" Clete said thank you many times in the not quite hour that seemed like many. Most of the thanks were to his mother. He knew when Lane began to regain consciousness and was beside him with a nourishing broth she'd taught him to make when he opened his eyes. \"Fishing trip. Vacation. Some vacation. Drink.\" \"Clete?\" \"Check your memories, Lane. They're both going to make it. Good thing I ran out of things to read and got into Mom's medical texts.\" \"Dad's in trance.\" \"Yeah. I used the medunit on him to help him along. Dutch knocked the blaster down just enough. Missed his head. Ah, Dutch is coming around. I'm in love with Alice. Aren't I, Sweetheart? She came. Just... materialized around us. Left Hensk outside. Still there I guess. Drink the rest. It's a good vitamin and mineral mix with more calories than you'd think. Got to get to Dutch. He'll wake up screaming for Dad.\" \"Let him know he saved him. Fastest move I've ever seen anyone make. Other than Dad.\" \"Yeah. Other than Dad. Later.\" Clete walked into Dutch's room and took his hand. He forced himself to calm. Dutch wasn't even fully conscious yet and he was already desperately worried. \"Dad's alive! He'll make it! Take it easy. You saved him. He's hurt, but he'll live.\" \"I couldn't let him die, Clete. I... love him so much.\" \"That is obvious. Dutch, you moved faster than humanly possible. Much faster.\" \"I've always been fast. They say Mom was.\" \"No, Dutch. We've been training together for weeks. You never moved at anything like that speed. You may be as fast as Dad. How's your head?\" \"Brother empath, you know. Thumping. Tell me the story.\" \"You hit the barrel and he creamed you with the stock.\" \"Hensk?\" \"Lane took the weapon and killed him. Wasn't easy. He finally went all cool and did it. Said, \"For my father.\" Went clear out afterward. Pretty heavy change, I guess. Surprised he held up as long as he did. He went dizzy as soon as that creep came out of the trees.\" \"Weird, Clete. Didn't that guy know it wouldn't work? If Dad hadn't escaped, he wouldn't have us. If he didn't have us, Hensk couldn't take us.\" \"I don't think he cared. Dutch, all he wanted was to have Dad beg for us. He planned on killing him anyway. Just wanted him to grovel at his feet.\" \"And he did.\" \"For us. Offered himself up in bondage in exchange, then tried to give his life. Yeah. Tried. He charged straight in. I felt him intend to die. He was too scared for us to think. If he died, Lane wouldn't exist. I'd still be at home. You'd still be in a Fed school.\" \"Would we? Or do we sort of exist in our own timestream? We took Lane's mother to Dad. What if... What if I couldn't... get her? Would he have just disappeared from between us?\" \"No answers, Dutch. Maybe it was always supposed to happen this way. As for his mother, she was trying desperately to break through. Never felt anyone... thing, whatever, want someone like she wanted Dad.\" \"Even I could feel it. Well, now what?\" \"We wait for Dad to wake up surprised to wake up.\" \"Yeah, the nicest kind of surprise. How… \" \"Pretty bad. He'll be under awhile.\" Gallant was as surprised as Clete expected. He made sure they were all leaning over him, right where he'd see them as soon as he opened his eyes, but he almost landed on him when the rush of relief hit him. \"You're all here.\" \"Yes. And so are you. Hensk isn't. The last one is gone, Dad. Lane 'remembered' you telling him the code and blew the ship. Dutch yelped and we lit out. Said he felt something.\" \"Where are we, Clete?\" \"Ask Lane. He set the coordinates.\" \"Ophidus sector. Nice and quiet.\" \"My home world is near here.\" \"That's why it's quiet. Safest place I could think of.\" \"OK. Enough. Sleep. You're exhausted.\" \"Not yet, Clete. How?\" \"Seems Dutch inherited more than your good looks. He moves fast.\" \"Who killed Hensk?\" \"I did.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"I'm not, but I didn't enjoy it.\" \"Good. I'm afraid I would have.\" \"Damn it, Dad. Sleep!\" \"Yes, Clete, and well. But hugs first. Dutch?\" \"Wow, first even. Sleep, Dad. We love you.\" He did. Soundly. For six days. Strangely, it was almost two full days longer than he'd tranced. He deserved it. He'd spent his life pursuing the servants of the Dark One he'd allowed into the universe. He'd still run into them now and again, but he could reverse any damage they did and run. He knew they would all be destroyed. Now he was truly free to begin fighting the Dark One himself. **** Dutch didn't know how he knew what the sudden shock had been, but he did. He ran out of his room yelling. \"Lane! Something's happened to Dad! Damn! Clete! Lane's out cold! Bring him! We've got to find Dad!\" They found him deep in Alice beside a small pool of clear water. Dutch wasn't sure how he'd found him either. He'd just run in the direction that 'felt' right, but he'd been to the pool before. \"He came to the pool, Dutch. I could swear... Dutch, I looked for this the other day. I swear it wasn't--\" \"There are a lot of odd things in this ship, Clete. Lane's told me about a few of them. He even told me where some of them were. I didn't find a meadow he talked about either. He's out cold too. Doesn't seem to be... Clete, he has a sword in his hand. He's holding it tight, but it's too cold for me to touch. Both shoulders of his shirt just crumbled when I moved him.\" \"Like they were dipped in liquid nitro. Dutch, he's ice cold.\" \"His hearts are beating steady.\" \"He's coming around.\" \"Dad! Dad, wake up! What happened?\" \"Hello. Did you hear them?\" \"Hear?\" \"The voices, Dutch. The music. I followed it here, then... NO! I don't want to be... Too late. I already gave my oath. Made the choice. Did it ten thousand years ago. Never expected to have it made official. I hate being drafted!\" \"You may hate being drafted, but you're extremely proud and rather overawed at the moment.\" \"Too accurate, Clete. My shoulders hurt. How's Lane?\" \"Coming around. Could you please give us an explanation?\" \"Someone, who called himself my father-in-law, just knighted me. Informed me I was Knight Hero and had been chosen to protect this universe. Said I'd been doing it long enough to prove I was capable of it. Hello, Lane, I think I just met your grandfather.\" He kept them with him for more than a year. Taught them and trained them to fight at his side. Laughed with them and shouted at them. And learned to love them too well. Not long after he nearly lost Dutch to a horror even he couldn't have survived, he took them to Dutch's universe, where it didn't exist, and left them on the Curie. Captain Merris was rather surprised, but promised to get them into the academy. He hunted Telas. He had a gift he wanted him to give them. He returned to his own universe aching with the pain of farewell.",

Professor, I don't think it's... I think they're alien.\" \"Oh, my. Let me see that corder. Hmm. You may be right. Exhume them carefully, then we'll take them for a full scan at the university.\" \"I'd really rather you didn't.\" \"Who are you?\" \"My name is Gallant.\" \"Uh, Alan, leave it.\" \"Professor, you've got to be kidding!\" \"No, I'm not. Please don't ask questions. Go back to camp and send Mick to me. Don't talk about it, Alan.\" Gallant smiled at the confused young man. \"Alan, come here. I'll explain. Those bones are why I'm here. They have no business being on Earth. In a moment, they won't be. You're on your way back to camp to send Mick to the professor. It's been a long day. You've enjoyed it, but didn't find anything unusual.\" \"You hypnotized him.\" \"Yes, I did. How did you know who I was? You recognized my name instantly.\" \"Pepperoni pizza has been a March Eighth tradition in my family for five generations.\" \"Ah, I see. And who is Mick?\" \"My son, Miklos. I've got a thing for ancient Greece. I think it began with my name.\" \"Your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Professor Athena Buchannon. Oh, dear! What did I do?!\" She sat down next to the big, beautiful, blond, family legend and watched him. He looked pretty stunned. She wondered why she wasn't. Maybe because it was March Eighth. Or would have been by the old calendar. Suddenly an intense wave of mingled emotions washed over her. Foremost was a kind of ironic joy. \"Whoa! Warn me if you're going to let loose with a blast like that, please.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I'm a very strong empath. You just about flattened me. All right, what's with the bones?\" \"I'm not sure. Athena, are you a... I'm not sure how to ask this. Are you gene selected?\" \"Great-great-grandmother Alice's project. Yes, though it ended a while back. I didn't pick my husband from stus at the U in Alaska. They were still a bit disappointed. I'm the cream of the crop they tell me. I'm fifty-two. Got three PhD's, an MD and I'm continental martial arts champion. In the Olympics twice in biathlon. Medaled both times. My son Mick's on his way. Curious. Real curious.\" \"Hi, Mom. Uh, huh. Well, from the way you're brimming, I'd say Gallant showed up for pepperoni pizza. Hi, Gallant. I'm Mick.\" \"I take it you're an empath too.\" \"Not really. Just with Mom. Dad before he died. High psi, but no breakthrough. Just poten. What's that?\" Gallant turned the small unit over in his hands. He'd built it because Athena had told him it would be needed. \"It will give me the genetic code of the bones, their age, then destroy them. One of the dark brothers seems to have decided to meddle in Earth's distant past. The bones indicate I might have a chance at stopping him.\" \"You mean they indicate you will stop him.\" \"No, Mick, I don't. Chance exists. The course of life in the universe can be changed. Earth could become a barren ball and have always been that way. Or be totally changed. The bones merely mean I can succeed. Keyed. Stand back a bit. You too, Athena. I've never used this before and I'd rather not learn it's too wide a band by having you two disappear.\" \"Oh, terrific. Come on, Mom. Let's get uphill.\" Gallant smiled. He really liked the pair of them. He wondered where the bright coppery hair had come from. Julie's family had all had hair in varying shades of soft brown. He waited until they were some distance away, keyed the unit, then ran to join them. They watched as the ground sank very slightly in the area. \"Good. Now, let's see how I did.\" \"Gallant, I've found more bones. Hmm... NO! This gets changed! Mick, pack us. We're going with him. Do it! Send resigs to the foundation. Get a super out here for the kids.\" \"Mom, Elaine?\" \"Up to you, Mick.\" \"Athena, you aren't coming with me! I never take anyone with me!\" \"You do this time, Gallant. I'm going to do my bit to change the universe. This is probably why I was born. The other bones are yours. I'm going to see to it they're not here.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, oh.\" \"It's still too dangerous. Athena, I won't trade your lives for mine. It's been incredibly long and full. I'm sorry, I won't take you. I'll be careful.\" \"No. You'll take us or I'll hunt for your ship. It's got to be around here someplace. I'll look for it until I find it, then I'll follow. Probably take me a hundred years to figure it out, but I will. If I don't, my son, or my grandkids, or my great-grandkids, or however many it takes, will. You are not going to die in Earth's past.\" \"One of those selected genes was for stubborn!\" \"Yeah, that too. I like it when you yell at me. It's loud, but it's all exasperated 'I care' underneath.\" \"You're really determined to go with me.\" \"Yes, Gallant. There's more to it. I'm bored. I have skills that I can't use for anything but play-acting. I'm a trained researcher in a half-dozen fields that are dying out or have too many in them already. The world is a delightfully peaceful and prosperous place and it's driving me crazy.\" \"And Mick?\" \"Inseparable. Too closely linked. Elaine's his love. I can't imagine her allowing herself to be left behind. You'll like her. Gallant, she's family already and she doesn't really have other. She said she'd recognize her mother, because she's seen her on vid. We don't even need to come back. The three of us can say farewell and no one will hunt us. She's making pepperoni pizza. She loved the idea. Right in the middle of modern Greece, she's making an old Italian dish American style. Come on. She's a great cook. Almost as good as Mick. Have to say you look like you appreciate good cooking.\" \"I'm comfortable this way.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm putting us all on a training program. We're all going to be in top form when we... Gallant, you just decided to take us along, didn't you?\" \"Yes. Your empathic powers are strong.\" \"It's not that. Look at the dig, Gallant. Look close.\" \"They're gone!\" \"Yeah, both sets. There's no settled earth. We've got a chance! Come on! Let's eat!\" **** \"Damn, you're just about too gorgeous to exist. Now I see why Great-great-great-grandmother Julie called you an angel. You look like you walked out of a Renaissance painting. Gallant, we're going to tower over these people. You know, no one ever mentioned how tall you are.\" \"I wasn't. I grow a bit once in a while.\" \"Explain that. You got a real weird feeling. Come on, Gallant. You know I'm too curious to drop it.\" \"I discovered it a few thousand years ago. Now, you see, I haven't even begun explaining and you're already shocked.\" \"No, but a 'few thousand' did knock me a bit.\" \"You're sure? Well, I'd never really been hurt badly. I'd learned my body could heal itself. I drop into a trance state, light enough I can find water and food if I must, during it. It's not restful. I sleep an approximately equal time afterward. This particular occasion, I tranced nine days. Yes, a lot. It was the first time I'd run into Hensk. I had him. Or thought I did. I chased him into a building on Apboretha. His ship was on the ground floor. It was a trap. He took off and dropped the building on me. I'd never had a broken bone. I made up for it. Multiple fractures. Arms, legs, ribs. I'd nearly gotten out. Somehow, the building missed my head. An old female dug me out and stayed by me. She gave me water and cared for me. I think she set the bones. My body grew. It strengthened itself by becoming taller and thicker. I'm incredibly dense. I weigh half again as much as a human my size. After that I came back to Earth. I needed to learn a lot more about just staying alive in an environment that... Anyway, that's why I'm about six-four and massive.\" \"Six-four? Gallant, we haven't used those terms for... a couple of cens. Well, a cen-and-a-half.\" \"Athena, I spent more than a century on Earth. The twentieth. I kept getting drafted. I hate being drafted.\" \"You went to war?\" \"Four of them. Two world wars, Korea and Vietnam. Grew a bit in all but the first. I was a very good sergeant. I only lost one man. Smitty. Right after we hit Omaha beach. I went back to the sixties later and marched for civil rights, then was a war protester.\" \"You were a hippie!\" \"That too.\" The last of the dark brothers had chosen to destroy the world and people he loved. He'd chosen the birthplace of western culture, Athens. Athena, Mick and Elaine had crammed to learn ancient Greek. They had Gallant to help with accent. Athena had been right. He liked Elaine. She was very proficient in the martial arts, but no one he'd ever seen was as good as Athena. Except himself. Mick was almost as good as his mother. \"Who's he after, Gallant?\" \"At a guess, Plato.\" \"Not Socrates?\" \"No, Athena, I don't think so. Plato would still have written his dialogues. They're the true treasure. Athena, you know the culture. You and Elaine are going to stand out even more than I do.\" \"I've given thought to that. Gallant, I'm gray-eyed Athena. You are Apollo. Mick and Elaine are minor divinities.\" \"Athena, that could seriously change the mythology of the period. We can't risk that. This time is pivotal in the development of your own civilization.\" \"It's just an expedient. You can use hypnosis to clear it. I got the idea when we landed atop Acropolis. There's another reason I chose this way. As gods, we won't be... pursued.\" \"Athena, I learned to handle male advances thousands of years ago. Your three times great-grandmother and a nice fellow named Chuck taught me.\" \"Hey, not just you. You may be super-gorgeous now that I've got you in shape, but Elaine, Mick and I are not mashed potatoes.\" \"No, you are champagne and caviar. All of you, but you most of all. Although, I'm not sure how I feel about your haircut.\" \"Short is practical. Cut it to a cen before every comp I was ever in. Call it battle dress. I'll be wearing a helm. At first anyway. Come on, Gallant. I can feel you've decided to go with my plan. Let's roll. Mick and Elaine are ready. Kiss for luck?\" It shocked them both. The sudden blending of their minds and the heat between them. He'd found the first Athena and she knew it too. \"Gallant, I don't quite know what to say. Nothing... Nothing like that ever... Not even with my husband.\" \"Athena, I've searched ten thousand years for you. Lead me, My Lady.\" \"Oh, Gallant, that's why I made you Apollo. We lead together. Let's go find Plato. Before I start trying to talk you into putting Alice on hover for a couple cens. Uh, hi, Mick, Elaine.\" \"Hi yourself, Mom. Very high. Grats, Gallant. You found your girl. And she's a beaut.\" \"That she is, Mick. Now, I have suddenly developed an acute desire to come out of this alive. Shall we see if we can accomplish it?\" **** \"Evil has come among you. Lo, Socrates, your students are endangered. I, Athena, seek Plato. Apollo has seen his destiny. One seeks to alter it.\" \"Oh, beautiful Goddess, he absents himself this day. His loves are not among these either. I had believed they sported on the slopes of Lykavittos. Now, I fear for them.\" \"Fear not. He is mine and in my keeping. Apollo, it pleases me to walk through my city. Will you speak to these? I would not change your vision with my presence.\" \"Yes, Athena, I shall touch each that the tale not be told. Come, Socrates, your words ring through the ages. Plato records them well. I would not have them changed. They guide the young of the future.\" \"Then I ask you take this vision.\" \"Socrates, I give you this day to remember us. On the morrow, you will awake, remembering all but our presence here and your trepidation over the fate of Plato. I bid you continue your discourse and pass this day as others. Speak not of us to those I have not touched.\" He gave each of them the same command, then ran after Athena. The speed of his run would convince Socrates and the young men they were, indeed, who they claimed to be. Athena was an excellent tactician. He struggled to calm himself. If he could keep his mind on the job at hand, he would have what he so desperately wanted. He could smell the evil. The dark brother was nearby. \"GALLANT!\" She saved his life. The dark brother had sprung from ambush and nearly shot him down. He suddenly knew the future she had changed. He would have been injured to dying, but would have killed the brother before death. It had been a trap. Plato wasn't the target. He was. \"NO! ATHENA!\" The sudden tears almost blinded him. The dark brother had shot her down. Mick and Elaine were headed toward the hooded figure at a run. He screamed in rage as he saw him shoot first Mick, then Elaine. He pulled the unit he'd built out and turned it on. It was still keyed to the dark brother's genetic code. He smiled as he listened to his death screams. It shocked him a bit. He had killed, but he had never enjoyed it before. He ran to Athena. She was alive! So were Mick and Elaine, but all were badly injured. Mick and Elaine he could save. Athena... No! She would not die! He needed Alice. Desperately. She wouldn't live through the journey to the ship. He laughed wildly as Alice materialized around them. Somehow, she had heard his need. And answered. He changed a decimal on the coordinates and threw her into flight. He had no idea where they were going, but the decimal point would insure a long flight. He did something he'd never done before. He placed Athena in nontime. She was the first living thing he'd ever risked suspending. He turned to Mick and Elaine, pulled out the medunit, and went to work on them. **** \"I can't find them, Elaine. I know they're here. I can feel it, but I can't find them.\" \"Mick, the note he left said he was going to try to heal her. You can feel she's still alive.\" \"Yeah, and still unconscious. This ship is huge. I only found my way back because I could feel you.\" \"What?\" \"Surprised me too. The link just grew with the love. Elaine, they're thirsty. At least she is. Terribly thirsty.\" \"Mick, this may sound weird, but ask the ship to help you find them. Told you it was weird.\" \"No, you're right. Come with me, Elaine. Pack food. I'm not kidding. We could end up dozens of Ks from here.\" \"All right. Give me five. Find a pack.\" They packed food. Mick said no to water. Gallant wouldn't have taken his mother anywhere they couldn't find it. He took Elaine's hand, then a deep breath. \"Alice, they need us. Please, help us find them.\" They set out hand in hand. Elaine squeezed his and smiled. All the corridors, but one, were dark. **** \"Mick, is she... out again?\" \"Just sleeping, Elaine. Gallant. Gallant, drink a bit of broth, then sleep. I know how it works. Mom told me.\" Mick sat back and smiled. They were both tired, but his mother's injuries were healed. \"Elaine, I'm going to trek back and check to see if Alice has anything she wants to tell us. I'll bring more food too. Stay with them?\" \"Naturally. Mick, this is a... bower. A beautiful clear pool, flowering trees, soft deep grass, roses on trellises... A bower in the middle of the ship.\" \"Not half the middle. You should see some of the... rooms. There's a meadow and a forest of strange trees. There's something that can only be a racecourse of some kind. There's a room full of nothing but labels hanging in the air, all with names of musical instruments. Bedrooms in a hundred different styles... Thousands of rooms. Told you I got lost. I keep looking for a kitchen closer to us, but haven't found one. Well, it's only a little more than a K. Not bad. Be back. Love.\" \"Love. Mick! How long?\" \"Sleep? Same as trance. Five days. Want a book or three?\" \"Yes. No, bring my pack. Might as well work on my thesis. I might get to deliver it.\" \"Bother you?\" \"No. Truth is, I'm as excited as I've been about anything in my life. You?\" \"About. Right up there with you saying yes when I asked you out the first time. Elaine, marry me.\" \"Gee, I thought I was going to have to ask you.\" **** \"Hensk. I can feel him. He's teamed up with the bel-Nathans. Nasty combo. Those people don't stand a chance. Wonder why he's so interested... Telepaths! A whole race of telepaths! I've got to help them. I'll get you somewhere safe, Athena.\" \"Gallant, you're not going into battle without me to watch your back.\" \"Athena, I don't want you in danger!! I want you safe!!\" \"Yell at me some more. I love it. Hey, I love you. Don't expect to keep you, but intend to have more than so far. Much more. Hensk is the last one, Gallant. And he scares you. Bad. He's got you... programmed. How many times have you met up with him?\" \"Seven.\" \"And?\" \"He got away.\" \"And you got hurt.\" \"That too.\" It happened the same way again, but it took nearly seven years. Seven years of running, fighting, running... The telepaths helped. So did the augmented horses Athena and Gallant gave them for transport. They all fell in love with the people, especially their leader Chervan. Communication wasn't difficult. The telepaths, some of them, learned to vocalize, in English. Gallant taught 'finger speech' to the others. He was uncomfortable communicating telepathically. The concussion he sustained, when Hensk blew out a mountainside trying to kill him, kept Gallant from going into trance. Athena never left his side the twelve weeks it took him to heal. She'd never let go of his hand the two weeks he lay unconscious. He spent four more months with her. \"The dreams.\" \"Yes, Athena, the dreams. She's come back.\" \"You're going alone, aren't you, Gallant?\" \"Athena... \" \"I've always known the time would come.\" \"Do you want to go home?\" \"This is home. There's nothing on Earth for me. Mick and Elaine feel the same. Our skills are needed here. Besides, Chervan and I together are an unbeatable combo. We'll get this world out of the stone age and on the road back to tech civ in nothing flat. Gallant, I want... Before you go... \" \"Tell me, Athena.\" \"I want all of you. I want the whole thing that I got just a taste of the first time we kissed. Drop your barriers with me just once. It's the one memory I want I don't have.\" She recoiled in shock when he opened his mind to her. He dropped his arms to his sides and turned away. He should have known better. \"No, Gallant! Stop! Again. Slowly this time. It was just too much all at once. You carry so much loneliness and pain. It hurts me to feel it. Show me the love and joy too. I want to know all of you. Love all of you.\" He stood with his back to her, desperately trying to rebuild his barriers. \"No, Athena. Even I don't want to know all of it. I put it all away and forget as much as I can. I surprised myself too. Chervan is scolding me. It seems I knocked half the paths on the planet to their knees. She's not really angry, just upset I didn't give them enough warning to get their barriers up.\" \"Warn them now. Don't argue, Gallant. I won't listen and I won't let you win.\" \"I don't really want to win. I want this memory too.\" **** He wandered. The dreams had sent him from Athena, but not to anywhere. He restlessly searched for Hensk, dodged a few attacks by dark brethren he'd already destroyed, and wandered. \"Find her, my gallant one. Find the second who bears my name. Build the door.\" He awoke aching with loneliness. A door? A door to where? He stumbled to the comp station. He was being driven. He avoided looking in a mirror. He knew what he'd see. Knew because his clothes hung on him. Knew because he couldn't eat or rest. A door to where? A door to beyond where he was? Where was he? He began again. From where he was. If he defined that, he would, perhaps, know what was beyond. The name Hrune. It came to his mind again. Hrune... He tapped Alice's memory banks. Hrune... Yes! Orbel Hrune, Lahathan mathematician. Theory of infinite universes. He patted the console. \"Thank you, Alice. Now I know what door I'm to build. Let's see if you and I can figure out how to build it. I hope you're in the mood to help.\" She was, but it still required months of work. Most at the comp station. He found a red giant to power it and began the work of building it. Athena hadn't come to his dreams since he'd begun the work. She came the night before he opened the door and whispered, \"The second Athena.\" Gallant cautiously explored the universe he'd created a way into. It shocked him when he discovered it was 'the same' as his. He was sure it shouldn't be. He was stunned when he learned his own people didn't exist in it. There was a race as old as his in another galaxy, but very different. He wasn't surprised to discover he actually liked them better. He set coordinates for Earth. It was home in his emotions and humans were the people he truly needed to know existed in this universe. Alice flashed \"Well it's about time, Nervous Nellie!\" on her screen and he laughed. \"You're right, Alice. I've been avoiding it, just as I avoided visiting Earth after the twentieth century, for several thousand years, because I was afraid it would change too much. This universe shouldn't be at all like ours, but it is. And telling myself it doesn't matter if there aren't humans in it is not working.\" He hopped through time. Humans not only existed, they flourished. By the twenty-second century, they'd put all their boundless energy into exploring their galaxy. Earth was the home of the Orion Arm Federation of Free Worlds and the base of the highly regarded Exploration Fleet, but they had a problem. It was called the Durcassin Empire. He hopped forward and saw the Federation and the Empire settle into an uneasy truce. The Federation grew on one side of the wide 'Zone of Neutrality,' by inviting space-faring peoples to join. The Empire grew on the other side, by conquest. Gallant decided he was lonesome and wanted people to talk to. He laughed when Alice gave him the location of a group of humans. She knew him very well. She flashed, \"And it's a dangerous place.\" He told her to give him data and hurry. He knew what 'kind' of danger when she landed. The fact she landed close, told him she was worried. He walked around a small outcropping and introduced himself. \"Hello, I'm Gallant.\" \"You have no business being here!\" \"Hey! The weapon is hardly necessary. I'm unarmed and intend injury to no one.\" \"Commander Telas?\" \"He's as unarmed as he claims, Captain. My sensors detect nothing that could be construed as dangerous.\" \"Cybernetic augmentation. Isn't that a bit unusual?\" Gallant smiled and cautiously lowered his hands. \"It wasn't a choice. Captain, he's not human. Very advanced physiology. Two hearts and a unique cell structure. Slow continual replacement. He probably has a life span of thousands of years.\" \"Thank you, Commander. Now, Mr. Gallant, why don't you tell me what you're doing on a planet that's, basically, falling apart under our feet.\" \"Looking for someone to talk to. Your scientific teams attracted my attention. I just decided to be friendly and say hello. Hello.\" The captain laughed and Gallant's smile widened. He'd missed humans. \"You've picked a pretty unstable setting for a chat. I'm Justin Merris, captain of the Federation Exploration Vessel Curie. We're trying to find out why this is the fourth planet in this region that's disintegrating.\" \"I think I know what's happening to the planet. If I'm right, it will spread. I'll give you the data I've collected.\" \"Thank you. It'll probably give my security chief fits, but why don't you come back to the ship and have a cup of coffee with me?\" \"I'd love to. With your permission, I'll land my craft in your shuttle bay. Captain, I'm going to take a very unusual step and invite Commander Telas aboard my ship, to make the journey with me. He's already deduced more than I really want known about me. I'd like the opportunity to convince him not to reveal everything he learns. The best way to do that is let him know everything, then choose not to reveal it.\" \"Commander?\" \"It's rather convoluted logic, Captain, but a very accurate judgment of my personality. I believe Lt. Ochis would feel a great deal more comfortable about having both his craft and him aboard if I arrived in it.\" \"Agreed. Commander Duchelle!\" \"Yes, Sir! Where did he come from?\" \"A ship. Mr. Gallant, Lieutenant Commander Athena Duchelle.\" \"Athena?! How interesting. Just Gallant. Now, Commander, if you'll come this way, I'll show you my ship.\" Gallant just turned and walked off. He couldn't think of anything to say to her. He noticed Telas followed at a nod from his captain, but he was a bit surprised he did. He wasn't surprised by what the woman named Athena said behind him. \"Well! I've never had quite that reaction to my name before. Or quite that response to an introduction. Not the politest person I've ever met.\" \"Commander Duchelle, your greeting was not exactly fleet protocol. He's not human. Telas seems to find him more than a little intriguing. He also seems to have some idea what's happening to this world. Finish your tests, then report to me aboard the ship.\" \"Yes, Captain. Non-human. Hmm.\" \"Commander, your intense interest in non-human anthros almost got you left behind on Base Six Four. This is not the place to be thinking of other things. I'd like as much information as we can get before this world becomes an asteroid belt.\" \"I know, I know. Curb my curiosity and get on with the job at hand. Yes, Captain. Still, he's very interesting.\" \"Yes, and he has data to add to yours, so I suggest you assemble some.\" \"Yes, Sir. We're about done.\" Gallant didn't take Telas directly to the Curie. It was nearly three months before he took him there. Of course, it was only ten minutes as far as the captain was concerned. In those months, they became very good friends. They had a great deal in common. Telas' cyber augmentation had been done by an alien scientific group when he was a child. He had been, basically, a slave to the computer that ran their ship. A fleet ship had tracked the abducted human children and freed them, but too late for Telas. Federation medical knowledge was incapable of reversing the augmentation. Telas would live for thousands of years as part man, part computer. He laughed when he told Gallant Alice was the first girl he'd ever truly loved. Gallant smiled and ached for him. The laugh was real, but tinged with longing. Gallant showed Telas what was causing the breakup. The device was small and nearly undetectable in the vast reaches of the neutral territory. The Empire had invented a new weapon. Soon it would begin to destabilize stars. Soon after, it would affect inhabited worlds. They landed on the Curie and Gallant joined the captain for coffee. They'd just begun to chat when Telas' voice came over the com. \"Gallant! Now!\" Gallant ran from the captain's ready room. Telas had a man in his arms and was stepping into a lift. Gallant leapt consoles and people and dove into it just as the doors began to close. \"Emergency one, shuttle bay two. Emergency two, medical. He's a mess inside. I don't know how he got from the pad to the lift. 'Something' destabilized the transport system. You stunned the bridge crew.\" \"If I didn't know better, I'd think you planned it. You timed it perfectly. Shuttle bay first.\" \"Doctor Marsh says we can save him, but Commander Duchelle is still on the planet and it's coming apart. I couldn't get her on comm.\" \"Damn! Telas, convince him he must violate neutral space. Destroy that thing.\" \"I will.\" Gallant ran for Alice as soon as the lift doors opened. He hadn't given the captain an easy job. The Curie would take a real beating just getting close enough to blast the device. He'd take a real beating saving Commander Duchelle. He didn't quite reach her before it began. Athena got a shoulder under him and got him to his feet. The landslide had rolled him about three hundred meters, then near buried him. She was amazed he was alive and astounded he was conscious. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" \"Would you believe rescuing you? My ship's over that cliff that used to be a ridge. Your transporter is nonfunctional.\" \"This job would be easier if you weren't quite so... \" \"Comfortable. I'd still weigh more than a human. This won't work. There just isn't time. Here. Go. Take this. It's the key to my ship. Push the green button on the navigation console. It'll take you to the nearest inhabited planet.\" \"Look, big, blond, and 'comfortable', you'll get out of this with me, or we'll not get out of it together. Don't argue! Just keep going.\" \"Why do I keep meeting stubborn women named Athena?!\" \"Explain that statement while I 'stubborn' us to a bit more stable ground. If there is any.\" \"There isn't. This whole planet is about to crumble around us. LOOK OUT!!\" She cried as she rigged a travois. He'd pushed her out of the way, then thrown himself between her and the falling, bouncing rock. It would have killed her. She didn't know why it hadn't killed him. She reminded herself the travois \"put basic physics to work\" and she knew she could do it, dragged him to a spot that didn't have tumbling cliffs on both sides and dropped to the ground, exhausted. The planet was coming apart, but she had to rest. Gallant awoke and looked around. Athena Duchelle was curled on the ground near where he lay. She'd gotten him a long way while he was unconscious. He decided it was probably his turn. He assessed his condition and smiled. He'd always liked a challenge. He struggled to his knees, waited for his head to stop spinning and his vision to clear, then got to his feet. She was small and ordinarily he'd have found her weight an easy load, but this wasn't ordinarily. He decided she'd been asleep when the rock hit her. She'd probably regain consciousness in a few hours. But they didn't have a few hours. He got his bearings, put her on the travois and set out. He faced the hill and laid down the travois. He'd have to carry her. He begged for just a little luck. If the hill would stay stable just a few minutes, he thought he could make it to Alice with her. He picked her up and started up the hill. He got about two-thirds of the way before the hill began to disintegrate. Suddenly, Alice was around him. He laughed, told her he loved her, gently laid Commander Duchelle on the floor and collapsed, before he could get his healing unit out of his pocket. **** Athena looked around. They had to be in his ship. She felt a faint vibration, so she knew they were in flight. How had they gotten there and where was he? She found him. He was unconscious on the floor not far from her. She rolled him over gently and began to examine him. Broken clavicle, scapula, ribs, badly bruised leg, she thought his sternum might be cracked and his mass of blond curly hair was matted with blood. And somehow, he'd gotten her to his ship and off the disintegrating planet. She'd found the one she'd been looking for. She smiled at the thought her little-girl white-knight dreams fit with grown-up girl plan, after all, even if he was a bit plump for the armor. Now to keep him alive to accomplish it. She gave up hunting for medical supplies after she'd gotten lost twice and nearly didn't find her way back to the control center. She settled for a small basin of water and a soft cloth. \"Hello.\" \"Hello, Gallant. How'd we get here?\" \"We staggered, until a beautiful lady performed an impossible rescue.\" \"What?\" \"My ship just does the impossible now and then. Neither of us can figure out how. Unh. There seem to be pieces of me where there shouldn't.\" \"Broken ribs. Several. How in hell did you pull that travois with a broken clavicle and scapula?\" \"I didn't pull it far. Couldn't get it up the hill.\" \"You carried me?!\" \"You don't weigh much. Probably not more than a hundred twenty pounds, soaking wet.\" \"Pounds?! Gallant, you use some amazing terms; weeks, months, pounds.\" \"Showing my age. Still hovering. The Curie may be in trouble. Alice needs my help to find her. I need yours to get to the controls. Push that chair over here, then help me into it.\" \"At least you have sense enough not to try to stand. Lord! You're heavy!\" \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lean on you that much. I weigh near three times what you do. Did I hurt you?\" \"No. I knew it and was prepared to help. I just didn't expect you to need it that fast. Concussion too. Had to be with that smack you got. You didn't expect dizzy to make slow assist fast support, either.\" \"I do know how strong you are. You pulled me a long way.\" \"We wouldn't have made it without both of us. Gallant gestures are wonderful. Teamwork is practical. What are you doing?\" \"Helping Alice find the Curie. The course was plotted by Telas, a person, not a computer. There wasn't time to input the data.\" \"Computers can't play hunches and Telas has the most data as a base for his. You know the data he's got.\" \"Precisely. Got her. Put us in her engineering section, Alice. I think Telas and I can hold her together long enough to destroy that disrupter. Athena, how well do you know her systems?\" \"I helped design them. She's a prototype. I hitched a ride on her for this mission. Pulled 'Mama's baby' and they let me get away with it.\" \"We're landing. Get someone to help me to the Curie's engineering console, then let Telas know I want him on the ops station.\" She ran for help. She barked, \"Work now, questions later!\" at the two open-mouthed crewmen who stopped and stared at the room too big to be in the little travel trailer. They got Gallant to the main engineering console of the shaking ship and held him up while he worked. Athena worked on the secondary station and implemented the commands that flashed across her screen. Telas did the same thing on the bridge. They tuned the shields, dampened the oscillation, the ship steadied and damage control began to catch up. The captain gave the order and the device was destroyed. The Curie raced for Federation space. Gallant smiled and collapsed. \"Get him to Medical. Now! STOP! You can't carry him like that! Telas! Am I glad to see you! He's got a broken clavicle and scapula and ribs and a concussion. Probably a half dozen other--\" \"I'll carry him. Get a lift and notify Dr. Marsh we're coming. He's his own best healer, but with a concussion, he'll need help.\" As soon as they got on the lift, Telas had Athena get Gallant's healing unit out of his pocket. He looked at the readings, then told her to put it back in the pocket. She raised an eyebrow. \"He doesn't need more help than we can give him. That unit isn't a great deal better than ours, just enough faster to make the med techs too curious.\" \"His ship is going to drive me crazy. It's smaller than it was in the shuttle bay.\" \"Only the physical interface. The ship is still infinite.\" \"Mathematical construct.\" \"Yes, a programmed set of dimensions. There's a very rare non-replicable isotope at the heart of it, but the rest is all a program he wrote. He called it the mathematics of finite infinity. I managed not to say that was a contradiction.\" \"It exists, so it's not impossible. Of course, I'll probably spend the rest of my life reminding myself of it. Get him to teach you why it's not, someday. He has enough time, too.\" \"Thank you, for understanding knowing someone who does means a great deal to me.\" \"I also know there's far too much caring there for a few minutes. It exists, so it's not impossible. Lynn!\" \"Him there. You there. Now, Lieutenant!\" \"Yes, Commander.\" Gallant was unconscious for two days. Dr. Marsh told them it was actually some kind of trance state. Once she'd healed his concussion, his own system had taken over and begun healing his other injuries. She complained about tripping over people every time she turned around, but smiled when she groused. Athena, Telas and Captain Merris smiled back. He awoke and asked for water, drank deeply and drifted off to sleep. Lynn Marsh sighed and tripped over people for two more days. Midday of the second day, Athena asked for her help. \"I think you're crazy.\" \"We've talked about this before, Lynn.\" \"Theoretically, not as a course of action.\" \"I'm going to the Pauling. She's got the finest medical facilities in space. I want this and I do know what I'm doing.\" \"I'm not sure it will work. Athena, he's very, very different.\" \"Yes. And very, very special.\" \"You're in love with him!\" \"Oh, yes, since I was eight. I always helped the white knight rescue me in my fantasies, but I know he's going to leave. Lynn, he's not even from this universe. Came through a 'doorway,' he called it.\" \"Two hearts, continual cell replacement, another set of chromosomes, for heaven's sake!\" \"And two arms, two legs, blond curly hair, beautiful voice, the gentlest smile.\" \"I give up. If gray-eyed Athena, connoisseur of the fleet, thinks a slightly plump alien is the most perfect male in existence, who am I to argue?\" \"Did you notice? He has gray eyes too. Sort of a sea mist blue-green gray and the fairest skin--\" \"Stop, already. I'm convinced. Climb on the table and let's get this started before I regain my sanity. But I get to be there for the finale. If it works.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it will.\" \"Yar Hulen's work says it probably could, maybe.\" \"You don't really doubt it will, either.\" \"I'm a doctor. I believe in good science and miracles.\" **** \"You mean you can cook?!\" \"Gallant, I can do almost anything. Following a recipe isn't that different from following a chemical formula. Not that I need a recipe. Traditional New Orleans fare. Seven bells. My quarters. See you then.\" \"I'll be there.\" Telas watched Athena walk away and grinned. \"Gallant, you're in for a treat. Athena grew up in New Orleans. Everyone in the fleet has tried to talk her into cooking dinner at one time or another. Every man has tried to get an invitation to her quarters.\" \"Uh, oh.\" \"Relax. You're not really her type, too comfortable. She likes slender with lots of muscle.\" \"More than half the reason I'm the way I am is to avoid being someone's type.\" \"Gallant, you've had thousands of years of experience. Women shouldn't make you that nervous.\" \"Telas, those thousands of years of experience are why women make me nervous.\" He decided he was in trouble right after he pulled a rose from a nontime pocket and gave it to her at her door. Her smile was warm enough to raise the ship's ambient temperature two degrees and his a bit more than that. She'd looked so lovely framed in the doorway with the glow of candlelight behind her, he'd done it without thinking about it first. He was too lost in her smile to notice she hadn't asked how he'd made the rose appear. Dinner was superb. He enjoyed it, the soft jazz playing in the background and her company. He also enjoyed the excellent wine she served him. \"Athena, thank you. It's been a very pleasant evening. Dinner was wonderful. I enjoyed it immensely.\" \"Good, then you'll stay a bit longer.\" \"I really should go.\" \"Can you dance?\" \"Of course I can dance.\" \"Here, one glass each of wine left. And a dance before you leave. Gallant, I know you're going to slip off to Alice and leave for wonderland.\" \"Not many people catch that allusion. Yes, Athena, it's time for me to return to my own universe. Oops! My, you're quick.\" \"Fastest reflexes in the fleet. Other than Telas. Barely spilled a drop. Why don't you drink it instead of wearing it? Would you believe I represented the Americas in the pan-Federation games? Hundred meter sprint. Took the silver. I was still in the academy at the time.\" \"You really are a very surprising young woman. I was told you attained the rank of Lt. Commander faster than anyone else had ever done it.\" \"That probably won't stand long. The Fleet's growing. Rank's going to come a bit faster for some of the bright young looies. I'm glad to see it.\" \"You asked about my 'stubborn' comment. I knew another beautiful woman named Athena once. She didn't have the Fleet to give her a place to use her skills.\" \"You found her one, then left her behind. Miss her. Loved her. Still do.\" \"You are entirely too perceptive. And far too beautiful by candlelight. I don't think I should have had that last glass of wine.\" \"Dance with me.\" She was soft and warm in his arms. Before he quite realized what he was doing, he was kissing her. As he scooped her up in his arms and carried her deeper into her quarters, he decided the last glass of wine had definitely been a mistake. He was very glad he'd made it. Gallant returned to his own universe, but she haunted his memory and his dreams. He'd fallen in love. He knew it and that he'd never love another woman in quite the same way again. He longed to return to her, but the other 'dream' Athena had gently told him he must not. He decided on a fishing trip. He was not expecting company. The tall, slender, extremely fair boy with near white hair, who walked out of the woods on his right, appeared to be in his mid-teens. He liked his smile, but wasn't feeling particularly sociable or he'd have chosen somewhere else for his fishing trip. \"Hello.\" \"Hello. Who are you?\" \"I'm Apollo Avelaine. Lane. How's the fishing?\" \"Quite good. It usually is on uninhabited planets.\" \"Pretty good if you go far enough into the past on inhabited ones too.\" \"Are you going to tell me who you are and why you're here, or just keep dropping obscure hints?\" \"Look at me. I've given you my name. My mother is gray-eyed Athena. Not one of the human ones. My hair is lighter than yours, but I look too much like you for you not to know me. Feel who I am. I traveled here from another time in a ship named Alice. You brought me. I've come to help you find my brothers.\" Gallant stared at him in shock. Lane laughed. \"You said you felt pretty strange when I told you. Hello, Dad. I'm from your future, but you've got me now. Just be glad you didn't get the girls too. \"Girls?\" \"You spend almost thirty years raising a family. I'm sixteen and the only boy of the group. You're taking most of the girls to your home world. I'm officially the youngest of three boys and three girls. You and I are going to find my brothers.\" \"Six… children. I told you all this?\" \"No. I'm Athena's child. I'm the timewalker. All my life exists within my memory. I'm Apollo. I see the future.\" He knew the boy was his without doubt. He could feel it. He didn't doubt he saw the future either. It was too clear in his eyes. \"That's a terrible burden to carry. Why did I bring you to me?\" \"To get my brothers. And to meet our Godfather.\" \"Your Godfather?\" \"Telas. You're about to hook our supper. You clean. I'll cook.\" **** The place looked very different than when he'd left it, but he'd expected it would. He smiled when he saw her, stopped and waited for her to feel him. She almost dropped the bundle she was carrying in the street. \"Hello, Athena.\" \"GALLANT! You've come for him. I think I've always known you would. Oh! Who are you?\" \"Lane. I told him to come. He didn't know. You forgot to mention what you were planning.\" \"'Forgot' probably isn't the operable term. I figured he'd argue about it. In fact, I knew he'd argue about it. Come on, Gallant. You know the paths all know you're here. Mick will know by now too.\" \"Chervan has already informed me, in no uncertain terms, I'm staying for dinner.\" \"Being one of three humans on a world of telepaths has been a very interesting experience. One I wouldn't trade. Mick and Elaine have four kids. Seven full humans on this world now, but with a bit of telekinetic assistance, the human strain will blend in within two generations.\" \"I had assumed that was how you'd overcome the inter-species differences. It hurt me to learn my last night with you was... shared, Athena.\" \"Oh, Gallant! It wasn't! Don't think that! I... Chervan and I... Before I came to find you, then after you'd gone. We... I wanted... \" \"Athena, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Don't cry. I'm not angry, nor hurt any longer. Feel.\" He held her a moment and then stepped back from her. She would know why. Leaving her had been very hard the first time. Now he would have to do it again. \"What's his name?\" \"Pericles. We call him Clete. Biggest kid on the planet. Strong as an ox and almost as fast as you are. Gentle and deadly. Strawberry blond curls. Looks just... Lane's your son.\" \"From somewhere far in the future. In my future. He tells me his mother's name is also Athena.\" \"Dad, we're staying for five days. It's important.\" \"He also tells me he sees the future. Handy if you're wondering if you're going to catch dinner. Not a bad cook either.\" \"That was a hint. All right. I'll cook dinner one of the days you're here. One of the days.\" Gallant laughed. She hadn't changed. She was a terrific cook, but she disliked it. In the near eight years they'd trained, then fought side by side against Hensk and the bel-Nathans, she'd cooked no more than a dozen times. Always as a special treat for him. \"Gallant, you're taller. How long have you been gone?\" \"Am I? I hadn't noticed. Not long. Just a few years.\" \"That means you got hurt and spent major time healing yourself. What happened?\" \"I fell down a hill and most of it came along. I had pretty good help healing. Must have put more energy into it than I needed.\" \"No, it means you broke a whole bunch of bones and your body strengthened itself by getting bigger. And thicker.\" \"Athena, I'm comfortable this way. Although, I've a feeling I'm about to get in very good shape. It seems I'm about to take on the job of training my sons.\" \"Well, Lane looks like he's in good shape and I've been training Clete since he was two.\" \"TWO?!\" \"It was either that or let him hurt himself trying to copy the older kids. To be honest, I was afraid he'd hurt someone else. He's massive, Gallant. Nearly a hundred ninety centimeters and about a hundred ten kilos of muscle and still getting bigger.\" \"He'll top out at one ninety-five and one fifty K. It'll always be all muscle. He likes to work-out.\" \"Lane!\" \"Sorry, Dad, but Athena doesn't mind.\" \"He's right, Gallant. I'm kind of pleased to know.\" \"Let's see, that's about six-four-and-a-half and three hundred thirty pounds. Whew! That is big.\" \"He's like you, Dad. All of us are. We're heavier than humans. He'll look like about one-thirty K. Two hundred eighty pounds for you.\" \"That's still big.\" \"Yes, it'll drive Dutch crazy. So will his purring.\" \"PURRING?!\" \"In the future. Shouldn't have mentioned it. You're about to meet him.\" \"Lane, you're going to drive me crazy.\" \"Always did.\" \"Hi, Mom, I just heard. You must be Gallant. I've heard a lot... Mother?\" \"You never asked.\" \"You mean you didn't tell him either?! ATHENA, YOU'RE HOPELESS!\" \"Gee, Gallant. You haven't yelled at me in seventeen years. Feels great.\" He groaned, Athena grinned and Lane and Clete sat on the ground and laughed. Five days passed and he had to leave her again. **** The trip through the doorway and to Earth in the time of the Federation was rather short. Athena's world was very near it, as he thought of it. But when he got there, he ran into unexpected difficulty. He tried to remember the man across the desk wasn't just being difficult, but it wasn't easy. \"He's my son and I want him!\" \"He's a Federation ward, Mr. Gallant, and you will have to prove your status.\" \"Dad, get Telas. He's expecting it. You set it up years ago. Remember?\" \"Oh. All right, Lane. Anything has to be easier than this.\" Gallant stormed out of the office and down the steps. Clete was having a bit of difficulty not kicking something in response to what he was feeling. What he got from Lane was too mixed to define, but it was predominantly anticipation, so strong it was a hunger. It was almost as strong as his father's frustration. \"Why, after all these years, did they make him a ward of the state?! Lane, when did I set this up with Telas?\" \"I don't know. Just that you do.\" \"Why don't you know and why didn't you tell me sooner?\" \"There he is. Right on time.\" \"Telas! It's good to see you!\" \"Hi, Gallant. Hello, Clete, Lane. Let's see, you're here to pick up Roberrin. That means this is the first time my godsons have met me.\" \"You mean I'm your godson too?\" \"You are now, Clete, but not yet. That even confuses me. Let's see... Your dad asked me a long time ago, but he hasn't... The simple answer is: Yes, and now that he knows, he will. I have a file on the duties and, more relevant, the privileges of my duty station. I believe this is the time to invoke my hugging privilege. I've watched over your son, Gallant. I gave him his first hug. Lynn Marsh states she was not really hugging him when she handed him to me. We were there. The Pauling was Athena's ship and they loved him too. We're quite smug. Athena trusted us to build her son into the person he could be. It's time he knew his father and his brothers.\" \"Telas, I can't prove I'm a Fed citizen. I'm not. They refuse to take straight paternity without a long involved court proceeding. I'm... two steps from just grabbing him.\" \"That's what I'm here to help you do. You want him to disappear from this time period. There are others helping. Lynn Marsh is Fleet Chief Med Officer. She's just had all his medical records put in a coded file and sealed under Fleet Med Command. The captain of the Pauling just 'lost' all his records at Admiral Merris' request. The only one left to 'hit' is Social.\" \"There's a sweet little old lady who will help at the school. Dad will charm her socks off and she'll 'forget' to refile Dutch's records. She thinks it's dumb to put a kid with an obviously caring parent in an institution. Clete and I will get him. It'll take him all of ten seconds to figure out who we are. It'll take us about two hours to convince him he doesn't need to say good-by to about forty girls. Come on, Clete. He'll be on the field for track practice by the time we get there. Dad, remember to tell me about sweet little old Ms. Brown.\" \"Telas, they're going to drive me crazy.\" \"You're going to turn them into outstanding young men and it'll break your heart to part with them.\" \"That too. I can already see it coming and I haven't even met Roberrin. Three sons, Telas. Three beautiful women gave me sons. And I already ache to hold... Lane calls him Dutch. His eyes light when he says it. I would have gone anywhere and done nearly anything to see... Telas, Social? I want my son.\" \"Back to the office you just left. You get that man to get into Dutch's file. As soon as he does, I'll key in an erase command from the outer office. I've got the Fed's pri-one override command. As soon as he closes the file, it will cease to have ever existed.\" \"Pri-one? Override?\" \"You have friends in high places. So will the boys when they reach this time. Gallant, you put them in the academy sixteen years ago.\" \"Wait! Don't tell me any more. I don't want to know the future, but I do want to know what happened to Athena.\" \"She saved a world and lost her life. Highest commendation the Fed can give. One of six ever awarded. She stopped a war. No one knows how she did it. The defense shield she threw up around a defenseless world fused into a lump of metal. It lasted just long enough to deflect the incomings. When it blew, she died. She was the only one who didn't live through the attack. Nearly two billion people owe her their lives. Every city on that planet has an Athena Boulevard or Athena Duchelle park. Half the girls under ten are named Athena. She's one of the Federation's greatest heroes.\" \"Sounds like the girl I knew.\" \"Ooh, it hasn't been very long, has it?\" \"No. Not long enough to forget the fragrance she wore or the way she felt in my arms. A minute, Telas. I need a minute.\" \"Gallant, she loved you. You were the last man she invited 'in' for dinner.\" \"Telas, there are four Athenas.\" \"I'd say the explanation lies in your future and in those three boys.\" \"I'll wait for it. There are three girls too, but Lane says they're close to each other, but not to him or me. Family, but not really friends. I don't understand it, but I don't think he does either. It may be the only thing that confuses him. I may have to do something about that. I'm not sure it's healthy. Teenage boys are supposed to be a bit confused.\" \"The only thing that confuses Dutch is girls. He never forgets a comm number, but he gets the names that go with them mixed up.\" \"Lane says he doesn't understand why they think he should choose between them either. He loves him incredibly, like he's been waiting for this moment his whole life, living for it. Let's go. I want my son.\" He insisted the man check the files to make sure he wasn't named as father, all files. He wasn't, just unspecified non-human. He made a hasty exit. He'd made such a fuss the man was going to go through them again. Telas led him to the school and he almost collapsed in mirth. He set about charming Ms. Brown and charmed himself right into trouble. Lane was near giggles before they got to the field. Clete wasn't far behind. He had no idea what was so funny to Lane, but he'd never felt anyone as strongly as he did him and his near giggly mood felt wonderful. He could have found his brother on the field with his eyes closed. It didn't take him long to notice them. He watched him come across the field and made an estimate from the ease and speed at which he did it. He could see Lane's description of 'fast' was an understatement. Lane's intense surge of excitement when he ran up to them didn't at all agree with his casual posture, but he didn't say anything, just stood and smiled. \"Hi, Dutch.\" \"Who are you?\" \"You've already figured out the answer. Come on, we're breaking you out of this place. Dad's finishing off your computer tracks now. He's Lane. I'm Clete. Apollo Avelaine and Pericles Buchannon. Our dad's Gallant. So's yours. Let's go.\" \"I need to say good-by to some people. I can't leave without telling them.\" \"Dutch, the important ones are helping. We haven't time for farewells to every girl in a ten kilometer radius.\" \"Just Rosalind and Jackie. Oh, and Carol and Diane. How did you know I wanted to say good-by to girls?\" \"He remembers the future. Pretty strange, but I'm starting to get used to it. Dutch, relax. You're starting to make me tense.\" \"He's wondering why Dad didn't come for him before, Clete. It's worrying him.\" \"Exactly. Well, why didn't he?\" \"Because, until I told him eighteen days ago, he didn't know either one of you existed. He didn't know I did until I walked up and introduced myself. NO! You can't tell her good-by.\" \"But she's right across... You really do know what's going to happen. Wow! That must be great.\" \"Dutch, you're not dense. Think about it a minute. Lane will never have a surprise, not even a happy one. Yeah, better. You're still doing dips emotionally, but your brain's getting back in gear. Oh, I'm an empath.\" \"A big one.\" \"Yes, and he'll get bigger, but so will we. Primarily because he makes us work at it. Yes, we're all the same age. You need to know Dad, so you understand who you are, Dutch.\" \"We're all the same age? Dumb question. You just said that.\" \"Not dumb. I wouldn't have known what you were going to ask if you didn't ask it. That's how it works. Dad's going to tell us how 'little old Ms. Brown' helped clear your files later.\" \"Little!? Old!? Corinne Brown may be the most beautiful redhead who ever walked a planet!\" \"Yeah. Make sure you don't let on you knew it. I worked very hard setting him up for it.\" \"Ooh. Does he do this often, Clete?\" \"I haven't been around him long enough to know, but from the way he's enjoying it, I'd say as often as he thinks he can get away with it.\" \"Ms. Brown. Our dad must really be something.\" Gallant got back to Alice quite late. He very carefully told Lane about 'sweet little old Ms. Brown' helping get rid of Dutch's files. He could have cheerfully strangled Telas when he added, \"Yes, your dad charmed her socks off.\" He began to realize he'd been had when the three boys collapsed in giggles in a corridor just beyond the main control room. **** \"DAD! Lane's having a nightmare and it's bad! Real bad.\" \"Where, Clete? I don't even know which room he chose.\" \"Come on. Hurry. That one.\" He pulled him out of sleep and into his arms. It was the first time he'd truly held one of his children. The rightness of it washed over him. \"Easy, Lane, easy. Tell me.\" \"I can't. It'll come and it'll pass, but I can't talk about it now.\" \"Not a nightmare, a future event.\" \"That's what all my nightmares are.\" \"Do you have them often?\" \"Too often. The closer the event, the worse they get. I know one day they'll stop. Well, they won't happen very often. Sorry, Clete, bad enough I have them. You waking up in a cold sweat and terror that isn't even your own isn't fair. But I can't do anything about it.\" \"Yes you can. Break the cycle. Do something to change it.\" \"Dad, I can't.\" \"You can and someday you will.\" \"If he doesn't, I will.\" \"Hello, Dutch. Woke you too.\" \"Something did. Something like cold breath on the back of my neck.\" \"WHEN?!\" \"Just now. Dad, what is it?\" \"We're leaving. This minute. TELAS! Clete, find him and see where he wants to go. We're out of here. NOW!\" He knew what the cold breath meant. Something about his sons was enough force for change the powers were involved. He fought the Dark One as the personification of anti-life in his own universe, but he was not the power of the destructive force. Like a ship cutting through water, his sons were increasing the possibilities for life to exist in some way and the bow wave of circumstance was exerting more pressure. There was no Dark One in Dutch's universe. The cold breath said, \"Chance is aligning against you. The 'dark power' has taken a hand.\" **** \"You have to give us Alice for a few days.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"There's something we have to do.\" \"Lane, I'm not giving you my ship without more explanation than that.\" \"We have to find the third Athena.\" \"Where is she?!\" \"Easy, Dad. She's my mother. We'll take her to you, but it's a long way in your future.\" \"I want to go with you.\" \"Sorry, it has to be just us. You have something else to do.\" \"Which is?\" \"Save a world.\" How had he let Lane talk him into this? He didn't like cold damp places. Especially cold damp places with bars and chains. He sighed and wondered how he was supposed to save this world. He'd gone straight from a stroll in the forest to a dungeon in chains. Not a great deal of world-saving opportunity in a journey of less than ten minutes with thirty guards. Oh, my. Dark-haired and beautiful! \"Visitors. How nice. Excuse me, but I'd like to discuss these chains.\" \"Be quiet! Where was he found?\" \"He walked out of the sacred grove.\" \"Then why is he alive?\" \"Because, Lady, he didn't walk into it.\" \"Get him down! Now! Attire him appropriately and bring him to me.\" Well, step one. He was being unchained. He wasn't extremely pleased with all the touching that seemed to be involved in the process, but the women were removing the... chains. He found it very difficult to concentrate on the architecture of the interesting building. The occupants were very distracting and all seemed to be female. He didn't have any difficulty paying attention when he was guided before the woman who had ordered him freed. \"Yes, I can see it now.\" \"Would someone please tell me what you're all muttering about?\" \"You have been prophesied. You will save us.\" \"Well, that's what I was told I was supposed to be doing. Close that window, please. I'm cold. Your idea of appropriate attire and mine seem to be quite different. Oh! Now, wait a minute!\" He didn't quite know what to do. He couldn't bring himself to hit any of them. They were so much smaller than he was. It would have been like hitting half-grown girls. Some of them were half-grown girls. Just before he stopped thinking about anything, she appeared in his mind, laughed and said, \"Save them, Gallant. Only you can. They will save their world.\" **** Lane grinned when his father walked through the door. The scenery he saw through it when it opened was lovely. He wouldn't tell him all of where they'd been or what they'd done. None of them ever would. Neither would Alice. She understood he wouldn't really want to know. \"Hello, Dad. I see you saved them.\" \"They say I did, Lane, but I don't really know.\" \"Dad, if you hadn't, that grove would not be standing.\" \"Rather an unusual way to... save a sacred grove. Where are Clete and Dutch?\" \"We're on our way to get them. Clete's preventing a murder.\" \"Whose murder?\" \"Auri, Aurora, got herself into a mess. He's going to be in rough shape when we get him.\" \"Injured?\" \"Not yet.\" \"You've lost me.\" \"It's his culture. He's going to fall apart on us. Dutch will do his best, but he won't be able to stop him.\" Gallant stared after the boy who had laughed wildly, then run into the corridors of the part of Alice he called the maze. The wild laugh had been startling, but hadn't bothered him near as much as the deep sobs that he'd heard as Lane had disappeared into the vast labyrinth of the ship. She was landing. Dutch ran in, pulling Clete behind him. \"Help me with him. It was the only way to save her, but he's almost catatonic. She told him you'd come for her before they made up their minds what to do about it.\" \"Do about what?!\" \"The sacrifice. He kept her from being sacrificed.\" \"How?\" \"How do you keep a woman from playing the role of virgin sacrifice?\" \"Oh, I see. But why is he in such bad shape?\" \"Just before we left, she told him who she is.\" \"Terrific. Now, if you'll tell me who she is, we'll all know.\" \"Lane's sister. Our sister.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"It gets worse. She told him she'd name their son Connell.\" \"Oh, brother. His culture has very strict taboos about these things, with good reason. Now I know why Lane ran. I need to find him.\" \"Dad, he said good-by to us. He said you'd send him away. It's not his fault. CLETE! Damn! I'll go after him.\" Gallant finished putting in the coordinates for the most peaceful place he knew. He had a mess on his hands and Lane had as much as said it would get worse. He needed to know what that 'worse' was. He'd barely begun to look for him when he heard Clete, then Dutch, scream in his mind. He'd wondered if they could at need. He ran for them. He suddenly realized Lane was right behind him. Dutch was near incoherent. \"I couldn't stop him!\" \"Give me that!\" He grabbed the medunit from Lane and went to work on the son who had tried to kill himself. It was going to be close. He spared just enough attention to notice Lane holding Dutch and calming him. So, he knew he'd be sent away, did he? The nightmares! He now knew what they were about. Within a few minutes, he was sure his son would live. When he finished repairing the damage he'd done to himself with a knife, he stepped back, took a deep breath and realized Lane was no longer in the room. \"Dutch, where's Lane?\" \"He said he had to get ready. Dad, he told me to tell Clete he'd miss him. And Auri had always known. Change things. Please, Dad.\" \"Dutch, he set Clete up for this. He knew this would happen.\" Dutch grabbed his arm and as he turned for the door. He was so angry he almost threw him aside. It shocked him enough to stop him. \"Dad, think! It's not like that. He's carried it inside his whole life. He doesn't think anything can change. Auri didn't either. Dad, he thinks he'll spend fifty years in Earth's past. Alone, Dad, until Clete and I find him. I'm not supposed to tell you.\" \"Yes, that's where I'd take him. About mid-twentieth century. I always liked it there. You can let go, Dutch. My mind is working. I'm going to move Clete to the surgery. I'm going to put restraints on him. I want you to stay with him.\" It didn't take him long to find Lane. He was lying on the floor of the command center, curled around a pack. \"Were you planning on going somewhere?\" \"Please, just do it. I've already reset the coordinates.\" \"Hmm. Earth. Nineteen forty-two. Oh! You're planning on helping build the Alaska highway. Too bad. They'll just have to manage without you.\" \"What?\" Gallant sat down on the floor next to his son. He looked terribly confused. It was an improvement. \"You're not leaving. It would probably be easier than facing Clete, but I think it's necessary you do so.\" \"You can't... change the future.\" \"I already have. Several times. Done a bit of past changing too. Come here, Son.\" Gallant pulled Lane into his arms and held him as he cried. He was very thankful Dutch had stopped him and 'thumped' him for being so angry. He was also thankful Telas had told him just enough to assure he paid attention to the thump. He didn't pursue the thought there had to be a reason he'd allowed Clete to be injured. Why hadn't he done something to change it before? Hadn't he known? Why had Clete been so overwhelmed by the culture of his world that he'd tried to kill himself? His mother was human and flat practical about such things. There had to be something adding to the horror. Something his strongly empathic son had felt from someone else? From Lane? His sister? Or him? Who had added just enough shock to make him grasp the knife? He was only sure it hadn't been Dutch. \"Dad... I'm... It's all changing. Dizzy.\" \"Easy, Lane, open your mind to me. I'll help you ride it out.\" He entered his son's mind and saw the wild spirit beneath the tightly controlled and slightly cool surface. He withdrew when the images began to settle. He didn't want to know the future. \"Thank you.\" \"Lane, you're very much my son. You're also as much a victim of this as Clete is. Now, we'd better get to him. Alice isn't going to put us down anywhere until we're ready, then she'll take us to a favorite spot of mine.\" \"Disneyland. Nineteen fifty-nine. Is that why Alice looks like a little silver travel trailer most of the time?\" \"I don't know. It's her choice. I do rather like it though. Rolled awning, wheels and all. I spent nearly a hundred years on Earth once. Towed her behind a car and explored North America.\" \"Motorcycles!\" \"Yes, those too. I have several of different types. Racing and doing stunt shows was a good excuse to travel and paid enough I didn't constantly have to worry about running out of money.\" \"Easier than the rock shoveling I thought I'd be doing. I couldn't even have gone to school. The first time someone got a stethoscope on me... \" \"Yes. You'd have spent all your time hiding what you are. You don't have my power. I just hypnotized doctors into forgetting I had two hearts.\" \"You fought in their wars.\" \"Several of them. Seemed like every time I changed identities, I got drafted. Very long ago, but I still remember. Especially Korea and Vietnam. Not good memories.\" \"Why did you do it?\" \"I could save lives. Some that lived through those wars wouldn't have if I hadn't been their sergeant. But I took lives too. Too many.\" \"You once told me you were a hippie.\" \"I went back and joined protests against racism and Vietnam. I didn't like the drug scene, but I liked the ideals of love and peace. Liked the music too.\" \"A red Gibson Les Paul and a clear Dan Armstrong bass. I've seen them.\" \"That bass put blisters on my fingers, but it has the most incredible tone. Lane, when do I find her?\" \"Dad, Mom's not the girl of your dreams, but she'll make you incredibly happy. She dies, but it's not really death. She has to go back to where we found her.\" \"But you said… I don't understand.\" \"I can't explain it. She's... something else, but she came to you as a woman, a human woman.\" \"The girl of my dreams. She's going to haunt me for another ten thousand years, isn't she?\" \"No, Dad, forever. But always with the promise of someday. She comes again right after Mom leaves.\" \"Admitting that's reassuring feels distinctly odd. Clete's going to wake up soon.\" \"Dad, open yourself to Clete and Dutch. They need to know you. Just as I did.\" \"I want to know them too.\" Gallant took them to Disneyland, then to other places he loved. He began to get into very good condition as he helped Clete get back into it. Then he took them fishing and relaxed just a bit too much. \"NO!\" \"Ah, the slave. You see slave, I have found your children. I've spent nearly one hundred years hunting you. Since you have children, I know it's been longer for you. You should have stayed away. I wouldn't have pursued you. You meant nothing. I had those telepaths at my feet. They were mine! Then you came. Three boys. They'll ease the irritation I felt the times I thought I'd killed you, then discovered you were still alive.\" \"Please, Hensk, Lord Master, spare them. I beg you. I will give my pledge to serve you and never seek escape.\" \"Don't be foolish. I already have you. We will return to the world I left a hundred years ago. They will hold you. The Dark One shall reign. Nothing will stop it. Rorisk will love your pretty boys. I think I'll loan you all to him.\" \"No, I won't allow you to do that.\" \"Did you know I had you altered? I won't have to wait long for these. They're probably capable of siring children now. I'll have them stimmed and try them with females of other species until I find one cross-fertile. You obviously did. It should be a very interesting process. Now, what is the best way to do this? Ah, I have it. You three put these chains on, or I will kill your father.\" Turning the weapon on Gallant was a mistake. He charged it. He expected to die, but Hensk would never get another shot off. His sons would kill him. He wondered how he'd found them. He felt the shot. Clete held on against the storm of emotion. He had to get through to the brother who was the source of it. \"Kill him! Do it now. Do it, Lane. Think about who he is. What he is. What he did to Dad. Kill him.\" \"Clete, I--\" \"DO IT!\" \"Yes. For my father.\" \"All right. Now, you check Dutch. I'll... Oh, damn. Lane, try to get over the changes. Past them. Whatever. I need you. They're both alive, but that's all I know.\" \"Go. They're not settling. It's uncertain. Dad. Help Dad. I'll... check Dutch. Medunit. Get unit. Call Alice. She'll--\" \"ALICE! Alice, help me!\" Clete said thank you many times in the not quite hour that seemed like many. Most of the thanks were to his mother. He knew when Lane began to regain consciousness and was beside him with a nourishing broth she'd taught him to make when he opened his eyes. \"Fishing trip. Vacation. Some vacation. Drink.\" \"Clete?\" \"Check your memories, Lane. They're both going to make it. Good thing I ran out of things to read and got into Mom's medical texts.\" \"Dad's in trance.\" \"Yeah. I used the medunit on him to help him along. Dutch knocked the blaster down just enough. Missed his head. Ah, Dutch is coming around. I'm in love with Alice. Aren't I, Sweetheart? She came. Just... materialized around us. Left Hensk outside. Still there I guess. Drink the rest. It's a good vitamin and mineral mix with more calories than you'd think. Got to get to Dutch. He'll wake up screaming for Dad.\" \"Let him know he saved him. Fastest move I've ever seen anyone make. Other than Dad.\" \"Yeah. Other than Dad. Later.\" Clete walked into Dutch's room and took his hand. He forced himself to calm. Dutch wasn't even fully conscious yet and he was already desperately worried. \"Dad's alive! He'll make it! Take it easy. You saved him. He's hurt, but he'll live.\" \"I couldn't let him die, Clete. I... love him so much.\" \"That is obvious. Dutch, you moved faster than humanly possible. Much faster.\" \"I've always been fast. They say Mom was.\" \"No, Dutch. We've been training together for weeks. You never moved at anything like that speed. You may be as fast as Dad. How's your head?\" \"Brother empath, you know. Thumping. Tell me the story.\" \"You hit the barrel and he creamed you with the stock.\" \"Hensk?\" \"Lane took the weapon and killed him. Wasn't easy. He finally went all cool and did it. Said, \"For my father.\" Went clear out afterward. Pretty heavy change, I guess. Surprised he held up as long as he did. He went dizzy as soon as that creep came out of the trees.\" \"Weird, Clete. Didn't that guy know it wouldn't work? If Dad hadn't escaped, he wouldn't have us. If he didn't have us, Hensk couldn't take us.\" \"I don't think he cared. Dutch, all he wanted was to have Dad beg for us. He planned on killing him anyway. Just wanted him to grovel at his feet.\" \"And he did.\" \"For us. Offered himself up in bondage in exchange, then tried to give his life. Yeah. Tried. He charged straight in. I felt him intend to die. He was too scared for us to think. If he died, Lane wouldn't exist. I'd still be at home. You'd still be in a Fed school.\" \"Would we? Or do we sort of exist in our own timestream? We took Lane's mother to Dad. What if... What if I couldn't... get her? Would he have just disappeared from between us?\" \"No answers, Dutch. Maybe it was always supposed to happen this way. As for his mother, she was trying desperately to break through. Never felt anyone... thing, whatever, want someone like she wanted Dad.\" \"Even I could feel it. Well, now what?\" \"We wait for Dad to wake up surprised to wake up.\" \"Yeah, the nicest kind of surprise. How… \" \"Pretty bad. He'll be under awhile.\" Gallant was as surprised as Clete expected. He made sure they were all leaning over him, right where he'd see them as soon as he opened his eyes, but he almost landed on him when the rush of relief hit him. \"You're all here.\" \"Yes. And so are you. Hensk isn't. The last one is gone, Dad. Lane 'remembered' you telling him the code and blew the ship. Dutch yelped and we lit out. Said he felt something.\" \"Where are we, Clete?\" \"Ask Lane. He set the coordinates.\" \"Ophidus sector. Nice and quiet.\" \"My home world is near here.\" \"That's why it's quiet. Safest place I could think of.\" \"OK. Enough. Sleep. You're exhausted.\" \"Not yet, Clete. How?\" \"Seems Dutch inherited more than your good looks. He moves fast.\" \"Who killed Hensk?\" \"I did.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"I'm not, but I didn't enjoy it.\" \"Good. I'm afraid I would have.\" \"Damn it, Dad. Sleep!\" \"Yes, Clete, and well. But hugs first. Dutch?\" \"Wow, first even. Sleep, Dad. We love you.\" He did. Soundly. For six days. Strangely, it was almost two full days longer than he'd tranced. He deserved it. He'd spent his life pursuing the servants of the Dark One he'd allowed into the universe. He'd still run into them now and again, but he could reverse any damage they did and run. He knew they would all be destroyed. Now he was truly free to begin fighting the Dark One himself. **** Dutch didn't know how he knew what the sudden shock had been, but he did. He ran out of his room yelling. \"Lane! Something's happened to Dad! Damn! Clete! Lane's out cold! Bring him! We've got to find Dad!\" They found him deep in Alice beside a small pool of clear water. Dutch wasn't sure how he'd found him either. He'd just run in the direction that 'felt' right, but he'd been to the pool before. \"He came to the pool, Dutch. I could swear... Dutch, I looked for this the other day. I swear it wasn't--\" \"There are a lot of odd things in this ship, Clete. Lane's told me about a few of them. He even told me where some of them were. I didn't find a meadow he talked about either. He's out cold too. Doesn't seem to be... Clete, he has a sword in his hand. He's holding it tight, but it's too cold for me to touch. Both shoulders of his shirt just crumbled when I moved him.\" \"Like they were dipped in liquid nitro. Dutch, he's ice cold.\" \"His hearts are beating steady.\" \"He's coming around.\" \"Dad! Dad, wake up! What happened?\" \"Hello. Did you hear them?\" \"Hear?\" \"The voices, Dutch. The music. I followed it here, then... NO! I don't want to be... Too late. I already gave my oath. Made the choice. Did it ten thousand years ago. Never expected to have it made official. I hate being drafted!\" \"You may hate being drafted, but you're extremely proud and rather overawed at the moment.\" \"Too accurate, Clete. My shoulders hurt. How's Lane?\" \"Coming around. Could you please give us an explanation?\" \"Someone, who called himself my father-in-law, just knighted me. Informed me I was Knight Hero and had been chosen to protect this universe. Said I'd been doing it long enough to prove I was capable of it. Hello, Lane, I think I just met your grandfather.\" He kept them with him for more than a year. Taught them and trained them to fight at his side. Laughed with them and shouted at them. And learned to love them too well. Not long after he nearly lost Dutch to a horror even he couldn't have survived, he took them to Dutch's universe, where it didn't exist, and left them on the Curie. Captain Merris was rather surprised, but promised to get them into the academy. He hunted Telas. He had a gift he wanted him to give them. He returned to his own universe aching with the pain of farewell.",

      "content": "Chapter Three Lane handed his captain his resignation and waited while he read it. \"I must say, this is something I would never have expected, Lieutenant.\" \"I know, Sir. It's necessary or I wouldn't do it.\" \"You're a fine officer. I hate to lose you, but I wish you every success. When do you want this to become effective?\" \"The day after tomorrow, Sir.\" \"Very well, Lieutenant. I will so enter it. Would you like me to order transport for you?\" \"No, Sir, that will take care of itself.\" \"The day after tomorrow.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Lane walked out of the lift just as the blip appeared on the tech's screen. That was as far as his future memory could be trusted. He intended to change everything he remembered after it. \"Captain, we have a ship on long range scanners. I'm trying to establish communications, but I haven't received a response.\" \"Any information on the type of craft?\" \"No, Sir.\" \"Captain, you won't receive a response. That ship doesn't belong here. I know how it got here and can get it back. The occupant is dying and needs my assistance. I ask that you transport me aboard at maximum range.\" \"I would like more information, Mr. Gallant.\" \"Just Lane, Captain. He needs me. That ship is my transport. It's weaponless and, at the moment, defenseless.\" \"Lane, if this request came from anyone else, I'd probably deny it. Will you notify me when you're safely aboard?\" \"Yes, Captain, I will.\" The captain stood and walked over to the young man who had so recently been one of his finest officers. He shook his hand. \"Take care of yourself. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say you will be missed.\" A chorus of affirmation from the other members of the bridge crew followed his words. Lane smiled at the people he'd known and worked with for three years, some of them longer. \"You'll hear from me again, Captain, and some of you, I shall see again. Good journeys to you all.\" He turned and left the bridge. It had hurt to resign the fleet, but he knew the time had come, had known it would come. He was ready, but it still hurt and there was another goodbye that was going to be even harder. The transporter chief was his best friend and wasn't going to just let him beam out of his life. \"Lane, I want to know what's going on.\" \"Mick, it's time for me to start work in the family business. I'm needed. You know how it is with me. I've seen things coming. That ship out there is the beginning of a series of events that must be changed. I can't change them as an officer in the fleet. I have to be outside the rules.\" \"We're going to lose two other officers too, aren't we? You're going to get your brothers.\" \"Mick, are you sure you don't see the future?\" Mick smiled. It was an old joke. One that they'd shared since they had become friends three years before. \"Take care of yourself and keep in touch or I'll hunt you down and break your arm.\" \"I'll be in touch, Mick. Good journeys.\" \"Good journeys.\" Lane smiled at the closest friend he'd ever had, other than his brothers and father, as the transporter hummed into function. He would keep in touch with him. If he survived the next ten minutes. He started moving as soon as he materialized. The beam hit the place he had been. \"I'm here to help! I know where you're from! I can save your life and get you back! Don't you think this ship has enough--\" He dove behind the console. \"Damage without you shooting up the bridge! My name's Lane!\" That had been too close. \"Yours is Pethnar. I can see--\" He dashed across an open space. \"The future! If you don't kill me, we both have one!\" He waited a few moments, then slowly stood with his hands in the air. \"That's better. See, no weapons. First we need to cancel the self-destruct. I can get you home, if you'll just let me.\" The man nodded, then folded. Lane raced for the engine room. He had a very short time to cancel the self-destruct. He grabbed the cutter out of his pocket and ripped a panel off. He clipped a connector and yanked off another panel. He pulled out a circuit board and ran back to the bridge. He dove under the central computer console and clipped two more connectors, scrambled up and hit the sequence on the pilot's board. The self-destruct stopped ticking. He'd have taken time for a sigh of relief if he'd been able to afford it. He pulled his pilfered medical supplies out and went to work on the severely injured anthropoid. He wished his former captain would give him a few minutes. The constant beep of the communications console was a distraction. He reached up with one hand, opened a channel, said, \"I'm real busy. Call you back,\" and snapped it closed. It stopped beeping. He took time for his sigh of relief. He'd made it. The young man would live. He held back the dizziness and carried him to a cabin. He struggled back to the bridge and opened a channel. They were waiting. \"Hello, Captain. I'm all right, just had a great deal to do. I've saved the pilot, but it was close. I want to report you're short some medical equipment.\" \"You don't sound all right, Lane. Are you sure? I don't suppose that ship has visual capabilities. We'd like to see you.\" \"Ordinarily it does, but it's going to take a bit of repair. I'm just out of breath. I've been moving pretty fast. I have an operable ship and am about to get underway. Safe journeys, Captain. Thanks for standing by. Give my best to the crew. Parth ship Elpeth out.\" \"Lane, wait! The medical supplies will be listed as humanitarian aid to injured lifeforms. Wouldn't want to add a negative postscript to an otherwise perfect record. Besides, I already filed it. You know how I hate to recall closed files. Federation ship Omaki out. Lane smiled, then groaned as his head spun. He forced himself to relax and let his consciousness float above the shifting images in his mind. He had changed the future. He would wait until the images settled, then see if it had been enough. Lane pushed aside the future memory that was no longer true and followed the one he'd created with the change. He moved the injured young man to a bed, then sat down beside him and waited for him to open his eyes. \"Hello, Pethnar. I can feel you trying to communicate, but I'm not getting anything but your name and a few disconnected images. My dad is the real telepath in the family. Nod if you want me to take you home. I thought so. I know how you got here and I can get you back. I don't think you'll be in too much trouble. Your dad's going to be too happy to see you. You rest. I'll get steering and navigation back on line. Should be back in your own universe in a few hours.\" Lane started on the repairs. The bridge looked bad, but the damage Pethnar had done while shooting at him was mostly superficial. The real problem would be in rebuilding the defensive system. He checked the seal on the patch Pethnar had made. It looked good. He was glad he'd been able to save him. Anybody who had worked as hard as he had to survive deserved to make it. **** \"Hi, you look better. Just in time to help me clear some of this out of the way.\" Lane watched Pethnar kick a crumpled strut with a jagged end. \"Yeah. It put a nasty hole in you. Take it easy. I fixed the hole, but you lost a lot of blood. I do need you to sit on this piece while I move this one. The minute I took the weight off, it would fly up and try to take my head off.\" Pethnar grinned and made dusting motions and a bit of a show of sitting very carefully on the beam Lane had indicated. Lane laughed and removed a mass of metal from beside him. \"Good. One end. Slide down it and let it rise slowly. All right. Now we can get the rest of this out of the way. Our bow is unstrung. You don't understand the reference? Well, the weight on both ends of the beam bowed it across the debris in the middle. There was an ancient weapon that used a piece of wood... Ah, you get it now.\" The defensive shields were put back on line and Lane set course for the doorway between the universes. Pethnar had come through it by accident and it had saved his life. All Lane could do was go back through and hope the patrol that had attacked Pethnar was gone. He was sure they were. He didn't see them in his future, but he knew things could change. He used things in ship construction record to get the sample needed for his translator and practiced the language, not just words he would say. **** \"Parthan ship Elpeth calling Parth. Come in, please.\" \"Parth control. Who is this?\" \"My name's Lane Gallant. The prince is on board and safe. This ship was attacked and he was injured, but he's all right now. We'd like a pick up. He made an emergency patch and it's a good one, but we don't want to tempt fate by trying it out on a surface landing.\" \"We've got you. Establish an orbit. The king just ran out of here. I'd say he was on his way. Thank you. We're mighty fond of our prince. Parth control out.\" Lane laughed and thumped Pethnar on the back. Pethnar grinned at him. \"I told you he wouldn't be mad. Just make sure you tell him you won't be taking any more experimental ships for a joy ride. I imagine he's going to keep one hand on you for a few days just to make sure you're really here.\" He laughed at Pethnar's expression. \"Yeah, overprotective. Probably why you took the ship in the first place. Thought so. I'll do what I can to help. You really saved your own life. I just brought the medical equipment on board. Don't shake your head at me. I didn't slap a patch on that wall with a hole in my side and I didn't outmaneuver the bunch that attacked this ship.\" \"Parth ship Denvith calling Elpeth. Come in, please.\" \"Elpeth here. That was quick.\" \"The king was in a hurry. We're going to take Elpeth aboard. It'll be a tight fit. Want us to send a pilot?\" \"No, the prince is as good as anybody you could send and I'm fair help. Give us speed and course. We'll be there.\" Pethnar grinned and shook his head. Lane was much more than fair help. He was better than anyone he'd ever seen. He just wished he could really say thank you to him, but he couldn't. He was telepathic with his own race, as were the majority of his people. They were beginning to adapt to it and he was one of those 'more advanced.' He no longer agreed with that designation. He had never really wished he could speak, until he hadn't been able to communicate with the ships that attacked him. When he hadn't answered, they had decided he was hostile. Now, he wished it again. He 'touched' his father, showed him Lane and his feeling for him. Lane gave the pilot's chair to Pethnar and took the operations console. He began reading off course and speed corrections. The little ship entered the hold of the big transport and landed with barely a bump. They got an all clear and opened the hatch. Pethnar grinned at Lane. His father was on his way across the hold at a dead run. He would tell him thank you for them both. **** \"Your Majesty, I really do need to go back.\" \"Call me Jessar, Lane. I think of you as a good friend of the family. Pethnar agrees. He really wants you to stay.\" \"I'd like to, but I can't. I do need to ask a large favor though. I need a ship. A small one. The doorway between the universes was a tight fit for the Elpeth. I also ask you remove all record of its coordinates. It's a secret that must be carefully kept.\" \"How did you know about it?\" \"My father created it. It's our way to visit home.\" \"Who is your father?\" \"Gallant. That's another secret that must be carefully kept. For his safety and mine. He has enemies who would be very happy to use me to get to him. I probably shouldn't have told you.\" \"Sir, we are most honored you have trusted us. Pethnar says he'll miss you, but do it your way. I agree. I have just the ship for you. You'll like her. I do. Panbath! Order Lissa prepared. Make sure she's fully stocked. Have her ready by... Is dawn soon enough? Dawn tomorrow. Make sure all the new equipment is functioning properly. Put Ardth in charge of the preparations. Now, I think a party is in order, don't you?\" **** Lane was delighted. The little ship was an absolute jewel. She had been the king's personal ship. She was sleek, clean and tastefully appointed. She was also faster than anything else her size. She was set up for a crew of three, perfect for his needs. He wasn't sure how he felt about her extensive armament, but knew it would be needed. Her shields were good, but he would make major improvements in them. He would also make her capable of things no other ship in the universe could do, but for that he would need his brothers. He smiled widely when his comm to the fleet ship was answered. Clete's 'range' kept getting longer. \"Hi, Clete. I need you. I'm sorry to give you such short notice.\" \"It'll take me a few hours. My captain won't be happy. I'll give him my resignation and say my farewells. I knew this would come someday. Do you want me to message Dutch?\" \"Yes. Tell him to kiss the ladies farewell. We'll pick him up in three days.\" \"That's some ship. Not many could get there that fast.\" \"She's a gem, Clete, but as soon as we get Dutch, we need to do some modifications. We'll be doing most of them ourselves. Say hello to Godfather for me.\" \"I will. Ride our shadow. We've been running nervous. See you soon.\" Lane tucked under the big starship and took a nap. He'd been running nervous too. Things were very tense close to neutral space. He was awakened by the comm call. \"Nelson calling Lissa. Come in, please.\" \"Lissa here. Hello, Telas. It's good to see you.\" \"I'm pleased to see you too. Clete's preparing to beam over. May I inquire why you've chosen to resign?\" \"It's time to carry on the family tradition.\" \"Understood. I've prepared something that should be of assistance. Clete's bringing it. It's coded. I don't believe you'll have difficulty in finding the key. If you see Alice, give her my regards.\" Lane smiled. He knew what the key was. Telas had made sure he 'realized' it, rather than 'remembered' it. He knew he'd enjoy it. \"I shall. Good journeys, Telas.\" \"Safe journeys to you. Say hello to Dutch for me. Clete is transporting now.\" \"Hi, Lane. What a mix. I get the pleasure, but what's got you so worried?\" \"I'll explain my emotional state once we're underway, Clete. We've got some changes to make and not a lot of time. Get on ops. I'll take con.\" \"Done.\" Clete grinned widely when Dutch transported aboard and pulled both his brothers into a hug. He'd felt Lane's tightly controlled impatience and hunger to be near him growing. His own wasn't quite as strong, but it was close. He'd actually felt it when Dutch got the message they were coming. \"I've missed you guys. Clete knows how much of an understatement that is. Guess this means we've got work to do. Captain said hello. Didn't even act surprised when I resigned. Said he knew it would come eventually.\" \"What's the relief I feel?\" \"Well, Clete, there are two lovely ladies who think I should make a choice... \" Lane and Clete burst into laughter. Dutch hadn't changed. Neither had his pleasure in their laughter. Clete pulled them into another hug. It was what they both really wanted. \"Clete, pull that info up. Let's see what he gave us. The key is Wabbit.\" Clete and Dutch smiled widely. It was a story Gallant had told while Telas was with them and it did seem rather appropriate. Lane returned their smiles. It felt so very good to be together again. The Gallant boys were on the loose and the universe was about to change. **** \"It's all here, Lane. Everything. Specs, power requirements, circuit diagrams. Everything. Some things we won't be able to use. They tap a source of energy that doesn't exist in this universe.\" \"Not so, Dutch. We'll tap through the doorway. He'll know it's us. We have to be able to travel. Too much depends on it. I remember us doing it.\" \"This is going to take work. And we'll have to do it all ourselves. We'll build inside Lissa's shell. Start with the dimensional matrix. Give us room to work. Need things. Hmm... One of the nonaligned worlds as base. That means we'll need credits.\" \"We'll do runs as a courier in the Amarri system.\" \"Oh, brother! Lane, that is one hot war you want to put us in the middle of. Blockade runners have a short life expectancy.\" \"He's right, Lane. The pay is high because so few live to collect it.\" \"I know, Clete, but we need the credit.\" \"There's more to it than that. I can feel it.\" \"That's the problem with having an empath around. All right. It's iffy. I've got multiple images of the future. The packets and passenger we carry could end that war. If we get through. Getting through will depend on the shields. Ending the war will depend on you.\" \"Uh, oh, Clete, I think you're in trouble. Even I could feel the worry in that statement.\" \"Yes. Let's get to work on the shields. We'll need them to present ourselves for employment.\" \"Lane, you haven't told me what I'm supposed to do yet. You dread telling me. I'm not moving til I know.\" \"Dutch, get started. We'll be with you in a few minutes.\" \"Now, wait a minute!\" \"Dutch, if he doesn't kill me, we'll be there.\" \"Oh. All right. Clete, remember, he knows how it turns out. He can't help it. Count to ten thousand. I don't think ten will be enough.\" **** Dutch walked onto the bridge and knew he hadn't changed things yet because Lane was expecting him. He still intended to make one though. \"Lane, I've had it. It's like a polar zone between you two. I can't function in this atmosphere. I'm freezing. I can't stay out of it any longer. I want to know what's going on.\" \"Dutch, it'll work out. It's necessary. He'll get through it. It's going to be rough. Be there when he needs you. He'll even forgive me someday.\" \"Some explanation. Dammit, Lane, I want more!\" \"I asked him, no, told him to do something that goes against every instinct he has. Everything he is. I'm counting on him to finish the job right. If he does, the war will end. If he can't do it, it's going to pull more systems in, then the Empire, then the Federation.\" \"It's why you pulled us out. You saw it coming.\" \"Yes. I stalled it. I rescued the young man piloting the experimental ship that would have been the trigger. Even after he engaged the self-destruct, there would have been enough left to... I hoped that would be it, but it wasn't. There's only one image that leads out of interstellar warfare. It depends on Clete making a woman who fears him love him. Love him so much she'll do anything for him. Love him enough to live for him.\" \"I'll get back to work. I'll be there, Lane, but you be there too. He won't get through it without you. You understand. I can only care.\" \"He won't want me. I don't remember being there.\" \"Good. I'm making this change. Same way I helped make the first one when you thought you were going bye-bye.\" Lane stared at him with his mouth open. \"Dad didn't need much, Lane. Just a reminder you'd already lived with the pain long enough.\" \"Dutch, you're amazing.\" \"Yeah. And cute too.\" **** Clete raised an eyebrow at Lane, but he just smiled. He hoped he was right. Dutch was getting very irritated with the Chair of the Planetary Assembly. \"I think the fact we're here is reference enough! If we couldn't get through the blockade, we'd be space dust!\" \"Dutch, calm down. I don't think the chairman meant it quite that way. He doesn't know who we are. It's a little hard to trust strangers who drop in and say, 'Give us your secrets to carry,' in the middle of a war.\" \"You're right, Lane. Being a fleet officer spoiled me. I got used to people knowing I was loyal, dependable, trustworthy, and well-trained as soon as they saw the uniform.\" \"You were a Federation Fleet officer?\" \"We all were, Gen. Lane decided you needed help, then he decided we should help too. We're here. Now let us help.\" \"I shall make arrangements for you to begin immediately. Please, accept our hospitality. Quarters will be assigned until we have a mission for you.\" \"Thank you, Gen.\" As soon as they left the council hall, Lane started to laugh. Dutch grinned. \"Nothing like telling an old lady you're a Boy Scout to convince her to let you carry her packages. Now, let's find where they keep the pretty ladies on this world.\" Clete burst into laughter too. Dutch thought it sounded wonderful and his grin widened. He left them leaning against a wall laughing. They'd catch up. **** Lane warned Dutch another hit was coming. He just couldn't dodge them all. \"Shields full.\" \"Eighty percent max!\" Lissa rocked with the force of the blast, but Lane got her steadied fast. They had a long way to go and he was trying to make a change. But he couldn't find one that didn't lead to a sudden end of the path. \"Make that sixty. Lane, we've got to shoot back. Clete, take over ops. I'll take the gun. Give it to me on manual, Lane.\" \"I don't-- Damn! He's already gone.\" \"He's right, Lane. Incoming. Aft shield down. Compensating. We're at thirty-two percent. We don't get that fighter off our tail, we've-- Shields off! Go, Dutch! YES! Shields up. We've got another one. Not anymore. Damn! I hope he knows what he's doing. Evasive, Lane! Dutch, routine A on three, two, one... NOW!\" The little ship had never fired back before. She'd run the blockade time after time and never fired a shot. This time they'd been waiting. The admiral had decided to take her out. Half a fleet could have gotten through the holes left in the blockade. He'd sent every ship with any kind of a chance at catching her after her. Half a fleet did get through. A fleet of cargo ships. The desperately needed supply ships opened a hole a little wider and sped through it toward the planet. The little ship had done her job and the admiral had lost his. She'd also reduced the strength of the blockade by eighteen ships. \"Nice work, Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Aren't you going to say anything, Lane?\" \"Do you really want me to say it?! I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You're right. We wouldn't have made it without the gun. I was hoping for a change. I guess... I was just hoping we could avoid killing anyone.\" \"So was I. Lane, we had to do it. The people on the planet need those medical supplies desperately. For every life lost up here, a thousand will be saved on Amarri. If it had been weapons they were trying to get through, I'd have told them to stuff it. Nice piloting.\" \"Ahem.\" \"Yeah, Clete, I know. You're the one who made us practice until every zig and zag was perfect. Worked too. I knew exactly where I'd be after every maneuver. Now, how long til touchdown? I've got dates and I need a bath.\" \"Twins again, Dutch?\" \"Nope. Triplets.\" \"I don't suppose you'd want to share.\" \"Clete, you've got to be kidding!\" \"I am. Touchdown in twelve minutes.\" Laire wasn't extremely young, but she was young to have been given the task of seeking the one ally the assembly was sure would end the war. She was pleased they thought her the right choice and didn't disagree with the assembly on that point, but she really wished there was another world that offered as much hope of it. She put aside her irritation at that and worked on the proposal. Then her office door opened and her level of irritation went up another notch. She didn't like being interrupted and didn't want her office cleaned, but it was fourday, the time scheduled for her lunch and Missa had a schedule too. She almost wished she did want lunch. Missa's mother and hers were old friends and she'd known her since she was a child. \"You're so lucky, Laire. A tenday with the three of them.\" \"I'm not looking forward to it.\" \"What?! You're about to spend ten days with three beautiful, blond, eligible men and you're not looking forward to it?\" \"Unlike you, Missa, I have other things on my mind. They're just three young hotshots. I'm not particularly interested.\" \"Those 'hotshots' are the most brilliant, talented, gorgeous hunks of pure male ever to hit this planet. Curly hair and gray eyes and voices that make your heart thump. Especially the little one.\" \"Missa, one hundred eighty-five centimeters is not little.\" \"See what I mean? Even you've noticed them. But you're right, Dutch only looks little when he's standing next to Clete. Kerith asked Dutch how tall he was. He said they're 'stair steps,' exactly five centimeters difference. Lane in the middle at one ninety. How'd you know how tall Dutch was?\" \"Those three young men have been the predominant topic of conversation since they landed here. If anyone had gotten them on a scale, I'd have overheard their weights too! I'm sorry, Missa. I'm just bored with the subject.\" \"All work. Laire, you worry me. You're either in conference or up to your ears in communiqués. You don't go anywhere but department social functions and you don't really socialize at them. Just work, work, work.\" \"We're at war. I have a job to do. Now, if you've finished stirring up dust on the pretext of cleaning my office, I'll get back to it. I'm not looking forward to it, but I must take an offer of alliance to Bernis, another bunch of swaggering males.\" Dutch sat down on the bridge and shook his head. Their passenger was not the friendly sort. \"She's an iceberg. Brr. Like a marble statue. Beautiful, but no feeling.\" \"That's the problem, Dutch. The feeling's there, but she's got it locked up. She'll never reach the bernisi. She's got everything they respect buried. She can't stop this war the way she is.\" \"Lane, I'm glad I'm not Clete. I get frostbite when I talk to her. She's an iron maiden, smooth metal outside and sharp knives within.\" \"Yes, and I've told Clete to step in and pull the door closed. They're going to cut each other apart, but Clete will bleed and bandage her wounds.\" \"She's broken and you told him to fix her.\" \"Violently.\" \"Oh, shit.\" Lane counted lives that wouldn't be lost and ached while he fixed the dinner tray. Clete, of course, felt it and was hovering right outside the galley when he finished it. \"Take this to her.\" \"Lane, she's revolted by me. Afraid of me. I can handle the revulsion, the fear--\" \"Clete, it's not you she's afraid of. It's herself. She's convinced herself she's made of stone. She's afraid of a crack. If Bernis allies with Amarri, the war will end instantly. The Fed or the Empire might win a war with the bernisi, but no one else would and everyone knows it. Her job is to convince the chief lord Amarri is worthy to be an ally and there's only one way to do that. She must 'burn with the fire of the hills.' Can she succeed the way she is?\" \"No. Give me her dinner. Wine and two glasses. Isn't that a bit obvious?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thanks.\" Clete knew Lane was right. He reminded himself the ambassador really did want to end the war and would have given her life to accomplish it, was giving it to accomplish it, steeled himself against her feelings and knocked. \"Ambassador Kardina, I brought your dinner.\" \"Leave it outside.\" \"Not this time. This time you eat. You're not going to forget another meal. Open, or I'll let myself in.\" \"Oh, all right.\" She opened the door and looked up at him. He could feel her fear. He almost handed her the tray and ran. He didn't. He poured two glasses of wine and handed one to her. \"Now, I'm going to sit here while you eat. You want to get rid of me? Eat your dinner.\" \"I'm in the middle of some trade figures. I'll eat when I'm done with them.\" \"I'll wait.\" He watched her work. She was a dark-haired beauty. Fortyish and richly feminine, very young to carry the hopes of her world and she knew it. He pushed the wine a bit closer to her hand and smiled when she absently picked it up and drank some. He took a few sips of his. Who had made this beautiful woman fear love? Why had she locked her passions away? He pulled her glass toward him and refilled it. She lifted it and drank, then reached up and rubbed her neck. He stood and stepped behind her. \"Easy, let me rub the knots out. SIT STILL!\" He realized he was trembling. The fragrance of her was making him dizzy. He ignored her fear. He'd felt it rise after her pleasure in his touch. It was the order in which they came that gave him hope he could help her and her world. He slipped his thumbs under her collar and massaged the tight cords of fatigued muscle. He felt her pleasure then her terror, again in that order, but the terror was overwhelming his determination. If this was going to be, it must be now. She felt the change in him and stood. He loosed his powers and reached for her. He opened her emotions and crashed through her barriers. He felt her terror as her walls crashed down and it excited him, aroused him. And he hated himself for it. He destroyed the ice statue she'd created outside and found fire within. He freed himself from his own barriers and fueled it with his own. He'd never done it before. In that instant, he knew he too had feared the passion within, just as she had. Lane had chosen this way to free them both. He forgave him and lost himself in the fire of the woman in his arms. Dutch and Lane were in the galley when Clete became fire. \"Lane!\" \"Hang on, Dutch! Take my hand. We'll ride this storm. We knew it was coming. We've known what he was since we were sixteen. Remember how it was. Dad was careful, but we knew. When we all joined minds, we knew what Clete was.\" \"Yeah, but like you always say, reality is much more intense than remembering.\" \"Now it's your turn. We won't get through this unless you shield us. He'll burn us out. You're the only one who can stop that from happening.\" \"Lane, I don't know how!\" \"It's not knowing. It's being. Be who you are!\" Dutch found his barriers. He hadn't known they were there. He set his power free. He met Lane's mind with his and set him free too. Lane hadn't known he was barriered either. He'd seen his brothers', but not his own. They joined with Clete and felt him surge into completeness. Passion, intellect and power blended. Something more than the sum of its parts blazed into existence. Dutch laughed with delight in their minds. Laire traced Clete's smile with a fingertip. He'd healed her and she hadn't known she was injured, but the smile was gently ironic and she was rather sure she hadn't been the only one healed. \"What are you?\" \"I'm not sure, Laire. Half human, half something more. Our father isn't from this universe. You got caught in, no, caused the breakthrough. You freed me. Freed us all. You're very special. Now I know why you walled yourself away. No one you'd met ever responded. They were half-passioned. Involved only with their bodies.\" \"Yes! I didn't know why. There was something wrong with me. I wanted more, more than they had. I loved a man deeply. He left me. He feared me.\" \"Laire, you burn with the fire of the hills.\" \"Clete, that's not fair!\" \"No, but it's real. You mustn't hide what you are. Must be who you are. It's the only way to win them and end the horror of war on your world and you want that more than anything else.\" \"Show me, Clete. Show me how to be who I am.\" Bernis, the home of the oldest species and civilization humans had ever found, was an odd world. It had a cycle of geologic upheaval that shouldn't have been stable, but was. It was also completely predictable. The bernisi had adapted to it and that adaptation was nearly as odd as the cycle. Many studies of both had been done by scholars in the Fed, but they'd found no answers. The bernisi had been tolerant of the studies, but not surprised by the outcome. The bernisi had been the first species humans had contacted that looked human and a real shock. They'd told them there were thousands upon thousands, but they'd never learned why either. They hadn't given humans a great deal more information about the galaxy. They'd stopped exploring a very long time before, if they ever had, but they did tell them a bit about other peoples they'd find nearby and that they'd been anticipating meeting them for a long time. They liked the Fed. Laire went over everything she knew about the bernisi one more time, as she faced the entry to the Hall of Lords. She smiled when she thought of how her view of that knowledge had changed over the last few days. \"Back me up, boys.\" \"Such a beautiful back.\" \"Dutch, you're incorrigible.\" \"No, but very encourageable.\" \"Clete, help me keep myself open. Don't let me get lost in trade figures and treaty negotiations.\" \"You won't. Bank the fires. We'll be standing at your back. Feel us there. Feel me there.\" \"How do I look?\" \"Ravishing.\" Lane grinned at her. She was surprised. She hadn't expected him to say it. \"Clete, doesn't have all the passion, Laire, just the power. Frankly, you knock my socks off.\" She laughed in delight at the very old phrase and took Clete's arm; beautiful lady in black, escorted by the warriors in white. Dutch winked at Lane and pulled their minds together. They became fire. The warriors at the door dropped back instinctively. Dutch and Lane hit the huge iron doors and they crashed open. The Warrior Lords stirred. They growled low in their throats. These were men and the woman burned. She won them in that moment. They were hers. The Chief Lord knelt before her. \"Lady, the warriors of Bernis will aid in your world's battle. Command us. We serve your fire.\" The warriors roared their approval. Laire stretched out her arms and exulted in her triumph. They returned to Amarri with an escort of bernisi ships. They had no difficulty getting through. The blockade dissolved around them. Tar a'Reth h'Mun, the chief lord, contacted Lissa and drily noted his computer had asked for assistance with the code the blockade fleet used. It just couldn't find a key to unencrypt the yelps on their comm channel. Laire was still giggling when they landed. Three days later, Lane dropped in the middle of the hall in the building that housed the Planetary Assembly. Clete moved people out of his way and Dutch went through the ones in his. They knew what was wrong. The war was over and the future was changing. \"No! Don't call med! Let us take care of him. Clete, clear this hall. I'm going in. It's bad.\" \"I can feel it. Do it fast or I'll be down there with him. OUT! Everyone out! NOW! MOVE! CLEAR THIS CORRIDOR!\" The guards on the assembly chamber door looked at each other, then Clete, and went inside the chamber. If Clete wanted the corridor clear, they weren't going to argue. One person came out of the chamber, Laire. \"They sued for peace. Sent an apology. Terrible misunderstanding. Terribly sorry. Hope you aren't angry we killed several thousand of your people. Oops.\" \"Yeah, oops. Look, Laire, keep everyone away. We need a few minutes. Lane's riding the winds of change.\" She went back in the chamber and brought out the chief and two other bernisi lords. They each moved into a corridor. Laire stood over them. No one would disturb them. If the council had to spend the night in the chamber, they would. Dutch opened his eyes and smiled. \"Can't be heaven. You're the most real woman I've met. Find us a room. This is going to take a while. Feel silly in the hall.\" Laire opened the first door along the central corridor and ordered the occupants out. It was the Assembly Chair's office. There was a small apartment behind it. Dutch walked. The bernisi carried Lane and Clete. They didn't ask what was happening, but Laire told them what Clete had said. Tar nodded. \"They're the sons of the Fire Lord. We knew them when they came into the Hall. They serve all life. It's an honor to guard them. And to serve them.\" Laire was still thinking over all of what Tar had said when the Assembly Chair asked permission to enter his office. She granted it, then winced when she realized that was exactly how she'd put it as she walked from the comm to the door to open it for him. \"Laire, it's rather embarrassing to have to ask to enter my own office.\" \"Chair Firth, I'm sorry. They need time. Your office was closest.\" \"Keep it as long as they need it. I just need some notes I made on my data pad this morning If you want me, I'll be sitting on the floor outside the door, hashing out a trade agreement with the chief lord.\" Laire was still laughing when he left. He was a very happy man. Her whole world was happy and she knew that the three in the apartment behind her were why. She looked up from the papers she was working on when they came out together. \"You absolutely glow. What happened?\" \"You changed the future. Lane's been learning the new one. It's never been this rough before. Thanks for your help.\" \"Dutch, Tar recognized you. He called you the 'Sons of the Fire Lord.' He said you serve all life.\" \"Sounds like he's met Dad. Lane?\" \"Not necessarily Tar, Dutch. The bernisi are a unique species. They've evolved through the rise and fall of civilization on their planet dozens of times. Part of that evolution is a racial memory. If they met Dad or us in their past in some way that was significant to them, all of them would remember. I'm not thinking straight! Laire, you didn't hear that.\" \"You can travel in time?!\" \"Not yet, but we will.\" \"Oh... my. What happened? I know you 'remember' your future and get dizzy if something changes, but… Why did it flatten all three of you this time? Please tell me, Lane.\" \"All right. Sit down on the couch with me. I'll tell you what you really did. Your little war wasn't destined to stay little. The Empire was on the verge of coming in. They would have chosen what they saw as the strongest side. The Federation would have rushed to the aid of Amarri. It would have spread. Neutral space would have become a war zone. Trillions would have died as world after world became a battleground. No one could have stayed out of it. Except, perhaps, the bernisi. Neutrality wouldn't have existed, but I don't think even the durcassins are foolish enough to attack them. I didn't see what would happen after a certain point.\" \"Dutch! Calm down! It's changed.\" \"Yeah, Clete. Lane…\" \"Dutch, all the explored galaxy would have been at war. I wouldn't have left the fleet. You two wouldn't have either. Laire, you stopped that. You ended the war and the Empire has no reason to come here. You are the savior of the known galaxy.\" \"No, Clete is. And you and Dutch. But I'd be delighted to accept the title of helper. Yes. I like that. Gallant helper. It has a nice ring to it.\" \"You helped a new branch of the family business. Starting small, but growing.\" \"What do you mean by starting small, Dutch?\" \"All we've done is save one little piece of one galaxy. And evidently us. Dad saves universes. He usually saves his own, but he's saved this one once or twice as part of saving... everything. We know he's been here several times, though after what I think of as this time. I'm confusing you.\" \"Yes, but keep going. I have illusions I'll sort it out.\" \"The first visit was when Mom decided to have me. He said he didn't stand a chance once she'd made up her mind. She was the second Athena.\" \"Family joke, Laire. Three different mothers with the same name. We're half-brothers. Only Dutch was actually born here. Lane and I come from Dad's universe.\" \"How much of this is 'family business,' Clete?\" \"All of it. Your job as helper from now on is to not know anything you heard in this room.\" \"I want to tell my husband. He should know.\" \"WHAT?! What husband?!\" \"Relax, Clete, I haven't married him yet. I haven't even asked him yet. I guess I decided the minute I saw him. It just took awhile to realize it.\" \"Just who is this you want to entrust our lives to?\" \"Tar a'Reth h'Mun, Dutch.\" \"Chief Lord of Bernis.\" \"That's him. I don't think he'll mind being second choice.\" \"Second choice?\" \"Well, I don't think Clete would say yes and my previous reaction to rejection was a bit too extreme to ask on the off chance I'm wrong.\" Lane didn't tell Dutch and Clete all he'd seen when the future had changed. Dutch had pulled out while he was still following the path in his mind. He 'remembered' waiting until they reached the world where they would find much of what they needed to finish the ship. He went to the ship and Dutch and Clete started on locating things they'd need. He was deep in the control systems when Dutch arrived about two hours later. \"They're expecting us, Lane.\" \"Good. How much could you locate, Dutch?\" \"Parts, boards, raw materials, things we can adapt, maybe twenty percent. It will about use our fees from Amarri. Enough to establish a matrix. We're not going to be able to build most of it in this time, but probably enough to get to another.\" \"Where's Clete?\" \"Rock hunting. I left him in the university library pulling every piece of planetary survey information they had stored. We need some extremely rare minerals besides the one isotope that's not just rare.\" \"Was he having any luck?\" \"Yes, but not finding the minerals.\" \"Explain the grin, Dutch, or I won't have remembered why it's funny.\" \"He was sitting on the floor with some ancient hvorkin maps unrolled. They aren't delicate, but they aren't easy to keep flat either. There was a pretty student holding down each corner for him. You know Clete. He could feel they really wanted to help, so he gave them something useful to do. Most attractive paperweights I ever saw. He asked me to stay, but I told him I had something to do too.\" \"That doesn't sound like you, Dutch.\" \"Yeah, well, I couldn't resist. When I left, he was loosening his collar. He was getting real warm. I figured he should get himself out of this one. Besides, I've already got plans.\" \"I thought so. I just couldn't see you leaving if there were several lovely ladies around.\" \"I have plans for you too, Lane. You're going out to dinner.\" \"Dutch, I've got a lot of work to do.\" \"Nope. If you look, you'll see you go. I'd prefer you didn't search for the memory though. Everyone should get nice surprises. Three hours. Very casual.\" Lane realized he was running late. He'd gotten involved and the three hours had slipped away. He really didn't want to leave what he was doing, but Dutch had pulled the double promise from him. He would go to dinner and he wouldn't look into the evening's future. He wondered just how casual \"very\" was. \"Let's go.\" \"Just a minute, Dutch. Let me get shoes and a shirt. You're wearing a tux!\" \"You're fine. They're waiting.\" Dutch began pushing his protesting brother toward the hatch. Half the fun of the evening would be watching his staid brother just surrender to the silliness of the situation he was in. As soon as he got him through the hatch, the ladies helped with the pushing and they were in the transport and on their way before he got a chance to turn around and run. They helped hustle him into the restaurant too. \"Dutch, I may strangle you. This is not what I would call 'very casual.' How could you do this to me? Why didn't I remember this?\" \"It was there. One of the first images I saw in the change. You weren't looking at anything in the near future. Your mind was on the war that wouldn't happen. Relax. Oh, oh. Clete may make things a bit warm out tonight.\" Lane started to laugh. He sat in the midst of a bevy of beautiful women in evening gowns, shirtless and barefoot, his only attire the pair of faded pants he wore when he worked on the ship. The women were enjoying it as much as Dutch was. They kept dragging him onto the dance floor. He tensed and took a deep breath. At least he wasn't cold. Clete was keeping things quite warm. He was beginning to wonder how Dutch could handle the heat in his tux. Laughter became giggles when Dutch answered the thought almost as soon as he had it. \"That's it. I'm dying. Here hold this.\" Dutch handed his jacket to the pretty woman on his left and proceeded to strip to the waist. Soon, he was dressed, or undressed, to the same extent as Lane. Two of the bernisi came in shortly thereafter and the evening got strange and wild. No one in the club minded the dance floor being taken over. The friendly combat of the four beautiful warriors was the best show in town. They carried the wildness with them as they hit club after club. They ran into Clete in the early hours of the morning and laughed as the four young women with him reduced him to their state of dress. Two more bernisi joined them and they prowled the capital. The city became one wild celebration. The streets filled and the summer night rang with peeling bells. The war was over. **** Dutch did a fast lookover of physical facilities when they landed on a world that wasn't human. It had been the third Fed explorers had discovered with people that looked like them and definitely advanced enough they wouldn't damage the culture introducing themselves. The bernisi had pointed them that direction, the opposite side of Fed space, and told them there were interesting worlds there. Dutch was rather sure they wouldn't have if they didn't know they'd carefully make sure of it first. He smiled when he stepped into Lissa and headed for the bridge. He didn't need to yell or query the ship comp for his brothers' locations. He hadn't since Clete had freed them of their barriers. It was very nice not being the only one who needed to. He'd never been jealous that Clete could find them by their feel and Lane knew where they'd be, but it had been a wish he'd never expected to have granted and meant a great deal to him. \"The facilities are the best I've seen outside the Federation. They can do the exterior modifications. We've got one problem. There's a source for the element we need, but it's held by some pretty nasty people.\" \"We've got a solution to that, but he's not going to like it.\" \"Not Clete again! Lane, he's going to get real difficult to live with. We're using him. I don't like it.\" \"It's not quite the same situation. He'll need you. I won't be much help. In fact, none.\" \"You're hiding something. Something bad. I like this less and less. You expect to be... Show me.\" \"Yes, you need to know. It's going to happen soon. I'm ready for it. You need to be. Take my hand. I warn you, it's going to be bad.\" \"NO! I want it changed! I want it stopped! I won't let you! You can't do it, Lane! Please, try to find--\" \"Dutch, it's the only way I could find. You know I looked. I get through it. We get what we need. We clean up a mess. Clete ends it. Dutch, I grow stronger for it. We need what we get from it. It's my choice. I choose not to change it. Clete's coming. You'll have to get yourself under control. Accept it. This is the way I want it.\" \"I'm going to talk to Clete. We have to work this out between us. You may be overruled, Lane. This will be harder on us than you can imagine. The choice isn't only yours to make. Stay put. I'll talk to you later.\" He caught Clete before he got to the ship and told him they needed to talk. He led him to a place he could explode, a place wide open and empty. Lane would wait. He believed they would accept his decision. \"I told him we had the right to choose too, Clete. He's sure it shouldn't be changed. Truly believes changing it would negate a lot of things we accomplish. He's positive he can take it. Question is, can we. Can you?\" \"Leave me. Get as far away from me as you can and do it fast. He'll know our decision. I can feel yours. Go.\" Dutch ran for the ship. He found Lane, shoved him into an empty cabin and locked him in. He got himself locked into another and destroyed the remote for the door. He waited. Clete couldn't contain it much longer. Fury. Blind, unreasoning, fury. Rage. Dutch had a fraction of a second to recognize it, then it washed thought away. He fed it. Gave it his power. The police didn't have enough men. Brawls broke out everywhere, even in the police stations. It passed quickly. There weren't any severe injuries. The physicians marveled there weren't. Clete let Lane and Dutch out, then they went out and got drunk. They had a lot of company. Psychologists began long papers about the racial memory that had caused thousands to suddenly go berserk and attack with their bare hands. Psychics spoke of the release of the anger within. Theists preached of the fury of gods. It happened four days later. Dutch screamed in anger when he felt Lane lose consciousness, but he was a long way away. He yelled for Clete to stay with the ship. He was working very hard when he got back to Lissa. There was no point in trying to hide the pain he felt. Clete knew it and he knew he hurt just as much. Dutch let the tears he'd been holding back flow, when he laid down the tools he was holding and pulled him into his arms. \"They picked him up with a couple dozen others on the university grounds. We can't even go after him. The ship won't be ready for days. The planetary police chased them, but were afraid they'd kill the innocents. Clete, they stunned them. Loaded them like cordwood on grav carts. Carried one each as a shield. Kids mostly. Students. I got the story from a semi-hysterical secretary who saw it out a window. Slavers. They've never hit a population center before.\" \"And they won't again. Let's get the ship ready. I'm empty where he belongs. Dutch, stay close. You keep me here. Something in me wants to... break free and join him.\" \"Damn. There's a lot to this he didn't see. I feel stretched. Pulled. Like you describe. It didn't happen when we were in the fleet. We've developed some kind of bond. A gestalt. More than the sum of its parts. I could find him by the direction of the pull. I'll know when it begins. Four systems away and I'll know.\" \"I'm going to be very angry before this is over.\" \"So will I, Clete. So will I.\" Lane awoke cold and chained. He knew much more time had passed than if he'd just been stunned. The lack of a headache would have told him that if he hadn't known where he was. He was on display and being sold. He forced himself to relax. The casual handling would soon end. The unit clamped to his head would complete its scan and his price would go up, way up. He saw the blue-skinned anthropoid's eyes widen when he looked at the screen. He nearly laughed as the unit was replaced with another. When it displayed its results, the blue male ran toward the central auction area. He had just become the most valuable piece of property on the planet. It didn't take long for that person to return with another. The memory began when the technician who had run for his superior spoke. \"A perfect specimen, physically and mentally. Bidding will be heavy. A unique item of unknown origin, not of any species we've encountered before. We believe it breedable with technological assistance.\" \"Take a sample. I want the results before he's auctioned. Sale contingent upon signing a no-cloning clause. He is unique, therefore trebly valuable. Minimum to be the highest any single sale has ever brought. Curtain the area. Private showing only. Ascertain if viewers can afford him. Post test results on the central screen. I'd take him myself if he wasn't going to make the clan rich.\" Lane jerked against his chains when the obese male touched him. The male smiled. He followed his memory. It held a path to what they needed. \"I will warn you. Do not touch me again.\" \"I have decided to do the sampling myself. Call me when the curtains are in place. Have a physician standing by. He will receive his first lesson as a slave from me. He will need repair. I find I wish to see the color of his blood.\" Lane followed the memory which showed him how to distance his mind from his body. He found the link with his brothers and sheltered his mind in their caring. He returned to himself strengthened. The pain was not great. The physician was efficient. There would be no evidence of abuse when he was viewed. He was carefully cleaned. The last thing that was done was the removal of the gag. The slaver hadn't wanted his clientele to know he was selling used goods. He knew what was coming, but couldn't help fighting against the eye cover and mouthpiece. The screens before his eyes were blank. He tried to distance himself, but the disk on his forehead prevented it. He would have cried out, but the mouthpiece stopped him. He was twice branded. His owner had claimed him, and his progeny. He fainted. He awoke and his tasks began. The screens filled and his mind worked. He had no choice. He was the creative element, the intuitive circuit, of a vast machine intelligence. He felt when his body was used, but the work never ceased. Nutrients dripped into his veins. Wastes were removed by filtration of his blood. He neither slept nor rested. He was aware of all that was being done. Aware of hands and laughter. Aware of being moved and touched. Damaged and healed. Aware of what was being taken from his mind and body. He was not aware of the passage of time, his ostentatious display, nor of the price paid for each integration performed, each touch felt. The one who had purchased the unique item at a price no other could have paid stroked him and smiled. He was an excellent example of why he could pay more than anyone else. He had recouped his price in a very few days. He invited his guests to enjoy themselves and ordered menial slaves to serve them. He would enjoy their envy. He kept a physician nearby. He always got carried away when he had an audience. This night was no exception. He became a bit angry with himself. He lost money when pain blanked the mind for several moments. He made up for it by selling chances on the use of his slave for a short period. He was delighted when the female who won invited all to participate. The mind blanked again, but the entertainment had been worth the cost. Dutch did a last systems check in engineering. They'd lifted as soon as Lissa was capable of it and had been working to complete her the entire journey. He ran for Clete as soon as he was done. He knew he wasn't on the bridge, but he didn't know why until Clete backed out of the area where they'd built their replicator and turned around. The photon cannon in his arms was an eloquent statement of his gentle brother's burning anger. \"The ship's ready.\" \"I felt it when you got sure. Carry this. I'll get the other one.\" \"He didn't have this in his memory.\" \"I don't plan on talking to him about it, Dutch. That society is diseased. We're going to perform surgery and remove the malignancy. It must be done before we release him. I'm not going to let him blame himself for it. I'm not going to feel guilty about it. Are you?\" \"No. I want the slaver. You take his owner.\" \"Done.\" Two men took apart a world. They began with the ships that rose from the single city to drive them off. They demolished buildings and destroyed vehicles. Slaves slew their masters and protected the backs of the two men in slave clouts with photon cannons in their hands. They found Lane and Clete went wild. Fury set fire to the planet. This rage was directed. It had a focus. Dutch found the slaver and told him who he was. He looked at the bloody thing he held in his hand and smiled. He left the cannon. He didn't need it. Clete left his weapon too, just dropped it. The raging mob grew silent and watched when he began to take apart a building with his hands. They made way for the man who stalked the streets, spattered with blood and dripping gore. Dutch helped Clete demolish the building around Lane. When they reached the vault, where the one who had paid to use and abuse him so badly had taken shelter, they quickly rebuilt a scan unit to read the lock, then Dutch went back to Lane and Clete entered the vault alone. He knew it contained dozens of armed men. They would not stop him. The last thing, the one who had called himself Lane's owner, saw was Clete's cold eyes and icy smile. The people in the streets huddled together in silence. The rage was more than they could hold, more than all of them could encompass. It had passed beyond them. Dutch was gently disconnecting Lane when Clete got there. He'd been unconscious since the power to the machine had failed. He would soon awaken, but they'd be done before he did. They wrapped a slave clout around him, then they smashed the machine with their hands, took the rare element from its heart and wrapped Lane's hands around it. Clete ripped open a water main and they cleansed their blood-drenched bodies. They sat down and held Lane between them until he awakened, smiled softly and told them it was time to leave. No one else died. The freed slaves had no more anger. They watched the three walk away from a city that was no more. Retribution had come to the clans that had enslaved a god. Lane knew he was still a bit confused by the time he'd been in the machine, but he was sure he'd have remembered remembering… He quit chasing the thought in circles and just asked Dutch. \"Is Clete all right?\" \"He will be. Just give him time, Lane.\" \"He's so withdrawn.\" \"DAMMIT! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?! I'm sorry, Lane, but you had to know. You say you gained something. Well, he lost something.\" \"Dutch, I guess my future memory isn't the only thing still only semi-functional. I don't understand.\" \"I hope you never do.\" \"Dutch, what did he lose?\" \"Innocence. Now, stop thinking about it. It's done. The choices were made. The blood spilled. The knowledge gained. Use it. Help me put this matrix together.\" Lane put one part of his mind on the task before him, but with another he sought to order his future memories and find the sound of Clete's laughter in them. When he found Clete's laughter, he saw what he must do. \"Put it away, Dutch. We have something else to do. I can't tell you what. It's got to be a surprise. Keep Clete busy. We're changing course. We're close, so we'll be setting down in about an hour. Go away. I want the bridge. Don't ask. It's part of the healing.\" He commed ahead. They'd be waiting. It was the perfect time, halfway through the two-day event, just in time for the celebration of acceptance. He landed the ship and smiled. They were waiting. \"Clete! Dutch! Let's go. Come on. We don't want to hold things up. They've got everything ready. Boy, am I glad the first thing we get are baths and appropriate costumes. You guys are grimy. Move. Move. Don't ask. You'll see.\" The bath was wonderful, if a bit overattended. The hot volcanic springs were the center of existence on Bernis, believed to hold great power of healing. The traditional warrior costumes suited them well. Clete and Dutch had learned they'd landed in the middle of Laire's wedding. They were ready in time for the acceptance ceremony and hurried to places in the Hall of Lords to hear it. \"I, Tar a'Reth h'Mun, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" \"I, Laire Brith Kardina, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" The hall rang with cheers. The Chief Lord had chosen and been chosen. It had been well past time. The Amarri woman was worthy. She had been worth the waiting. She would bear warriors of Bernis. Any woman touched by the fire of Bernis bore children to her people. Any man touched by it sired them. It was the greatest of the survival traits of their ancient species. \"Congratulations, Laire. You're going to be very happy.\" \"Thank you, Lane. Look, boys, don't go away. I've got to join the women. They want to see if I'm fit to go with them into battle. They're the home guard. Wish me luck. They're a formidable bunch.\" \"Actually, they're the ground troops on any world, but you know that and are waiting to see if we do.\" \"Caught, Lane, but still nervous.\" \"You'll do great. They love a woman who can bring a chief lord to his knees. Right, Tar?\" \"Yes, Dutch, and they had begun to despair that I would find one. I'm glad you're here. This day is one of great victory for me.\" \"You're a lucky man.\" \"Yes, Clete, I am. I wasn't sure she'd accept me.\" \"What?!\" \"Last night was our trial together. I feared her decision.\" \"I still don't understand.\" \"How do the humans say it? Oh, yes. Clete, my friend, you are a very tough act to follow.\" Clete stared at Tar for a moment and Dutch and Lane started to laugh. He was speechless. Tar grinned at him and suddenly he roared with laughter. The knot inside Lane untied. Innocence might be gone, but laughter had returned. Laire smiled at the sound. She helped the ladies lay their plan of battle for the evening. She made introductions, then whisked Tar away and left the dozen, dusky, unattached women around them. They were carrying carafes of wine and three extra glasses. She smiled at Tar. By morning, she and he would be viewed with near awe. \"Oh, my head.\" \"Don't talk so loud, Dutch. Where's Clete?\" \"You're asking me?\" \"You either, huh? I thought we'd decided not to do that again.\" \"We were set up by an expert. Good Lord, I don't believe it!\" \"Well, now we know where he is. Come on. Let's get to the hot springs.\" \"Yeah, before it gets embarrassing to be seen in public.\" Clete found them at the springs in the early afternoon. He had a rather large party escorting him. He smiled and sighed as he slipped into the water. \"Lane, I've got a buzzing in my mind.\" \"I noticed it too, Dutch. Strange sort of thing.\" \"You know, it's kind of familiar. Bit distracting.\" \"That's true. Any suggestions?\" Clete looked from one to the other. They were leading up to something. \"We could try asking him.\" \"Asking me what, Dutch?\" \"Clete, could you please try not to purr so loud?!\" They got quite a bit done that afternoon. Lane defined the space and programmed it while Clete and Dutch set up the matrix. The two parts had to be finished as a unit. They set the chunk of rare isotope into its brackets below the pilot's station and crossed their fingers. Lane sent current through it and started the program running. A wave of dizziness passed through them. They walked to the door of their small hold and Lane laid his hand against it. \"Now we see if we really did it.\" He pushed the door open and walked through. \"Incredible! Where did you get it from?\" \"Everywhere, Dutch. I started here with... well, a hotel lobby. Central herbarium, fountain... Like the fireplace? It'll burn forever. You can reshape it, poke it, add fuel. A real fire, but a program. Through those doors is a pool and gymnasium complex. Those lead to kitchen and dining areas. Remember all those questions I asked you? Come on. Let me show you the results.\" \"Lane, I want to see that fire program.\" \"I'll show it to you later, Dutch, but I want to show you what's down this hall first. This door leads to… \" \"Perfect! It's perfect! Incredible! The colors, the shapes. Wonderful!\" \"This is your space, Dutch. It's like a holosphere. You can change it, within limits. It'll always be a set of rooms, living quarters. You'll have to fill your closets, but never will any of us stand waiting for a shower again. Want to see Clete's?\" \"I want to see it.\" \"Right across the hall, Clete. Come on. You know I'm enjoying myself immensely. Open that door.\" \"Lane! How... \" \"Told you. Like a holosphere. The enclosed courtyard is primarily holoreality. It has day and night, sun and moonlight. The furnishings are 'big and comfortable.' The bedroom opens onto the courtyard too. You have a very modern frontier feel. Fireplace works like the one in the living room. You can even put it out and start a new one. There are birds in the trees, but I didn't see any need for bugs. Stock real food if you want it. These are really just large bedrooms. They're not meant to be complete homes. Come on. I want to show you mine.\" \"I'm coming. I just want to see-- Lane, that's outrageous! That bed would hold eight!\" \"Large and comfortable. This way. End of the hall is mine. Like the door? Mahogany. Wood and brass. I'm going to fill the bookshelves with the real thing. Nice thing about holoreality, it doesn't have to be polished. Nice, big, four-poster in the next room. My fireplace is smaller, but went with the décor. Dutch, I didn't give you one because it just didn't fit with your ultramodern requests.\" \"I have no complaints at all, Lane. I wouldn't use it. If I want to sit by a fire, I'll do it out in the central area. Lighting controls?\" \"Voice. Water is the only thing you get that's real. Food synthesizer is in the kitchen. This way.\" \"We're going to really like this too, Dutch. He's real smug.\" \"He deserves to be, Clete.\" \"Yeah, he does.\" \"Thank you.\" The kitchen was a homey place set up for synthesis or real cooking. It had a breakfast nook and a well-appointed dining area. The pool, spa and gymnasium complex had been very carefully planned. It was a very well-thought-out arrangement. \"I've got one more set of doors. I don't even know exactly what's behind them. I know there's a lab and computers and... Well, this piece in the front is an add on. Behind those doors is everything in the Wabbit program. A finite infinity. I... peeked at the program. It made me miss Dad so much I stopped. Oh, I forgot! Hold is behind the other doors in the gym. Lissa is now the outside framework of her own dimension. All those numbers we crunched were to integrate a cargo transporter. It's a pretty complicated process. The cargo lift is no longer operational. Here are your keys. The hatch now has a lock. Look familiar don't they. Damn, I miss him.\" \"We could visit, Lane.\" \"Dutch is right. She needs a test run. We could find him. Look. Is it a problem?\" \"Clete, I'm sure I'd have noticed it.\" \"Let's try something. I've been wondering if we could use your future memory more effectively. Remember how we hunted a solution when you saw those drug dealers were... going to kill him? Let's see what would happen.\" \"Clete, you know what… \" \"Yes, I know how hard it was to let Dutch take the chance and have faith Dad would be in time to save him, but they're both alive and they wouldn't be if we hadn't.\" \"Clete's right, Lane. We need to be able to use it as a way to gauge our actions.\" \"Dutch, I think you just like making me dizzy. All right. The couches by the fireplace. We... Oops! We hurry! Come on! Things are already starting to change.\" They laughed and ran after him. They'd made the decision to make a test run and find their father. The future Lane saw was changing. He didn't quite make the couch. He was laying on the floor giggling. Clete picked him up and put him on one. \"I don't believe it! They were defined in the program! He surprised me again!\" \"How about explaining that, Lane?\" \"We're complete, Dutch. Engines, computer banks, everything. The banks only hold basic information. Telas couldn't have carried their store of knowledge, but the processing capacity is there. You know, I'll bet he carried... It would have taken most of his memory. For us from Dad. A present. He wouldn't have trusted it to anything else. I thought... Clete, you even commented you were worried because you'd seen him using the ship comps to store info. Now we know why. We also know why even Dad couldn't remove Telas' augmentation. He's trusted us with the best-kept secret in the Fed. No Fed comp could have held all the program. His living brain is the basis of the system. Alice lies behind the doors in the gym.\" \"Alice? All of... Yippee! I don't have to spend years building engines!\" There were some problems. Lissa didn't fully integrate into the system. They went to work on it. First they dropped the transporter. It was an insoluble lump in an otherwise smooth blend. They redesigned the bridge. In fact, they practically gutted her and started over. They finally hit the solution when they put her on the inside instead of the outside. They put her back together. She was a ship within a ship. They moved the controls for time/space flight off the bridge and into their living room. They had two ships. Lissa could be dropped free and used independently. They dubbed the time/space ship Melissa. They entered it in her log. They hoped she liked it. Lissa had transporters and weapons. Melissa did not. Melissa could travel in time and was virtually indestructible. Lissa was not. Lissa fit inside Melissa. They thought it a very neat arrangement, especially when they learned Melissa could be made very small on the outside even with Lissa in her. It meant they could 'stack' their father's ship in her. When they told Melissa to choose her own shape, they decided she definitely had a sense of humor and was 'sweet' on Lane. She'd found the perfect way to tease him. Her shape of choice was a small 'wood,' scarf-draped, fortune-telling booth. They gave up trying to figure out why Lissa was in Melissa even when she wasn't. The answer had to be because Melissa wanted her there. They just stepped through the door in the back of the booth, stepped out of Lissa's hatch, slapped it closed, walked two meters to the hold and entered the living room, even when Melissa was in Lissa's hold. Their ship had a unique personality and a stubborn streak. She was not a copy of Alice and they were delighted with her. \"Lane, where and when do we find Dad?\" \"At one of his favorite fishing spots. About the same amount of time has passed for him as for us.\" \"Better. Why were you so worried about it, Dutch?\" \"I don't know, Clete. Yes I do. His voice. I want to hear his voice just as it was. Just as I hear it in my memory. I'll never forget hearing my mother's voice again. I was twenty-three and somewhere I was four. I was a brand new ensign. Her voice came over the comm channel. The captain sent me to sickbay. I was useless on the bridge.\" \"Don't tell him.\" \"What?\" \"Don't tell him. You ache when you talk about it. He didn't think about you running into her. It was a scar he didn't intend to open.\" \"But, Clete, it was wonderful. I... Oh, I see what you mean. It brought it all back. I heard her and knew when she would die. How alone I'd be. Yeah. I won't tell him.\" \"You two get by the hatch. We have to get out before he runs for it. Others who arrive in his vicinity like we will intend to kill him.\" \"Don't be far behind, Lane.\" \"I won't, Dutch. Hurry. We're about to land.\" They stepped out and Dutch yelled, \"Dad!\" He'd been halfway through the door. He spun around and stared at them. He was still standing with his mouth open and one hand on the door when Lane joined them. He stepped away from the door and smiled. They ran for him like boys. Clete steadied him until he got his breath back. Dutch had nearly knocked him flat. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Dad, that has a rather obvious answer. We smelled fish frying a universe and several thousand years away.\" \"Dutch, you haven't changed.\" \"No, but you have. You've been taking very good care of yourself. Gotten very comfortable. No workouts, good food--\" \"Ignore him. We built Melissa and she needed a test run. This is where we all wanted to bring her, to find you. What's wrong?\" \"Clete, do you have any idea how hard it was to say goodby to you? Now I have to do it again!\" He hadn't changed. He still knew exactly when they needed to be shouted at. They told him how they'd filled their years and asked how he'd filled his. He told them of his wanderings and his battles. He spoke of people he'd met and parted from. Clete ached for him. They were three together. He was, as always, alone. Even though he knew he'd have disagreed and pointed out Alice was always with him, it still hurt. They showed him their ships, introduced him to Melissa and talked long hours before the fire. Lane told him they'd learned to choose the changes they would make. Gallant laughed when Clete walked out of the kitchen, handed him a towel and noted his surge of relief had been a surprise to him too and he was cleaning up cocoa while he made more. He spent several days with them. One evening his gentle smile told them it would be their last. He wouldn't say goodbye. He'd said it too many times to people he loved. In the morning he was gone. They set course for the doorway. They would see him again. Someday.",

It's necessary or I wouldn't do it.\" \"You're a fine officer. I hate to lose you, but I wish you every success. When do you want this to become effective?\" \"The day after tomorrow, Sir.\" \"Very well, Lieutenant. I will so enter it. Would you like me to order transport for you?\" \"No, Sir, that will take care of itself.\" \"The day after tomorrow.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Lane walked out of the lift just as the blip appeared on the tech's screen. That was as far as his future memory could be trusted. He intended to change everything he remembered after it. \"Captain, we have a ship on long range scanners. I'm trying to establish communications, but I haven't received a response.\" \"Any information on the type of craft?\" \"No, Sir.\" \"Captain, you won't receive a response. That ship doesn't belong here. I know how it got here and can get it back. The occupant is dying and needs my assistance. I ask that you transport me aboard at maximum range.\" \"I would like more information, Mr. Gallant.\" \"Just Lane, Captain. He needs me. That ship is my transport. It's weaponless and, at the moment, defenseless.\" \"Lane, if this request came from anyone else, I'd probably deny it. Will you notify me when you're safely aboard?\" \"Yes, Captain, I will.\" The captain stood and walked over to the young man who had so recently been one of his finest officers. He shook his hand. \"Take care of yourself. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say you will be missed.\" A chorus of affirmation from the other members of the bridge crew followed his words. Lane smiled at the people he'd known and worked with for three years, some of them longer. \"You'll hear from me again, Captain, and some of you, I shall see again. Good journeys to you all.\" He turned and left the bridge. It had hurt to resign the fleet, but he knew the time had come, had known it would come. He was ready, but it still hurt and there was another goodbye that was going to be even harder. The transporter chief was his best friend and wasn't going to just let him beam out of his life. \"Lane, I want to know what's going on.\" \"Mick, it's time for me to start work in the family business. I'm needed. You know how it is with me. I've seen things coming. That ship out there is the beginning of a series of events that must be changed. I can't change them as an officer in the fleet. I have to be outside the rules.\" \"We're going to lose two other officers too, aren't we? You're going to get your brothers.\" \"Mick, are you sure you don't see the future?\" Mick smiled. It was an old joke. One that they'd shared since they had become friends three years before. \"Take care of yourself and keep in touch or I'll hunt you down and break your arm.\" \"I'll be in touch, Mick. Good journeys.\" \"Good journeys.\" Lane smiled at the closest friend he'd ever had, other than his brothers and father, as the transporter hummed into function. He would keep in touch with him. If he survived the next ten minutes. He started moving as soon as he materialized. The beam hit the place he had been. \"I'm here to help! I know where you're from! I can save your life and get you back! Don't you think this ship has enough--\" He dove behind the console. \"Damage without you shooting up the bridge! My name's Lane!\" That had been too close. \"Yours is Pethnar. I can see--\" He dashed across an open space. \"The future! If you don't kill me, we both have one!\" He waited a few moments, then slowly stood with his hands in the air. \"That's better. See, no weapons. First we need to cancel the self-destruct. I can get you home, if you'll just let me.\" The man nodded, then folded. Lane raced for the engine room. He had a very short time to cancel the self-destruct. He grabbed the cutter out of his pocket and ripped a panel off. He clipped a connector and yanked off another panel. He pulled out a circuit board and ran back to the bridge. He dove under the central computer console and clipped two more connectors, scrambled up and hit the sequence on the pilot's board. The self-destruct stopped ticking. He'd have taken time for a sigh of relief if he'd been able to afford it. He pulled his pilfered medical supplies out and went to work on the severely injured anthropoid. He wished his former captain would give him a few minutes. The constant beep of the communications console was a distraction. He reached up with one hand, opened a channel, said, \"I'm real busy. Call you back,\" and snapped it closed. It stopped beeping. He took time for his sigh of relief. He'd made it. The young man would live. He held back the dizziness and carried him to a cabin. He struggled back to the bridge and opened a channel. They were waiting. \"Hello, Captain. I'm all right, just had a great deal to do. I've saved the pilot, but it was close. I want to report you're short some medical equipment.\" \"You don't sound all right, Lane. Are you sure? I don't suppose that ship has visual capabilities. We'd like to see you.\" \"Ordinarily it does, but it's going to take a bit of repair. I'm just out of breath. I've been moving pretty fast. I have an operable ship and am about to get underway. Safe journeys, Captain. Thanks for standing by. Give my best to the crew. Parth ship Elpeth out.\" \"Lane, wait! The medical supplies will be listed as humanitarian aid to injured lifeforms. Wouldn't want to add a negative postscript to an otherwise perfect record. Besides, I already filed it. You know how I hate to recall closed files. Federation ship Omaki out. Lane smiled, then groaned as his head spun. He forced himself to relax and let his consciousness float above the shifting images in his mind. He had changed the future. He would wait until the images settled, then see if it had been enough. Lane pushed aside the future memory that was no longer true and followed the one he'd created with the change. He moved the injured young man to a bed, then sat down beside him and waited for him to open his eyes. \"Hello, Pethnar. I can feel you trying to communicate, but I'm not getting anything but your name and a few disconnected images. My dad is the real telepath in the family. Nod if you want me to take you home. I thought so. I know how you got here and I can get you back. I don't think you'll be in too much trouble. Your dad's going to be too happy to see you. You rest. I'll get steering and navigation back on line. Should be back in your own universe in a few hours.\" Lane started on the repairs. The bridge looked bad, but the damage Pethnar had done while shooting at him was mostly superficial. The real problem would be in rebuilding the defensive system. He checked the seal on the patch Pethnar had made. It looked good. He was glad he'd been able to save him. Anybody who had worked as hard as he had to survive deserved to make it. **** \"Hi, you look better. Just in time to help me clear some of this out of the way.\" Lane watched Pethnar kick a crumpled strut with a jagged end. \"Yeah. It put a nasty hole in you. Take it easy. I fixed the hole, but you lost a lot of blood. I do need you to sit on this piece while I move this one. The minute I took the weight off, it would fly up and try to take my head off.\" Pethnar grinned and made dusting motions and a bit of a show of sitting very carefully on the beam Lane had indicated. Lane laughed and removed a mass of metal from beside him. \"Good. One end. Slide down it and let it rise slowly. All right. Now we can get the rest of this out of the way. Our bow is unstrung. You don't understand the reference? Well, the weight on both ends of the beam bowed it across the debris in the middle. There was an ancient weapon that used a piece of wood... Ah, you get it now.\" The defensive shields were put back on line and Lane set course for the doorway between the universes. Pethnar had come through it by accident and it had saved his life. All Lane could do was go back through and hope the patrol that had attacked Pethnar was gone. He was sure they were. He didn't see them in his future, but he knew things could change. He used things in ship construction record to get the sample needed for his translator and practiced the language, not just words he would say. **** \"Parthan ship Elpeth calling Parth. Come in, please.\" \"Parth control. Who is this?\" \"My name's Lane Gallant. The prince is on board and safe. This ship was attacked and he was injured, but he's all right now. We'd like a pick up. He made an emergency patch and it's a good one, but we don't want to tempt fate by trying it out on a surface landing.\" \"We've got you. Establish an orbit. The king just ran out of here. I'd say he was on his way. Thank you. We're mighty fond of our prince. Parth control out.\" Lane laughed and thumped Pethnar on the back. Pethnar grinned at him. \"I told you he wouldn't be mad. Just make sure you tell him you won't be taking any more experimental ships for a joy ride. I imagine he's going to keep one hand on you for a few days just to make sure you're really here.\" He laughed at Pethnar's expression. \"Yeah, overprotective. Probably why you took the ship in the first place. Thought so. I'll do what I can to help. You really saved your own life. I just brought the medical equipment on board. Don't shake your head at me. I didn't slap a patch on that wall with a hole in my side and I didn't outmaneuver the bunch that attacked this ship.\" \"Parth ship Denvith calling Elpeth. Come in, please.\" \"Elpeth here. That was quick.\" \"The king was in a hurry. We're going to take Elpeth aboard. It'll be a tight fit. Want us to send a pilot?\" \"No, the prince is as good as anybody you could send and I'm fair help. Give us speed and course. We'll be there.\" Pethnar grinned and shook his head. Lane was much more than fair help. He was better than anyone he'd ever seen. He just wished he could really say thank you to him, but he couldn't. He was telepathic with his own race, as were the majority of his people. They were beginning to adapt to it and he was one of those 'more advanced.' He no longer agreed with that designation. He had never really wished he could speak, until he hadn't been able to communicate with the ships that attacked him. When he hadn't answered, they had decided he was hostile. Now, he wished it again. He 'touched' his father, showed him Lane and his feeling for him. Lane gave the pilot's chair to Pethnar and took the operations console. He began reading off course and speed corrections. The little ship entered the hold of the big transport and landed with barely a bump. They got an all clear and opened the hatch. Pethnar grinned at Lane. His father was on his way across the hold at a dead run. He would tell him thank you for them both. **** \"Your Majesty, I really do need to go back.\" \"Call me Jessar, Lane. I think of you as a good friend of the family. Pethnar agrees. He really wants you to stay.\" \"I'd like to, but I can't. I do need to ask a large favor though. I need a ship. A small one. The doorway between the universes was a tight fit for the Elpeth. I also ask you remove all record of its coordinates. It's a secret that must be carefully kept.\" \"How did you know about it?\" \"My father created it. It's our way to visit home.\" \"Who is your father?\" \"Gallant. That's another secret that must be carefully kept. For his safety and mine. He has enemies who would be very happy to use me to get to him. I probably shouldn't have told you.\" \"Sir, we are most honored you have trusted us. Pethnar says he'll miss you, but do it your way. I agree. I have just the ship for you. You'll like her. I do. Panbath! Order Lissa prepared. Make sure she's fully stocked. Have her ready by... Is dawn soon enough? Dawn tomorrow. Make sure all the new equipment is functioning properly. Put Ardth in charge of the preparations. Now, I think a party is in order, don't you?\" **** Lane was delighted. The little ship was an absolute jewel. She had been the king's personal ship. She was sleek, clean and tastefully appointed. She was also faster than anything else her size. She was set up for a crew of three, perfect for his needs. He wasn't sure how he felt about her extensive armament, but knew it would be needed. Her shields were good, but he would make major improvements in them. He would also make her capable of things no other ship in the universe could do, but for that he would need his brothers. He smiled widely when his comm to the fleet ship was answered. Clete's 'range' kept getting longer. \"Hi, Clete. I need you. I'm sorry to give you such short notice.\" \"It'll take me a few hours. My captain won't be happy. I'll give him my resignation and say my farewells. I knew this would come someday. Do you want me to message Dutch?\" \"Yes. Tell him to kiss the ladies farewell. We'll pick him up in three days.\" \"That's some ship. Not many could get there that fast.\" \"She's a gem, Clete, but as soon as we get Dutch, we need to do some modifications. We'll be doing most of them ourselves. Say hello to Godfather for me.\" \"I will. Ride our shadow. We've been running nervous. See you soon.\" Lane tucked under the big starship and took a nap. He'd been running nervous too. Things were very tense close to neutral space. He was awakened by the comm call. \"Nelson calling Lissa. Come in, please.\" \"Lissa here. Hello, Telas. It's good to see you.\" \"I'm pleased to see you too. Clete's preparing to beam over. May I inquire why you've chosen to resign?\" \"It's time to carry on the family tradition.\" \"Understood. I've prepared something that should be of assistance. Clete's bringing it. It's coded. I don't believe you'll have difficulty in finding the key. If you see Alice, give her my regards.\" Lane smiled. He knew what the key was. Telas had made sure he 'realized' it, rather than 'remembered' it. He knew he'd enjoy it. \"I shall. Good journeys, Telas.\" \"Safe journeys to you. Say hello to Dutch for me. Clete is transporting now.\" \"Hi, Lane. What a mix. I get the pleasure, but what's got you so worried?\" \"I'll explain my emotional state once we're underway, Clete. We've got some changes to make and not a lot of time. Get on ops. I'll take con.\" \"Done.\" Clete grinned widely when Dutch transported aboard and pulled both his brothers into a hug. He'd felt Lane's tightly controlled impatience and hunger to be near him growing. His own wasn't quite as strong, but it was close. He'd actually felt it when Dutch got the message they were coming. \"I've missed you guys. Clete knows how much of an understatement that is. Guess this means we've got work to do. Captain said hello. Didn't even act surprised when I resigned. Said he knew it would come eventually.\" \"What's the relief I feel?\" \"Well, Clete, there are two lovely ladies who think I should make a choice... \" Lane and Clete burst into laughter. Dutch hadn't changed. Neither had his pleasure in their laughter. Clete pulled them into another hug. It was what they both really wanted. \"Clete, pull that info up. Let's see what he gave us. The key is Wabbit.\" Clete and Dutch smiled widely. It was a story Gallant had told while Telas was with them and it did seem rather appropriate. Lane returned their smiles. It felt so very good to be together again. The Gallant boys were on the loose and the universe was about to change. **** \"It's all here, Lane. Everything. Specs, power requirements, circuit diagrams. Everything. Some things we won't be able to use. They tap a source of energy that doesn't exist in this universe.\" \"Not so, Dutch. We'll tap through the doorway. He'll know it's us. We have to be able to travel. Too much depends on it. I remember us doing it.\" \"This is going to take work. And we'll have to do it all ourselves. We'll build inside Lissa's shell. Start with the dimensional matrix. Give us room to work. Need things. Hmm... One of the nonaligned worlds as base. That means we'll need credits.\" \"We'll do runs as a courier in the Amarri system.\" \"Oh, brother! Lane, that is one hot war you want to put us in the middle of. Blockade runners have a short life expectancy.\" \"He's right, Lane. The pay is high because so few live to collect it.\" \"I know, Clete, but we need the credit.\" \"There's more to it than that. I can feel it.\" \"That's the problem with having an empath around. All right. It's iffy. I've got multiple images of the future. The packets and passenger we carry could end that war. If we get through. Getting through will depend on the shields. Ending the war will depend on you.\" \"Uh, oh, Clete, I think you're in trouble. Even I could feel the worry in that statement.\" \"Yes. Let's get to work on the shields. We'll need them to present ourselves for employment.\" \"Lane, you haven't told me what I'm supposed to do yet. You dread telling me. I'm not moving til I know.\" \"Dutch, get started. We'll be with you in a few minutes.\" \"Now, wait a minute!\" \"Dutch, if he doesn't kill me, we'll be there.\" \"Oh. All right. Clete, remember, he knows how it turns out. He can't help it. Count to ten thousand. I don't think ten will be enough.\" **** Dutch walked onto the bridge and knew he hadn't changed things yet because Lane was expecting him. He still intended to make one though. \"Lane, I've had it. It's like a polar zone between you two. I can't function in this atmosphere. I'm freezing. I can't stay out of it any longer. I want to know what's going on.\" \"Dutch, it'll work out. It's necessary. He'll get through it. It's going to be rough. Be there when he needs you. He'll even forgive me someday.\" \"Some explanation. Dammit, Lane, I want more!\" \"I asked him, no, told him to do something that goes against every instinct he has. Everything he is. I'm counting on him to finish the job right. If he does, the war will end. If he can't do it, it's going to pull more systems in, then the Empire, then the Federation.\" \"It's why you pulled us out. You saw it coming.\" \"Yes. I stalled it. I rescued the young man piloting the experimental ship that would have been the trigger. Even after he engaged the self-destruct, there would have been enough left to... I hoped that would be it, but it wasn't. There's only one image that leads out of interstellar warfare. It depends on Clete making a woman who fears him love him. Love him so much she'll do anything for him. Love him enough to live for him.\" \"I'll get back to work. I'll be there, Lane, but you be there too. He won't get through it without you. You understand. I can only care.\" \"He won't want me. I don't remember being there.\" \"Good. I'm making this change. Same way I helped make the first one when you thought you were going bye-bye.\" Lane stared at him with his mouth open. \"Dad didn't need much, Lane. Just a reminder you'd already lived with the pain long enough.\" \"Dutch, you're amazing.\" \"Yeah. And cute too.\" **** Clete raised an eyebrow at Lane, but he just smiled. He hoped he was right. Dutch was getting very irritated with the Chair of the Planetary Assembly. \"I think the fact we're here is reference enough! If we couldn't get through the blockade, we'd be space dust!\" \"Dutch, calm down. I don't think the chairman meant it quite that way. He doesn't know who we are. It's a little hard to trust strangers who drop in and say, 'Give us your secrets to carry,' in the middle of a war.\" \"You're right, Lane. Being a fleet officer spoiled me. I got used to people knowing I was loyal, dependable, trustworthy, and well-trained as soon as they saw the uniform.\" \"You were a Federation Fleet officer?\" \"We all were, Gen. Lane decided you needed help, then he decided we should help too. We're here. Now let us help.\" \"I shall make arrangements for you to begin immediately. Please, accept our hospitality. Quarters will be assigned until we have a mission for you.\" \"Thank you, Gen.\" As soon as they left the council hall, Lane started to laugh. Dutch grinned. \"Nothing like telling an old lady you're a Boy Scout to convince her to let you carry her packages. Now, let's find where they keep the pretty ladies on this world.\" Clete burst into laughter too. Dutch thought it sounded wonderful and his grin widened. He left them leaning against a wall laughing. They'd catch up. **** Lane warned Dutch another hit was coming. He just couldn't dodge them all. \"Shields full.\" \"Eighty percent max!\" Lissa rocked with the force of the blast, but Lane got her steadied fast. They had a long way to go and he was trying to make a change. But he couldn't find one that didn't lead to a sudden end of the path. \"Make that sixty. Lane, we've got to shoot back. Clete, take over ops. I'll take the gun. Give it to me on manual, Lane.\" \"I don't-- Damn! He's already gone.\" \"He's right, Lane. Incoming. Aft shield down. Compensating. We're at thirty-two percent. We don't get that fighter off our tail, we've-- Shields off! Go, Dutch! YES! Shields up. We've got another one. Not anymore. Damn! I hope he knows what he's doing. Evasive, Lane! Dutch, routine A on three, two, one... NOW!\" The little ship had never fired back before. She'd run the blockade time after time and never fired a shot. This time they'd been waiting. The admiral had decided to take her out. Half a fleet could have gotten through the holes left in the blockade. He'd sent every ship with any kind of a chance at catching her after her. Half a fleet did get through. A fleet of cargo ships. The desperately needed supply ships opened a hole a little wider and sped through it toward the planet. The little ship had done her job and the admiral had lost his. She'd also reduced the strength of the blockade by eighteen ships. \"Nice work, Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Aren't you going to say anything, Lane?\" \"Do you really want me to say it?! I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You're right. We wouldn't have made it without the gun. I was hoping for a change. I guess... I was just hoping we could avoid killing anyone.\" \"So was I. Lane, we had to do it. The people on the planet need those medical supplies desperately. For every life lost up here, a thousand will be saved on Amarri. If it had been weapons they were trying to get through, I'd have told them to stuff it. Nice piloting.\" \"Ahem.\" \"Yeah, Clete, I know. You're the one who made us practice until every zig and zag was perfect. Worked too. I knew exactly where I'd be after every maneuver. Now, how long til touchdown? I've got dates and I need a bath.\" \"Twins again, Dutch?\" \"Nope. Triplets.\" \"I don't suppose you'd want to share.\" \"Clete, you've got to be kidding!\" \"I am. Touchdown in twelve minutes.\" Laire wasn't extremely young, but she was young to have been given the task of seeking the one ally the assembly was sure would end the war. She was pleased they thought her the right choice and didn't disagree with the assembly on that point, but she really wished there was another world that offered as much hope of it. She put aside her irritation at that and worked on the proposal. Then her office door opened and her level of irritation went up another notch. She didn't like being interrupted and didn't want her office cleaned, but it was fourday, the time scheduled for her lunch and Missa had a schedule too. She almost wished she did want lunch. Missa's mother and hers were old friends and she'd known her since she was a child. \"You're so lucky, Laire. A tenday with the three of them.\" \"I'm not looking forward to it.\" \"What?! You're about to spend ten days with three beautiful, blond, eligible men and you're not looking forward to it?\" \"Unlike you, Missa, I have other things on my mind. They're just three young hotshots. I'm not particularly interested.\" \"Those 'hotshots' are the most brilliant, talented, gorgeous hunks of pure male ever to hit this planet. Curly hair and gray eyes and voices that make your heart thump. Especially the little one.\" \"Missa, one hundred eighty-five centimeters is not little.\" \"See what I mean? Even you've noticed them. But you're right, Dutch only looks little when he's standing next to Clete. Kerith asked Dutch how tall he was. He said they're 'stair steps,' exactly five centimeters difference. Lane in the middle at one ninety. How'd you know how tall Dutch was?\" \"Those three young men have been the predominant topic of conversation since they landed here. If anyone had gotten them on a scale, I'd have overheard their weights too! I'm sorry, Missa. I'm just bored with the subject.\" \"All work. Laire, you worry me. You're either in conference or up to your ears in communiqués. You don't go anywhere but department social functions and you don't really socialize at them. Just work, work, work.\" \"We're at war. I have a job to do. Now, if you've finished stirring up dust on the pretext of cleaning my office, I'll get back to it. I'm not looking forward to it, but I must take an offer of alliance to Bernis, another bunch of swaggering males.\" Dutch sat down on the bridge and shook his head. Their passenger was not the friendly sort. \"She's an iceberg. Brr. Like a marble statue. Beautiful, but no feeling.\" \"That's the problem, Dutch. The feeling's there, but she's got it locked up. She'll never reach the bernisi. She's got everything they respect buried. She can't stop this war the way she is.\" \"Lane, I'm glad I'm not Clete. I get frostbite when I talk to her. She's an iron maiden, smooth metal outside and sharp knives within.\" \"Yes, and I've told Clete to step in and pull the door closed. They're going to cut each other apart, but Clete will bleed and bandage her wounds.\" \"She's broken and you told him to fix her.\" \"Violently.\" \"Oh, shit.\" Lane counted lives that wouldn't be lost and ached while he fixed the dinner tray. Clete, of course, felt it and was hovering right outside the galley when he finished it. \"Take this to her.\" \"Lane, she's revolted by me. Afraid of me. I can handle the revulsion, the fear--\" \"Clete, it's not you she's afraid of. It's herself. She's convinced herself she's made of stone. She's afraid of a crack. If Bernis allies with Amarri, the war will end instantly. The Fed or the Empire might win a war with the bernisi, but no one else would and everyone knows it. Her job is to convince the chief lord Amarri is worthy to be an ally and there's only one way to do that. She must 'burn with the fire of the hills.' Can she succeed the way she is?\" \"No. Give me her dinner. Wine and two glasses. Isn't that a bit obvious?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thanks.\" Clete knew Lane was right. He reminded himself the ambassador really did want to end the war and would have given her life to accomplish it, was giving it to accomplish it, steeled himself against her feelings and knocked. \"Ambassador Kardina, I brought your dinner.\" \"Leave it outside.\" \"Not this time. This time you eat. You're not going to forget another meal. Open, or I'll let myself in.\" \"Oh, all right.\" She opened the door and looked up at him. He could feel her fear. He almost handed her the tray and ran. He didn't. He poured two glasses of wine and handed one to her. \"Now, I'm going to sit here while you eat. You want to get rid of me? Eat your dinner.\" \"I'm in the middle of some trade figures. I'll eat when I'm done with them.\" \"I'll wait.\" He watched her work. She was a dark-haired beauty. Fortyish and richly feminine, very young to carry the hopes of her world and she knew it. He pushed the wine a bit closer to her hand and smiled when she absently picked it up and drank some. He took a few sips of his. Who had made this beautiful woman fear love? Why had she locked her passions away? He pulled her glass toward him and refilled it. She lifted it and drank, then reached up and rubbed her neck. He stood and stepped behind her. \"Easy, let me rub the knots out. SIT STILL!\" He realized he was trembling. The fragrance of her was making him dizzy. He ignored her fear. He'd felt it rise after her pleasure in his touch. It was the order in which they came that gave him hope he could help her and her world. He slipped his thumbs under her collar and massaged the tight cords of fatigued muscle. He felt her pleasure then her terror, again in that order, but the terror was overwhelming his determination. If this was going to be, it must be now. She felt the change in him and stood. He loosed his powers and reached for her. He opened her emotions and crashed through her barriers. He felt her terror as her walls crashed down and it excited him, aroused him. And he hated himself for it. He destroyed the ice statue she'd created outside and found fire within. He freed himself from his own barriers and fueled it with his own. He'd never done it before. In that instant, he knew he too had feared the passion within, just as she had. Lane had chosen this way to free them both. He forgave him and lost himself in the fire of the woman in his arms. Dutch and Lane were in the galley when Clete became fire. \"Lane!\" \"Hang on, Dutch! Take my hand. We'll ride this storm. We knew it was coming. We've known what he was since we were sixteen. Remember how it was. Dad was careful, but we knew. When we all joined minds, we knew what Clete was.\" \"Yeah, but like you always say, reality is much more intense than remembering.\" \"Now it's your turn. We won't get through this unless you shield us. He'll burn us out. You're the only one who can stop that from happening.\" \"Lane, I don't know how!\" \"It's not knowing. It's being. Be who you are!\" Dutch found his barriers. He hadn't known they were there. He set his power free. He met Lane's mind with his and set him free too. Lane hadn't known he was barriered either. He'd seen his brothers', but not his own. They joined with Clete and felt him surge into completeness. Passion, intellect and power blended. Something more than the sum of its parts blazed into existence. Dutch laughed with delight in their minds. Laire traced Clete's smile with a fingertip. He'd healed her and she hadn't known she was injured, but the smile was gently ironic and she was rather sure she hadn't been the only one healed. \"What are you?\" \"I'm not sure, Laire. Half human, half something more. Our father isn't from this universe. You got caught in, no, caused the breakthrough. You freed me. Freed us all. You're very special. Now I know why you walled yourself away. No one you'd met ever responded. They were half-passioned. Involved only with their bodies.\" \"Yes! I didn't know why. There was something wrong with me. I wanted more, more than they had. I loved a man deeply. He left me. He feared me.\" \"Laire, you burn with the fire of the hills.\" \"Clete, that's not fair!\" \"No, but it's real. You mustn't hide what you are. Must be who you are. It's the only way to win them and end the horror of war on your world and you want that more than anything else.\" \"Show me, Clete. Show me how to be who I am.\" Bernis, the home of the oldest species and civilization humans had ever found, was an odd world. It had a cycle of geologic upheaval that shouldn't have been stable, but was. It was also completely predictable. The bernisi had adapted to it and that adaptation was nearly as odd as the cycle. Many studies of both had been done by scholars in the Fed, but they'd found no answers. The bernisi had been tolerant of the studies, but not surprised by the outcome. The bernisi had been the first species humans had contacted that looked human and a real shock. They'd told them there were thousands upon thousands, but they'd never learned why either. They hadn't given humans a great deal more information about the galaxy. They'd stopped exploring a very long time before, if they ever had, but they did tell them a bit about other peoples they'd find nearby and that they'd been anticipating meeting them for a long time. They liked the Fed. Laire went over everything she knew about the bernisi one more time, as she faced the entry to the Hall of Lords. She smiled when she thought of how her view of that knowledge had changed over the last few days. \"Back me up, boys.\" \"Such a beautiful back.\" \"Dutch, you're incorrigible.\" \"No, but very encourageable.\" \"Clete, help me keep myself open. Don't let me get lost in trade figures and treaty negotiations.\" \"You won't. Bank the fires. We'll be standing at your back. Feel us there. Feel me there.\" \"How do I look?\" \"Ravishing.\" Lane grinned at her. She was surprised. She hadn't expected him to say it. \"Clete, doesn't have all the passion, Laire, just the power. Frankly, you knock my socks off.\" She laughed in delight at the very old phrase and took Clete's arm; beautiful lady in black, escorted by the warriors in white. Dutch winked at Lane and pulled their minds together. They became fire. The warriors at the door dropped back instinctively. Dutch and Lane hit the huge iron doors and they crashed open. The Warrior Lords stirred. They growled low in their throats. These were men and the woman burned. She won them in that moment. They were hers. The Chief Lord knelt before her. \"Lady, the warriors of Bernis will aid in your world's battle. Command us. We serve your fire.\" The warriors roared their approval. Laire stretched out her arms and exulted in her triumph. They returned to Amarri with an escort of bernisi ships. They had no difficulty getting through. The blockade dissolved around them. Tar a'Reth h'Mun, the chief lord, contacted Lissa and drily noted his computer had asked for assistance with the code the blockade fleet used. It just couldn't find a key to unencrypt the yelps on their comm channel. Laire was still giggling when they landed. Three days later, Lane dropped in the middle of the hall in the building that housed the Planetary Assembly. Clete moved people out of his way and Dutch went through the ones in his. They knew what was wrong. The war was over and the future was changing. \"No! Don't call med! Let us take care of him. Clete, clear this hall. I'm going in. It's bad.\" \"I can feel it. Do it fast or I'll be down there with him. OUT! Everyone out! NOW! MOVE! CLEAR THIS CORRIDOR!\" The guards on the assembly chamber door looked at each other, then Clete, and went inside the chamber. If Clete wanted the corridor clear, they weren't going to argue. One person came out of the chamber, Laire. \"They sued for peace. Sent an apology. Terrible misunderstanding. Terribly sorry. Hope you aren't angry we killed several thousand of your people. Oops.\" \"Yeah, oops. Look, Laire, keep everyone away. We need a few minutes. Lane's riding the winds of change.\" She went back in the chamber and brought out the chief and two other bernisi lords. They each moved into a corridor. Laire stood over them. No one would disturb them. If the council had to spend the night in the chamber, they would. Dutch opened his eyes and smiled. \"Can't be heaven. You're the most real woman I've met. Find us a room. This is going to take a while. Feel silly in the hall.\" Laire opened the first door along the central corridor and ordered the occupants out. It was the Assembly Chair's office. There was a small apartment behind it. Dutch walked. The bernisi carried Lane and Clete. They didn't ask what was happening, but Laire told them what Clete had said. Tar nodded. \"They're the sons of the Fire Lord. We knew them when they came into the Hall. They serve all life. It's an honor to guard them. And to serve them.\" Laire was still thinking over all of what Tar had said when the Assembly Chair asked permission to enter his office. She granted it, then winced when she realized that was exactly how she'd put it as she walked from the comm to the door to open it for him. \"Laire, it's rather embarrassing to have to ask to enter my own office.\" \"Chair Firth, I'm sorry. They need time. Your office was closest.\" \"Keep it as long as they need it. I just need some notes I made on my data pad this morning If you want me, I'll be sitting on the floor outside the door, hashing out a trade agreement with the chief lord.\" Laire was still laughing when he left. He was a very happy man. Her whole world was happy and she knew that the three in the apartment behind her were why. She looked up from the papers she was working on when they came out together. \"You absolutely glow. What happened?\" \"You changed the future. Lane's been learning the new one. It's never been this rough before. Thanks for your help.\" \"Dutch, Tar recognized you. He called you the 'Sons of the Fire Lord.' He said you serve all life.\" \"Sounds like he's met Dad. Lane?\" \"Not necessarily Tar, Dutch. The bernisi are a unique species. They've evolved through the rise and fall of civilization on their planet dozens of times. Part of that evolution is a racial memory. If they met Dad or us in their past in some way that was significant to them, all of them would remember. I'm not thinking straight! Laire, you didn't hear that.\" \"You can travel in time?!\" \"Not yet, but we will.\" \"Oh... my. What happened? I know you 'remember' your future and get dizzy if something changes, but… Why did it flatten all three of you this time? Please tell me, Lane.\" \"All right. Sit down on the couch with me. I'll tell you what you really did. Your little war wasn't destined to stay little. The Empire was on the verge of coming in. They would have chosen what they saw as the strongest side. The Federation would have rushed to the aid of Amarri. It would have spread. Neutral space would have become a war zone. Trillions would have died as world after world became a battleground. No one could have stayed out of it. Except, perhaps, the bernisi. Neutrality wouldn't have existed, but I don't think even the durcassins are foolish enough to attack them. I didn't see what would happen after a certain point.\" \"Dutch! Calm down! It's changed.\" \"Yeah, Clete. Lane…\" \"Dutch, all the explored galaxy would have been at war. I wouldn't have left the fleet. You two wouldn't have either. Laire, you stopped that. You ended the war and the Empire has no reason to come here. You are the savior of the known galaxy.\" \"No, Clete is. And you and Dutch. But I'd be delighted to accept the title of helper. Yes. I like that. Gallant helper. It has a nice ring to it.\" \"You helped a new branch of the family business. Starting small, but growing.\" \"What do you mean by starting small, Dutch?\" \"All we've done is save one little piece of one galaxy. And evidently us. Dad saves universes. He usually saves his own, but he's saved this one once or twice as part of saving... everything. We know he's been here several times, though after what I think of as this time. I'm confusing you.\" \"Yes, but keep going. I have illusions I'll sort it out.\" \"The first visit was when Mom decided to have me. He said he didn't stand a chance once she'd made up her mind. She was the second Athena.\" \"Family joke, Laire. Three different mothers with the same name. We're half-brothers. Only Dutch was actually born here. Lane and I come from Dad's universe.\" \"How much of this is 'family business,' Clete?\" \"All of it. Your job as helper from now on is to not know anything you heard in this room.\" \"I want to tell my husband. He should know.\" \"WHAT?! What husband?!\" \"Relax, Clete, I haven't married him yet. I haven't even asked him yet. I guess I decided the minute I saw him. It just took awhile to realize it.\" \"Just who is this you want to entrust our lives to?\" \"Tar a'Reth h'Mun, Dutch.\" \"Chief Lord of Bernis.\" \"That's him. I don't think he'll mind being second choice.\" \"Second choice?\" \"Well, I don't think Clete would say yes and my previous reaction to rejection was a bit too extreme to ask on the off chance I'm wrong.\" Lane didn't tell Dutch and Clete all he'd seen when the future had changed. Dutch had pulled out while he was still following the path in his mind. He 'remembered' waiting until they reached the world where they would find much of what they needed to finish the ship. He went to the ship and Dutch and Clete started on locating things they'd need. He was deep in the control systems when Dutch arrived about two hours later. \"They're expecting us, Lane.\" \"Good. How much could you locate, Dutch?\" \"Parts, boards, raw materials, things we can adapt, maybe twenty percent. It will about use our fees from Amarri. Enough to establish a matrix. We're not going to be able to build most of it in this time, but probably enough to get to another.\" \"Where's Clete?\" \"Rock hunting. I left him in the university library pulling every piece of planetary survey information they had stored. We need some extremely rare minerals besides the one isotope that's not just rare.\" \"Was he having any luck?\" \"Yes, but not finding the minerals.\" \"Explain the grin, Dutch, or I won't have remembered why it's funny.\" \"He was sitting on the floor with some ancient hvorkin maps unrolled. They aren't delicate, but they aren't easy to keep flat either. There was a pretty student holding down each corner for him. You know Clete. He could feel they really wanted to help, so he gave them something useful to do. Most attractive paperweights I ever saw. He asked me to stay, but I told him I had something to do too.\" \"That doesn't sound like you, Dutch.\" \"Yeah, well, I couldn't resist. When I left, he was loosening his collar. He was getting real warm. I figured he should get himself out of this one. Besides, I've already got plans.\" \"I thought so. I just couldn't see you leaving if there were several lovely ladies around.\" \"I have plans for you too, Lane. You're going out to dinner.\" \"Dutch, I've got a lot of work to do.\" \"Nope. If you look, you'll see you go. I'd prefer you didn't search for the memory though. Everyone should get nice surprises. Three hours. Very casual.\" Lane realized he was running late. He'd gotten involved and the three hours had slipped away. He really didn't want to leave what he was doing, but Dutch had pulled the double promise from him. He would go to dinner and he wouldn't look into the evening's future. He wondered just how casual \"very\" was. \"Let's go.\" \"Just a minute, Dutch. Let me get shoes and a shirt. You're wearing a tux!\" \"You're fine. They're waiting.\" Dutch began pushing his protesting brother toward the hatch. Half the fun of the evening would be watching his staid brother just surrender to the silliness of the situation he was in. As soon as he got him through the hatch, the ladies helped with the pushing and they were in the transport and on their way before he got a chance to turn around and run. They helped hustle him into the restaurant too. \"Dutch, I may strangle you. This is not what I would call 'very casual.' How could you do this to me? Why didn't I remember this?\" \"It was there. One of the first images I saw in the change. You weren't looking at anything in the near future. Your mind was on the war that wouldn't happen. Relax. Oh, oh. Clete may make things a bit warm out tonight.\" Lane started to laugh. He sat in the midst of a bevy of beautiful women in evening gowns, shirtless and barefoot, his only attire the pair of faded pants he wore when he worked on the ship. The women were enjoying it as much as Dutch was. They kept dragging him onto the dance floor. He tensed and took a deep breath. At least he wasn't cold. Clete was keeping things quite warm. He was beginning to wonder how Dutch could handle the heat in his tux. Laughter became giggles when Dutch answered the thought almost as soon as he had it. \"That's it. I'm dying. Here hold this.\" Dutch handed his jacket to the pretty woman on his left and proceeded to strip to the waist. Soon, he was dressed, or undressed, to the same extent as Lane. Two of the bernisi came in shortly thereafter and the evening got strange and wild. No one in the club minded the dance floor being taken over. The friendly combat of the four beautiful warriors was the best show in town. They carried the wildness with them as they hit club after club. They ran into Clete in the early hours of the morning and laughed as the four young women with him reduced him to their state of dress. Two more bernisi joined them and they prowled the capital. The city became one wild celebration. The streets filled and the summer night rang with peeling bells. The war was over. **** Dutch did a fast lookover of physical facilities when they landed on a world that wasn't human. It had been the third Fed explorers had discovered with people that looked like them and definitely advanced enough they wouldn't damage the culture introducing themselves. The bernisi had pointed them that direction, the opposite side of Fed space, and told them there were interesting worlds there. Dutch was rather sure they wouldn't have if they didn't know they'd carefully make sure of it first. He smiled when he stepped into Lissa and headed for the bridge. He didn't need to yell or query the ship comp for his brothers' locations. He hadn't since Clete had freed them of their barriers. It was very nice not being the only one who needed to. He'd never been jealous that Clete could find them by their feel and Lane knew where they'd be, but it had been a wish he'd never expected to have granted and meant a great deal to him. \"The facilities are the best I've seen outside the Federation. They can do the exterior modifications. We've got one problem. There's a source for the element we need, but it's held by some pretty nasty people.\" \"We've got a solution to that, but he's not going to like it.\" \"Not Clete again! Lane, he's going to get real difficult to live with. We're using him. I don't like it.\" \"It's not quite the same situation. He'll need you. I won't be much help. In fact, none.\" \"You're hiding something. Something bad. I like this less and less. You expect to be... Show me.\" \"Yes, you need to know. It's going to happen soon. I'm ready for it. You need to be. Take my hand. I warn you, it's going to be bad.\" \"NO! I want it changed! I want it stopped! I won't let you! You can't do it, Lane! Please, try to find--\" \"Dutch, it's the only way I could find. You know I looked. I get through it. We get what we need. We clean up a mess. Clete ends it. Dutch, I grow stronger for it. We need what we get from it. It's my choice. I choose not to change it. Clete's coming. You'll have to get yourself under control. Accept it. This is the way I want it.\" \"I'm going to talk to Clete. We have to work this out between us. You may be overruled, Lane. This will be harder on us than you can imagine. The choice isn't only yours to make. Stay put. I'll talk to you later.\" He caught Clete before he got to the ship and told him they needed to talk. He led him to a place he could explode, a place wide open and empty. Lane would wait. He believed they would accept his decision. \"I told him we had the right to choose too, Clete. He's sure it shouldn't be changed. Truly believes changing it would negate a lot of things we accomplish. He's positive he can take it. Question is, can we. Can you?\" \"Leave me. Get as far away from me as you can and do it fast. He'll know our decision. I can feel yours. Go.\" Dutch ran for the ship. He found Lane, shoved him into an empty cabin and locked him in. He got himself locked into another and destroyed the remote for the door. He waited. Clete couldn't contain it much longer. Fury. Blind, unreasoning, fury. Rage. Dutch had a fraction of a second to recognize it, then it washed thought away. He fed it. Gave it his power. The police didn't have enough men. Brawls broke out everywhere, even in the police stations. It passed quickly. There weren't any severe injuries. The physicians marveled there weren't. Clete let Lane and Dutch out, then they went out and got drunk. They had a lot of company. Psychologists began long papers about the racial memory that had caused thousands to suddenly go berserk and attack with their bare hands. Psychics spoke of the release of the anger within. Theists preached of the fury of gods. It happened four days later. Dutch screamed in anger when he felt Lane lose consciousness, but he was a long way away. He yelled for Clete to stay with the ship. He was working very hard when he got back to Lissa. There was no point in trying to hide the pain he felt. Clete knew it and he knew he hurt just as much. Dutch let the tears he'd been holding back flow, when he laid down the tools he was holding and pulled him into his arms. \"They picked him up with a couple dozen others on the university grounds. We can't even go after him. The ship won't be ready for days. The planetary police chased them, but were afraid they'd kill the innocents. Clete, they stunned them. Loaded them like cordwood on grav carts. Carried one each as a shield. Kids mostly. Students. I got the story from a semi-hysterical secretary who saw it out a window. Slavers. They've never hit a population center before.\" \"And they won't again. Let's get the ship ready. I'm empty where he belongs. Dutch, stay close. You keep me here. Something in me wants to... break free and join him.\" \"Damn. There's a lot to this he didn't see. I feel stretched. Pulled. Like you describe. It didn't happen when we were in the fleet. We've developed some kind of bond. A gestalt. More than the sum of its parts. I could find him by the direction of the pull. I'll know when it begins. Four systems away and I'll know.\" \"I'm going to be very angry before this is over.\" \"So will I, Clete. So will I.\" Lane awoke cold and chained. He knew much more time had passed than if he'd just been stunned. The lack of a headache would have told him that if he hadn't known where he was. He was on display and being sold. He forced himself to relax. The casual handling would soon end. The unit clamped to his head would complete its scan and his price would go up, way up. He saw the blue-skinned anthropoid's eyes widen when he looked at the screen. He nearly laughed as the unit was replaced with another. When it displayed its results, the blue male ran toward the central auction area. He had just become the most valuable piece of property on the planet. It didn't take long for that person to return with another. The memory began when the technician who had run for his superior spoke. \"A perfect specimen, physically and mentally. Bidding will be heavy. A unique item of unknown origin, not of any species we've encountered before. We believe it breedable with technological assistance.\" \"Take a sample. I want the results before he's auctioned. Sale contingent upon signing a no-cloning clause. He is unique, therefore trebly valuable. Minimum to be the highest any single sale has ever brought. Curtain the area. Private showing only. Ascertain if viewers can afford him. Post test results on the central screen. I'd take him myself if he wasn't going to make the clan rich.\" Lane jerked against his chains when the obese male touched him. The male smiled. He followed his memory. It held a path to what they needed. \"I will warn you. Do not touch me again.\" \"I have decided to do the sampling myself. Call me when the curtains are in place. Have a physician standing by. He will receive his first lesson as a slave from me. He will need repair. I find I wish to see the color of his blood.\" Lane followed the memory which showed him how to distance his mind from his body. He found the link with his brothers and sheltered his mind in their caring. He returned to himself strengthened. The pain was not great. The physician was efficient. There would be no evidence of abuse when he was viewed. He was carefully cleaned. The last thing that was done was the removal of the gag. The slaver hadn't wanted his clientele to know he was selling used goods. He knew what was coming, but couldn't help fighting against the eye cover and mouthpiece. The screens before his eyes were blank. He tried to distance himself, but the disk on his forehead prevented it. He would have cried out, but the mouthpiece stopped him. He was twice branded. His owner had claimed him, and his progeny. He fainted. He awoke and his tasks began. The screens filled and his mind worked. He had no choice. He was the creative element, the intuitive circuit, of a vast machine intelligence. He felt when his body was used, but the work never ceased. Nutrients dripped into his veins. Wastes were removed by filtration of his blood. He neither slept nor rested. He was aware of all that was being done. Aware of hands and laughter. Aware of being moved and touched. Damaged and healed. Aware of what was being taken from his mind and body. He was not aware of the passage of time, his ostentatious display, nor of the price paid for each integration performed, each touch felt. The one who had purchased the unique item at a price no other could have paid stroked him and smiled. He was an excellent example of why he could pay more than anyone else. He had recouped his price in a very few days. He invited his guests to enjoy themselves and ordered menial slaves to serve them. He would enjoy their envy. He kept a physician nearby. He always got carried away when he had an audience. This night was no exception. He became a bit angry with himself. He lost money when pain blanked the mind for several moments. He made up for it by selling chances on the use of his slave for a short period. He was delighted when the female who won invited all to participate. The mind blanked again, but the entertainment had been worth the cost. Dutch did a last systems check in engineering. They'd lifted as soon as Lissa was capable of it and had been working to complete her the entire journey. He ran for Clete as soon as he was done. He knew he wasn't on the bridge, but he didn't know why until Clete backed out of the area where they'd built their replicator and turned around. The photon cannon in his arms was an eloquent statement of his gentle brother's burning anger. \"The ship's ready.\" \"I felt it when you got sure. Carry this. I'll get the other one.\" \"He didn't have this in his memory.\" \"I don't plan on talking to him about it, Dutch. That society is diseased. We're going to perform surgery and remove the malignancy. It must be done before we release him. I'm not going to let him blame himself for it. I'm not going to feel guilty about it. Are you?\" \"No. I want the slaver. You take his owner.\" \"Done.\" Two men took apart a world. They began with the ships that rose from the single city to drive them off. They demolished buildings and destroyed vehicles. Slaves slew their masters and protected the backs of the two men in slave clouts with photon cannons in their hands. They found Lane and Clete went wild. Fury set fire to the planet. This rage was directed. It had a focus. Dutch found the slaver and told him who he was. He looked at the bloody thing he held in his hand and smiled. He left the cannon. He didn't need it. Clete left his weapon too, just dropped it. The raging mob grew silent and watched when he began to take apart a building with his hands. They made way for the man who stalked the streets, spattered with blood and dripping gore. Dutch helped Clete demolish the building around Lane. When they reached the vault, where the one who had paid to use and abuse him so badly had taken shelter, they quickly rebuilt a scan unit to read the lock, then Dutch went back to Lane and Clete entered the vault alone. He knew it contained dozens of armed men. They would not stop him. The last thing, the one who had called himself Lane's owner, saw was Clete's cold eyes and icy smile. The people in the streets huddled together in silence. The rage was more than they could hold, more than all of them could encompass. It had passed beyond them. Dutch was gently disconnecting Lane when Clete got there. He'd been unconscious since the power to the machine had failed. He would soon awaken, but they'd be done before he did. They wrapped a slave clout around him, then they smashed the machine with their hands, took the rare element from its heart and wrapped Lane's hands around it. Clete ripped open a water main and they cleansed their blood-drenched bodies. They sat down and held Lane between them until he awakened, smiled softly and told them it was time to leave. No one else died. The freed slaves had no more anger. They watched the three walk away from a city that was no more. Retribution had come to the clans that had enslaved a god. Lane knew he was still a bit confused by the time he'd been in the machine, but he was sure he'd have remembered remembering… He quit chasing the thought in circles and just asked Dutch. \"Is Clete all right?\" \"He will be. Just give him time, Lane.\" \"He's so withdrawn.\" \"DAMMIT! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?! I'm sorry, Lane, but you had to know. You say you gained something. Well, he lost something.\" \"Dutch, I guess my future memory isn't the only thing still only semi-functional. I don't understand.\" \"I hope you never do.\" \"Dutch, what did he lose?\" \"Innocence. Now, stop thinking about it. It's done. The choices were made. The blood spilled. The knowledge gained. Use it. Help me put this matrix together.\" Lane put one part of his mind on the task before him, but with another he sought to order his future memories and find the sound of Clete's laughter in them. When he found Clete's laughter, he saw what he must do. \"Put it away, Dutch. We have something else to do. I can't tell you what. It's got to be a surprise. Keep Clete busy. We're changing course. We're close, so we'll be setting down in about an hour. Go away. I want the bridge. Don't ask. It's part of the healing.\" He commed ahead. They'd be waiting. It was the perfect time, halfway through the two-day event, just in time for the celebration of acceptance. He landed the ship and smiled. They were waiting. \"Clete! Dutch! Let's go. Come on. We don't want to hold things up. They've got everything ready. Boy, am I glad the first thing we get are baths and appropriate costumes. You guys are grimy. Move. Move. Don't ask. You'll see.\" The bath was wonderful, if a bit overattended. The hot volcanic springs were the center of existence on Bernis, believed to hold great power of healing. The traditional warrior costumes suited them well. Clete and Dutch had learned they'd landed in the middle of Laire's wedding. They were ready in time for the acceptance ceremony and hurried to places in the Hall of Lords to hear it. \"I, Tar a'Reth h'Mun, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" \"I, Laire Brith Kardina, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" The hall rang with cheers. The Chief Lord had chosen and been chosen. It had been well past time. The Amarri woman was worthy. She had been worth the waiting. She would bear warriors of Bernis. Any woman touched by the fire of Bernis bore children to her people. Any man touched by it sired them. It was the greatest of the survival traits of their ancient species. \"Congratulations, Laire. You're going to be very happy.\" \"Thank you, Lane. Look, boys, don't go away. I've got to join the women. They want to see if I'm fit to go with them into battle. They're the home guard. Wish me luck. They're a formidable bunch.\" \"Actually, they're the ground troops on any world, but you know that and are waiting to see if we do.\" \"Caught, Lane, but still nervous.\" \"You'll do great. They love a woman who can bring a chief lord to his knees. Right, Tar?\" \"Yes, Dutch, and they had begun to despair that I would find one. I'm glad you're here. This day is one of great victory for me.\" \"You're a lucky man.\" \"Yes, Clete, I am. I wasn't sure she'd accept me.\" \"What?!\" \"Last night was our trial together. I feared her decision.\" \"I still don't understand.\" \"How do the humans say it? Oh, yes. Clete, my friend, you are a very tough act to follow.\" Clete stared at Tar for a moment and Dutch and Lane started to laugh. He was speechless. Tar grinned at him and suddenly he roared with laughter. The knot inside Lane untied. Innocence might be gone, but laughter had returned. Laire smiled at the sound. She helped the ladies lay their plan of battle for the evening. She made introductions, then whisked Tar away and left the dozen, dusky, unattached women around them. They were carrying carafes of wine and three extra glasses. She smiled at Tar. By morning, she and he would be viewed with near awe. \"Oh, my head.\" \"Don't talk so loud, Dutch. Where's Clete?\" \"You're asking me?\" \"You either, huh? I thought we'd decided not to do that again.\" \"We were set up by an expert. Good Lord, I don't believe it!\" \"Well, now we know where he is. Come on. Let's get to the hot springs.\" \"Yeah, before it gets embarrassing to be seen in public.\" Clete found them at the springs in the early afternoon. He had a rather large party escorting him. He smiled and sighed as he slipped into the water. \"Lane, I've got a buzzing in my mind.\" \"I noticed it too, Dutch. Strange sort of thing.\" \"You know, it's kind of familiar. Bit distracting.\" \"That's true. Any suggestions?\" Clete looked from one to the other. They were leading up to something. \"We could try asking him.\" \"Asking me what, Dutch?\" \"Clete, could you please try not to purr so loud?!\" They got quite a bit done that afternoon. Lane defined the space and programmed it while Clete and Dutch set up the matrix. The two parts had to be finished as a unit. They set the chunk of rare isotope into its brackets below the pilot's station and crossed their fingers. Lane sent current through it and started the program running. A wave of dizziness passed through them. They walked to the door of their small hold and Lane laid his hand against it. \"Now we see if we really did it.\" He pushed the door open and walked through. \"Incredible! Where did you get it from?\" \"Everywhere, Dutch. I started here with... well, a hotel lobby. Central herbarium, fountain... Like the fireplace? It'll burn forever. You can reshape it, poke it, add fuel. A real fire, but a program. Through those doors is a pool and gymnasium complex. Those lead to kitchen and dining areas. Remember all those questions I asked you? Come on. Let me show you the results.\" \"Lane, I want to see that fire program.\" \"I'll show it to you later, Dutch, but I want to show you what's down this hall first. This door leads to… \" \"Perfect! It's perfect! Incredible! The colors, the shapes. Wonderful!\" \"This is your space, Dutch. It's like a holosphere. You can change it, within limits. It'll always be a set of rooms, living quarters. You'll have to fill your closets, but never will any of us stand waiting for a shower again. Want to see Clete's?\" \"I want to see it.\" \"Right across the hall, Clete. Come on. You know I'm enjoying myself immensely. Open that door.\" \"Lane! How... \" \"Told you. Like a holosphere. The enclosed courtyard is primarily holoreality. It has day and night, sun and moonlight. The furnishings are 'big and comfortable.' The bedroom opens onto the courtyard too. You have a very modern frontier feel. Fireplace works like the one in the living room. You can even put it out and start a new one. There are birds in the trees, but I didn't see any need for bugs. Stock real food if you want it. These are really just large bedrooms. They're not meant to be complete homes. Come on. I want to show you mine.\" \"I'm coming. I just want to see-- Lane, that's outrageous! That bed would hold eight!\" \"Large and comfortable. This way. End of the hall is mine. Like the door? Mahogany. Wood and brass. I'm going to fill the bookshelves with the real thing. Nice thing about holoreality, it doesn't have to be polished. Nice, big, four-poster in the next room. My fireplace is smaller, but went with the décor. Dutch, I didn't give you one because it just didn't fit with your ultramodern requests.\" \"I have no complaints at all, Lane. I wouldn't use it. If I want to sit by a fire, I'll do it out in the central area. Lighting controls?\" \"Voice. Water is the only thing you get that's real. Food synthesizer is in the kitchen. This way.\" \"We're going to really like this too, Dutch. He's real smug.\" \"He deserves to be, Clete.\" \"Yeah, he does.\" \"Thank you.\" The kitchen was a homey place set up for synthesis or real cooking. It had a breakfast nook and a well-appointed dining area. The pool, spa and gymnasium complex had been very carefully planned. It was a very well-thought-out arrangement. \"I've got one more set of doors. I don't even know exactly what's behind them. I know there's a lab and computers and... Well, this piece in the front is an add on. Behind those doors is everything in the Wabbit program. A finite infinity. I... peeked at the program. It made me miss Dad so much I stopped. Oh, I forgot! Hold is behind the other doors in the gym. Lissa is now the outside framework of her own dimension. All those numbers we crunched were to integrate a cargo transporter. It's a pretty complicated process. The cargo lift is no longer operational. Here are your keys. The hatch now has a lock. Look familiar don't they. Damn, I miss him.\" \"We could visit, Lane.\" \"Dutch is right. She needs a test run. We could find him. Look. Is it a problem?\" \"Clete, I'm sure I'd have noticed it.\" \"Let's try something. I've been wondering if we could use your future memory more effectively. Remember how we hunted a solution when you saw those drug dealers were... going to kill him? Let's see what would happen.\" \"Clete, you know what… \" \"Yes, I know how hard it was to let Dutch take the chance and have faith Dad would be in time to save him, but they're both alive and they wouldn't be if we hadn't.\" \"Clete's right, Lane. We need to be able to use it as a way to gauge our actions.\" \"Dutch, I think you just like making me dizzy. All right. The couches by the fireplace. We... Oops! We hurry! Come on! Things are already starting to change.\" They laughed and ran after him. They'd made the decision to make a test run and find their father. The future Lane saw was changing. He didn't quite make the couch. He was laying on the floor giggling. Clete picked him up and put him on one. \"I don't believe it! They were defined in the program! He surprised me again!\" \"How about explaining that, Lane?\" \"We're complete, Dutch. Engines, computer banks, everything. The banks only hold basic information. Telas couldn't have carried their store of knowledge, but the processing capacity is there. You know, I'll bet he carried... It would have taken most of his memory. For us from Dad. A present. He wouldn't have trusted it to anything else. I thought... Clete, you even commented you were worried because you'd seen him using the ship comps to store info. Now we know why. We also know why even Dad couldn't remove Telas' augmentation. He's trusted us with the best-kept secret in the Fed. No Fed comp could have held all the program. His living brain is the basis of the system. Alice lies behind the doors in the gym.\" \"Alice? All of... Yippee! I don't have to spend years building engines!\" There were some problems. Lissa didn't fully integrate into the system. They went to work on it. First they dropped the transporter. It was an insoluble lump in an otherwise smooth blend. They redesigned the bridge. In fact, they practically gutted her and started over. They finally hit the solution when they put her on the inside instead of the outside. They put her back together. She was a ship within a ship. They moved the controls for time/space flight off the bridge and into their living room. They had two ships. Lissa could be dropped free and used independently. They dubbed the time/space ship Melissa. They entered it in her log. They hoped she liked it. Lissa had transporters and weapons. Melissa did not. Melissa could travel in time and was virtually indestructible. Lissa was not. Lissa fit inside Melissa. They thought it a very neat arrangement, especially when they learned Melissa could be made very small on the outside even with Lissa in her. It meant they could 'stack' their father's ship in her. When they told Melissa to choose her own shape, they decided she definitely had a sense of humor and was 'sweet' on Lane. She'd found the perfect way to tease him. Her shape of choice was a small 'wood,' scarf-draped, fortune-telling booth. They gave up trying to figure out why Lissa was in Melissa even when she wasn't. The answer had to be because Melissa wanted her there. They just stepped through the door in the back of the booth, stepped out of Lissa's hatch, slapped it closed, walked two meters to the hold and entered the living room, even when Melissa was in Lissa's hold. Their ship had a unique personality and a stubborn streak. She was not a copy of Alice and they were delighted with her. \"Lane, where and when do we find Dad?\" \"At one of his favorite fishing spots. About the same amount of time has passed for him as for us.\" \"Better. Why were you so worried about it, Dutch?\" \"I don't know, Clete. Yes I do. His voice. I want to hear his voice just as it was. Just as I hear it in my memory. I'll never forget hearing my mother's voice again. I was twenty-three and somewhere I was four. I was a brand new ensign. Her voice came over the comm channel. The captain sent me to sickbay. I was useless on the bridge.\" \"Don't tell him.\" \"What?\" \"Don't tell him. You ache when you talk about it. He didn't think about you running into her. It was a scar he didn't intend to open.\" \"But, Clete, it was wonderful. I... Oh, I see what you mean. It brought it all back. I heard her and knew when she would die. How alone I'd be. Yeah. I won't tell him.\" \"You two get by the hatch. We have to get out before he runs for it. Others who arrive in his vicinity like we will intend to kill him.\" \"Don't be far behind, Lane.\" \"I won't, Dutch. Hurry. We're about to land.\" They stepped out and Dutch yelled, \"Dad!\" He'd been halfway through the door. He spun around and stared at them. He was still standing with his mouth open and one hand on the door when Lane joined them. He stepped away from the door and smiled. They ran for him like boys. Clete steadied him until he got his breath back. Dutch had nearly knocked him flat. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Dad, that has a rather obvious answer. We smelled fish frying a universe and several thousand years away.\" \"Dutch, you haven't changed.\" \"No, but you have. You've been taking very good care of yourself. Gotten very comfortable. No workouts, good food--\" \"Ignore him. We built Melissa and she needed a test run. This is where we all wanted to bring her, to find you. What's wrong?\" \"Clete, do you have any idea how hard it was to say goodby to you? Now I have to do it again!\" He hadn't changed. He still knew exactly when they needed to be shouted at. They told him how they'd filled their years and asked how he'd filled his. He told them of his wanderings and his battles. He spoke of people he'd met and parted from. Clete ached for him. They were three together. He was, as always, alone. Even though he knew he'd have disagreed and pointed out Alice was always with him, it still hurt. They showed him their ships, introduced him to Melissa and talked long hours before the fire. Lane told him they'd learned to choose the changes they would make. Gallant laughed when Clete walked out of the kitchen, handed him a towel and noted his surge of relief had been a surprise to him too and he was cleaning up cocoa while he made more. He spent several days with them. One evening his gentle smile told them it would be their last. He wouldn't say goodbye. He'd said it too many times to people he loved. In the morning he was gone. They set course for the doorway. They would see him again. Someday.",

It's necessary or I wouldn't do it.\" \"You're a fine officer. I hate to lose you, but I wish you every success. When do you want this to become effective?\" \"The day after tomorrow, Sir.\" \"Very well, Lieutenant. I will so enter it. Would you like me to order transport for you?\" \"No, Sir, that will take care of itself.\" \"The day after tomorrow.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" Lane walked out of the lift just as the blip appeared on the tech's screen. That was as far as his future memory could be trusted. He intended to change everything he remembered after it. \"Captain, we have a ship on long range scanners. I'm trying to establish communications, but I haven't received a response.\" \"Any information on the type of craft?\" \"No, Sir.\" \"Captain, you won't receive a response. That ship doesn't belong here. I know how it got here and can get it back. The occupant is dying and needs my assistance. I ask that you transport me aboard at maximum range.\" \"I would like more information, Mr. Gallant.\" \"Just Lane, Captain. He needs me. That ship is my transport. It's weaponless and, at the moment, defenseless.\" \"Lane, if this request came from anyone else, I'd probably deny it. Will you notify me when you're safely aboard?\" \"Yes, Captain, I will.\" The captain stood and walked over to the young man who had so recently been one of his finest officers. He shook his hand. \"Take care of yourself. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say you will be missed.\" A chorus of affirmation from the other members of the bridge crew followed his words. Lane smiled at the people he'd known and worked with for three years, some of them longer. \"You'll hear from me again, Captain, and some of you, I shall see again. Good journeys to you all.\" He turned and left the bridge. It had hurt to resign the fleet, but he knew the time had come, had known it would come. He was ready, but it still hurt and there was another goodbye that was going to be even harder. The transporter chief was his best friend and wasn't going to just let him beam out of his life. \"Lane, I want to know what's going on.\" \"Mick, it's time for me to start work in the family business. I'm needed. You know how it is with me. I've seen things coming. That ship out there is the beginning of a series of events that must be changed. I can't change them as an officer in the fleet. I have to be outside the rules.\" \"We're going to lose two other officers too, aren't we? You're going to get your brothers.\" \"Mick, are you sure you don't see the future?\" Mick smiled. It was an old joke. One that they'd shared since they had become friends three years before. \"Take care of yourself and keep in touch or I'll hunt you down and break your arm.\" \"I'll be in touch, Mick. Good journeys.\" \"Good journeys.\" Lane smiled at the closest friend he'd ever had, other than his brothers and father, as the transporter hummed into function. He would keep in touch with him. If he survived the next ten minutes. He started moving as soon as he materialized. The beam hit the place he had been. \"I'm here to help! I know where you're from! I can save your life and get you back! Don't you think this ship has enough--\" He dove behind the console. \"Damage without you shooting up the bridge! My name's Lane!\" That had been too close. \"Yours is Pethnar. I can see--\" He dashed across an open space. \"The future! If you don't kill me, we both have one!\" He waited a few moments, then slowly stood with his hands in the air. \"That's better. See, no weapons. First we need to cancel the self-destruct. I can get you home, if you'll just let me.\" The man nodded, then folded. Lane raced for the engine room. He had a very short time to cancel the self-destruct. He grabbed the cutter out of his pocket and ripped a panel off. He clipped a connector and yanked off another panel. He pulled out a circuit board and ran back to the bridge. He dove under the central computer console and clipped two more connectors, scrambled up and hit the sequence on the pilot's board. The self-destruct stopped ticking. He'd have taken time for a sigh of relief if he'd been able to afford it. He pulled his pilfered medical supplies out and went to work on the severely injured anthropoid. He wished his former captain would give him a few minutes. The constant beep of the communications console was a distraction. He reached up with one hand, opened a channel, said, \"I'm real busy. Call you back,\" and snapped it closed. It stopped beeping. He took time for his sigh of relief. He'd made it. The young man would live. He held back the dizziness and carried him to a cabin. He struggled back to the bridge and opened a channel. They were waiting. \"Hello, Captain. I'm all right, just had a great deal to do. I've saved the pilot, but it was close. I want to report you're short some medical equipment.\" \"You don't sound all right, Lane. Are you sure? I don't suppose that ship has visual capabilities. We'd like to see you.\" \"Ordinarily it does, but it's going to take a bit of repair. I'm just out of breath. I've been moving pretty fast. I have an operable ship and am about to get underway. Safe journeys, Captain. Thanks for standing by. Give my best to the crew. Parth ship Elpeth out.\" \"Lane, wait! The medical supplies will be listed as humanitarian aid to injured lifeforms. Wouldn't want to add a negative postscript to an otherwise perfect record. Besides, I already filed it. You know how I hate to recall closed files. Federation ship Omaki out. Lane smiled, then groaned as his head spun. He forced himself to relax and let his consciousness float above the shifting images in his mind. He had changed the future. He would wait until the images settled, then see if it had been enough. Lane pushed aside the future memory that was no longer true and followed the one he'd created with the change. He moved the injured young man to a bed, then sat down beside him and waited for him to open his eyes. \"Hello, Pethnar. I can feel you trying to communicate, but I'm not getting anything but your name and a few disconnected images. My dad is the real telepath in the family. Nod if you want me to take you home. I thought so. I know how you got here and I can get you back. I don't think you'll be in too much trouble. Your dad's going to be too happy to see you. You rest. I'll get steering and navigation back on line. Should be back in your own universe in a few hours.\" Lane started on the repairs. The bridge looked bad, but the damage Pethnar had done while shooting at him was mostly superficial. The real problem would be in rebuilding the defensive system. He checked the seal on the patch Pethnar had made. It looked good. He was glad he'd been able to save him. Anybody who had worked as hard as he had to survive deserved to make it. **** \"Hi, you look better. Just in time to help me clear some of this out of the way.\" Lane watched Pethnar kick a crumpled strut with a jagged end. \"Yeah. It put a nasty hole in you. Take it easy. I fixed the hole, but you lost a lot of blood. I do need you to sit on this piece while I move this one. The minute I took the weight off, it would fly up and try to take my head off.\" Pethnar grinned and made dusting motions and a bit of a show of sitting very carefully on the beam Lane had indicated. Lane laughed and removed a mass of metal from beside him. \"Good. One end. Slide down it and let it rise slowly. All right. Now we can get the rest of this out of the way. Our bow is unstrung. You don't understand the reference? Well, the weight on both ends of the beam bowed it across the debris in the middle. There was an ancient weapon that used a piece of wood... Ah, you get it now.\" The defensive shields were put back on line and Lane set course for the doorway between the universes. Pethnar had come through it by accident and it had saved his life. All Lane could do was go back through and hope the patrol that had attacked Pethnar was gone. He was sure they were. He didn't see them in his future, but he knew things could change. He used things in ship construction record to get the sample needed for his translator and practiced the language, not just words he would say. **** \"Parthan ship Elpeth calling Parth. Come in, please.\" \"Parth control. Who is this?\" \"My name's Lane Gallant. The prince is on board and safe. This ship was attacked and he was injured, but he's all right now. We'd like a pick up. He made an emergency patch and it's a good one, but we don't want to tempt fate by trying it out on a surface landing.\" \"We've got you. Establish an orbit. The king just ran out of here. I'd say he was on his way. Thank you. We're mighty fond of our prince. Parth control out.\" Lane laughed and thumped Pethnar on the back. Pethnar grinned at him. \"I told you he wouldn't be mad. Just make sure you tell him you won't be taking any more experimental ships for a joy ride. I imagine he's going to keep one hand on you for a few days just to make sure you're really here.\" He laughed at Pethnar's expression. \"Yeah, overprotective. Probably why you took the ship in the first place. Thought so. I'll do what I can to help. You really saved your own life. I just brought the medical equipment on board. Don't shake your head at me. I didn't slap a patch on that wall with a hole in my side and I didn't outmaneuver the bunch that attacked this ship.\" \"Parth ship Denvith calling Elpeth. Come in, please.\" \"Elpeth here. That was quick.\" \"The king was in a hurry. We're going to take Elpeth aboard. It'll be a tight fit. Want us to send a pilot?\" \"No, the prince is as good as anybody you could send and I'm fair help. Give us speed and course. We'll be there.\" Pethnar grinned and shook his head. Lane was much more than fair help. He was better than anyone he'd ever seen. He just wished he could really say thank you to him, but he couldn't. He was telepathic with his own race, as were the majority of his people. They were beginning to adapt to it and he was one of those 'more advanced.' He no longer agreed with that designation. He had never really wished he could speak, until he hadn't been able to communicate with the ships that attacked him. When he hadn't answered, they had decided he was hostile. Now, he wished it again. He 'touched' his father, showed him Lane and his feeling for him. Lane gave the pilot's chair to Pethnar and took the operations console. He began reading off course and speed corrections. The little ship entered the hold of the big transport and landed with barely a bump. They got an all clear and opened the hatch. Pethnar grinned at Lane. His father was on his way across the hold at a dead run. He would tell him thank you for them both. **** \"Your Majesty, I really do need to go back.\" \"Call me Jessar, Lane. I think of you as a good friend of the family. Pethnar agrees. He really wants you to stay.\" \"I'd like to, but I can't. I do need to ask a large favor though. I need a ship. A small one. The doorway between the universes was a tight fit for the Elpeth. I also ask you remove all record of its coordinates. It's a secret that must be carefully kept.\" \"How did you know about it?\" \"My father created it. It's our way to visit home.\" \"Who is your father?\" \"Gallant. That's another secret that must be carefully kept. For his safety and mine. He has enemies who would be very happy to use me to get to him. I probably shouldn't have told you.\" \"Sir, we are most honored you have trusted us. Pethnar says he'll miss you, but do it your way. I agree. I have just the ship for you. You'll like her. I do. Panbath! Order Lissa prepared. Make sure she's fully stocked. Have her ready by... Is dawn soon enough? Dawn tomorrow. Make sure all the new equipment is functioning properly. Put Ardth in charge of the preparations. Now, I think a party is in order, don't you?\" **** Lane was delighted. The little ship was an absolute jewel. She had been the king's personal ship. She was sleek, clean and tastefully appointed. She was also faster than anything else her size. She was set up for a crew of three, perfect for his needs. He wasn't sure how he felt about her extensive armament, but knew it would be needed. Her shields were good, but he would make major improvements in them. He would also make her capable of things no other ship in the universe could do, but for that he would need his brothers. He smiled widely when his comm to the fleet ship was answered. Clete's 'range' kept getting longer. \"Hi, Clete. I need you. I'm sorry to give you such short notice.\" \"It'll take me a few hours. My captain won't be happy. I'll give him my resignation and say my farewells. I knew this would come someday. Do you want me to message Dutch?\" \"Yes. Tell him to kiss the ladies farewell. We'll pick him up in three days.\" \"That's some ship. Not many could get there that fast.\" \"She's a gem, Clete, but as soon as we get Dutch, we need to do some modifications. We'll be doing most of them ourselves. Say hello to Godfather for me.\" \"I will. Ride our shadow. We've been running nervous. See you soon.\" Lane tucked under the big starship and took a nap. He'd been running nervous too. Things were very tense close to neutral space. He was awakened by the comm call. \"Nelson calling Lissa. Come in, please.\" \"Lissa here. Hello, Telas. It's good to see you.\" \"I'm pleased to see you too. Clete's preparing to beam over. May I inquire why you've chosen to resign?\" \"It's time to carry on the family tradition.\" \"Understood. I've prepared something that should be of assistance. Clete's bringing it. It's coded. I don't believe you'll have difficulty in finding the key. If you see Alice, give her my regards.\" Lane smiled. He knew what the key was. Telas had made sure he 'realized' it, rather than 'remembered' it. He knew he'd enjoy it. \"I shall. Good journeys, Telas.\" \"Safe journeys to you. Say hello to Dutch for me. Clete is transporting now.\" \"Hi, Lane. What a mix. I get the pleasure, but what's got you so worried?\" \"I'll explain my emotional state once we're underway, Clete. We've got some changes to make and not a lot of time. Get on ops. I'll take con.\" \"Done.\" Clete grinned widely when Dutch transported aboard and pulled both his brothers into a hug. He'd felt Lane's tightly controlled impatience and hunger to be near him growing. His own wasn't quite as strong, but it was close. He'd actually felt it when Dutch got the message they were coming. \"I've missed you guys. Clete knows how much of an understatement that is. Guess this means we've got work to do. Captain said hello. Didn't even act surprised when I resigned. Said he knew it would come eventually.\" \"What's the relief I feel?\" \"Well, Clete, there are two lovely ladies who think I should make a choice... \" Lane and Clete burst into laughter. Dutch hadn't changed. Neither had his pleasure in their laughter. Clete pulled them into another hug. It was what they both really wanted. \"Clete, pull that info up. Let's see what he gave us. The key is Wabbit.\" Clete and Dutch smiled widely. It was a story Gallant had told while Telas was with them and it did seem rather appropriate. Lane returned their smiles. It felt so very good to be together again. The Gallant boys were on the loose and the universe was about to change. **** \"It's all here, Lane. Everything. Specs, power requirements, circuit diagrams. Everything. Some things we won't be able to use. They tap a source of energy that doesn't exist in this universe.\" \"Not so, Dutch. We'll tap through the doorway. He'll know it's us. We have to be able to travel. Too much depends on it. I remember us doing it.\" \"This is going to take work. And we'll have to do it all ourselves. We'll build inside Lissa's shell. Start with the dimensional matrix. Give us room to work. Need things. Hmm... One of the nonaligned worlds as base. That means we'll need credits.\" \"We'll do runs as a courier in the Amarri system.\" \"Oh, brother! Lane, that is one hot war you want to put us in the middle of. Blockade runners have a short life expectancy.\" \"He's right, Lane. The pay is high because so few live to collect it.\" \"I know, Clete, but we need the credit.\" \"There's more to it than that. I can feel it.\" \"That's the problem with having an empath around. All right. It's iffy. I've got multiple images of the future. The packets and passenger we carry could end that war. If we get through. Getting through will depend on the shields. Ending the war will depend on you.\" \"Uh, oh, Clete, I think you're in trouble. Even I could feel the worry in that statement.\" \"Yes. Let's get to work on the shields. We'll need them to present ourselves for employment.\" \"Lane, you haven't told me what I'm supposed to do yet. You dread telling me. I'm not moving til I know.\" \"Dutch, get started. We'll be with you in a few minutes.\" \"Now, wait a minute!\" \"Dutch, if he doesn't kill me, we'll be there.\" \"Oh. All right. Clete, remember, he knows how it turns out. He can't help it. Count to ten thousand. I don't think ten will be enough.\" **** Dutch walked onto the bridge and knew he hadn't changed things yet because Lane was expecting him. He still intended to make one though. \"Lane, I've had it. It's like a polar zone between you two. I can't function in this atmosphere. I'm freezing. I can't stay out of it any longer. I want to know what's going on.\" \"Dutch, it'll work out. It's necessary. He'll get through it. It's going to be rough. Be there when he needs you. He'll even forgive me someday.\" \"Some explanation. Dammit, Lane, I want more!\" \"I asked him, no, told him to do something that goes against every instinct he has. Everything he is. I'm counting on him to finish the job right. If he does, the war will end. If he can't do it, it's going to pull more systems in, then the Empire, then the Federation.\" \"It's why you pulled us out. You saw it coming.\" \"Yes. I stalled it. I rescued the young man piloting the experimental ship that would have been the trigger. Even after he engaged the self-destruct, there would have been enough left to... I hoped that would be it, but it wasn't. There's only one image that leads out of interstellar warfare. It depends on Clete making a woman who fears him love him. Love him so much she'll do anything for him. Love him enough to live for him.\" \"I'll get back to work. I'll be there, Lane, but you be there too. He won't get through it without you. You understand. I can only care.\" \"He won't want me. I don't remember being there.\" \"Good. I'm making this change. Same way I helped make the first one when you thought you were going bye-bye.\" Lane stared at him with his mouth open. \"Dad didn't need much, Lane. Just a reminder you'd already lived with the pain long enough.\" \"Dutch, you're amazing.\" \"Yeah. And cute too.\" **** Clete raised an eyebrow at Lane, but he just smiled. He hoped he was right. Dutch was getting very irritated with the Chair of the Planetary Assembly. \"I think the fact we're here is reference enough! If we couldn't get through the blockade, we'd be space dust!\" \"Dutch, calm down. I don't think the chairman meant it quite that way. He doesn't know who we are. It's a little hard to trust strangers who drop in and say, 'Give us your secrets to carry,' in the middle of a war.\" \"You're right, Lane. Being a fleet officer spoiled me. I got used to people knowing I was loyal, dependable, trustworthy, and well-trained as soon as they saw the uniform.\" \"You were a Federation Fleet officer?\" \"We all were, Gen. Lane decided you needed help, then he decided we should help too. We're here. Now let us help.\" \"I shall make arrangements for you to begin immediately. Please, accept our hospitality. Quarters will be assigned until we have a mission for you.\" \"Thank you, Gen.\" As soon as they left the council hall, Lane started to laugh. Dutch grinned. \"Nothing like telling an old lady you're a Boy Scout to convince her to let you carry her packages. Now, let's find where they keep the pretty ladies on this world.\" Clete burst into laughter too. Dutch thought it sounded wonderful and his grin widened. He left them leaning against a wall laughing. They'd catch up. **** Lane warned Dutch another hit was coming. He just couldn't dodge them all. \"Shields full.\" \"Eighty percent max!\" Lissa rocked with the force of the blast, but Lane got her steadied fast. They had a long way to go and he was trying to make a change. But he couldn't find one that didn't lead to a sudden end of the path. \"Make that sixty. Lane, we've got to shoot back. Clete, take over ops. I'll take the gun. Give it to me on manual, Lane.\" \"I don't-- Damn! He's already gone.\" \"He's right, Lane. Incoming. Aft shield down. Compensating. We're at thirty-two percent. We don't get that fighter off our tail, we've-- Shields off! Go, Dutch! YES! Shields up. We've got another one. Not anymore. Damn! I hope he knows what he's doing. Evasive, Lane! Dutch, routine A on three, two, one... NOW!\" The little ship had never fired back before. She'd run the blockade time after time and never fired a shot. This time they'd been waiting. The admiral had decided to take her out. Half a fleet could have gotten through the holes left in the blockade. He'd sent every ship with any kind of a chance at catching her after her. Half a fleet did get through. A fleet of cargo ships. The desperately needed supply ships opened a hole a little wider and sped through it toward the planet. The little ship had done her job and the admiral had lost his. She'd also reduced the strength of the blockade by eighteen ships. \"Nice work, Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Aren't you going to say anything, Lane?\" \"Do you really want me to say it?! I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You're right. We wouldn't have made it without the gun. I was hoping for a change. I guess... I was just hoping we could avoid killing anyone.\" \"So was I. Lane, we had to do it. The people on the planet need those medical supplies desperately. For every life lost up here, a thousand will be saved on Amarri. If it had been weapons they were trying to get through, I'd have told them to stuff it. Nice piloting.\" \"Ahem.\" \"Yeah, Clete, I know. You're the one who made us practice until every zig and zag was perfect. Worked too. I knew exactly where I'd be after every maneuver. Now, how long til touchdown? I've got dates and I need a bath.\" \"Twins again, Dutch?\" \"Nope. Triplets.\" \"I don't suppose you'd want to share.\" \"Clete, you've got to be kidding!\" \"I am. Touchdown in twelve minutes.\" Laire wasn't extremely young, but she was young to have been given the task of seeking the one ally the assembly was sure would end the war. She was pleased they thought her the right choice and didn't disagree with the assembly on that point, but she really wished there was another world that offered as much hope of it. She put aside her irritation at that and worked on the proposal. Then her office door opened and her level of irritation went up another notch. She didn't like being interrupted and didn't want her office cleaned, but it was fourday, the time scheduled for her lunch and Missa had a schedule too. She almost wished she did want lunch. Missa's mother and hers were old friends and she'd known her since she was a child. \"You're so lucky, Laire. A tenday with the three of them.\" \"I'm not looking forward to it.\" \"What?! You're about to spend ten days with three beautiful, blond, eligible men and you're not looking forward to it?\" \"Unlike you, Missa, I have other things on my mind. They're just three young hotshots. I'm not particularly interested.\" \"Those 'hotshots' are the most brilliant, talented, gorgeous hunks of pure male ever to hit this planet. Curly hair and gray eyes and voices that make your heart thump. Especially the little one.\" \"Missa, one hundred eighty-five centimeters is not little.\" \"See what I mean? Even you've noticed them. But you're right, Dutch only looks little when he's standing next to Clete. Kerith asked Dutch how tall he was. He said they're 'stair steps,' exactly five centimeters difference. Lane in the middle at one ninety. How'd you know how tall Dutch was?\" \"Those three young men have been the predominant topic of conversation since they landed here. If anyone had gotten them on a scale, I'd have overheard their weights too! I'm sorry, Missa. I'm just bored with the subject.\" \"All work. Laire, you worry me. You're either in conference or up to your ears in communiqués. You don't go anywhere but department social functions and you don't really socialize at them. Just work, work, work.\" \"We're at war. I have a job to do. Now, if you've finished stirring up dust on the pretext of cleaning my office, I'll get back to it. I'm not looking forward to it, but I must take an offer of alliance to Bernis, another bunch of swaggering males.\" Dutch sat down on the bridge and shook his head. Their passenger was not the friendly sort. \"She's an iceberg. Brr. Like a marble statue. Beautiful, but no feeling.\" \"That's the problem, Dutch. The feeling's there, but she's got it locked up. She'll never reach the bernisi. She's got everything they respect buried. She can't stop this war the way she is.\" \"Lane, I'm glad I'm not Clete. I get frostbite when I talk to her. She's an iron maiden, smooth metal outside and sharp knives within.\" \"Yes, and I've told Clete to step in and pull the door closed. They're going to cut each other apart, but Clete will bleed and bandage her wounds.\" \"She's broken and you told him to fix her.\" \"Violently.\" \"Oh, shit.\" Lane counted lives that wouldn't be lost and ached while he fixed the dinner tray. Clete, of course, felt it and was hovering right outside the galley when he finished it. \"Take this to her.\" \"Lane, she's revolted by me. Afraid of me. I can handle the revulsion, the fear--\" \"Clete, it's not you she's afraid of. It's herself. She's convinced herself she's made of stone. She's afraid of a crack. If Bernis allies with Amarri, the war will end instantly. The Fed or the Empire might win a war with the bernisi, but no one else would and everyone knows it. Her job is to convince the chief lord Amarri is worthy to be an ally and there's only one way to do that. She must 'burn with the fire of the hills.' Can she succeed the way she is?\" \"No. Give me her dinner. Wine and two glasses. Isn't that a bit obvious?\" \"Yes.\" \"Thanks.\" Clete knew Lane was right. He reminded himself the ambassador really did want to end the war and would have given her life to accomplish it, was giving it to accomplish it, steeled himself against her feelings and knocked. \"Ambassador Kardina, I brought your dinner.\" \"Leave it outside.\" \"Not this time. This time you eat. You're not going to forget another meal. Open, or I'll let myself in.\" \"Oh, all right.\" She opened the door and looked up at him. He could feel her fear. He almost handed her the tray and ran. He didn't. He poured two glasses of wine and handed one to her. \"Now, I'm going to sit here while you eat. You want to get rid of me? Eat your dinner.\" \"I'm in the middle of some trade figures. I'll eat when I'm done with them.\" \"I'll wait.\" He watched her work. She was a dark-haired beauty. Fortyish and richly feminine, very young to carry the hopes of her world and she knew it. He pushed the wine a bit closer to her hand and smiled when she absently picked it up and drank some. He took a few sips of his. Who had made this beautiful woman fear love? Why had she locked her passions away? He pulled her glass toward him and refilled it. She lifted it and drank, then reached up and rubbed her neck. He stood and stepped behind her. \"Easy, let me rub the knots out. SIT STILL!\" He realized he was trembling. The fragrance of her was making him dizzy. He ignored her fear. He'd felt it rise after her pleasure in his touch. It was the order in which they came that gave him hope he could help her and her world. He slipped his thumbs under her collar and massaged the tight cords of fatigued muscle. He felt her pleasure then her terror, again in that order, but the terror was overwhelming his determination. If this was going to be, it must be now. She felt the change in him and stood. He loosed his powers and reached for her. He opened her emotions and crashed through her barriers. He felt her terror as her walls crashed down and it excited him, aroused him. And he hated himself for it. He destroyed the ice statue she'd created outside and found fire within. He freed himself from his own barriers and fueled it with his own. He'd never done it before. In that instant, he knew he too had feared the passion within, just as she had. Lane had chosen this way to free them both. He forgave him and lost himself in the fire of the woman in his arms. Dutch and Lane were in the galley when Clete became fire. \"Lane!\" \"Hang on, Dutch! Take my hand. We'll ride this storm. We knew it was coming. We've known what he was since we were sixteen. Remember how it was. Dad was careful, but we knew. When we all joined minds, we knew what Clete was.\" \"Yeah, but like you always say, reality is much more intense than remembering.\" \"Now it's your turn. We won't get through this unless you shield us. He'll burn us out. You're the only one who can stop that from happening.\" \"Lane, I don't know how!\" \"It's not knowing. It's being. Be who you are!\" Dutch found his barriers. He hadn't known they were there. He set his power free. He met Lane's mind with his and set him free too. Lane hadn't known he was barriered either. He'd seen his brothers', but not his own. They joined with Clete and felt him surge into completeness. Passion, intellect and power blended. Something more than the sum of its parts blazed into existence. Dutch laughed with delight in their minds. Laire traced Clete's smile with a fingertip. He'd healed her and she hadn't known she was injured, but the smile was gently ironic and she was rather sure she hadn't been the only one healed. \"What are you?\" \"I'm not sure, Laire. Half human, half something more. Our father isn't from this universe. You got caught in, no, caused the breakthrough. You freed me. Freed us all. You're very special. Now I know why you walled yourself away. No one you'd met ever responded. They were half-passioned. Involved only with their bodies.\" \"Yes! I didn't know why. There was something wrong with me. I wanted more, more than they had. I loved a man deeply. He left me. He feared me.\" \"Laire, you burn with the fire of the hills.\" \"Clete, that's not fair!\" \"No, but it's real. You mustn't hide what you are. Must be who you are. It's the only way to win them and end the horror of war on your world and you want that more than anything else.\" \"Show me, Clete. Show me how to be who I am.\" Bernis, the home of the oldest species and civilization humans had ever found, was an odd world. It had a cycle of geologic upheaval that shouldn't have been stable, but was. It was also completely predictable. The bernisi had adapted to it and that adaptation was nearly as odd as the cycle. Many studies of both had been done by scholars in the Fed, but they'd found no answers. The bernisi had been tolerant of the studies, but not surprised by the outcome. The bernisi had been the first species humans had contacted that looked human and a real shock. They'd told them there were thousands upon thousands, but they'd never learned why either. They hadn't given humans a great deal more information about the galaxy. They'd stopped exploring a very long time before, if they ever had, but they did tell them a bit about other peoples they'd find nearby and that they'd been anticipating meeting them for a long time. They liked the Fed. Laire went over everything she knew about the bernisi one more time, as she faced the entry to the Hall of Lords. She smiled when she thought of how her view of that knowledge had changed over the last few days. \"Back me up, boys.\" \"Such a beautiful back.\" \"Dutch, you're incorrigible.\" \"No, but very encourageable.\" \"Clete, help me keep myself open. Don't let me get lost in trade figures and treaty negotiations.\" \"You won't. Bank the fires. We'll be standing at your back. Feel us there. Feel me there.\" \"How do I look?\" \"Ravishing.\" Lane grinned at her. She was surprised. She hadn't expected him to say it. \"Clete, doesn't have all the passion, Laire, just the power. Frankly, you knock my socks off.\" She laughed in delight at the very old phrase and took Clete's arm; beautiful lady in black, escorted by the warriors in white. Dutch winked at Lane and pulled their minds together. They became fire. The warriors at the door dropped back instinctively. Dutch and Lane hit the huge iron doors and they crashed open. The Warrior Lords stirred. They growled low in their throats. These were men and the woman burned. She won them in that moment. They were hers. The Chief Lord knelt before her. \"Lady, the warriors of Bernis will aid in your world's battle. Command us. We serve your fire.\" The warriors roared their approval. Laire stretched out her arms and exulted in her triumph. They returned to Amarri with an escort of bernisi ships. They had no difficulty getting through. The blockade dissolved around them. Tar a'Reth h'Mun, the chief lord, contacted Lissa and drily noted his computer had asked for assistance with the code the blockade fleet used. It just couldn't find a key to unencrypt the yelps on their comm channel. Laire was still giggling when they landed. Three days later, Lane dropped in the middle of the hall in the building that housed the Planetary Assembly. Clete moved people out of his way and Dutch went through the ones in his. They knew what was wrong. The war was over and the future was changing. \"No! Don't call med! Let us take care of him. Clete, clear this hall. I'm going in. It's bad.\" \"I can feel it. Do it fast or I'll be down there with him. OUT! Everyone out! NOW! MOVE! CLEAR THIS CORRIDOR!\" The guards on the assembly chamber door looked at each other, then Clete, and went inside the chamber. If Clete wanted the corridor clear, they weren't going to argue. One person came out of the chamber, Laire. \"They sued for peace. Sent an apology. Terrible misunderstanding. Terribly sorry. Hope you aren't angry we killed several thousand of your people. Oops.\" \"Yeah, oops. Look, Laire, keep everyone away. We need a few minutes. Lane's riding the winds of change.\" She went back in the chamber and brought out the chief and two other bernisi lords. They each moved into a corridor. Laire stood over them. No one would disturb them. If the council had to spend the night in the chamber, they would. Dutch opened his eyes and smiled. \"Can't be heaven. You're the most real woman I've met. Find us a room. This is going to take a while. Feel silly in the hall.\" Laire opened the first door along the central corridor and ordered the occupants out. It was the Assembly Chair's office. There was a small apartment behind it. Dutch walked. The bernisi carried Lane and Clete. They didn't ask what was happening, but Laire told them what Clete had said. Tar nodded. \"They're the sons of the Fire Lord. We knew them when they came into the Hall. They serve all life. It's an honor to guard them. And to serve them.\" Laire was still thinking over all of what Tar had said when the Assembly Chair asked permission to enter his office. She granted it, then winced when she realized that was exactly how she'd put it as she walked from the comm to the door to open it for him. \"Laire, it's rather embarrassing to have to ask to enter my own office.\" \"Chair Firth, I'm sorry. They need time. Your office was closest.\" \"Keep it as long as they need it. I just need some notes I made on my data pad this morning If you want me, I'll be sitting on the floor outside the door, hashing out a trade agreement with the chief lord.\" Laire was still laughing when he left. He was a very happy man. Her whole world was happy and she knew that the three in the apartment behind her were why. She looked up from the papers she was working on when they came out together. \"You absolutely glow. What happened?\" \"You changed the future. Lane's been learning the new one. It's never been this rough before. Thanks for your help.\" \"Dutch, Tar recognized you. He called you the 'Sons of the Fire Lord.' He said you serve all life.\" \"Sounds like he's met Dad. Lane?\" \"Not necessarily Tar, Dutch. The bernisi are a unique species. They've evolved through the rise and fall of civilization on their planet dozens of times. Part of that evolution is a racial memory. If they met Dad or us in their past in some way that was significant to them, all of them would remember. I'm not thinking straight! Laire, you didn't hear that.\" \"You can travel in time?!\" \"Not yet, but we will.\" \"Oh... my. What happened? I know you 'remember' your future and get dizzy if something changes, but… Why did it flatten all three of you this time? Please tell me, Lane.\" \"All right. Sit down on the couch with me. I'll tell you what you really did. Your little war wasn't destined to stay little. The Empire was on the verge of coming in. They would have chosen what they saw as the strongest side. The Federation would have rushed to the aid of Amarri. It would have spread. Neutral space would have become a war zone. Trillions would have died as world after world became a battleground. No one could have stayed out of it. Except, perhaps, the bernisi. Neutrality wouldn't have existed, but I don't think even the durcassins are foolish enough to attack them. I didn't see what would happen after a certain point.\" \"Dutch! Calm down! It's changed.\" \"Yeah, Clete. Lane…\" \"Dutch, all the explored galaxy would have been at war. I wouldn't have left the fleet. You two wouldn't have either. Laire, you stopped that. You ended the war and the Empire has no reason to come here. You are the savior of the known galaxy.\" \"No, Clete is. And you and Dutch. But I'd be delighted to accept the title of helper. Yes. I like that. Gallant helper. It has a nice ring to it.\" \"You helped a new branch of the family business. Starting small, but growing.\" \"What do you mean by starting small, Dutch?\" \"All we've done is save one little piece of one galaxy. And evidently us. Dad saves universes. He usually saves his own, but he's saved this one once or twice as part of saving... everything. We know he's been here several times, though after what I think of as this time. I'm confusing you.\" \"Yes, but keep going. I have illusions I'll sort it out.\" \"The first visit was when Mom decided to have me. He said he didn't stand a chance once she'd made up her mind. She was the second Athena.\" \"Family joke, Laire. Three different mothers with the same name. We're half-brothers. Only Dutch was actually born here. Lane and I come from Dad's universe.\" \"How much of this is 'family business,' Clete?\" \"All of it. Your job as helper from now on is to not know anything you heard in this room.\" \"I want to tell my husband. He should know.\" \"WHAT?! What husband?!\" \"Relax, Clete, I haven't married him yet. I haven't even asked him yet. I guess I decided the minute I saw him. It just took awhile to realize it.\" \"Just who is this you want to entrust our lives to?\" \"Tar a'Reth h'Mun, Dutch.\" \"Chief Lord of Bernis.\" \"That's him. I don't think he'll mind being second choice.\" \"Second choice?\" \"Well, I don't think Clete would say yes and my previous reaction to rejection was a bit too extreme to ask on the off chance I'm wrong.\" Lane didn't tell Dutch and Clete all he'd seen when the future had changed. Dutch had pulled out while he was still following the path in his mind. He 'remembered' waiting until they reached the world where they would find much of what they needed to finish the ship. He went to the ship and Dutch and Clete started on locating things they'd need. He was deep in the control systems when Dutch arrived about two hours later. \"They're expecting us, Lane.\" \"Good. How much could you locate, Dutch?\" \"Parts, boards, raw materials, things we can adapt, maybe twenty percent. It will about use our fees from Amarri. Enough to establish a matrix. We're not going to be able to build most of it in this time, but probably enough to get to another.\" \"Where's Clete?\" \"Rock hunting. I left him in the university library pulling every piece of planetary survey information they had stored. We need some extremely rare minerals besides the one isotope that's not just rare.\" \"Was he having any luck?\" \"Yes, but not finding the minerals.\" \"Explain the grin, Dutch, or I won't have remembered why it's funny.\" \"He was sitting on the floor with some ancient hvorkin maps unrolled. They aren't delicate, but they aren't easy to keep flat either. There was a pretty student holding down each corner for him. You know Clete. He could feel they really wanted to help, so he gave them something useful to do. Most attractive paperweights I ever saw. He asked me to stay, but I told him I had something to do too.\" \"That doesn't sound like you, Dutch.\" \"Yeah, well, I couldn't resist. When I left, he was loosening his collar. He was getting real warm. I figured he should get himself out of this one. Besides, I've already got plans.\" \"I thought so. I just couldn't see you leaving if there were several lovely ladies around.\" \"I have plans for you too, Lane. You're going out to dinner.\" \"Dutch, I've got a lot of work to do.\" \"Nope. If you look, you'll see you go. I'd prefer you didn't search for the memory though. Everyone should get nice surprises. Three hours. Very casual.\" Lane realized he was running late. He'd gotten involved and the three hours had slipped away. He really didn't want to leave what he was doing, but Dutch had pulled the double promise from him. He would go to dinner and he wouldn't look into the evening's future. He wondered just how casual \"very\" was. \"Let's go.\" \"Just a minute, Dutch. Let me get shoes and a shirt. You're wearing a tux!\" \"You're fine. They're waiting.\" Dutch began pushing his protesting brother toward the hatch. Half the fun of the evening would be watching his staid brother just surrender to the silliness of the situation he was in. As soon as he got him through the hatch, the ladies helped with the pushing and they were in the transport and on their way before he got a chance to turn around and run. They helped hustle him into the restaurant too. \"Dutch, I may strangle you. This is not what I would call 'very casual.' How could you do this to me? Why didn't I remember this?\" \"It was there. One of the first images I saw in the change. You weren't looking at anything in the near future. Your mind was on the war that wouldn't happen. Relax. Oh, oh. Clete may make things a bit warm out tonight.\" Lane started to laugh. He sat in the midst of a bevy of beautiful women in evening gowns, shirtless and barefoot, his only attire the pair of faded pants he wore when he worked on the ship. The women were enjoying it as much as Dutch was. They kept dragging him onto the dance floor. He tensed and took a deep breath. At least he wasn't cold. Clete was keeping things quite warm. He was beginning to wonder how Dutch could handle the heat in his tux. Laughter became giggles when Dutch answered the thought almost as soon as he had it. \"That's it. I'm dying. Here hold this.\" Dutch handed his jacket to the pretty woman on his left and proceeded to strip to the waist. Soon, he was dressed, or undressed, to the same extent as Lane. Two of the bernisi came in shortly thereafter and the evening got strange and wild. No one in the club minded the dance floor being taken over. The friendly combat of the four beautiful warriors was the best show in town. They carried the wildness with them as they hit club after club. They ran into Clete in the early hours of the morning and laughed as the four young women with him reduced him to their state of dress. Two more bernisi joined them and they prowled the capital. The city became one wild celebration. The streets filled and the summer night rang with peeling bells. The war was over. **** Dutch did a fast lookover of physical facilities when they landed on a world that wasn't human. It had been the third Fed explorers had discovered with people that looked like them and definitely advanced enough they wouldn't damage the culture introducing themselves. The bernisi had pointed them that direction, the opposite side of Fed space, and told them there were interesting worlds there. Dutch was rather sure they wouldn't have if they didn't know they'd carefully make sure of it first. He smiled when he stepped into Lissa and headed for the bridge. He didn't need to yell or query the ship comp for his brothers' locations. He hadn't since Clete had freed them of their barriers. It was very nice not being the only one who needed to. He'd never been jealous that Clete could find them by their feel and Lane knew where they'd be, but it had been a wish he'd never expected to have granted and meant a great deal to him. \"The facilities are the best I've seen outside the Federation. They can do the exterior modifications. We've got one problem. There's a source for the element we need, but it's held by some pretty nasty people.\" \"We've got a solution to that, but he's not going to like it.\" \"Not Clete again! Lane, he's going to get real difficult to live with. We're using him. I don't like it.\" \"It's not quite the same situation. He'll need you. I won't be much help. In fact, none.\" \"You're hiding something. Something bad. I like this less and less. You expect to be... Show me.\" \"Yes, you need to know. It's going to happen soon. I'm ready for it. You need to be. Take my hand. I warn you, it's going to be bad.\" \"NO! I want it changed! I want it stopped! I won't let you! You can't do it, Lane! Please, try to find--\" \"Dutch, it's the only way I could find. You know I looked. I get through it. We get what we need. We clean up a mess. Clete ends it. Dutch, I grow stronger for it. We need what we get from it. It's my choice. I choose not to change it. Clete's coming. You'll have to get yourself under control. Accept it. This is the way I want it.\" \"I'm going to talk to Clete. We have to work this out between us. You may be overruled, Lane. This will be harder on us than you can imagine. The choice isn't only yours to make. Stay put. I'll talk to you later.\" He caught Clete before he got to the ship and told him they needed to talk. He led him to a place he could explode, a place wide open and empty. Lane would wait. He believed they would accept his decision. \"I told him we had the right to choose too, Clete. He's sure it shouldn't be changed. Truly believes changing it would negate a lot of things we accomplish. He's positive he can take it. Question is, can we. Can you?\" \"Leave me. Get as far away from me as you can and do it fast. He'll know our decision. I can feel yours. Go.\" Dutch ran for the ship. He found Lane, shoved him into an empty cabin and locked him in. He got himself locked into another and destroyed the remote for the door. He waited. Clete couldn't contain it much longer. Fury. Blind, unreasoning, fury. Rage. Dutch had a fraction of a second to recognize it, then it washed thought away. He fed it. Gave it his power. The police didn't have enough men. Brawls broke out everywhere, even in the police stations. It passed quickly. There weren't any severe injuries. The physicians marveled there weren't. Clete let Lane and Dutch out, then they went out and got drunk. They had a lot of company. Psychologists began long papers about the racial memory that had caused thousands to suddenly go berserk and attack with their bare hands. Psychics spoke of the release of the anger within. Theists preached of the fury of gods. It happened four days later. Dutch screamed in anger when he felt Lane lose consciousness, but he was a long way away. He yelled for Clete to stay with the ship. He was working very hard when he got back to Lissa. There was no point in trying to hide the pain he felt. Clete knew it and he knew he hurt just as much. Dutch let the tears he'd been holding back flow, when he laid down the tools he was holding and pulled him into his arms. \"They picked him up with a couple dozen others on the university grounds. We can't even go after him. The ship won't be ready for days. The planetary police chased them, but were afraid they'd kill the innocents. Clete, they stunned them. Loaded them like cordwood on grav carts. Carried one each as a shield. Kids mostly. Students. I got the story from a semi-hysterical secretary who saw it out a window. Slavers. They've never hit a population center before.\" \"And they won't again. Let's get the ship ready. I'm empty where he belongs. Dutch, stay close. You keep me here. Something in me wants to... break free and join him.\" \"Damn. There's a lot to this he didn't see. I feel stretched. Pulled. Like you describe. It didn't happen when we were in the fleet. We've developed some kind of bond. A gestalt. More than the sum of its parts. I could find him by the direction of the pull. I'll know when it begins. Four systems away and I'll know.\" \"I'm going to be very angry before this is over.\" \"So will I, Clete. So will I.\" Lane awoke cold and chained. He knew much more time had passed than if he'd just been stunned. The lack of a headache would have told him that if he hadn't known where he was. He was on display and being sold. He forced himself to relax. The casual handling would soon end. The unit clamped to his head would complete its scan and his price would go up, way up. He saw the blue-skinned anthropoid's eyes widen when he looked at the screen. He nearly laughed as the unit was replaced with another. When it displayed its results, the blue male ran toward the central auction area. He had just become the most valuable piece of property on the planet. It didn't take long for that person to return with another. The memory began when the technician who had run for his superior spoke. \"A perfect specimen, physically and mentally. Bidding will be heavy. A unique item of unknown origin, not of any species we've encountered before. We believe it breedable with technological assistance.\" \"Take a sample. I want the results before he's auctioned. Sale contingent upon signing a no-cloning clause. He is unique, therefore trebly valuable. Minimum to be the highest any single sale has ever brought. Curtain the area. Private showing only. Ascertain if viewers can afford him. Post test results on the central screen. I'd take him myself if he wasn't going to make the clan rich.\" Lane jerked against his chains when the obese male touched him. The male smiled. He followed his memory. It held a path to what they needed. \"I will warn you. Do not touch me again.\" \"I have decided to do the sampling myself. Call me when the curtains are in place. Have a physician standing by. He will receive his first lesson as a slave from me. He will need repair. I find I wish to see the color of his blood.\" Lane followed the memory which showed him how to distance his mind from his body. He found the link with his brothers and sheltered his mind in their caring. He returned to himself strengthened. The pain was not great. The physician was efficient. There would be no evidence of abuse when he was viewed. He was carefully cleaned. The last thing that was done was the removal of the gag. The slaver hadn't wanted his clientele to know he was selling used goods. He knew what was coming, but couldn't help fighting against the eye cover and mouthpiece. The screens before his eyes were blank. He tried to distance himself, but the disk on his forehead prevented it. He would have cried out, but the mouthpiece stopped him. He was twice branded. His owner had claimed him, and his progeny. He fainted. He awoke and his tasks began. The screens filled and his mind worked. He had no choice. He was the creative element, the intuitive circuit, of a vast machine intelligence. He felt when his body was used, but the work never ceased. Nutrients dripped into his veins. Wastes were removed by filtration of his blood. He neither slept nor rested. He was aware of all that was being done. Aware of hands and laughter. Aware of being moved and touched. Damaged and healed. Aware of what was being taken from his mind and body. He was not aware of the passage of time, his ostentatious display, nor of the price paid for each integration performed, each touch felt. The one who had purchased the unique item at a price no other could have paid stroked him and smiled. He was an excellent example of why he could pay more than anyone else. He had recouped his price in a very few days. He invited his guests to enjoy themselves and ordered menial slaves to serve them. He would enjoy their envy. He kept a physician nearby. He always got carried away when he had an audience. This night was no exception. He became a bit angry with himself. He lost money when pain blanked the mind for several moments. He made up for it by selling chances on the use of his slave for a short period. He was delighted when the female who won invited all to participate. The mind blanked again, but the entertainment had been worth the cost. Dutch did a last systems check in engineering. They'd lifted as soon as Lissa was capable of it and had been working to complete her the entire journey. He ran for Clete as soon as he was done. He knew he wasn't on the bridge, but he didn't know why until Clete backed out of the area where they'd built their replicator and turned around. The photon cannon in his arms was an eloquent statement of his gentle brother's burning anger. \"The ship's ready.\" \"I felt it when you got sure. Carry this. I'll get the other one.\" \"He didn't have this in his memory.\" \"I don't plan on talking to him about it, Dutch. That society is diseased. We're going to perform surgery and remove the malignancy. It must be done before we release him. I'm not going to let him blame himself for it. I'm not going to feel guilty about it. Are you?\" \"No. I want the slaver. You take his owner.\" \"Done.\" Two men took apart a world. They began with the ships that rose from the single city to drive them off. They demolished buildings and destroyed vehicles. Slaves slew their masters and protected the backs of the two men in slave clouts with photon cannons in their hands. They found Lane and Clete went wild. Fury set fire to the planet. This rage was directed. It had a focus. Dutch found the slaver and told him who he was. He looked at the bloody thing he held in his hand and smiled. He left the cannon. He didn't need it. Clete left his weapon too, just dropped it. The raging mob grew silent and watched when he began to take apart a building with his hands. They made way for the man who stalked the streets, spattered with blood and dripping gore. Dutch helped Clete demolish the building around Lane. When they reached the vault, where the one who had paid to use and abuse him so badly had taken shelter, they quickly rebuilt a scan unit to read the lock, then Dutch went back to Lane and Clete entered the vault alone. He knew it contained dozens of armed men. They would not stop him. The last thing, the one who had called himself Lane's owner, saw was Clete's cold eyes and icy smile. The people in the streets huddled together in silence. The rage was more than they could hold, more than all of them could encompass. It had passed beyond them. Dutch was gently disconnecting Lane when Clete got there. He'd been unconscious since the power to the machine had failed. He would soon awaken, but they'd be done before he did. They wrapped a slave clout around him, then they smashed the machine with their hands, took the rare element from its heart and wrapped Lane's hands around it. Clete ripped open a water main and they cleansed their blood-drenched bodies. They sat down and held Lane between them until he awakened, smiled softly and told them it was time to leave. No one else died. The freed slaves had no more anger. They watched the three walk away from a city that was no more. Retribution had come to the clans that had enslaved a god. Lane knew he was still a bit confused by the time he'd been in the machine, but he was sure he'd have remembered remembering… He quit chasing the thought in circles and just asked Dutch. \"Is Clete all right?\" \"He will be. Just give him time, Lane.\" \"He's so withdrawn.\" \"DAMMIT! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?! I'm sorry, Lane, but you had to know. You say you gained something. Well, he lost something.\" \"Dutch, I guess my future memory isn't the only thing still only semi-functional. I don't understand.\" \"I hope you never do.\" \"Dutch, what did he lose?\" \"Innocence. Now, stop thinking about it. It's done. The choices were made. The blood spilled. The knowledge gained. Use it. Help me put this matrix together.\" Lane put one part of his mind on the task before him, but with another he sought to order his future memories and find the sound of Clete's laughter in them. When he found Clete's laughter, he saw what he must do. \"Put it away, Dutch. We have something else to do. I can't tell you what. It's got to be a surprise. Keep Clete busy. We're changing course. We're close, so we'll be setting down in about an hour. Go away. I want the bridge. Don't ask. It's part of the healing.\" He commed ahead. They'd be waiting. It was the perfect time, halfway through the two-day event, just in time for the celebration of acceptance. He landed the ship and smiled. They were waiting. \"Clete! Dutch! Let's go. Come on. We don't want to hold things up. They've got everything ready. Boy, am I glad the first thing we get are baths and appropriate costumes. You guys are grimy. Move. Move. Don't ask. You'll see.\" The bath was wonderful, if a bit overattended. The hot volcanic springs were the center of existence on Bernis, believed to hold great power of healing. The traditional warrior costumes suited them well. Clete and Dutch had learned they'd landed in the middle of Laire's wedding. They were ready in time for the acceptance ceremony and hurried to places in the Hall of Lords to hear it. \"I, Tar a'Reth h'Mun, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" \"I, Laire Brith Kardina, accept you as my mate. You burn with the fire of the hills. I claim your fire.\" The hall rang with cheers. The Chief Lord had chosen and been chosen. It had been well past time. The Amarri woman was worthy. She had been worth the waiting. She would bear warriors of Bernis. Any woman touched by the fire of Bernis bore children to her people. Any man touched by it sired them. It was the greatest of the survival traits of their ancient species. \"Congratulations, Laire. You're going to be very happy.\" \"Thank you, Lane. Look, boys, don't go away. I've got to join the women. They want to see if I'm fit to go with them into battle. They're the home guard. Wish me luck. They're a formidable bunch.\" \"Actually, they're the ground troops on any world, but you know that and are waiting to see if we do.\" \"Caught, Lane, but still nervous.\" \"You'll do great. They love a woman who can bring a chief lord to his knees. Right, Tar?\" \"Yes, Dutch, and they had begun to despair that I would find one. I'm glad you're here. This day is one of great victory for me.\" \"You're a lucky man.\" \"Yes, Clete, I am. I wasn't sure she'd accept me.\" \"What?!\" \"Last night was our trial together. I feared her decision.\" \"I still don't understand.\" \"How do the humans say it? Oh, yes. Clete, my friend, you are a very tough act to follow.\" Clete stared at Tar for a moment and Dutch and Lane started to laugh. He was speechless. Tar grinned at him and suddenly he roared with laughter. The knot inside Lane untied. Innocence might be gone, but laughter had returned. Laire smiled at the sound. She helped the ladies lay their plan of battle for the evening. She made introductions, then whisked Tar away and left the dozen, dusky, unattached women around them. They were carrying carafes of wine and three extra glasses. She smiled at Tar. By morning, she and he would be viewed with near awe. \"Oh, my head.\" \"Don't talk so loud, Dutch. Where's Clete?\" \"You're asking me?\" \"You either, huh? I thought we'd decided not to do that again.\" \"We were set up by an expert. Good Lord, I don't believe it!\" \"Well, now we know where he is. Come on. Let's get to the hot springs.\" \"Yeah, before it gets embarrassing to be seen in public.\" Clete found them at the springs in the early afternoon. He had a rather large party escorting him. He smiled and sighed as he slipped into the water. \"Lane, I've got a buzzing in my mind.\" \"I noticed it too, Dutch. Strange sort of thing.\" \"You know, it's kind of familiar. Bit distracting.\" \"That's true. Any suggestions?\" Clete looked from one to the other. They were leading up to something. \"We could try asking him.\" \"Asking me what, Dutch?\" \"Clete, could you please try not to purr so loud?!\" They got quite a bit done that afternoon. Lane defined the space and programmed it while Clete and Dutch set up the matrix. The two parts had to be finished as a unit. They set the chunk of rare isotope into its brackets below the pilot's station and crossed their fingers. Lane sent current through it and started the program running. A wave of dizziness passed through them. They walked to the door of their small hold and Lane laid his hand against it. \"Now we see if we really did it.\" He pushed the door open and walked through. \"Incredible! Where did you get it from?\" \"Everywhere, Dutch. I started here with... well, a hotel lobby. Central herbarium, fountain... Like the fireplace? It'll burn forever. You can reshape it, poke it, add fuel. A real fire, but a program. Through those doors is a pool and gymnasium complex. Those lead to kitchen and dining areas. Remember all those questions I asked you? Come on. Let me show you the results.\" \"Lane, I want to see that fire program.\" \"I'll show it to you later, Dutch, but I want to show you what's down this hall first. This door leads to… \" \"Perfect! It's perfect! Incredible! The colors, the shapes. Wonderful!\" \"This is your space, Dutch. It's like a holosphere. You can change it, within limits. It'll always be a set of rooms, living quarters. You'll have to fill your closets, but never will any of us stand waiting for a shower again. Want to see Clete's?\" \"I want to see it.\" \"Right across the hall, Clete. Come on. You know I'm enjoying myself immensely. Open that door.\" \"Lane! How... \" \"Told you. Like a holosphere. The enclosed courtyard is primarily holoreality. It has day and night, sun and moonlight. The furnishings are 'big and comfortable.' The bedroom opens onto the courtyard too. You have a very modern frontier feel. Fireplace works like the one in the living room. You can even put it out and start a new one. There are birds in the trees, but I didn't see any need for bugs. Stock real food if you want it. These are really just large bedrooms. They're not meant to be complete homes. Come on. I want to show you mine.\" \"I'm coming. I just want to see-- Lane, that's outrageous! That bed would hold eight!\" \"Large and comfortable. This way. End of the hall is mine. Like the door? Mahogany. Wood and brass. I'm going to fill the bookshelves with the real thing. Nice thing about holoreality, it doesn't have to be polished. Nice, big, four-poster in the next room. My fireplace is smaller, but went with the décor. Dutch, I didn't give you one because it just didn't fit with your ultramodern requests.\" \"I have no complaints at all, Lane. I wouldn't use it. If I want to sit by a fire, I'll do it out in the central area. Lighting controls?\" \"Voice. Water is the only thing you get that's real. Food synthesizer is in the kitchen. This way.\" \"We're going to really like this too, Dutch. He's real smug.\" \"He deserves to be, Clete.\" \"Yeah, he does.\" \"Thank you.\" The kitchen was a homey place set up for synthesis or real cooking. It had a breakfast nook and a well-appointed dining area. The pool, spa and gymnasium complex had been very carefully planned. It was a very well-thought-out arrangement. \"I've got one more set of doors. I don't even know exactly what's behind them. I know there's a lab and computers and... Well, this piece in the front is an add on. Behind those doors is everything in the Wabbit program. A finite infinity. I... peeked at the program. It made me miss Dad so much I stopped. Oh, I forgot! Hold is behind the other doors in the gym. Lissa is now the outside framework of her own dimension. All those numbers we crunched were to integrate a cargo transporter. It's a pretty complicated process. The cargo lift is no longer operational. Here are your keys. The hatch now has a lock. Look familiar don't they. Damn, I miss him.\" \"We could visit, Lane.\" \"Dutch is right. She needs a test run. We could find him. Look. Is it a problem?\" \"Clete, I'm sure I'd have noticed it.\" \"Let's try something. I've been wondering if we could use your future memory more effectively. Remember how we hunted a solution when you saw those drug dealers were... going to kill him? Let's see what would happen.\" \"Clete, you know what… \" \"Yes, I know how hard it was to let Dutch take the chance and have faith Dad would be in time to save him, but they're both alive and they wouldn't be if we hadn't.\" \"Clete's right, Lane. We need to be able to use it as a way to gauge our actions.\" \"Dutch, I think you just like making me dizzy. All right. The couches by the fireplace. We... Oops! We hurry! Come on! Things are already starting to change.\" They laughed and ran after him. They'd made the decision to make a test run and find their father. The future Lane saw was changing. He didn't quite make the couch. He was laying on the floor giggling. Clete picked him up and put him on one. \"I don't believe it! They were defined in the program! He surprised me again!\" \"How about explaining that, Lane?\" \"We're complete, Dutch. Engines, computer banks, everything. The banks only hold basic information. Telas couldn't have carried their store of knowledge, but the processing capacity is there. You know, I'll bet he carried... It would have taken most of his memory. For us from Dad. A present. He wouldn't have trusted it to anything else. I thought... Clete, you even commented you were worried because you'd seen him using the ship comps to store info. Now we know why. We also know why even Dad couldn't remove Telas' augmentation. He's trusted us with the best-kept secret in the Fed. No Fed comp could have held all the program. His living brain is the basis of the system. Alice lies behind the doors in the gym.\" \"Alice? All of... Yippee! I don't have to spend years building engines!\" There were some problems. Lissa didn't fully integrate into the system. They went to work on it. First they dropped the transporter. It was an insoluble lump in an otherwise smooth blend. They redesigned the bridge. In fact, they practically gutted her and started over. They finally hit the solution when they put her on the inside instead of the outside. They put her back together. She was a ship within a ship. They moved the controls for time/space flight off the bridge and into their living room. They had two ships. Lissa could be dropped free and used independently. They dubbed the time/space ship Melissa. They entered it in her log. They hoped she liked it. Lissa had transporters and weapons. Melissa did not. Melissa could travel in time and was virtually indestructible. Lissa was not. Lissa fit inside Melissa. They thought it a very neat arrangement, especially when they learned Melissa could be made very small on the outside even with Lissa in her. It meant they could 'stack' their father's ship in her. When they told Melissa to choose her own shape, they decided she definitely had a sense of humor and was 'sweet' on Lane. She'd found the perfect way to tease him. Her shape of choice was a small 'wood,' scarf-draped, fortune-telling booth. They gave up trying to figure out why Lissa was in Melissa even when she wasn't. The answer had to be because Melissa wanted her there. They just stepped through the door in the back of the booth, stepped out of Lissa's hatch, slapped it closed, walked two meters to the hold and entered the living room, even when Melissa was in Lissa's hold. Their ship had a unique personality and a stubborn streak. She was not a copy of Alice and they were delighted with her. \"Lane, where and when do we find Dad?\" \"At one of his favorite fishing spots. About the same amount of time has passed for him as for us.\" \"Better. Why were you so worried about it, Dutch?\" \"I don't know, Clete. Yes I do. His voice. I want to hear his voice just as it was. Just as I hear it in my memory. I'll never forget hearing my mother's voice again. I was twenty-three and somewhere I was four. I was a brand new ensign. Her voice came over the comm channel. The captain sent me to sickbay. I was useless on the bridge.\" \"Don't tell him.\" \"What?\" \"Don't tell him. You ache when you talk about it. He didn't think about you running into her. It was a scar he didn't intend to open.\" \"But, Clete, it was wonderful. I... Oh, I see what you mean. It brought it all back. I heard her and knew when she would die. How alone I'd be. Yeah. I won't tell him.\" \"You two get by the hatch. We have to get out before he runs for it. Others who arrive in his vicinity like we will intend to kill him.\" \"Don't be far behind, Lane.\" \"I won't, Dutch. Hurry. We're about to land.\" They stepped out and Dutch yelled, \"Dad!\" He'd been halfway through the door. He spun around and stared at them. He was still standing with his mouth open and one hand on the door when Lane joined them. He stepped away from the door and smiled. They ran for him like boys. Clete steadied him until he got his breath back. Dutch had nearly knocked him flat. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Dad, that has a rather obvious answer. We smelled fish frying a universe and several thousand years away.\" \"Dutch, you haven't changed.\" \"No, but you have. You've been taking very good care of yourself. Gotten very comfortable. No workouts, good food--\" \"Ignore him. We built Melissa and she needed a test run. This is where we all wanted to bring her, to find you. What's wrong?\" \"Clete, do you have any idea how hard it was to say goodby to you? Now I have to do it again!\" He hadn't changed. He still knew exactly when they needed to be shouted at. They told him how they'd filled their years and asked how he'd filled his. He told them of his wanderings and his battles. He spoke of people he'd met and parted from. Clete ached for him. They were three together. He was, as always, alone. Even though he knew he'd have disagreed and pointed out Alice was always with him, it still hurt. They showed him their ships, introduced him to Melissa and talked long hours before the fire. Lane told him they'd learned to choose the changes they would make. Gallant laughed when Clete walked out of the kitchen, handed him a towel and noted his surge of relief had been a surprise to him too and he was cleaning up cocoa while he made more. He spent several days with them. One evening his gentle smile told them it would be their last. He wouldn't say goodbye. He'd said it too many times to people he loved. In the morning he was gone. They set course for the doorway. They would see him again. Someday.",

      "content": "Chapter Four They explored their universe through time. They became wanderers. They'd begun with an orderly exploration, but soon tossed away the plan. Lane told them their future was getting acquainted with their ship and the universe, for awhile. They enjoyed Earth in a great many periods of its history. They avoided wars. They knew how Earth's wars turned out and what they eventually led to. It was a rocky road, but she was exactly how they wanted her. They were having breakfast when Dutch sighed. \"I'm bored. Let's find something to do.\" \"Just what did you have in mind, Dutch?\" \"You're grinning at me. You were waiting for me to say it. All right, Lane, what's up?\" \"Time to make some changes. We're going to do some real traveling. I want to stock up on Earth. There are things that just can't be synthesized or replicated properly. Melissa is going to be very cooperative and take us in just like Lissa would. Put together lists of everything you want. Not too long. If it can be replicated successfully, don't include it.\" \"Champagne and caviar. Blue jeans. The real thing. Real cotton and silk kimonos. Leather boots.\" \"Dutch, most of that is very easy to replicate.\" \"I know, Clete, but we don't have a lot of the patterns I want. I know where to get them though. Old Meister will have almost everything, including the best roses ever grown. I wonder if he's still mad at me.\" \"Probably, fathers tend to get angry when their daughters are unhappy. If I remember, you made two of them unhappy.\" \"I never said I'd marry them, either of them. Why does every set of twins think I should choose between them?\" They landed Melissa at the spaceport and started their shopping trip. Jan Meister wasn't angry. In fact, he spent a great deal of time telling Dutch how happy his daughters were. Dutch didn't mind, though he did get a little tired of looking at grandchildren at about the two hundredth holoframe. Meister was a collector. He shared his collection by allowing replicator patterns to be made. Dutch shared his enthusiasm for real materials and sighed with him that no replicator would ever duplicate the feel of raw silk or the smell of real leather. Clete and Lane left the two sybarites and went to an antique book shop. Lane found several items he wanted. Clete discovered the collection of ancient films and asked for copies of several. He made an instant friend when he asked for Fantasia and Snow White. He walked out of the shop with a complete collection of full-length Disney animated classics. He also carried a carefully preserved cel. The old man in the shop had decided he should have it. He thought Clete would give it the care and love it deserved. Dutch was carrying a case of champagne into Melissa when they arrived. \"Just in time. I told interested parties I didn't want any of this to go through a transporter. They thought I was a little eccentric. I stored the replicator patterns on Lissa. Give me a hand.\" \"As soon as we store our own treasures. Wait'll you see what Clete got.\" Lane placed his books in his library and watched Clete very carefully hang the cel. It was from Snow White and in amazing condition. Clete ordered a slight change in the lighting. Dutch walked in with a case of champagne in his hands and just stood and looked at the cel. He'd loved early Disney animation since he was a small child. \"You know, she's probably the reason I've never really fallen in love. I've been looking for her since I was three.\" They moved all the items Dutch had stacked on grav carts into the ship, put them away, then opened a bottle of champagne. Melissa did her Lissa imitation and they left Earth. As soon as they'd cleared the watchful eyes of Earth control, Lane set coordinates for some real traveling. He remembered they were needed a third of the way across the universe and several thousand years in the past. They explored on the way, but inside the ship. One of their explorations was of the ancient books Lane had found, especially the cookbooks. Clete liked to cook too, but he liked 'homey hearty fare.' Dutch was the perfect person for whom to cook. He made coffee, and anticipated \"YUM!\" the entire time they worked. He truly appreciated it, and the synthesizer began to make more 'raw' than cooked foods. Lane was becoming an artist in the kitchen. Their father and Clete could do 'spectacular,' but Lane was the one who enjoyed it most. They were approaching the world when Dutch and Clete agreed he'd found a better recipe for wild mushroom and black walnut wine sauce, and he had a recipe his father would want. He and Clete were both 'after' their father's pizza sauce. Dutch chose a lovely brandy for after dinner. \"I'm awed, Lane.\" \"Thank you, Dutch. This one I will trade to Dad, then the sauce for your sausage, Clete.\" \"Nope, you'll share. You aren't going to make pizza as often as we like to eat it.\" \"I don't think you can change that one, Lane. I'll help talk him into making the sausage whenever you want to cook with it.\" \"I had no doubt of it, Dutch.\" \"Talk to us about the faint undercurrent of dread, Lane.\" \"It's an Earth-type planet with a similar development pattern. The culture is the closest we'll ever find to the Western culture of Earth, at least in this era. Humanoid in the extreme, though gravity is a bit lower.\" \"One of the worlds seeded with life a bit later than others?\" \"Dutch, Dad told me to leave the question of the seeded worlds alone when I was four. I don't think he knows why he's sure he, and we, should, but he is.\" \"OK. But it's still a valid question.\" \"He's right, Lane. Is there enough difference in gravity to need to retrain for it?\" \"No, not even enough for the people to show it much. They've got themselves in a real mess. They're about to destroy their world.\" \"Lane, you said it was in a stage about equal to the Earth's nineteenth century. How can they destroy themselves?\" \"I wish I had an answer to that, Dutch. We've got a real mystery. Technology makes a big leap, then in about twenty years, they blow themselves up in a nuclear war. We may have found another time traveler.\" \"That's not good. If you're right, we've got a real problem too. When are we?\" \"I'm following my memory, Clete. We find a blasted world, then journey into its past. At that point, we have to change things. There she is. A radioactive cinder. I remember us doing a thirty-year jump.\" \"Do fifty. See what happens.\" \"Well, that's it. Clete, take over. I'm down.\" Dutch grabbed him and got him to a couch. They'd made the first change. It was a fairly small one, so Lane should steady in a few moments. Melissa landed in a small clearing. There was a frontier city about a kilometer away. Lane moved them forward two years and a partial-season. \"All right, Lane, now what?\" \"Side arms practice, Dutch. Projectile weapons. Outside. Attracts the attention of a boy about twelve. He's our guide. Clete, put a corder and medunit in your pocket. This is going to be a rough go. I've got multiples. Nothing clear. Dutch, be careful. Snow White lives here, but you're the wrong prince.\" \"Figures. I'm going to meet the girl of my dreams and I'm not the boy of hers. You steady enough to hit the buttons on the replicator?\" \"Yes, but every choice we make will cause a few seconds of confusion. There are just too many images to find a clear path. I'm going to be semi-useless. We'll just have to play it out.\" \"Why am I carrying a corder and medunit?\" \"That happens right away. The corder locates us a small gold deposit. The medunit saves our young guide's life. His mom is going to be very grateful, Clete. Be gentle. She's very lonely. She thinks her husband is dead.\" \"And he's not.\" \"No. Good. That takes care of a half-dozen of the multiples. You made up your mind the right way, of course. These are about right. There you are, Dutch. Choose clothing and sidearms along those lines. Clete, you're going to look real big to these people.\" \"Yeah, I figured that out when you said we didn't need to retrain. Big man to knock down. I'm going to spend half my time trying not to break anyone.\" \"We're all going to have problems. I think I see a way to shortcut them, but we'll have to watch our... Yes, keep that medunit handy. We make some unscrupulous unfriends.\" \"What you mean is our backs sprout holes.\" \"Would you rather fight every man in town, Dutch? And every one that hits town? All one at a time? If we clean them up all at once, you'll have more time for ladies.\" \"Oh, well, what's a few holes?\" They'd spent a lot of time practicing with weapons used by various cultures, first with their father, then while they were in the academy. Though those were only from the cultures humans had met, there weren't great differences in them. They'd practiced more with 'variations' since. Clete really couldn't resist making them work as a team and Dutch couldn't resist turning anything into a show. It was going to prove very useful. Their guide arrived not long after they began practicing with replicas of Colt 45's outside Melissa. They were near enough like the guns common to the culture to be custom-made for show people. Their young guide arrived while they practiced. \"Gee, I've never seen anybody shoot like that!\" \"Hi. We practice a lot. Goes with the show.\" \"Trick shots, huh? Interestin' guns. Can see bigger wouldn' bother you guys none. You're kind of in the middle of nowhere for a medicine show. Who are you fellas?\" \"I'm Dutch. He's Clete and that's Lane. We're retired. The booth came down through the family. We're real sentimental about it. Usually leave it in a safe place. The clearing looked good.\" \"How'd you get it here? Where's your mounts? Are you stayin' in town? Want to have supper at our place?\" \"Whoa! Let's see. Lane, do you remember all those questions?\" \"In order: a friend dropped us off; don't have any; haven't decided yet; we'd love to, if we can pay back with a few chores. What's your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Shoulda' said. I'm Billy Kendirk. Come on. We need to get goin' so Ma knows to make for more 'fore she starts dinner. We definitely got chores you can help with. Pa's been gone awhile and me and Ma ain't been keepin' up too good.\" Lane knew when it was coming. Billy was talking animatedly about his mom's berry pie. \"Look, I'll get some berries right over there. We'll have pie tonight.\" He ran right into a... Might as well call it a bear. Filled the same niche. Grew just as big. Was just as hairy and dangerous. Clete charged after him. He got swiped, but not bad. He decked the bear and went to work on Billy. Dutch and Lane picked berries. Billy had taken a beating for berry pie. He deserved to have it. \"I healed everything major. Left the superficial stuff. Just hit him with a dose of antibiotic. Lane, that could have been prevented.\" \"I know, Clete. This memory has a way for us to really help them.\" \"Good work, Clete. He'll be real proud of his scars. How about you?\" \"Dutch, scars don't last on me. You know that.\" \"That's not what I meant.\" \"Oh. No, I could heal me, but the shirt would still have holes. Wouldn't make sense.\" Dutch laughed and thumped Lane on the back. It completely surprised him and Clete laughed and picked up Billy. He'd regain consciousness soon. Lane was giggling and complaining he was dizzy, so Dutch steered him. It didn't happen often, but sometimes Dutch just surprised him with an \"I love you.\" Dutch was a blaze of love in his soul and the love between his two brothers the most wonderful feeling in existence. Lane located the gold. He handed the corder back to Clete and he and Dutch rolled over a rock in the stream and picked up a few nuggets of placer. They rolled the rock back. The deposit itself was a few hundred meters upstream. They'd help Billy file a claim. It would get him and his mom through the rough times until his father returned. They could see how rough they'd been as they walked into the yard. Billy's mother ran for them when she saw Clete was carrying her son. \"BILLY!!\" \"Easy, Ma'am! He's roughed up a bit, but he'll be all right. Had an argument over a berry patch. My name's Clete Gallant. My brothers Lane and Dutch. Let's get him inside.\" \"Yes. Thank you. I'm Sare Kendirk.\" \"Billy said you'd trade us a home-cooked meal for a few chores. My brothers are carrying a load of berries in their shirts. Figured Billy ought to get his pie.\" He laid Billy on the bed and smiled. \"Nice kid. You can be proud of him. He'll grow up to be a fine man.\" \"Thank you. Hurts a bit he's havin' to do it so fast. You're bleeding. Take your shirt off. Do you whilst I'm patchin' Billy. Where'd your brothers go?\" \"To find things that need fixing. I'd better go help.\" \"You sit right there til I get those claw marks cleaned out. Then I'll see if we got a shirt big enough to fit you. My husband wasn't near your size, but he liked things loose.\" \"You said was.\" \"I figure somethin' happened to him and he ain't comin' back. Been gone more'n a year. Went south to buy us a good startin' herd.\" \"Lot of things other than dying can delay a man. Give it time. A good man is worth waiting for.\" \"I don't know how long we can wait. Place is goin' downhill. Me'n Billy are just scratchin' by. I'm tryin' to hold the land, but I'm wonderin' if… \" Clete realized what he'd done. She'd been alone for a long time. He'd slipped out of his shirt and she'd stopped talking. Lane had warned him. Her need washed over him. He had to get out of the house, or distract her, or something. He wouldn't be able to resist that need long. Billy woke up. Clete thought, \"Whew, kid's got good timing,\" and grinned as her emotions became maternal. Billy chattered at her as she bandaged Clete. He kept her distracted until he could get into a shirt and make excuses about helping his brothers. It was a good thing Lane had told him her husband was alive. He wondered how he'd known. \"Hi, Clete. You look warm.\" \"Dutch, you're pushing it. This corral's in bad shape.\" \"Everything is. You can see they've been trying, but they need logs split and carried. Probably don't have money for nails either. Lane's in the shed putting an edge on the ax. Help me see how many of these nails we can pound back to usefulness. Pull that rail loose. We'll redo it. It's been over-nailed. I'd say Billy's work.\" \"He's getting better. There are only a couple bent nails on the most recent.\" In three hours, they'd accomplished more than Billy and his mom could have in a month. They were finishing repairs on the roof of the house when Sare called them to dinner. She stared at the rebuilt corrals, the rehung barn door, the repaired shed wall, the rebuilt buggy and the stack of rails laying next to the shed. They dropped off the roof and went to wash up. Billy yelled and she dashed in to get her pies out. She wondered what she'd done to deserve being blessed. She was glad she'd decided to fix a bit extra because of the size of the men. They definitely deserved it. They appreciated it. \"Billy, you were right. The best berry pie I ever had. Do you feel up to a little walk? I've got something to show you. Ma'am, I'm going to have to walk off that last piece of pie. I hope you don't mind if Billy goes with me.\" \"My name's Sare, Lane. And after what you boys did around here today, I wish you coulda' held three pieces of pie. Go on, Billy. I'll wash up.\" \"No, Sare, you won't. Dutch and I already drew straws on that chore. I wash. He dries. You get to sit on the porch and watch the evening settle in.\" \"Clete, you don't have to do that. You done enough already.\" \"You did the work of cooking for three extra and spent time on those pies. We'll take care of the extra cleanup. Now, outside. Go on. Don't you feel guilty. We don't have to do dishes often. It's a novelty.\" They joined her on the porch within minutes. They were watching the sunset when Lane and Billy walked into the yard. He looked very serious, but Clete could feel his mother saw the excitement beneath. \"Ma, I'm goin' into town with them in the mornin'. I've got somethin' to do. I'm goin' in and see if I can sleep. Night.\" \"Now, what was that all about?\" \"It's his story, Sare. He's decided how he wants to tell it. He really does have things to do in town. We'll be back tomorrow evening.\" \"Lane, I don' know what you're up to, but you're all in on it. All right. He can go. Just make sure he's home before dark. I hate waitin' supper.\" She smiled at them. They were real nice men. And Clete... \"Well, we've made ourselves a spot in the barn. Might as well get a good night's sleep. See you in the morning.\" \"We're right behind you, Clete. Come on, Dutch, turn-in time. Billy's going to want to make an early start. Goodnight, Sare. I really enjoyed dinner.\" \"They're rushing me off again. You have a pleasant night. You sleep in. We'll buy Billy breakfast in town. That way you'll both get a treat. Goodnight.\" \"Goodnight, Dutch. You boys sleep well.\" Dutch strolled into the barn and grinned at Clete. \"Warm evening.\" \"Give him a break, Dutch. Even I could feel how lonely she is.\" \"Me too, Lane. How do you know her husband's coming home?\" \"We pick up a telegram from him tomorrow. He was robbed and he spent the last year out on the range, working to earn a very good small herd, and enough to get them home, from a rancher. He didn't have money for a telegram before. Clete would have answered her need and she'd have hated herself. Her husband won't be home until spring, but she won't be so lonely once she knows he's coming. Now, she and Billy will have enough to see them through. All we have to do is get him to town and back. After tomorrow, he'll be safe.\" \"Uh, huh, just how does one trip make him safe?\" \"Clete's about to get a job.\" \"Why me? Why is it always me?\" \"Relax, Clete. The first thing you do is hire us.\" Dutch stared at the animals tied to hitching rails along the street of the town. They gave him a very odd feeling. \"Lane, they're horses.\" \"Like the bear and the people, Dutch, similar evolution on a seeded world. This is a very Earth-like planet. There was very little drift. I'm just glad we spent so many of our vacations at the academy learning to ride.\" \"I used to spend my offtime in the holosphere riding too. You'd be amazed at how many women like the smell of saddle leather.\" Lane and Clete laughed. Billy, who had been leading and a bit too excited to notice Dutch had suddenly stopped, when the horses came in sight, ran back to see what was going on. They told him they were teasing Dutch about finding a horse he liked. By then, they were. Lane assured it. They went to the assay office first, then convinced the clerk at the courthouse to file the claim in Billy's name. Billy insisted on buying them breakfast at the hotel. They left him shopping at the general store and headed for trouble. It was waiting for them at the saloon. \"Lane, that place shouldn't be open this early.\" \"It's not, Clete. It's open this late. The proprietor doesn't like it, but his current clientele become violently insistent. Lawmen aren't plentiful and the only remaining deputy in town is recovering from a very close call.\" \"I suppose I'm not supposed to break anyone.\" \"Right, Dutch. Very few of these are real nasties. They just follow along.\" \"How do we find the rotten apples?\" \"They find us. You'll know who they are. They're the ones that shoot me in the back.\" \"Lovely. I suppose you can't just point them out and save us the trouble of buying you a new shirt.\" \"I get shot in the back, Dutch. I don't see them.\" \"Noisy isn't it? This is a rowdy bunch. The bartender's nervous. NO!\" \"Where's he going?\" \"He's about to stop a bully. Get ready, Dutch. Clete's about to heat things up. No one hits someone smaller, especially a woman, if he can stop it. Take the man in red plaid first. He pulls a gun.\" Clete dropped the man from the balcony. He was careful. He dropped him on several others to break his fall. Dutch relieved the man of his gun and put him down for a nap. Clete dropped from the balcony and tucked several others in. Lane was busy too. He kept removing guns from people who were aiming at Dutch and Clete. They took care of the ones aiming at him. \"Over already and I was just getting warmed up.\" \"Two. Armed. Back room. Three. Same. Upstairs. Two. Doors.\" \"Clete says you get to play some more, Dutch. You get the back room. I'll remove our unfriends outside.\" Clete had already headed for the stairs. Lane slammed the doors outward, finished putting the two men to sleep and dragged them inside. Dutch was dragging two from the back room. \"Dutch, see that door up there. When it opens, draw and shoot the gun that sticks out. It'll be pointed at Clete's head.\" Dutch drew and fired. Clete reached through the door and hauled the man out. He held him in the air with one hand and put him to sleep with the other. \"Catch. They'll break if I drop them.\" Dutch and Lane caught the three Clete dropped over the balcony railing and stacked them with their friends. They made a total of twenty-three in the pile. The bartender decided it was safe to stick his nose above the bar. \"Who are you boys?\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Dutch. This is Lane. The big man calming the ladies upstairs is Clete. Damn, Lane, let's find a cold shower. Somebody's very grateful.\" \"Let's go get him. Billy's about to need us.\" \"We'd better hurry. He gets his shirt off and we'll be fighting women too. Clete! We don't have time for them to tell you they're grateful.\" \"Hey! You don't have to push.\" \"Sure we do, Clete. Lane says Billy needs us.\" \"Why didn't you say so?!\" Lane and Dutch shook their heads and laughed when Clete dropped from the balcony and went through the doors at a run. He had Billy's problem taken care of before they got there. He was dumping the man, who'd tried to make Billy give him money when the storekeeper went to the storeroom for more flour, on the walk when they arrived. The storekeeper was pleased. He told them the man wouldn't have tried it if the town had a lawman on his feet. Clete asked why it didn't. He'd have heard how worried he was about his town if he hadn't been able to feel it. Lane told him they'd make sure Billy got home safely with his supplies. \"Dutch, go with him to the livery stable. He needs a wagon and a team. See if they've got anything we'd like. Try to find a horse big enough Clete's feet won't drag the ground. There's some good-looking tack in here. We'll help the storekeep tally and get Billy's purchases moved outside. See if you can find horses not broken to a bit. I know. They bother me lots more than they do the horses.\" \"We'll probably have to take what they've got or break our own, Lane.\" \"You know how I feel about it.\" \"We gentle them ourselves. If possible.\" \"If possible.\" \"Come on, Billy. Let's go horse shopping.\" Billy was near abounce when they returned with a wagon and team. Dutch grinned and winked at Lane. He'd found what they wanted too. \"You did well, Billy. That's a nice team.\" \"They'll pull a plow too, Lane. Ma won't have to do her garden by hand. Do you think she'll like the material I picked?\" \"It'll make a very pretty dress. Clete, you and Dutch load. I'm going to the telegraph office to see if we have any messages. Billy, come with me.\" \"I ought to help load, Lane. It's our stuff.\" \"Come on. You stay, I'll feel guilty. They don't really need us. Look. We'd be in the way. Clete heaves from the walk and Dutch guides it into place. They'll probably beat us to the corral.\" Billy cried when he read the telegram. Lane and the clerk carried on a long discussion about the weather and pointedly didn't notice. The culture was much like Earth's nineteenth century in some ways, but 'real men' not crying wasn't one. The contents of the message were personal. They were being polite and giving him 'privacy' to deal with his emotions. After he told them what the message was, the clerk wished every \"wallop\" message that came in was good news, and was glad that he'd come that day. They didn't have a lawman to take it to the ranch, and he'd have been trying to figure a way to take the good news out to them, and might have 'bent' the rules to do it. Billy said he'd tell his mother he'd been \"real pleasured to give the good news.\" Lane smiled, as they walked out. Billy was working very hard on the way he spoke. He was 'a man of substance' now and intended to sound like it. His purchases had included two thick, quite expensive, books. Early education took place at home, not in schools. Those were for older children, who wanted to learn things they couldn't, working with a parent, older relative or family friend. It wasn't an apprenticeship system. The duty of teaching a child was strong enough in the culture it was near totally literate, but the books Billy had chosen weren't for the purpose of teaching children to read. Those were inexpensive and plentiful. He mentioned the books and Billy began the explanation he'd remembered. He saw how the culture could produce \"bad apples.\" It was where the memory came from. That was the way it worked. His memory was cluttered with would-have-been and it was wonderful. Dutch didn't allow nightmares and Clete told him if he had one. He ignored what he remembered, after a point. Dutch wouldn't choose that path, unless it was the right one. Clete was \"getting exasperated\" with his self-doubt. He was the one they knew could be trusted to make the best choice, always, and he didn't. Lane had the feeling that was going to change. He paid attention to feelings. Mick O'Herlihy had told him it would be weird if he didn't 'get hunches' and not training a very convenient talent was silly. And then gotten him into several situations he'd 'felt' his way out of, with his head spinning, and one he hadn't. He had a feeling Dutch had to accept he had their complete trust, as they had his, soon. It wasn't lack of self-esteem. It was intense admiration. He was their center, the love that filled them with joy was perfect and total, like their father's. He was going to have to accept that love inspired love, and himself. Billy and Lane reached the livery stable just as Clete and Dutch arrived with the wagon. There were a large number of people standing around. They'd heard someone had bought the big black stallion. They wanted to see what kind of fool would buy a horse that couldn't be broken. \"That's him, Clete. Only one big enough to carry you.\" \"You're right, Dutch, and he's as pretty as you said. Hand me the hackamore and the black blanket. He'll like this saddle. It'll fit well and look real good on him. I'll meet you by the other corral in a few minutes. He'll probably need shoeing. Tell the smith I want to do it myself. He's on your way.\" \"Aren't we going to stay and watch!?\" \"We really hadn't planned on it, Billy.\" \"Lane, nobody's ever ridden that horse! Nobody! He's wild. A killer.\" \"Nonsense. Horses don't kill unless they have a very good reason. We'll stay, just so you see all the horse needs is the right kind of treatment and what that is. Go ahead, Dutch. Take the wagon. We'll catch up.\" Clete was sitting on the ground in the middle of the corral softly singing. The black animal circled him several times and he ignored it. It wasn't afraid of him. He established as mutual. It became curious and edged toward him. He sang to it and looked in its eyes. He sang of rolling plains, sweet green grass and the friendship between man and beast. The black dipped its head and he gently rubbed its nose. It danced back a few steps, but soon returned. It wasn't really wild. It had just been out on the range since a colt. It had some familiarity with people and no bad experiences there, and had also been in the corral long enough to get used to people, in general. It just didn't trust them. Since most of the people around the corral felt the same way about the very big horse, it wasn't surprising. The horses of Clete's world were augmented, but it didn't take much longer for the black to decide he was more interesting than threatening. It really wasn't a 'wild horse.' Like evolution didn't mean species were identical. This animal was a bit more 'domesticated.' He'd been told it's daddy was a plow horse, and it was obvious to Clete that the animals had been pulling plows longer on that world. He slowly stood and stroked it. He held each piece of tack up and let it get acquainted with it, then laid it back on the ground. People gasped when he vaulted on its bare back and it reared. He rode it down and sang in its ears. He could feel when it calmed and slid off. He added a bit to his estimate of time domesticated. It accepted a rider \"belonged\" very quickly. He held the local version of the hackamore up and very slowly put it on. He ran his fingers under every strap to assure their placement, then picked up the blanket. He turned the animal's head with a gentle tug on the hackamore. He made sure it watched him put the blanket on. He then picked up the saddle. He turned it over in his hands and explained all the pieces. The words held no meaning for the horse, but the soft voice calmed it and the saddle became familiar. Clete made sure it was watching when he gently set the saddle in place. The horse danced a bit, but soon calmed. Lane knew when Clete cheated. He felt him spread a blanket of calm over the horse when he tightened the cinches. He was in a bit of a hurry. He swung up in the saddle and taught the black the signals of the reins. Lane opened the corral door and he rode out. No one watching got terribly excited. It had become a very calm afternoon all over town. Lane grinned. His horse was going to be very easy to 'gentle.' He watched Clete ride toward the smithy and he and Billy went to find Dutch. \"Very nice, Dutch. Stallions.\" \"They were the only ones not bit-broken, Lane. Besides, I thought the two buckskins went nice with Clete's black.\" \"Let's saddle up. Clete's at the smithy. We'll have him check these too.\" \"Oh, no! I'll bet he takes his shirt off. There go my chances with every woman in town.\" Lane laughed. He and Dutch weren't as massive as Clete, but they were all well-proportioned. Dutch never had any trouble finding willing companions, usually several at a time. He and Clete both knew the real reason Dutch preferred multiple ladies. He thought none of them would expect attraction to develop into a long-term special relationship, if there were several. He didn't seem to realize some of them still fell in love and wanted more, but at least they knew he didn't from the beginning. They all ended up taking off their shirts. The smithy was rather secluded, so they didn't attract too large a crowd. The blacksmith changed that. He decided to have a beer and told the bartender about the size of the men working in the smithy. The bartender told him about the fight. The barmaid, who had just started her day's work. overheard. She told the girls in the hotel kitchen. Word spread. Soon every knothole in the smithy had an eye and the doorway got very crowded. Clete knew they were there, but he was keeping things calm until he finished the horses. \"Lane, as soon as he's done, it's going to get very warm around here.\" \"I know, Dutch. We'll just have to try to get him out of town while he's still thinking about his horse.\" \"Sometimes I wonder why I stick with you guys.\" \"Spillover, Clete. You need us to keep you from being mobbed. You hate it when somebody gets left out.\" \"Dutch, you're the one that likes ladies in multiples. You look for twins.\" \"Had a soft spot for look-alike ladies ever since I met Cory and Cally at the academy.\" \"There. Done. Your 'soft spot' wasn't what I was talking about.\" Dutch dumped a bucket of water over him and Clete chased him out of the smithy. They ran back in. Lane sat down on the hard-packed dirt floor and laughed. Shirtless was not something one did in public in the 'nineteenth century.' They'd shocked a very large group of women. The shock didn't last long. It wasn't Earth's 'Western' culture, just one very similar. They didn't have the same reasons to teach 'sex is sinful.' Neither unwanted pregnancy nor venereal disease was a problem and the afternoon was getting warm. Clete grabbed his shirt, swung up on the black and winced. \"I'm out of here. I'll be at the first cold stream.\" Lane and Dutch pulled on their shirts and got ready to follow. It took them awhile. They kept having to lean against things. Billy wasn't sure why they were laughing so hard, but he laughed too. He had a gold claim, supplies and a telegram to take to his mother. He was a very happy boy. The day wasn't over. They were nearing the ranch when Clete felt a problem. \"We've got company, Lane.\" \"How many, Clete?\" \"Half-dozen. Mean. Mad. Greedy.\" \"Get them for me.\" \"NO! Dutch, get Billy out of here! Lane's down! I'm after the--\" \"Sons of bitches that shot him in the back! Grab on, Billy! I'm going to put you in those rocks. We'll catch the wagon later. They won't run far.\" Dutch dropped Billy off and raced back. He heard gunfire and swung off his horse. He started his circle and took out a man holding a rifle. He wasn't gentle. He was too mad to worry about breaking him. He felt Clete's blast of rage and heard horses scream. The ones who had tried to run away would be mountless. Most people caught very little of what Clete was feeling. Most animals caught most of it. Clete stopped his horse from killing the man who had tried to kill him. Dutch ran down the two who were running. He met Clete at Lane's side. \"Bad. Damn. Why doesn't he let us know sooner?\" \"He does when it's one of us, Clete. I broke some.\" \"Me too. Slug went through. Medunit says touch and go. How far are we from Melissa?\" \"Too far. Triage. Stabilize him.\" \"He's actually sturdier than we are, Dutch. He's on his way. Go get Billy. He'll have a survivable wound by the time you get back here with the wagon. We'll use that coil of rope to secure the... men, then borrow the wagon to take them back to town.\" \"Done.\" All six men were alive, but in bad shape. Clete made sure none of them were actually dying. Billy wanted to shoot them. Dutch told him Lane would want them legally tried and convicted. Billy decided Judge Herkmer would take care of them when he rode through. In his culture, a judge decided guilt or innocence. The jury of fifteen decided penalty, within limits. If Lane lived, the men wouldn't hang. Clete didn't treat any of them. They would all be treated by a physician when they got them to town. They'd live because he'd saved Lane. That was enough. They tied the men on their horses and gently laid Lane on top of the supplies in the wagon. When they got to the ranch, they carried Lane inside, then unloaded the wagon fast. Sare just didn't understand when they began making a place for Lane in it. \"You're not going to take him with you?!\" \"Yes, Sare, we are. It's the fastest way to get him to the doctor.\" \"That bouncin' will be bad on him, Clete.\" \"We'll take it easy. We've seen enough injuries to know he'll make it. He heals real fast. He'll be fine in a few days.\" \"You're just sayin' that. He ain't gonna' make it. He's shot through the lung. If he survives, he'll be... well nigh a cripple a long time.\" \"Tell her, Clete. She'll keep it secret.\" \"Dutch... \" \"Tell her or I will. Who we are, what we are, where we come from, why we're here. I'll keep Billy busy outside.\" \"What's he mean?\" \"Lane's not going to like this. Sare, Lane wasn't shot through the lung. He was shot through the heart. He has two. We all do. Put your hands on my chest. We're not from your world. We're from the far future. Our father is... too far away to describe. It's our legacy, our job, to carry on his work. We... save worlds. This one will be murdered if we don't change the future. It will die in war. Killed by weapons that are developed too soon. We're here because someone else is here. Someone from the future. You don't believe me and I'm scaring you. Watch. This is why Lane won't die.\" He pulled the medunit from his pocket and used it on Lane. Sare gasped as she watched tissues knit together. \"It's what I used on Billy. I healed all but the flesh wound. I thought he deserved to brag about his scars. Great. Now you believe me and you're terrified. Sare, we're the good guys. The Gallants. The white knights. My mother helped destroy an army and rebuilt a world. Dutch's mother was an officer in a service that maintains the highest ideals. She gave her life to save a world. Lane's mother... I don't know. She was searching for our father. He's the true hero. We're just in the family business. Better. At least you're not terrified.\" \"You're angels.\" \"Definitely not. If Lane hadn't told me your husband was alive, I'd have proved it.\" \"How did he... \" \"Know? He sees the future. When it's terrible, we go back in the past to change it. I feel what other people feel. Dutch is the power, the love, that binds us. Lane knew he was going to be shot. It wasn't important enough to change.\" \"I was right. You're angels.\" \"Nah, just the Gallant boys.\" \"Same thing and I don't think you know much about angels. I won't tell Lane you told me.\" \"Thanks and you're right. I don't know much about angels. Lane didn't give us much briefing on the culture other than it's a lot like one we know well. He didn't even really explain why this is a frontier.\" \"The government bought it from the people who were already here. It was about empty and waitin' for the time we could meet the price. We pay half our taxes in food to earn the land, and they get it for another 68 years. Farmin' just isn't what most like to do, and they kept their numbers down, so the land could support the people huntin' and roamin' over it with their herds. When they just started blendin' in with the city people other places; goin' to school, learnin' trades and such, they worked out a plan to take care of them all and build them some schools and nice parks, horse ranches and such. It's goin' to be one country on more'n half this continent when we get this land producin' and bring the west and east together, and richer for the blendin'. I'm tryin' to think who could war like you say. It would take somethin' that would make someone true afraid.\" \"Yes, something is learned too soon. Now, not in close to a century.\" It took two days for the people of the town to come to a decision about the men keeping watch over the ones they'd brought in and put in the jail. Lane was actually 'up and around' by the time the mayor and town council visited them. He was healing incredibly fast. They'd told everyone he was lucky. Not many people could say they'd been back shot, had the bullet bounce off a bone and ended up with not much more than a flesh wound. \"Mr. Mayor, it's an honor, but--\" \"Take the job, Clete.\" \"Lane, we aren't going to be here long. They need someone who wants to help build this country.\" \"They need someone now. Today. Next week will be too late.\" \"All right. Swear me in. You've got yourself a town marshal.\" The first thing Clete did was make Dutch and Lane deputies. As soon as the official party left, they held a conference. \"All right, Lane, what do you see?\" \"Snow White and the witch. Sorry, Clete. There's a very lovely young lady who's desperately worried. Somehow, she's the key. Dutch, you're the one she turns to. Clete, the witch is your problem. She's not really that bad. You'll get her straightened out.\" \"And just what will you be doing?\" \"Spending a lot of time dizzy, Dutch. It's already starting. I need a chair. Go mingle with the townsfolk. Get acquainted. I'll be all right. I'll even meet you in the saloon. Oh, Clete, you've got another deputy. He's ready to get back to light duty. He's at the boarding house. Look him up. His name is Parker Redlore. Now go. I'm tired of keeping you in focus.\" Clete found Parker Redlore. He was a serious young man recovering from a serious injury. Clete asked to see it and did a bit of sleight of hand with the medunit. Parker decided he was fit enough to stand a watch at the jail. He told Clete he felt lots better. Clete agreed \"a reason to get up and around\" made a lot of difference. Dutch was very good at getting acquainted with the townspeople, half of them anyway. He met some men too. Then he saw Snow White. She was fairytale beautiful; black hair and porcelain skin. Perfectly proportioned to fit in a man's arms and lips created for kissing. She was also being hustled down the walk by an older woman. She looked up and right into his eyes. His head swam. He was drowning in twin blue pools. The older woman gave her arm a yank and called her a hussy. She meekly dropped her eyes and hurried along. That's when the shooting started. Dutch dove for cover. Six men were barreling down the street on horseback. As soon as they passed him, he vaulted on behind the one trailing. He tossed him from the saddle and went after the next one. He was on his third when Clete dove from atop a porch and took the lead three out of their saddles. It had been a very short jail break attempt. Clete and Dutch grabbed two unconscious men each and dragged them toward the jail. It was getting very full. Clete went back for the last two and Dutch got acquainted with Parker. He really liked the kid. The townspeople were very pleased with their full jail. They decided to hold the ice cream social, stock sale and dance, they'd been considering canceling, after all. Four men took a big wagon up into the mountains to get ice. They were quite sure the social would be well-attended. Four days was plenty of time for word to spread to outlying ranches the town was now a safe place to bring families. Their new lawmen were personally invited by a large number of people. Early that afternoon, Dutch asked Lane who should watch when. He just smiled at him. \"All right, we draw straws. Short straw takes first watch. Long straw takes last.\" \"Make that four straws, Dutch. I'm in on this too.\" \"You got it, Parker. Four straws it is.\" Dutch grinned at his new friend. Clete had been busy. Every time Parker fell asleep on the cot in the office, Clete used the medunit on him. A few more naps and he'd have nothing but a scar to remind him of the hole in his side. \"Long straw. Well, at least I'll get to see the stock show and have ice cream at the church. A lawman's work is never done. Later.\" \"Dutch, you've got the short straw. Clete's and mine are the same length.\" \"Ah, well, I wasn't that interested in the stock show and I will get to go to the dance, but I'd sure appreciate it if you'd send me a dish of ice cream. You know, Parker's really dedicated. He's a lawman because he wants to make the 'frontier' safe for people. When we leave, he should be marshal, Lane.\" \"Yes, Dutch. A real prince of a guy.\" \"Oh.\" Lane led Clete to the ice cream social. He didn't have any trouble identifying Snow White. She was obvious even before he asked for ice cream for Dutch. He grinned at Lane when he identified the witch. \"I'll take it to him.\" \"You'll do no such-- Drat that girl. I'll never turn her into a proper lady. Her father should have sent her to me years ago.\" \"Ma'am, I think you're doing a fine job. She seems like a very nice girl.\" \"Oh, she's nice enough, but she just won't walk and talk like a lady. I mean, look at the way she ran out of here. No bonnet. Runnin' down the street with a dish in her hand.\" \"Ma'am, I think being a lady is something that comes from inside. Any woman can wear a bonnet and walk and talk proper. A lady is something more. She's got you as an example. She's bound to turn out right.\" \"Please call me Bella, Marshal. Won't you have another dish of ice cream?\" \"If you'd be willing to join me in that shady spot over there, I'd love one.\" \"Lispeth, I'm goin' to sit a bit with the marshal. You come dip.\" Clete smiled as she dropped her apron on a chair and came round the table. He noticed she hadn't put on her bonnet. Bella was a very handsome woman, if a bit strait-laced. He noticed the afternoon was getting warm in his vicinity and wondered if she was planning on loosening those laces a bit. He also knew exactly when Dutch got his ice cream. \"I brought you some ice cream. The marshal said you'd asked and I... \" She was breathless and blushing. Dutch decided he was going to get hurt. He was already in love. \"Thank you. I thought it was the only thing I was going to miss this afternoon. I seem to have been very wrong. But now, it's here and you're here and I haven't missed anything after all. Let's sit on the porch. I feel like a real villain eating ice cream and sharing lovely company in front of all those misguided people back there. They call me Dutch. What's your name?\" \"Tessa. I probably should get back. My aunt will be upset if I don't.\" \"Was your aunt with you in town a few days ago?\" \"Yes. I saw what you did. You were wonderful.\" Dutch looked into her eyes and got dizzy. \"Uh, just doing my job.\" He was in trouble. She was pure and sweet and innocent, and he'd have promised to stay with her forever in that instant. And would have. And counted himself lucky. \"Speaking of jobs, you came to see me for something. You wanted to talk to a lawman.\" \"That's just the way Parker says it, proud-like. I been tryin' to think of a way to see him, but my aunt would never believe it was just business.\" \"I see. You and he are more than friends.\" \"Fore my pa sent me to my aunt's place, he used to come over of a Sabbath and have dinner.\" \"Why did your father send you to your aunt?\" \"He said to learn proper lady things, but I don't believe it. He never said anything about it before. He was scared of somethin' and wanted me safe. I'm real worried. I ain't heard from him in more'n ten days and he wasn't in church on Sabbath.\" \"It sounds like he may be in trouble. Can you tell me any more?\" \"My pa's a good man. He's real smart. He makes all kinds of interestin' things. He sells some of 'em to people to make lots of 'em. Gets money for every one they sell. We do pretty good on it.\" \"A successful inventor. A very rare and talented individual. You said you thought something had scared him. Any idea what?\" \"I don't know more'n it started after a funny little man came to visit. I watched from my window. It was pretty late at night. He got Pa out of bed. He showed Pa somethin' and he got real excited. He put on his pants and went off with him. He snuck back in early in the mornin'. Acted funny when I asked him about it. Said he'd been busy makin' us rich and I shouldn't pry.\" Dutch made the mistake of looking into her eyes again. He swallowed. It didn't help the lump in his throat at all. He hadn't expected it to help the one in his chest. \"We thought something strange might be going on around here. This town sprouted more than its usual crop of nasties recently. We've been trying to figure out why.\" \"Well, two of them fellas I seen afore. They work for a minin' company Pa built some things for. They got a big dig up in the mountains. They come got the things Pa built.\" \"Tessa, I want you to go back to the fair and find my brother... Never mind. Why don't you go to the stock show? I think you'll see someone there who will be real pleased to see you.\" \"My aunt will be mad, says ladies don't belong in barns.\" \"Your aunt probably won't even notice. Unless I miss my guess, she's in the company of my brother Clete.\" \"The marshal?!\" \"That's the one. I doubt she'll be looking for you.\" \"Aunt Bella with the marshal, she's probably just as glad I'm not around.\" She giggled. Dutch thought it was the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard. \"Thank you, Dutch. I feel lots better.\" She flashed him a dazzling smile and walked away. He groaned and buried his face in his hands. \"Dammit, Clete. Not now!\" Lane walked around the corner of the building and sat down in the chair Tessa had just vacated. Dutch didn't even look up. \"Go to the saloon, Dutch. Find company. You two were running a feedback loop. Get drunk if necessary.\" \"Lane--\" \"Go. I'll take over. You don't want to be here when Parker comes in.\" \"You're right. He'll be floating on air and all I'll want to do is ground him. You all right?\" \"Yes. You've made the change. I needed a nice quiet place to let the images settle. Now, GO!\" Dutch was too busy meeting people to actually drink much, but he had several companions, two of whom were carrying unopened bottles, when he got to the large open area where the fair, which the people called a \"social,\" was being held. The sound of gunfire had attracted his attention. It didn't surprise him at all that Clete found him immediately. He was feeling pretty strange. \"Dutch, you're going to get drunk.\" \"Yes, Clete, I certainly am. Lane's orders. The girls are his idea too. What's going on?\" \"Sharpshooting show.\" \"About time for Lane to show up. Let's show off. I need it. Ego boost. Found out a knight loses to a prince.\" \"The way it has to be.\" \"Come on, girls. The Gallant boys are about to join the show.\" \"I'd have never known he'd been drinking. Do you really intend to be in the show?\" \"If Dutch says he needs it, he needs it. I'll find you a nice place to sit and watch, Bella. Just promise you won't go away. I plan on taking you dancing later.\" \"Don't you worry, Marshal. I'll be right where you can find me.\" \"Hi, Clete, Ma'am.\" \"You know what's going on, Lane?\" \"Yes. We'll be waiting for you. Routine three. The whole thing. The horses are standing behind the grandstand.\" \"He really does need a boost. Alcohol?\" \"He really does and you know he'd never pull a gun if he didn't know exactly how much he'd had and what its effect would be.\" \"Yeah, he wants the anesthesia, but needs the boost. Routine three should be enough of one to reduce the desire for the anesthesia. I'll be there.\" Clete found a place in the grandstand for Bella and met Dutch and Lane by the horses. The horses weren't trained for the routine, but they'd only use them for the intro. They vaulted on. They were riding bareback. Clete nodded and Lane signaled the emcee. They kicked the horses into motion and started boosting Dutch's ego. They rode, tumbled, shot, tumbled, shot again. Then they really started showing off. The finale was perfect. Dutch started his run. Lane did the lift and Clete tossed him. He soared into the air, did an impossible double fast draw, and shot the tops off six pennants at the top of his flight. He reholstered the guns and dropped onto their crossed arms. They tossed him into the air and did handsprings. They ended in a line and set six guns spinning in perfect synchronization. They spun and put two shots each through the center of the target, spun guns into holsters, turned toward the audience and bowed. Total silence. They whistled for their horses and vaulted on. They actually got out of the performing ring before the place exploded in cheers. \"I FEEL BETTER!\" Lane and Clete laughed. They told their horses they were wonderful and Lane led them back to their stalls, then he began looking for company. The band was tuning up and the dance would be foot-stomping fun. Company found him. A lot of it. Dutch swept through with more company and they hit the dance floor. Clete escorted Bella onto the floor and the town cut loose. They collected guns when a few men decided to shoot theirs into the air. The party didn't get much quieter, but it did get safer. \"Lane, we're getting out of here. Things are really starting to warm up.\" \"I noticed, Dutch. I don't think I'm going to be able to stand the heat much longer either. See you in the morning. Ladies, I'm drowning in moonslight. Save me.\" \"Where are they going, Marshal?\" \"Walking in the moonslight.\" \"All of them?\" \"I'm the only one who's chosen a lady for the evening. They just have company. Would you like to take a walk in the moonslight, Bella?\" \"Yes, Marshal, I would.\" He smiled. She sounded surprised. He could feel her pleasure in the invitation and the surprise. \"Please, I'm only Marshal when I'm working. I am most definitely off duty. I'm Clete.\" \"I'm glad you're off duty, Clete.\" Dutch watched the street from the office. The town was nice and peaceful. It made him feel very nice. He'd had a nice night and didn't have the hangover he'd been planning before they'd showed off. He nodded to Bella and Clete on the walk across the street. \"That is a changed woman, Lane. She's beautiful.\" \"Amazing what a little bit of Clete's own brand of sunshine can do for a late bloomer. Nice thing is, it'll last. She's discovered she's beautiful, Dutch. Now she always will be. Ah, that's the judge. We need to get this done and find that mining company.\" \"Did you see him light up when Clete introduced Bella?\" \"Yes. So did Clete. That's one worry off his mind.\" \"I'm gone, Lane. Out the back. See you in court.\" Lane sighed and ached a bit for Dutch. He didn't blame him for not wanting to be there when the two approaching the door arrived. He needed a bit of time to bury the hurt a bit deeper. \"Hello, Parker. You must be Tessa. It's very nice to meet you.\" \"Tessa, this is Lane. Isn't Dutch here? We were goin' to ask him to lunch.\" \"Sorry, Parker, you just missed him. You two go on. Busy day. There are Sare and Billy Kendirk.\" \"Oh, what a pretty dress.\" \"Please tell her that, Tessa, and make sure Billy hears. He chose that material for her. He said it was the first store-bought present he'd ever given her.\" \"Lane, you're a nice man. All of you are nice. Dutch especially. I felt much better after we'd talked. It was like I had a big brother I could tell my worries.\" \"I'm sure he'd be complimented. I don't think anyone's ever said that to him before. Ah, Sare, Billy. You know Tessa and Parker, I believe.\" \"Hello, Tessa. Parker, you're looking well. You had us worried for awhile.\" \"I'm much better, Ma'am. Been healin' right well.\" \"Sare, that's a real pretty dress.\" \"Billy picked the material for me, Tessa.\" \"Think I'll have him come shoppin' with me. I never know what's goin' to be pretty made up. Not many men have the knack. Musta' got it from his pa. He always picks you pretty things too.\" Lane worked to keep his hurt for Dutch out of his eyes and smile. He really had found Snow White, but she'd already found her prince. \"Billy, I think Clete will want you. You'll be testifying. I think he'd like you to meet the judge. I saw them go into the hotel.\" \"I want to meet him too, Lane. It'll be easier sayin' what I got to say if'n he's not a stranger. I'll head over there. All right, Ma?\" \"Certainly is. You got important things to do. You get 'em done.\" She smiled as he ran across the street. Parker made a swipe as he went by and laughed when he missed. \"Amazin' how this town's changed since you boys come. How you been, Lane?\" \"I'm just fine, Sare.\" She watched Parker and Tessa enter the hotel, then turned and grinned at him. \"Yep. Amazin' how healthy everthin' got after the Gallant boys walked in from somewhere.\" Frontier justice was swift. The judge heard the testimony, asked the prisoners questions and made his decision. The fifteen men and women set the punishment. The six, who had attacked them, were given the maximum of twelve years \"confinement and labor.\" The other six, who had made a loud and foolish attempt to scare the town into letting them go, were given one year. If Lane had died, six would have also died. With the town and jail empty of 'bad guys' and Parker on his feet, they weren't really needed there any longer. Clete turned over his badge to Parker and they headed out to solve the real problem. \"Do we check the mine or the farm first?\" \"You choose.\" \"Again, huh? I hate doing this when we're riding, Lane. I'm afraid I'll hit something big and you'll fall off. The farm. CLETE! Help me get him down!\" \"I've got him! What happened, Dutch?\" \"I asked him farm or mine and he told me to choose.\" \"While we were riding?\" \"That's what I said.\" \"You picked?\" \"The farm. I don't think he expected this.\" \"I didn't. Find us some place in the shade. This is.…\" \"Bring the horses, Dutch. He's clear out. We hit something bigger than one planet in trouble. Shade. Get water. I hear a stream over that way.\" Clete settled Lane and sat down. \"Clete, wrong choice. Bad choice. Both wrong.\" \"Lane! Lane? Dutch, we've got to decide to do something totally different. We've got to change things fast.\" \"We use Melissa?\" \"Done.\" \"Roller coaster. Swoops and dives. Flying.\" \"Lane, we're going back to Melissa.\" \"Good choice, Dutch.\" \"Here. Cold water. Do you need me? Do you want me to come in?\" \"No. Just give it time to steady. They're not what they seem. Six of one. Half-dozen of the other. We have to choose the right ones. Our key. Snow White. Everything follows.\" \"The men we put away?\" \"No, Dutch. Twelve await. Our test. Our judgment. Our choice.\" \"Clete, he's not making a lot of sense.\" \"He's worried, but not lost. Still confused. Getting better. Scared a little. For us.\" \"I'm worried all right. We're about to undergo a very strange test. It's waiting for us in the clearing with Melissa. We'll be given one clue. Snow White. Just that. I don't know what it means, but that's what we're given. Each of us must make exactly the right choice. We're facing judgment. I'm ready.\" \"Do you have any images after we reach Melissa?\" \"No, Dutch. Once we ride into the clearing, everything ends. We're given the clue and told we must choose on our way there.\" \"No point in putting it off. I'll get the horses.\" \"Clete, somehow, everything we've done, everything we are, has been leading to this. Dutch is our center, but he still feels like the weak link. As if he doesn't really belong.\" \"I know. Our talents are obvious. He isn't really capable of envy, but he gets wistful about them. He puts his life in our hands with a trust that frightens me. If we asked him to die, he would cheerfully give up his life and only ask if we were sure it was necessary.\" \"That's some progress. A few years ago he wouldn't have asked. You know, he's the only one who belongs here. We're outsiders. Both born on the other side of the doorway. This is his home. He's our touchstone with this universe.\" \"The choice must be his.\" \"Yes, Clete, the choice is his. We have to believe in him, as he does in us. Are you ready to die if he says it's necessary?\" \"A very good question. I need-- No I don't. The answer is yes. His lack of faith in himself makes it hard for me. I have to look past it. I find it's his and not my own.\" \"Good. I think we have one major problem.\" \"Convincing him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"They weren't real happy about leaving that nice fresh clover. I finally convinced them. Told them too much would give them tummy aches. All right. You're both looking at me like... I don't know, but something's up.\" \"Yes, Dutch. It's time you carried your load. We're handing it to you.\" \"Lane, I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"He's telling you the choice is yours. Whatever it is, it will be the right one for us. We give you ourselves. Use us as you deem necessary. Stop it! Why can't you trust yourself? We have complete faith in you. You must know that. You don't know it. Lane, he just doesn't believe me.\" \"Then we show him. Sit down, Dutch. Between us. We're going to take you apart and put you back together again. Decide now. Are we doing the wrong thing?\" \"You never do the wrong thing.\" \"There it is. That's the problem. Of course I do, but I do the best I can. So does Clete. So do you. That's all that really matters. Take our hands. You must decide. We can't join together unless you will it. You are our binding force. I'm not even sure we'd exist in this universe without you.\" \"That's silly. Of course you'd exist.\" \"Would we, Dutch? Clete's from the past of another universe, created out of one woman's love and determination to give him existence, an impossible feat. I helped bring my own mother to my father, but you brought her into our reality. You are real. Your mother made a choice and used well-known biological techniques, the tested methods of science. Clete and I are impossible. You are not. We're dreams come true. You are firmly real.\" \"Lane, you're scaring him.\" \"Good. He needs the courage it takes to overcome fear. He can't go on being fearless. It's not real.\" \"All right. You want to show me. Do it.\" Dutch reached for them and pulled their minds to his. He fought down his fear and conquered it. They broke him apart. They showed him what he was to them, their faith in him. Their absolute, unquestioning, trust. The union was complete. He was one being and three. His doubt died. He learned himself. His was the power of choice. He was their freedom and his own. Mistakes were unimportant. Trust and striving were all. They gave him their love. The ultimate gesture of total trust. He showed them his. They had always known. He had been afraid of failing them. He learned he could not. He slowly separated them from himself and found they remained bound to him. He would always know where they were, when they were, and how they fared. He had taken his place and accepted his burden. \"Wow.\" \"I believe that expresses it nicely. All right, Dutch. Now I think we're ready. How about it?\" \"It'll take me awhile to get my feet back on the ground, Lane, but yes, we're ready.\" \"Good. I'm drowning in your pleasure. Put your backside in the saddle. Let's get this done.\" \"Clete, you're a fraud. You're singing inside.\" \"Dutch, if we don't start riding, it'll be outside too.\" Actually, they all sang several songs their father had taught them. The folk medley from the 'Sixties' just seemed appropriate somehow. They were going to be tested. They were ready. Dutch reined in and just stared at her for a few seconds. This was more than a likeness. \"Snow White, right out of the cel.\" \"Yes, Dutch. The test awaits you. It is life or death and you three must choose. You may choose only six. No more. The powers of this universe have met and you are their battleground.\" \"Good and evil.\" \"Do you think it that simple?\" \"No. Chaos and order; life and death, shadow and light, endings and beginnings. They can't exist without each other.\" \"You are so very young to have the wisdom to see it. I am here because it is your wish to serve that which also possesses the wisdom. Remember, no more than six.\" \"That's your clue, Dutch. We have faith in your decision.\" \"I know, Lane. I'm ready.\" They rode into the clearing and stopped in surprise. Twelve beautiful women stood awaiting them. They dismounted and their horses trotted off. One of the women stepped forward and smiled. \"We are companions for you. You have the choice of six.\" \"What happens to the others?\" \"They will be slain.\" \"And if I choose none? What happens to you?\" \"We will live, but you three will be slain. Do not choose that way. You are needed.\" \"I've made the choice. We'd rather die than be the cause of death to innocents. Kill us. We're prepared.\" The women lifted the bows laying at their feet and they fell in a rain of arrows. Lane whispered, \"It was the right choice, Dutch.\" He knew it was. He smiled as he died. \"Awaken.\" Dutch opened his eyes. Snow White sat on the ground near his feet. He sat up and checked Lane and Clete. \"They live, as do you.\" \"I'd assumed I was alive. I was dead?\" \"If life was not truly risked, it would not have been the testing you wanted. \" \"I guess we did, I did, want it. That's why you're Snow White and not Lane's or Clete's dream girl.\" \"Why did you choose this way? \"We want to protect life. Want to serve it. Choosing life for some and death for others may be necessary sometime, but if we had the choice, it would be life for all. The choice we were asked to make had no compassion. Without compassion, we are a force for destruction. It is not what we have chosen to be.\" \"You have chosen a symbol. It is fitting. Awaken your brothers.\" \"Clete, Lane, wake up. We have company. Seems I made our decision correctly.\" Lane and Clete sat up and grinned at him. They hadn't had any doubts. \"Kneel before me. You have been tested and found to be pure of heart. Your oath to serve life was given in your choice.\" Snow White produced a gleaming sword from somewhere and tapped Dutch, then Clete and Lane on both shoulders. \"Roberrin, I name you Knight Champion. Pericles, I name you Knight Guardian. Apollo, I name you Knight Judge.\" Suddenly she was gone from the clearing. \"How about that? We have official status. Our side, three. Opponent, zip.\" \"Dutch, I've got memories again. We've still got a change to make.\" \"And I'm absolutely awash in brotherly love. Horses or Melissa, Lane?\" \"Both, Clete. Round them up. I'll see if I can talk Melissa into a new shape. Dutch, I'll need you. She listens better if you're around.\" \"Right, Lane. Sure she does. You neglect to mention she only listens to you.\" They spent the night in Melissa and set out on the road in the morning. Lane had been successful. The bright painting on the side of the wagon said \"Gallant Brothers Traveling Show.\" The buckskins didn't mind pulling it. The black tossed his head and danced down the road ahead of them. They headed for the farm first. It didn't take them long to find the evidence they'd expected. \"We're on the right track, Lane. Tessa's father was working with radioactive materials. I found residual traces in his workshop. Is this the piece you meant?\" \"That's it. Dutch, come over here. What do you think of this?\" \"I think our time traveler is stranded without it. He wouldn't have left it behind unless... He doesn't want someone else to have time travel! He's a fool, but not intentionally destructive.\" \"Most of the stuff in the shed looks like they were working on power generation.\" \"That would make sense, Clete. All right. I've got a clear image of the way to the mining camp. Put that piece in Melissa. He kept it out of their hands. We have to do the same. Let's see... Dutch you drive. I really need some rest. I spent most of last night trying to pick a clear path through the jumble in my head. Wake me when you need me.\" \"Lane, why don't you go in and go to bed?\" \"I like the feel of the sun. Oh, hide our keys. Yours and mine. Clete can keep his around his neck. Three alike is too many. They'll... Ah, that's better. Good choice. They'll never notice.\" Dutch shook his head and tucked the keys into the horses' harness. They became one more decoration in the gaudy equipment. He smiled, as he looked at Lane curled up behind the seat of Melissa-as-wagon. He felt a surge of protectiveness. Clete grinned at him as he climbed up beside him. It was a new feeling from Dutch. He'd been waiting for it a long time. He chuckled softly when Dutch arranged himself to keep the sun off Lane's fair face. Clete tapped Lane awake at the crossroads. He pointed and went back to sleep. They maintained their cover by camping at a spot that showed frequent use. Lane stood watch while Clete and Dutch slept. They dawdled over breakfast and took their time breaking camp. They knew they were about to have company. Everything was put away and Dutch was hitching the horses when it rode in. \"What are you doin' here?\" \"Hitching a horse to a wagon. Oh. Traveling. We're showmen. The Gallant Brothers. I'm sure you've heard of us. I'm Dutch. My brothers are around here someplace. We took so long over breakfast, they decided to fix lunch.\" \"This road doesn't go anywhere.\" \"You mean it doesn't go up to a big mine?\" \"What do you know about that?\" \"I know where there are hard-working men, there's money to be made. Sounded like a big enough operation to be worth the trip. There are my brothers now. All right! We eat good today.\" \"Hi there. Company for lunch. Come on, Clete. Bring those fish over here. Let's stuff them. I've got some wild tubers and herbs. Dutch, where are your manners? Introduce us.\" \"Sorry, Lane, we hadn't gotten that far. I'll stir up the fire. Ouch! Stones are good and hot. Hmm... Ooh, those leaves smell good. The fish will be nice wrapped in them. Won't you join us Mister... \" \"Carna. Lef Carna. Don't mind if I do. Sure looks good.\" \"In a few minutes, it'll smell that way. I'm Clete. That's Lane. I catch the fish, but he turns them into a feast.\" \"How do, Mr. Carna.\" \"Jes, Lef. Where'd you boys come from?\" \"Down south lately. We've never really had a place to be from. Our dad's a traveling man, quite a magician. Never could figure out how he made all those flowers appear. We're on our own now. Put together our own kind of show. Got enough material we can vary it to suit the audience.\" \"Where'd you hear about the mine?\" \"Dutch, do you remember?\" \"Not right off hand, Lane. Yes I do. A pretty girl told me about it. I stuck it on our route.\" \"What was the girl's name?\" \"Lef, you just asked my brother a question he probably can't answer. He doesn't remember their names. Just tells them they're beautiful and gives them a farewell kiss.\" \"Clete, I remember their names. I just don't always remember which name went with which girl. I usually just give them one I think suits them. Let's see... I called her 'Snow White.' She had soft white skin and big blue eyes. Wasn't too long back. I spent an afternoon with her. I had dates for the evening. Twins I think. Sisters? Four of them, anyway. All with soft brown hair. No, they were just friends. Yeah, friends. Or...maybe that was the night I woke up with a whole bunch and I couldn't remember where I found them all.\" \"See what I mean? A question he can't answer.\" Lef laughed. He liked these boys. \"Well, the boss keeps a pretty tight lid on things. We don't see many strangers, but we could use a good show. We had a bunch of boys ride off with our supply list and they ain't come back. They were carryin' a little money, but not a lot. I figure they got drunk and spent it and lit out. You boys could make extra if you're carryin' good drink.\" \"Sorry, Lef. Got enough trouble with Dutch sober. Drunk he gets in more. Forgets to ask if they're married. Lane and I hate having to leave town in a hurry.\" \"Too bad. Even the saloon's gettin' low.\" \"You have a saloon?!\" \"Dutch, we got everthin'. Good-size town, all in all.\" \"Women?\" \"Them too. Jes be careful. Right number of 'em's married.\" \"Yippee! This isn't going to be as boring as I thought.\" They'd needed Lef. He got them through the guards and Dutch to the mine owner's office. That person wasn't pleased. \"Boss, we need somethin' new. They're jes' showmen. I jes' don' see no problem.\" \"You aren't paid to make decisions. I told you not to let people come here, not guide them in. Get out of here, Lef. Before I forget you're a good miner.\" \"Sir, we put on a good show. We're even getting pretty well-known places. We're here. Why don't you let us do what we're good at?\" \"All right, but keep to your own business.\" \"No problem. A mine is a mine. You've seen one hole in the ground, you've seen them all. I like sunshine and moonslight. And women. You don't find any of them in a hole.\" Dutch grinned at the man who made his skin crawl. He'd already figured out what was being hidden. There were other things being pulled out, but he was standing over a uranium mine. \"We'll put on a big show day after tomorrow.\" \"Why so long?\" \"You want to give everybody a day off? You do, we'll do it sooner. We just figured you'd want it on the day most of the men aren't working.\" \"Day after tomorrow.\" Dutch left the office and walked to the saloon. Lane had told him they needed to enhance their reputation a bit. He and Clete were already there. They'd taken rooms at the hotel. Dutch wasn't looking forward to the hangover he had been told to build. \"Day after tomorrow.\" \"Right. Clete, what's the feel of the place?\" \"Suppressed energy. Hard labor with not a lot of ways to unwind. Worry. Some fear. Unfocused. Lane, some of these men are in bad shape.\" \"I saw it. Radiation sickness. There's more here than just a mine. We could synthesize the drug, but I don't see any way to give it to them.\" \"I do, Lane. Let's set up a still, get real drunk tomorrow night and give it away. Real friendly.\" \"Ow, my head. Two hangovers in a row is too much to think about, Dutch.\" \"I think one is enough too, Clete. Tomorrow night we'll drink a substitute. They won't know the difference. We'll add some herbs to it. Sell it as a tonic, then 'get wasted' and give it away. Lane can make it taste good.\" \"Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"No, I'm all right. Not bad. Good change. Images clearing. We've got a path. A good one. All the way through. Damn. Well, it'll be worth it.\" \"Uh, Clete, did that 'damn' make you as nervous as it did me?\" \"Yeah, Dutch. Why is it I'm no longer worried about a hangover?\" \"We'll get through. Tessa's father and our traveler are in the mine. They think our nasty has Tessa. There's a girl here with the same coloring. He showed her from a distance and sent them a piece of her hair. Our time traveler is from this world. He's an incredible genius, but time travel was an accident. He found the mineral and figured out what he'd done after the fact. He wanted to stop the terrible chemical pollution of his time. Thought he could do it by creating nuclear power and bypassing the fossil fuel age. A bit dotty. Looked up Tessa's dad as a great inventor in the right area. He's just as worried about Tessa as her dad is. Nice old boy. He'll be willing to listen to what we have to say, but we have to show him his world comes out of its chemical slog. He's going to fall in love with Melissa.\" \"Lane, what are we going to get through?\" \"Dutch, you don't really want to know.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Where do we start?\" \"Right here. No, wait. We've got to get the still going. Clete, you and me. Dutch, find all the women you can. Go out of here with a bottle in one hand and your shirt in the other. Make a point of asking if they're married. Clete and I will join you in the same condition. We're going to do some heavy showing off. No guns. Pure physical stuff. Clete, it's going to be a very warm night. We're going to be spread a bit thin. We want the undivided attention of every single woman here.\" \"How many is that?\" \"About two dozen.\" \"No problem.\" Lane and Dutch laughed and Clete grinned. Lane still felt a little odd, but he was too wise to dwell on something before it happened. Dutch watched them leave, then went to the bar and ordered two bottles. Drunk was going to take quite a bit of the rather watered alcohol served in the place. He wondered what Lane would say if he asked for a hangover cure. They'd agreed not to use it. They had decided it was too easy. If they were going to abuse themselves, they should pay for it. This was different. It was in the line of duty. He decided they shouldn't suffer for it. Lane would see the decision and make the arrangements. He made a swift end to one bottle and started on the other. He knew what kind of single girls he would find in a mining camp, but by the time he got through the second bottle, they would be beautiful ladies. He grinned at the bartender's expression when he handed him the second empty bottle and ordered a third. He didn't open it. It would spill. That was it. He was ready. He took off his shirt and shook out his hair, gave a whoop and burst out the doors. He did a tumbling run down the middle of the road and grinned. Both shirt and bottle were a bit dusty, but neither was damaged. He asked the first woman he saw if she was married and did she have friends. She said no and yes and he started gathering them. They weren't shy. He was dizzy with kisses when Lane and Clete found them. They showed off. Miners coming off shift got in the spirit and challenged Clete to contests of strength. Dutch ran a race against a horse and won. Lane spun through the women and every lace was undone and in his hands. They did a perfect tumbling routine, then headed back to the saloon. They cleaned out the stocks and shared them around. The moons came up and Clete let loose. The night got warm, very warm. They'd gotten the women a bit drunk too. They'd found it was a good way to keep them from noticing their two heartbeats, until they stopped noticing period. When morning came, Lane handed Dutch and Clete small capsules and swallowed his own. Clete stretched and purred. They left a large group of sleeping people in the meadow and went to find a hot bath, shirts and breakfast. \"Clete, you're purring again. It makes my teeth rattle.\" \"Sorry, Dutch. I'm trying not to. Just takes a bit of shutdown time.\" \"You were wide open and broadcasting last night. Wonder how many people here in the camp picked it up.\" \"Look around, Dutch. A lot of them. Those three women over there are married.\" \"I see what you mean, Lane. They look very contented.\" \"They are. The only frustrated people in this camp are single men. All but three of them.\" \"Clete, you're smug. Since I am too, I'm sure it's appropriate. But the purring drives me crazy!\" \"Let's get to work. These are the herbs I need for flavor. Clete, you get them. Stay away from the mining operation. Dutch, you start the drug synthesis. I'm going to buy a lot of grain. Mention I need to replenish my mash.\" \"Lane, you're really going to fix these people up, aren't you?\" \"What do you mean, Clete?\" \"I recognize a few of these. Looked over your shoulder when you were analyzing the local plants. Our tonic is going to cure practically every disease on the planet and give them a good vitamin dose besides.\" \"It'll taste good too. They've got a magnificent biota. I don't blame Professor Princar for wanting to save it. Most of those plants are already being used. Their medicine shows are true aids, not fraudulent like the ones on Earth were. Their biota is why they're much healthier in general. Medicine shows bring herbal aids from elsewhere. Birth control in a tea and antibiotic in poultices, salves and powders. They're just beginning to learn why the things they've been using for centuries work. It's why our time-traveler is so desperate to save it and chose this as the time. Tessa's father is aware of what they'd be be losing. If there was something to help radiation sickness, I'd have used it instead of having Dutch synthesize. Oh, unlock Melissa for him. Ride out bare-chested and bareback, gathering bag over your shoulder.\" \"All right, but I'm taking a shirt. Dutch sometimes misses places when he spreads screen and I hate finding out about it when I get red spots.\" They laughed and went to work. By late afternoon, they were ready to sell their tonic. They didn't have to pitch it. Every working girl in the camp pitched it for them. Men started lining up as soon as they saw them setting up. They sold it by the dipper and by the bottle. A few special bottles were prepared just for children. They contained everything but the alcohol. They said they never charged for children's tonic. They drank copious amounts of fluid that looked like the same thing, but wasn't. The actual alcohol content of the tonic was fairly low. They started acting drunk and got generous. Dutch slipped extra doses into the dipper for men who were in more advanced stages of radiation poisoning. Clete did his sleight of hand with the medunit on a few men with the type of injuries that occurred among pick-and-shovel miners. Lane brought buckets of their tonic out and kept the big iron kettle brimming. They kept careful count and Dutch took a friendly half-dozen bottles to the saloon. He shared them with the bartender and the working girls. Clete gave take-home bottles to the shaft boss to give the men working the last shift. They bottled the last kettle-full and left the bottles sitting out, then went to the hotel for a good night's sleep, about four hours. They got ready to build their show arena early in the morning. Clete made sure they were all well-spread with a good sunscreen. Dutch said he didn't plan on getting any sun on \"that part\" of his anatomy. Clete told him to hold still. Lane made sure Clete didn't get spots, then they went for wood. The hammering attracted attention and an audience. Lane and Dutch grinned at each other when Clete took off his shirt. Several of the married women gasped, but they didn't leave, just stood and watched him split rails. He shook his head and laughed when Lane and Dutch dumped buckets of water over him. They finished the arena and grandstand by mid-afternoon and went to get ready. They asked the bartender to collect admission for them on the way to Melissa. They replicated three snow-white, silver-trimmed outfits and strapped on guns. They had trained the horses and added several pieces to routine three. Clete whistled and they started the show. The miners and others in the camp were a very appreciative audience. They didn't know some of the things they did couldn't have been done by someone from their world, but they were sure they'd just seen the best sharpshooting show on it. Dutch was feeling very nice when they rode out of the arena to thunderous applause. Clete was pleased too, but there was an undercurrent of tension in Lane that kept him from reveling in Dutch's pleasure. \"That went well. The horses are born performers.\" \"Clete, that's an understatement. They and we were magnificent.\" \"Dutch, give me your gunbelt. You too, Clete. We don't want them on us. I'm going to give them to the hotel manager and ask him to keep them for us. I already told the bartender to give him the gate receipts to put in the safe. Clete, do you have the medunit?\" \"Yes.\" \"Let me see... Dutch, put it behind the lamp at the mine entrance. We'll want it, but we don't want it found. Push it back in the niche. Do it, then meet us back here. Don't be seen. Move fast. Now.\" Clete watched Lane 'waiting.' He could feel his tension had become anticipation of something and it wasn't pleasant. \"Dutch is close and so is something else. Tell me what it is, Lane.\" \"Pain. Our nasty boys are real sick. They want us. We're going to have to let them have us. It's the path to the survival of this world.\" \"Can't we change it?\" \"We could. Do you want to risk it?\" \"Risk what?\" \"Changing something because it's hard on us, Dutch.\" \"A silly question. Don't you think so, Clete?\" \"Yeah. Sorry I asked.\" \"Oops. Unit's in place. Now what?\" \"A good meal. The boarding house porch. Enjoy it. It'll be our last for awhile.\" Lane nearly hoped something would change things, but nothing did. It happened just as he remembered. Before they'd quite finished dinner, they were taken to the mine owner's house. \"They were easy to take, Boss. We just held guns on everybody else in the place and they stood there and let us chain them up.\" \"Idiot. You made them heroes. Well, spread the word we found out they're wanted men and were after the payroll anyway. Maybe somebody will believe it.\" \"Nobody's going to come up here to the house for 'em, Boss.\" \"Lef might have, but I put him back out on the trail. Did you get their wagon?\" \"Yeah, but we can't get it open.\" \"Search them for keys. No, I think I'll do it myself. Hold very still if you don't want a bullet put through your brother's head.\" Lane held his breath. He could feel Clete's anger. He breathed in relief when he felt him clamp down on it. He held very still. He felt Dutch begin to pull them together. It worried him. It wasn't in his memories. He gasped and concentrated on the shifting images. Dutch had made a good choice. The path was still clear. Being together would make what they had to go through easier. He felt the gun at his head and watched as Dutch was searched. Clete's turn came last. The man found the key around his neck, but didn't realize what it was. He left it there. They laughed together in their minds. He had found the key to the universe and had not recognized it. Then it began. Endless hours of pain for one, then another. Dutch's love had 'added value' to the ordeal. They were more interesting, because they were stronger together. They would gain something from it, but that wasn't the reason it was worth it. It would strengthen the rule of law in the still sparsely settled land. It was Clete's turn again, and it was time. He waited for Dutch to begin the path. \"How much longer, Lane?\" \"Soon, Dutch. They don't want us to die of thirst. We're still strong enough to be interesting. Clete, come on. Come back to us. Dutch, do something.\" \"He's trying to shield us from his pain.\" \"I know what he's doing. It's just the wrong choice. Pull him back. Force him if necessary. Show him what I see. He must accept the bonding. Must let us help hold him above what he's going through. Do it, Dutch. Do it now. He'll die if he takes it alone. He'll take his and ours. Like he's always done. Stop him. This time stop him. This time you can.\" \"Lane... \" \"Dutch, this time you can. Now, stop him.\" Dutch fought Clete. Fought him with his love. Pulled him. Drove through the barriers he had built and wept for him. Tears he wouldn't shed for himself. He gathered them together and forced Clete to open himself. Forced him to accept their presence. To see why he must allow it. Forced him to accept their strength. He surrendered his pain. They had made the choice for him. \"They're bringing him back. They give us water. Not enough to rebuild ourselves, but enough to keep us alive. Dutch, prepare yourself for the blood. You felt the pain. You can't let the sight shock you. We'll lose him if you do.\" \"Can I be angry, Lane?\" \"Oh, yes. We can be very, very angry.\" Rage. Blinding, burning, rage. Fury like he'd known only once before. Lane and Dutch burned him clean with their anger. He struggled to lift his head and look at them. He smiled and slipped into unconsciousness. Lane sighed in relief. \"He's dying of thirst. We all are. If that's what you plan, tell us now. We'll be unconscious by nightfall.\" \"Give them water. I don't want them drying up and passing out. This one too. Give him some now and more later. I want all of them alive for awhile. We're not done with them. Bring that one downstairs. Make sure this one's secured.\" It was Lane's turn again. Dutch held his mind with his love and refused to let him count how many more times each of them would suffer, or the days until it would end. The very sick ones had learned they were \"something else.\" Lane said they would tell no one. They were interesting enough, they were given some food too. It gave them the energy to heal enough to live long enough. Lef set his glass down on the bar and leaned close to the bartender. The hair on his neck was standing up and he was sure he smelled something bad. \"They ain't. Ain't wanted by nobody. Did a stint as lawmen, I hear. He's lyin'. This smells bad.\" \"Lef, he said he was just gonna' keep 'em here til the judge passed through.\" \"When did he say it?\" \"Been 'bout eight days.\" \"Judge passed through more'n six days ago. Talked to him a spell. How I found out they been lawmen.\" \"They put on a good show, Lef. They got a bundle a' money in the hotel safe.\" \"I want ever' man believes in findin' out the truth a' this in here tonight. Keep it low. We don' want them special hired guns to hear. Get the miners. We got to know. This ain't right. The judge didn' get no wire to come up here. How long ago he take 'em?\" \"'Bout ten-eleven days.\" \"The day he sent me out. I's 'sposed to be gone four more. Too long. Longer'n ever 'fore. Smelled bad. Why I'm back. Damn. Hope they're alive.\" \"I'll send the girls out. They like them boys.\" \"I jes' hope we ain't too late.\" Lef learned how the Gallant boys had been taken and told the men they were fools. They started getting mad. Not at Lef, at the men who had made fools of them. They laid plans. They surrounded the house and took out the sentry. Lef looked in a window and ran. He knelt in the grass and was violently ill. He chose ten men and made them swear an oath of secrecy. All the others listened to the oath. The ten had guns. They would be the judges. They broke through doors and windows, saw and killed. They shot all but the boss. They hung him on his porch. Lane smiled when Lef released him. \"Hello, Lef. Take us to the mine entrance. I've got a miracle waiting there. Get the two men he was holding in the mine and bring them to us.\" Lef held Lane and cried. The men wrapped them in blankets and carried them to the mine. They found the locked door in the abandoned shaft and freed the two men. Lane whispered the location of the medunit to the professor and lost consciousness. Lane didn't know it was Tessa's father who healed them, or that Lef helped. The professor swore him to secrecy. One look at the medunit had told him they were from farther in the future than he was. Lef watched them healed and believed. He took seven men and destroyed the lab, then blew up the mine shaft. The professor watched in sorrow. His time craft was gone, and with it his dreams of saving his world. He was not sorry to see the bombs he had been forced to build buried under the mountain. When Lane regained consciousness, he told him his story. The camp broke up. Lef stayed until he knew they were all right, then said goodbye. He was going to the federal court to apply to become a judge. They'd accept him. He had letters from several men saying they were sure he'd be a good one. Dutch, Clete and Lane left soon after he did. They took the professor and Tessa's father with them. Their first stop was his farm. \"Let Tessa know you're all right.\" \"I thought he had her and all the time she was safe. I'm an old fool, Lane.\" \"No, just a loving father.\" \"Say hello to Bella for me. She's quite a woman.\" \"Do you mean my sister Bella?!\" \"That's the one.\" Clete grinned at the expression on his face. Dutch and Lane managed to keep from laughing, just. They drove out of the yard and stopped by the bank of a stream. Dutch climbed down and removed the keys from the harness. \"What do we do with the horses, Lane? If we set them free, they'll just be captured again.\" \"Clete, just how much did you tell Sare?\" \"Just what I told him to, Lane. Everything.\" \"That's where we take the horses. It's not far. Let's go. Professor, watch for berry bushes. We'll talk Sare out of one more meal. Wait'll you taste her pie.\" They had one more meal with Sare and Billy and left the horses in the barn. They carried their tack into Melissa and laughed at the professor's expression when he stepped into Lissa. He started toward the bridge and they redirected him. Clete held him up when he stepped into their living room. \"This is... is... \" \"Melissa, our ship. Make yourself comfortable while we stow this.\" \"Here, Dutch. I'll take yours too. You stick with him. Show him the kitchen and fix him a cup of tea. He needs it.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Come on, Professor. This way.\" \"This isn't possible!\" \"Neither are we. Well, Lane and Clete insist I am, but since my father doesn't exist in this universe, I have my doubts. Here. Sit down and drink this. I'll tell you why we're here. And why we're not sure why you are. Lane says we... interrupted the paradox, or shorted the loop.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"What you did here would have left your world a radioactive cinder in fifty years. Of course, you wouldn't have been born, so it wouldn't have happened. But then, you would have and it would, and round and round. We're new at this and still trying to figure that part out. Or we found it because we were supposed to change it. Dad says just fix and don't worry.\" \"Dutch, you're confusing him.\" \"I figured he might as well be as confused as we are, Lane.\" \"Help. I've set course for your world's future, Professor. I know you need to see it to truly believe it will change soon enough without changing the past. We're interested too. I know, but I want to see. We'll be landing soon.\" \"How soon, Lane? Does the professor have time for a tour?\" \"No, but we'll give him one anyway. Melissa loves to be shown off. Just the apartments though. We'll skip the ship proper. It would take years to explain finite infinity.\" \"Finite infinity is a self-contradictory statement.\" \"See what I mean? Come on. We'll start with the gym.\" They showed him Melissa, then his rich, green, and peaceful world. He promised to work to better his own time in his own time and they left him in his workshop mulling over the concept of finite infinity. They didn't return the rare element that made time travel possible. They 'forgot' to mention they had it. Dutch dropped onto a couch in the living room as Lane put them in flight. \"Lane, let's take a vacation.\" \"Exactly, Dutch. We're on our way, but I think you should know vacation runs right into work.\" \"Then we'd better start getting back in shape. The gym. Now.\" Dutch and Lane groaned, but followed Clete to the gym. They knew he was right. They had weight to regain and strength to rebuild. Vacations were more fun if they could show off.",

      "content": "Chapter Four They explored their universe through time. They became wanderers. They'd begun with an orderly exploration, but soon tossed away the plan. Lane told them their future was getting acquainted with their ship and the universe, for awhile. They enjoyed Earth in a great many periods of its history. They avoided wars. They knew how Earth's wars turned out and what they eventually led to. It was a rocky road, but she was exactly how they wanted her. They were having breakfast when Dutch sighed. \"I'm bored. Let's find something to do.\" \"Just what did you have in mind, Dutch?\" \"You're grinning at me. You were waiting for me to say it. All right, Lane, what's up?\" \"Time to make some changes. We're going to do some real traveling. I want to stock up on Earth. There are things that just can't be synthesized or replicated properly. Melissa is going to be very cooperative and take us in just like Lissa would. Put together lists of everything you want. Not too long. If it can be replicated successfully, don't include it.\" \"Champagne and caviar. Blue jeans. The real thing. Real cotton and silk kimonos. Leather boots.\" \"Dutch, most of that is very easy to replicate.\" \"I know, Clete, but we don't have a lot of the patterns I want. I know where to get them though. Old Meister will have almost everything, including the best roses ever grown. I wonder if he's still mad at me.\" \"Probably, fathers tend to get angry when their daughters are unhappy. If I remember, you made two of them unhappy.\" \"I never said I'd marry them, either of them. Why does every set of twins think I should choose between them?\" They landed Melissa at the spaceport and started their shopping trip. Jan Meister wasn't angry. In fact, he spent a great deal of time telling Dutch how happy his daughters were. Dutch didn't mind, though he did get a little tired of looking at grandchildren at about the two hundredth holoframe. Meister was a collector. He shared his collection by allowing replicator patterns to be made. Dutch shared his enthusiasm for real materials and sighed with him that no replicator would ever duplicate the feel of raw silk or the smell of real leather. Clete and Lane left the two sybarites and went to an antique book shop. Lane found several items he wanted. Clete discovered the collection of ancient films and asked for copies of several. He made an instant friend when he asked for Fantasia and Snow White. He walked out of the shop with a complete collection of full-length Disney animated classics. He also carried a carefully preserved cel. The old man in the shop had decided he should have it. He thought Clete would give it the care and love it deserved. Dutch was carrying a case of champagne into Melissa when they arrived. \"Just in time. I told interested parties I didn't want any of this to go through a transporter. They thought I was a little eccentric. I stored the replicator patterns on Lissa. Give me a hand.\" \"As soon as we store our own treasures. Wait'll you see what Clete got.\" Lane placed his books in his library and watched Clete very carefully hang the cel. It was from Snow White and in amazing condition. Clete ordered a slight change in the lighting. Dutch walked in with a case of champagne in his hands and just stood and looked at the cel. He'd loved early Disney animation since he was a small child. \"You know, she's probably the reason I've never really fallen in love. I've been looking for her since I was three.\" They moved all the items Dutch had stacked on grav carts into the ship, put them away, then opened a bottle of champagne. Melissa did her Lissa imitation and they left Earth. As soon as they'd cleared the watchful eyes of Earth control, Lane set coordinates for some real traveling. He remembered they were needed a third of the way across the universe and several thousand years in the past. They explored on the way, but inside the ship. One of their explorations was of the ancient books Lane had found, especially the cookbooks. Clete liked to cook too, but he liked 'homey hearty fare.' Dutch was the perfect person for whom to cook. He made coffee, and anticipated \"YUM!\" the entire time they worked. He truly appreciated it, and the synthesizer began to make more 'raw' than cooked foods. Lane was becoming an artist in the kitchen. Their father and Clete could do 'spectacular,' but Lane was the one who enjoyed it most. They were approaching the world when Dutch and Clete agreed he'd found a better recipe for wild mushroom and black walnut wine sauce, and he had a recipe his father would want. He and Clete were both 'after' their father's pizza sauce. Dutch chose a lovely brandy for after dinner. \"I'm awed, Lane.\" \"Thank you, Dutch. This one I will trade to Dad, then the sauce for your sausage, Clete.\" \"Nope, you'll share. You aren't going to make pizza as often as we like to eat it.\" \"I don't think you can change that one, Lane. I'll help talk him into making the sausage whenever you want to cook with it.\" \"I had no doubt of it, Dutch.\" \"Talk to us about the faint undercurrent of dread, Lane.\" \"It's an Earth-type planet with a similar development pattern. The culture is the closest we'll ever find to the Western culture of Earth, at least in this era. Humanoid in the extreme, though gravity is a bit lower.\" \"One of the worlds seeded with life a bit later than others?\" \"Dutch, Dad told me to leave the question of the seeded worlds alone when I was four. I don't think he knows why he's sure he, and we, should, but he is.\" \"OK. But it's still a valid question.\" \"He's right, Lane. Is there enough difference in gravity to need to retrain for it?\" \"No, not even enough for the people to show it much. They've got themselves in a real mess. They're about to destroy their world.\" \"Lane, you said it was in a stage about equal to the Earth's nineteenth century. How can they destroy themselves?\" \"I wish I had an answer to that, Dutch. We've got a real mystery. Technology makes a big leap, then in about twenty years, they blow themselves up in a nuclear war. We may have found another time traveler.\" \"That's not good. If you're right, we've got a real problem too. When are we?\" \"I'm following my memory, Clete. We find a blasted world, then journey into its past. At that point, we have to change things. There she is. A radioactive cinder. I remember us doing a thirty-year jump.\" \"Do fifty. See what happens.\" \"Well, that's it. Clete, take over. I'm down.\" Dutch grabbed him and got him to a couch. They'd made the first change. It was a fairly small one, so Lane should steady in a few moments. Melissa landed in a small clearing. There was a frontier city about a kilometer away. Lane moved them forward two years and a partial-season. \"All right, Lane, now what?\" \"Side arms practice, Dutch. Projectile weapons. Outside. Attracts the attention of a boy about twelve. He's our guide. Clete, put a corder and medunit in your pocket. This is going to be a rough go. I've got multiples. Nothing clear. Dutch, be careful. Snow White lives here, but you're the wrong prince.\" \"Figures. I'm going to meet the girl of my dreams and I'm not the boy of hers. You steady enough to hit the buttons on the replicator?\" \"Yes, but every choice we make will cause a few seconds of confusion. There are just too many images to find a clear path. I'm going to be semi-useless. We'll just have to play it out.\" \"Why am I carrying a corder and medunit?\" \"That happens right away. The corder locates us a small gold deposit. The medunit saves our young guide's life. His mom is going to be very grateful, Clete. Be gentle. She's very lonely. She thinks her husband is dead.\" \"And he's not.\" \"No. Good. That takes care of a half-dozen of the multiples. You made up your mind the right way, of course. These are about right. There you are, Dutch. Choose clothing and sidearms along those lines. Clete, you're going to look real big to these people.\" \"Yeah, I figured that out when you said we didn't need to retrain. Big man to knock down. I'm going to spend half my time trying not to break anyone.\" \"We're all going to have problems. I think I see a way to shortcut them, but we'll have to watch our... Yes, keep that medunit handy. We make some unscrupulous unfriends.\" \"What you mean is our backs sprout holes.\" \"Would you rather fight every man in town, Dutch? And every one that hits town? All one at a time? If we clean them up all at once, you'll have more time for ladies.\" \"Oh, well, what's a few holes?\" They'd spent a lot of time practicing with weapons used by various cultures, first with their father, then while they were in the academy. Though those were only from the cultures humans had met, there weren't great differences in them. They'd practiced more with 'variations' since. Clete really couldn't resist making them work as a team and Dutch couldn't resist turning anything into a show. It was going to prove very useful. Their guide arrived not long after they began practicing with replicas of Colt 45's outside Melissa. They were near enough like the guns common to the culture to be custom-made for show people. Their young guide arrived while they practiced. \"Gee, I've never seen anybody shoot like that!\" \"Hi. We practice a lot. Goes with the show.\" \"Trick shots, huh? Interestin' guns. Can see bigger wouldn' bother you guys none. You're kind of in the middle of nowhere for a medicine show. Who are you fellas?\" \"I'm Dutch. He's Clete and that's Lane. We're retired. The booth came down through the family. We're real sentimental about it. Usually leave it in a safe place. The clearing looked good.\" \"How'd you get it here? Where's your mounts? Are you stayin' in town? Want to have supper at our place?\" \"Whoa! Let's see. Lane, do you remember all those questions?\" \"In order: a friend dropped us off; don't have any; haven't decided yet; we'd love to, if we can pay back with a few chores. What's your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Shoulda' said. I'm Billy Kendirk. Come on. We need to get goin' so Ma knows to make for more 'fore she starts dinner. We definitely got chores you can help with. Pa's been gone awhile and me and Ma ain't been keepin' up too good.\" Lane knew when it was coming. Billy was talking animatedly about his mom's berry pie. \"Look, I'll get some berries right over there. We'll have pie tonight.\" He ran right into a... Might as well call it a bear. Filled the same niche. Grew just as big. Was just as hairy and dangerous. Clete charged after him. He got swiped, but not bad. He decked the bear and went to work on Billy. Dutch and Lane picked berries. Billy had taken a beating for berry pie. He deserved to have it. \"I healed everything major. Left the superficial stuff. Just hit him with a dose of antibiotic. Lane, that could have been prevented.\" \"I know, Clete. This memory has a way for us to really help them.\" \"Good work, Clete. He'll be real proud of his scars. How about you?\" \"Dutch, scars don't last on me. You know that.\" \"That's not what I meant.\" \"Oh. No, I could heal me, but the shirt would still have holes. Wouldn't make sense.\" Dutch laughed and thumped Lane on the back. It completely surprised him and Clete laughed and picked up Billy. He'd regain consciousness soon. Lane was giggling and complaining he was dizzy, so Dutch steered him. It didn't happen often, but sometimes Dutch just surprised him with an \"I love you.\" Dutch was a blaze of love in his soul and the love between his two brothers the most wonderful feeling in existence. Lane located the gold. He handed the corder back to Clete and he and Dutch rolled over a rock in the stream and picked up a few nuggets of placer. They rolled the rock back. The deposit itself was a few hundred meters upstream. They'd help Billy file a claim. It would get him and his mom through the rough times until his father returned. They could see how rough they'd been as they walked into the yard. Billy's mother ran for them when she saw Clete was carrying her son. \"BILLY!!\" \"Easy, Ma'am! He's roughed up a bit, but he'll be all right. Had an argument over a berry patch. My name's Clete Gallant. My brothers Lane and Dutch. Let's get him inside.\" \"Yes. Thank you. I'm Sare Kendirk.\" \"Billy said you'd trade us a home-cooked meal for a few chores. My brothers are carrying a load of berries in their shirts. Figured Billy ought to get his pie.\" He laid Billy on the bed and smiled. \"Nice kid. You can be proud of him. He'll grow up to be a fine man.\" \"Thank you. Hurts a bit he's havin' to do it so fast. You're bleeding. Take your shirt off. Do you whilst I'm patchin' Billy. Where'd your brothers go?\" \"To find things that need fixing. I'd better go help.\" \"You sit right there til I get those claw marks cleaned out. Then I'll see if we got a shirt big enough to fit you. My husband wasn't near your size, but he liked things loose.\" \"You said was.\" \"I figure somethin' happened to him and he ain't comin' back. Been gone more'n a year. Went south to buy us a good startin' herd.\" \"Lot of things other than dying can delay a man. Give it time. A good man is worth waiting for.\" \"I don't know how long we can wait. Place is goin' downhill. Me'n Billy are just scratchin' by. I'm tryin' to hold the land, but I'm wonderin' if… \" Clete realized what he'd done. She'd been alone for a long time. He'd slipped out of his shirt and she'd stopped talking. Lane had warned him. Her need washed over him. He had to get out of the house, or distract her, or something. He wouldn't be able to resist that need long. Billy woke up. Clete thought, \"Whew, kid's got good timing,\" and grinned as her emotions became maternal. Billy chattered at her as she bandaged Clete. He kept her distracted until he could get into a shirt and make excuses about helping his brothers. It was a good thing Lane had told him her husband was alive. He wondered how he'd known. \"Hi, Clete. You look warm.\" \"Dutch, you're pushing it. This corral's in bad shape.\" \"Everything is. You can see they've been trying, but they need logs split and carried. Probably don't have money for nails either. Lane's in the shed putting an edge on the ax. Help me see how many of these nails we can pound back to usefulness. Pull that rail loose. We'll redo it. It's been over-nailed. I'd say Billy's work.\" \"He's getting better. There are only a couple bent nails on the most recent.\" In three hours, they'd accomplished more than Billy and his mom could have in a month. They were finishing repairs on the roof of the house when Sare called them to dinner. She stared at the rebuilt corrals, the rehung barn door, the repaired shed wall, the rebuilt buggy and the stack of rails laying next to the shed. They dropped off the roof and went to wash up. Billy yelled and she dashed in to get her pies out. She wondered what she'd done to deserve being blessed. She was glad she'd decided to fix a bit extra because of the size of the men. They definitely deserved it. They appreciated it. \"Billy, you were right. The best berry pie I ever had. Do you feel up to a little walk? I've got something to show you. Ma'am, I'm going to have to walk off that last piece of pie. I hope you don't mind if Billy goes with me.\" \"My name's Sare, Lane. And after what you boys did around here today, I wish you coulda' held three pieces of pie. Go on, Billy. I'll wash up.\" \"No, Sare, you won't. Dutch and I already drew straws on that chore. I wash. He dries. You get to sit on the porch and watch the evening settle in.\" \"Clete, you don't have to do that. You done enough already.\" \"You did the work of cooking for three extra and spent time on those pies. We'll take care of the extra cleanup. Now, outside. Go on. Don't you feel guilty. We don't have to do dishes often. It's a novelty.\" They joined her on the porch within minutes. They were watching the sunset when Lane and Billy walked into the yard. He looked very serious, but Clete could feel his mother saw the excitement beneath. \"Ma, I'm goin' into town with them in the mornin'. I've got somethin' to do. I'm goin' in and see if I can sleep. Night.\" \"Now, what was that all about?\" \"It's his story, Sare. He's decided how he wants to tell it. He really does have things to do in town. We'll be back tomorrow evening.\" \"Lane, I don' know what you're up to, but you're all in on it. All right. He can go. Just make sure he's home before dark. I hate waitin' supper.\" She smiled at them. They were real nice men. And Clete... \"Well, we've made ourselves a spot in the barn. Might as well get a good night's sleep. See you in the morning.\" \"We're right behind you, Clete. Come on, Dutch, turn-in time. Billy's going to want to make an early start. Goodnight, Sare. I really enjoyed dinner.\" \"They're rushing me off again. You have a pleasant night. You sleep in. We'll buy Billy breakfast in town. That way you'll both get a treat. Goodnight.\" \"Goodnight, Dutch. You boys sleep well.\" Dutch strolled into the barn and grinned at Clete. \"Warm evening.\" \"Give him a break, Dutch. Even I could feel how lonely she is.\" \"Me too, Lane. How do you know her husband's coming home?\" \"We pick up a telegram from him tomorrow. He was robbed and he spent the last year out on the range, working to earn a very good small herd, and enough to get them home, from a rancher. He didn't have money for a telegram before. Clete would have answered her need and she'd have hated herself. Her husband won't be home until spring, but she won't be so lonely once she knows he's coming. Now, she and Billy will have enough to see them through. All we have to do is get him to town and back. After tomorrow, he'll be safe.\" \"Uh, huh, just how does one trip make him safe?\" \"Clete's about to get a job.\" \"Why me? Why is it always me?\" \"Relax, Clete. The first thing you do is hire us.\" Dutch stared at the animals tied to hitching rails along the street of the town. They gave him a very odd feeling. \"Lane, they're horses.\" \"Like the bear and the people, Dutch, similar evolution on a seeded world. This is a very Earth-like planet. There was very little drift. I'm just glad we spent so many of our vacations at the academy learning to ride.\" \"I used to spend my offtime in the holosphere riding too. You'd be amazed at how many women like the smell of saddle leather.\" Lane and Clete laughed. Billy, who had been leading and a bit too excited to notice Dutch had suddenly stopped, when the horses came in sight, ran back to see what was going on. They told him they were teasing Dutch about finding a horse he liked. By then, they were. Lane assured it. They went to the assay office first, then convinced the clerk at the courthouse to file the claim in Billy's name. Billy insisted on buying them breakfast at the hotel. They left him shopping at the general store and headed for trouble. It was waiting for them at the saloon. \"Lane, that place shouldn't be open this early.\" \"It's not, Clete. It's open this late. The proprietor doesn't like it, but his current clientele become violently insistent. Lawmen aren't plentiful and the only remaining deputy in town is recovering from a very close call.\" \"I suppose I'm not supposed to break anyone.\" \"Right, Dutch. Very few of these are real nasties. They just follow along.\" \"How do we find the rotten apples?\" \"They find us. You'll know who they are. They're the ones that shoot me in the back.\" \"Lovely. I suppose you can't just point them out and save us the trouble of buying you a new shirt.\" \"I get shot in the back, Dutch. I don't see them.\" \"Noisy isn't it? This is a rowdy bunch. The bartender's nervous. NO!\" \"Where's he going?\" \"He's about to stop a bully. Get ready, Dutch. Clete's about to heat things up. No one hits someone smaller, especially a woman, if he can stop it. Take the man in red plaid first. He pulls a gun.\" Clete dropped the man from the balcony. He was careful. He dropped him on several others to break his fall. Dutch relieved the man of his gun and put him down for a nap. Clete dropped from the balcony and tucked several others in. Lane was busy too. He kept removing guns from people who were aiming at Dutch and Clete. They took care of the ones aiming at him. \"Over already and I was just getting warmed up.\" \"Two. Armed. Back room. Three. Same. Upstairs. Two. Doors.\" \"Clete says you get to play some more, Dutch. You get the back room. I'll remove our unfriends outside.\" Clete had already headed for the stairs. Lane slammed the doors outward, finished putting the two men to sleep and dragged them inside. Dutch was dragging two from the back room. \"Dutch, see that door up there. When it opens, draw and shoot the gun that sticks out. It'll be pointed at Clete's head.\" Dutch drew and fired. Clete reached through the door and hauled the man out. He held him in the air with one hand and put him to sleep with the other. \"Catch. They'll break if I drop them.\" Dutch and Lane caught the three Clete dropped over the balcony railing and stacked them with their friends. They made a total of twenty-three in the pile. The bartender decided it was safe to stick his nose above the bar. \"Who are you boys?\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Dutch. This is Lane. The big man calming the ladies upstairs is Clete. Damn, Lane, let's find a cold shower. Somebody's very grateful.\" \"Let's go get him. Billy's about to need us.\" \"We'd better hurry. He gets his shirt off and we'll be fighting women too. Clete! We don't have time for them to tell you they're grateful.\" \"Hey! You don't have to push.\" \"Sure we do, Clete. Lane says Billy needs us.\" \"Why didn't you say so?!\" Lane and Dutch shook their heads and laughed when Clete dropped from the balcony and went through the doors at a run. He had Billy's problem taken care of before they got there. He was dumping the man, who'd tried to make Billy give him money when the storekeeper went to the storeroom for more flour, on the walk when they arrived. The storekeeper was pleased. He told them the man wouldn't have tried it if the town had a lawman on his feet. Clete asked why it didn't. He'd have heard how worried he was about his town if he hadn't been able to feel it. Lane told him they'd make sure Billy got home safely with his supplies. \"Dutch, go with him to the livery stable. He needs a wagon and a team. See if they've got anything we'd like. Try to find a horse big enough Clete's feet won't drag the ground. There's some good-looking tack in here. We'll help the storekeep tally and get Billy's purchases moved outside. See if you can find horses not broken to a bit. I know. They bother me lots more than they do the horses.\" \"We'll probably have to take what they've got or break our own, Lane.\" \"You know how I feel about it.\" \"We gentle them ourselves. If possible.\" \"If possible.\" \"Come on, Billy. Let's go horse shopping.\" Billy was near abounce when they returned with a wagon and team. Dutch grinned and winked at Lane. He'd found what they wanted too. \"You did well, Billy. That's a nice team.\" \"They'll pull a plow too, Lane. Ma won't have to do her garden by hand. Do you think she'll like the material I picked?\" \"It'll make a very pretty dress. Clete, you and Dutch load. I'm going to the telegraph office to see if we have any messages. Billy, come with me.\" \"I ought to help load, Lane. It's our stuff.\" \"Come on. You stay, I'll feel guilty. They don't really need us. Look. We'd be in the way. Clete heaves from the walk and Dutch guides it into place. They'll probably beat us to the corral.\" Billy cried when he read the telegram. Lane and the clerk carried on a long discussion about the weather and pointedly didn't notice. The culture was much like Earth's nineteenth century in some ways, but 'real men' not crying wasn't one. The contents of the message were personal. They were being polite and giving him 'privacy' to deal with his emotions. After he told them what the message was, the clerk wished every \"wallop\" message that came in was good news, and was glad that he'd come that day. They didn't have a lawman to take it to the ranch, and he'd have been trying to figure a way to take the good news out to them, and might have 'bent' the rules to do it. Billy said he'd tell his mother he'd been \"real pleasured to give the good news.\" Lane smiled, as they walked out. Billy was working very hard on the way he spoke. He was 'a man of substance' now and intended to sound like it. His purchases had included two thick, quite expensive, books. Early education took place at home, not in schools. Those were for older children, who wanted to learn things they couldn't, working with a parent, older relative or family friend. It wasn't an apprenticeship system. The duty of teaching a child was strong enough in the culture it was near totally literate, but the books Billy had chosen weren't for the purpose of teaching children to read. Those were inexpensive and plentiful. He mentioned the books and Billy began the explanation he'd remembered. He saw how the culture could produce \"bad apples.\" It was where the memory came from. That was the way it worked. His memory was cluttered with would-have-been and it was wonderful. Dutch didn't allow nightmares and Clete told him if he had one. He ignored what he remembered, after a point. Dutch wouldn't choose that path, unless it was the right one. Clete was \"getting exasperated\" with his self-doubt. He was the one they knew could be trusted to make the best choice, always, and he didn't. Lane had the feeling that was going to change. He paid attention to feelings. Mick O'Herlihy had told him it would be weird if he didn't 'get hunches' and not training a very convenient talent was silly. And then gotten him into several situations he'd 'felt' his way out of, with his head spinning, and one he hadn't. He had a feeling Dutch had to accept he had their complete trust, as they had his, soon. It wasn't lack of self-esteem. It was intense admiration. He was their center, the love that filled them with joy was perfect and total, like their father's. He was going to have to accept that love inspired love, and himself. Billy and Lane reached the livery stable just as Clete and Dutch arrived with the wagon. There were a large number of people standing around. They'd heard someone had bought the big black stallion. They wanted to see what kind of fool would buy a horse that couldn't be broken. \"That's him, Clete. Only one big enough to carry you.\" \"You're right, Dutch, and he's as pretty as you said. Hand me the hackamore and the black blanket. He'll like this saddle. It'll fit well and look real good on him. I'll meet you by the other corral in a few minutes. He'll probably need shoeing. Tell the smith I want to do it myself. He's on your way.\" \"Aren't we going to stay and watch!?\" \"We really hadn't planned on it, Billy.\" \"Lane, nobody's ever ridden that horse! Nobody! He's wild. A killer.\" \"Nonsense. Horses don't kill unless they have a very good reason. We'll stay, just so you see all the horse needs is the right kind of treatment and what that is. Go ahead, Dutch. Take the wagon. We'll catch up.\" Clete was sitting on the ground in the middle of the corral softly singing. The black animal circled him several times and he ignored it. It wasn't afraid of him. He established as mutual. It became curious and edged toward him. He sang to it and looked in its eyes. He sang of rolling plains, sweet green grass and the friendship between man and beast. The black dipped its head and he gently rubbed its nose. It danced back a few steps, but soon returned. It wasn't really wild. It had just been out on the range since a colt. It had some familiarity with people and no bad experiences there, and had also been in the corral long enough to get used to people, in general. It just didn't trust them. Since most of the people around the corral felt the same way about the very big horse, it wasn't surprising. The horses of Clete's world were augmented, but it didn't take much longer for the black to decide he was more interesting than threatening. It really wasn't a 'wild horse.' Like evolution didn't mean species were identical. This animal was a bit more 'domesticated.' He'd been told it's daddy was a plow horse, and it was obvious to Clete that the animals had been pulling plows longer on that world. He slowly stood and stroked it. He held each piece of tack up and let it get acquainted with it, then laid it back on the ground. People gasped when he vaulted on its bare back and it reared. He rode it down and sang in its ears. He could feel when it calmed and slid off. He added a bit to his estimate of time domesticated. It accepted a rider \"belonged\" very quickly. He held the local version of the hackamore up and very slowly put it on. He ran his fingers under every strap to assure their placement, then picked up the blanket. He turned the animal's head with a gentle tug on the hackamore. He made sure it watched him put the blanket on. He then picked up the saddle. He turned it over in his hands and explained all the pieces. The words held no meaning for the horse, but the soft voice calmed it and the saddle became familiar. Clete made sure it was watching when he gently set the saddle in place. The horse danced a bit, but soon calmed. Lane knew when Clete cheated. He felt him spread a blanket of calm over the horse when he tightened the cinches. He was in a bit of a hurry. He swung up in the saddle and taught the black the signals of the reins. Lane opened the corral door and he rode out. No one watching got terribly excited. It had become a very calm afternoon all over town. Lane grinned. His horse was going to be very easy to 'gentle.' He watched Clete ride toward the smithy and he and Billy went to find Dutch. \"Very nice, Dutch. Stallions.\" \"They were the only ones not bit-broken, Lane. Besides, I thought the two buckskins went nice with Clete's black.\" \"Let's saddle up. Clete's at the smithy. We'll have him check these too.\" \"Oh, no! I'll bet he takes his shirt off. There go my chances with every woman in town.\" Lane laughed. He and Dutch weren't as massive as Clete, but they were all well-proportioned. Dutch never had any trouble finding willing companions, usually several at a time. He and Clete both knew the real reason Dutch preferred multiple ladies. He thought none of them would expect attraction to develop into a long-term special relationship, if there were several. He didn't seem to realize some of them still fell in love and wanted more, but at least they knew he didn't from the beginning. They all ended up taking off their shirts. The smithy was rather secluded, so they didn't attract too large a crowd. The blacksmith changed that. He decided to have a beer and told the bartender about the size of the men working in the smithy. The bartender told him about the fight. The barmaid, who had just started her day's work. overheard. She told the girls in the hotel kitchen. Word spread. Soon every knothole in the smithy had an eye and the doorway got very crowded. Clete knew they were there, but he was keeping things calm until he finished the horses. \"Lane, as soon as he's done, it's going to get very warm around here.\" \"I know, Dutch. We'll just have to try to get him out of town while he's still thinking about his horse.\" \"Sometimes I wonder why I stick with you guys.\" \"Spillover, Clete. You need us to keep you from being mobbed. You hate it when somebody gets left out.\" \"Dutch, you're the one that likes ladies in multiples. You look for twins.\" \"Had a soft spot for look-alike ladies ever since I met Cory and Cally at the academy.\" \"There. Done. Your 'soft spot' wasn't what I was talking about.\" Dutch dumped a bucket of water over him and Clete chased him out of the smithy. They ran back in. Lane sat down on the hard-packed dirt floor and laughed. Shirtless was not something one did in public in the 'nineteenth century.' They'd shocked a very large group of women. The shock didn't last long. It wasn't Earth's 'Western' culture, just one very similar. They didn't have the same reasons to teach 'sex is sinful.' Neither unwanted pregnancy nor venereal disease was a problem and the afternoon was getting warm. Clete grabbed his shirt, swung up on the black and winced. \"I'm out of here. I'll be at the first cold stream.\" Lane and Dutch pulled on their shirts and got ready to follow. It took them awhile. They kept having to lean against things. Billy wasn't sure why they were laughing so hard, but he laughed too. He had a gold claim, supplies and a telegram to take to his mother. He was a very happy boy. The day wasn't over. They were nearing the ranch when Clete felt a problem. \"We've got company, Lane.\" \"How many, Clete?\" \"Half-dozen. Mean. Mad. Greedy.\" \"Get them for me.\" \"NO! Dutch, get Billy out of here! Lane's down! I'm after the--\" \"Sons of bitches that shot him in the back! Grab on, Billy! I'm going to put you in those rocks. We'll catch the wagon later. They won't run far.\" Dutch dropped Billy off and raced back. He heard gunfire and swung off his horse. He started his circle and took out a man holding a rifle. He wasn't gentle. He was too mad to worry about breaking him. He felt Clete's blast of rage and heard horses scream. The ones who had tried to run away would be mountless. Most people caught very little of what Clete was feeling. Most animals caught most of it. Clete stopped his horse from killing the man who had tried to kill him. Dutch ran down the two who were running. He met Clete at Lane's side. \"Bad. Damn. Why doesn't he let us know sooner?\" \"He does when it's one of us, Clete. I broke some.\" \"Me too. Slug went through. Medunit says touch and go. How far are we from Melissa?\" \"Too far. Triage. Stabilize him.\" \"He's actually sturdier than we are, Dutch. He's on his way. Go get Billy. He'll have a survivable wound by the time you get back here with the wagon. We'll use that coil of rope to secure the... men, then borrow the wagon to take them back to town.\" \"Done.\" All six men were alive, but in bad shape. Clete made sure none of them were actually dying. Billy wanted to shoot them. Dutch told him Lane would want them legally tried and convicted. Billy decided Judge Herkmer would take care of them when he rode through. In his culture, a judge decided guilt or innocence. The jury of fifteen decided penalty, within limits. If Lane lived, the men wouldn't hang. Clete didn't treat any of them. They would all be treated by a physician when they got them to town. They'd live because he'd saved Lane. That was enough. They tied the men on their horses and gently laid Lane on top of the supplies in the wagon. When they got to the ranch, they carried Lane inside, then unloaded the wagon fast. Sare just didn't understand when they began making a place for Lane in it. \"You're not going to take him with you?!\" \"Yes, Sare, we are. It's the fastest way to get him to the doctor.\" \"That bouncin' will be bad on him, Clete.\" \"We'll take it easy. We've seen enough injuries to know he'll make it. He heals real fast. He'll be fine in a few days.\" \"You're just sayin' that. He ain't gonna' make it. He's shot through the lung. If he survives, he'll be... well nigh a cripple a long time.\" \"Tell her, Clete. She'll keep it secret.\" \"Dutch... \" \"Tell her or I will. Who we are, what we are, where we come from, why we're here. I'll keep Billy busy outside.\" \"What's he mean?\" \"Lane's not going to like this. Sare, Lane wasn't shot through the lung. He was shot through the heart. He has two. We all do. Put your hands on my chest. We're not from your world. We're from the far future. Our father is... too far away to describe. It's our legacy, our job, to carry on his work. We... save worlds. This one will be murdered if we don't change the future. It will die in war. Killed by weapons that are developed too soon. We're here because someone else is here. Someone from the future. You don't believe me and I'm scaring you. Watch. This is why Lane won't die.\" He pulled the medunit from his pocket and used it on Lane. Sare gasped as she watched tissues knit together. \"It's what I used on Billy. I healed all but the flesh wound. I thought he deserved to brag about his scars. Great. Now you believe me and you're terrified. Sare, we're the good guys. The Gallants. The white knights. My mother helped destroy an army and rebuilt a world. Dutch's mother was an officer in a service that maintains the highest ideals. She gave her life to save a world. Lane's mother... I don't know. She was searching for our father. He's the true hero. We're just in the family business. Better. At least you're not terrified.\" \"You're angels.\" \"Definitely not. If Lane hadn't told me your husband was alive, I'd have proved it.\" \"How did he... \" \"Know? He sees the future. When it's terrible, we go back in the past to change it. I feel what other people feel. Dutch is the power, the love, that binds us. Lane knew he was going to be shot. It wasn't important enough to change.\" \"I was right. You're angels.\" \"Nah, just the Gallant boys.\" \"Same thing and I don't think you know much about angels. I won't tell Lane you told me.\" \"Thanks and you're right. I don't know much about angels. Lane didn't give us much briefing on the culture other than it's a lot like one we know well. He didn't even really explain why this is a frontier.\" \"The government bought it from the people who were already here. It was about empty and waitin' for the time we could meet the price. We pay half our taxes in food to earn the land, and they get it for another 68 years. Farmin' just isn't what most like to do, and they kept their numbers down, so the land could support the people huntin' and roamin' over it with their herds. When they just started blendin' in with the city people other places; goin' to school, learnin' trades and such, they worked out a plan to take care of them all and build them some schools and nice parks, horse ranches and such. It's goin' to be one country on more'n half this continent when we get this land producin' and bring the west and east together, and richer for the blendin'. I'm tryin' to think who could war like you say. It would take somethin' that would make someone true afraid.\" \"Yes, something is learned too soon. Now, not in close to a century.\" It took two days for the people of the town to come to a decision about the men keeping watch over the ones they'd brought in and put in the jail. Lane was actually 'up and around' by the time the mayor and town council visited them. He was healing incredibly fast. They'd told everyone he was lucky. Not many people could say they'd been back shot, had the bullet bounce off a bone and ended up with not much more than a flesh wound. \"Mr. Mayor, it's an honor, but--\" \"Take the job, Clete.\" \"Lane, we aren't going to be here long. They need someone who wants to help build this country.\" \"They need someone now. Today. Next week will be too late.\" \"All right. Swear me in. You've got yourself a town marshal.\" The first thing Clete did was make Dutch and Lane deputies. As soon as the official party left, they held a conference. \"All right, Lane, what do you see?\" \"Snow White and the witch. Sorry, Clete. There's a very lovely young lady who's desperately worried. Somehow, she's the key. Dutch, you're the one she turns to. Clete, the witch is your problem. She's not really that bad. You'll get her straightened out.\" \"And just what will you be doing?\" \"Spending a lot of time dizzy, Dutch. It's already starting. I need a chair. Go mingle with the townsfolk. Get acquainted. I'll be all right. I'll even meet you in the saloon. Oh, Clete, you've got another deputy. He's ready to get back to light duty. He's at the boarding house. Look him up. His name is Parker Redlore. Now go. I'm tired of keeping you in focus.\" Clete found Parker Redlore. He was a serious young man recovering from a serious injury. Clete asked to see it and did a bit of sleight of hand with the medunit. Parker decided he was fit enough to stand a watch at the jail. He told Clete he felt lots better. Clete agreed \"a reason to get up and around\" made a lot of difference. Dutch was very good at getting acquainted with the townspeople, half of them anyway. He met some men too. Then he saw Snow White. She was fairytale beautiful; black hair and porcelain skin. Perfectly proportioned to fit in a man's arms and lips created for kissing. She was also being hustled down the walk by an older woman. She looked up and right into his eyes. His head swam. He was drowning in twin blue pools. The older woman gave her arm a yank and called her a hussy. She meekly dropped her eyes and hurried along. That's when the shooting started. Dutch dove for cover. Six men were barreling down the street on horseback. As soon as they passed him, he vaulted on behind the one trailing. He tossed him from the saddle and went after the next one. He was on his third when Clete dove from atop a porch and took the lead three out of their saddles. It had been a very short jail break attempt. Clete and Dutch grabbed two unconscious men each and dragged them toward the jail. It was getting very full. Clete went back for the last two and Dutch got acquainted with Parker. He really liked the kid. The townspeople were very pleased with their full jail. They decided to hold the ice cream social, stock sale and dance, they'd been considering canceling, after all. Four men took a big wagon up into the mountains to get ice. They were quite sure the social would be well-attended. Four days was plenty of time for word to spread to outlying ranches the town was now a safe place to bring families. Their new lawmen were personally invited by a large number of people. Early that afternoon, Dutch asked Lane who should watch when. He just smiled at him. \"All right, we draw straws. Short straw takes first watch. Long straw takes last.\" \"Make that four straws, Dutch. I'm in on this too.\" \"You got it, Parker. Four straws it is.\" Dutch grinned at his new friend. Clete had been busy. Every time Parker fell asleep on the cot in the office, Clete used the medunit on him. A few more naps and he'd have nothing but a scar to remind him of the hole in his side. \"Long straw. Well, at least I'll get to see the stock show and have ice cream at the church. A lawman's work is never done. Later.\" \"Dutch, you've got the short straw. Clete's and mine are the same length.\" \"Ah, well, I wasn't that interested in the stock show and I will get to go to the dance, but I'd sure appreciate it if you'd send me a dish of ice cream. You know, Parker's really dedicated. He's a lawman because he wants to make the 'frontier' safe for people. When we leave, he should be marshal, Lane.\" \"Yes, Dutch. A real prince of a guy.\" \"Oh.\" Lane led Clete to the ice cream social. He didn't have any trouble identifying Snow White. She was obvious even before he asked for ice cream for Dutch. He grinned at Lane when he identified the witch. \"I'll take it to him.\" \"You'll do no such-- Drat that girl. I'll never turn her into a proper lady. Her father should have sent her to me years ago.\" \"Ma'am, I think you're doing a fine job. She seems like a very nice girl.\" \"Oh, she's nice enough, but she just won't walk and talk like a lady. I mean, look at the way she ran out of here. No bonnet. Runnin' down the street with a dish in her hand.\" \"Ma'am, I think being a lady is something that comes from inside. Any woman can wear a bonnet and walk and talk proper. A lady is something more. She's got you as an example. She's bound to turn out right.\" \"Please call me Bella, Marshal. Won't you have another dish of ice cream?\" \"If you'd be willing to join me in that shady spot over there, I'd love one.\" \"Lispeth, I'm goin' to sit a bit with the marshal. You come dip.\" Clete smiled as she dropped her apron on a chair and came round the table. He noticed she hadn't put on her bonnet. Bella was a very handsome woman, if a bit strait-laced. He noticed the afternoon was getting warm in his vicinity and wondered if she was planning on loosening those laces a bit. He also knew exactly when Dutch got his ice cream. \"I brought you some ice cream. The marshal said you'd asked and I... \" She was breathless and blushing. Dutch decided he was going to get hurt. He was already in love. \"Thank you. I thought it was the only thing I was going to miss this afternoon. I seem to have been very wrong. But now, it's here and you're here and I haven't missed anything after all. Let's sit on the porch. I feel like a real villain eating ice cream and sharing lovely company in front of all those misguided people back there. They call me Dutch. What's your name?\" \"Tessa. I probably should get back. My aunt will be upset if I don't.\" \"Was your aunt with you in town a few days ago?\" \"Yes. I saw what you did. You were wonderful.\" Dutch looked into her eyes and got dizzy. \"Uh, just doing my job.\" He was in trouble. She was pure and sweet and innocent, and he'd have promised to stay with her forever in that instant. And would have. And counted himself lucky. \"Speaking of jobs, you came to see me for something. You wanted to talk to a lawman.\" \"That's just the way Parker says it, proud-like. I been tryin' to think of a way to see him, but my aunt would never believe it was just business.\" \"I see. You and he are more than friends.\" \"Fore my pa sent me to my aunt's place, he used to come over of a Sabbath and have dinner.\" \"Why did your father send you to your aunt?\" \"He said to learn proper lady things, but I don't believe it. He never said anything about it before. He was scared of somethin' and wanted me safe. I'm real worried. I ain't heard from him in more'n ten days and he wasn't in church on Sabbath.\" \"It sounds like he may be in trouble. Can you tell me any more?\" \"My pa's a good man. He's real smart. He makes all kinds of interestin' things. He sells some of 'em to people to make lots of 'em. Gets money for every one they sell. We do pretty good on it.\" \"A successful inventor. A very rare and talented individual. You said you thought something had scared him. Any idea what?\" \"I don't know more'n it started after a funny little man came to visit. I watched from my window. It was pretty late at night. He got Pa out of bed. He showed Pa somethin' and he got real excited. He put on his pants and went off with him. He snuck back in early in the mornin'. Acted funny when I asked him about it. Said he'd been busy makin' us rich and I shouldn't pry.\" Dutch made the mistake of looking into her eyes again. He swallowed. It didn't help the lump in his throat at all. He hadn't expected it to help the one in his chest. \"We thought something strange might be going on around here. This town sprouted more than its usual crop of nasties recently. We've been trying to figure out why.\" \"Well, two of them fellas I seen afore. They work for a minin' company Pa built some things for. They got a big dig up in the mountains. They come got the things Pa built.\" \"Tessa, I want you to go back to the fair and find my brother... Never mind. Why don't you go to the stock show? I think you'll see someone there who will be real pleased to see you.\" \"My aunt will be mad, says ladies don't belong in barns.\" \"Your aunt probably won't even notice. Unless I miss my guess, she's in the company of my brother Clete.\" \"The marshal?!\" \"That's the one. I doubt she'll be looking for you.\" \"Aunt Bella with the marshal, she's probably just as glad I'm not around.\" She giggled. Dutch thought it was the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard. \"Thank you, Dutch. I feel lots better.\" She flashed him a dazzling smile and walked away. He groaned and buried his face in his hands. \"Dammit, Clete. Not now!\" Lane walked around the corner of the building and sat down in the chair Tessa had just vacated. Dutch didn't even look up. \"Go to the saloon, Dutch. Find company. You two were running a feedback loop. Get drunk if necessary.\" \"Lane--\" \"Go. I'll take over. You don't want to be here when Parker comes in.\" \"You're right. He'll be floating on air and all I'll want to do is ground him. You all right?\" \"Yes. You've made the change. I needed a nice quiet place to let the images settle. Now, GO!\" Dutch was too busy meeting people to actually drink much, but he had several companions, two of whom were carrying unopened bottles, when he got to the large open area where the fair, which the people called a \"social,\" was being held. The sound of gunfire had attracted his attention. It didn't surprise him at all that Clete found him immediately. He was feeling pretty strange. \"Dutch, you're going to get drunk.\" \"Yes, Clete, I certainly am. Lane's orders. The girls are his idea too. What's going on?\" \"Sharpshooting show.\" \"About time for Lane to show up. Let's show off. I need it. Ego boost. Found out a knight loses to a prince.\" \"The way it has to be.\" \"Come on, girls. The Gallant boys are about to join the show.\" \"I'd have never known he'd been drinking. Do you really intend to be in the show?\" \"If Dutch says he needs it, he needs it. I'll find you a nice place to sit and watch, Bella. Just promise you won't go away. I plan on taking you dancing later.\" \"Don't you worry, Marshal. I'll be right where you can find me.\" \"Hi, Clete, Ma'am.\" \"You know what's going on, Lane?\" \"Yes. We'll be waiting for you. Routine three. The whole thing. The horses are standing behind the grandstand.\" \"He really does need a boost. Alcohol?\" \"He really does and you know he'd never pull a gun if he didn't know exactly how much he'd had and what its effect would be.\" \"Yeah, he wants the anesthesia, but needs the boost. Routine three should be enough of one to reduce the desire for the anesthesia. I'll be there.\" Clete found a place in the grandstand for Bella and met Dutch and Lane by the horses. The horses weren't trained for the routine, but they'd only use them for the intro. They vaulted on. They were riding bareback. Clete nodded and Lane signaled the emcee. They kicked the horses into motion and started boosting Dutch's ego. They rode, tumbled, shot, tumbled, shot again. Then they really started showing off. The finale was perfect. Dutch started his run. Lane did the lift and Clete tossed him. He soared into the air, did an impossible double fast draw, and shot the tops off six pennants at the top of his flight. He reholstered the guns and dropped onto their crossed arms. They tossed him into the air and did handsprings. They ended in a line and set six guns spinning in perfect synchronization. They spun and put two shots each through the center of the target, spun guns into holsters, turned toward the audience and bowed. Total silence. They whistled for their horses and vaulted on. They actually got out of the performing ring before the place exploded in cheers. \"I FEEL BETTER!\" Lane and Clete laughed. They told their horses they were wonderful and Lane led them back to their stalls, then he began looking for company. The band was tuning up and the dance would be foot-stomping fun. Company found him. A lot of it. Dutch swept through with more company and they hit the dance floor. Clete escorted Bella onto the floor and the town cut loose. They collected guns when a few men decided to shoot theirs into the air. The party didn't get much quieter, but it did get safer. \"Lane, we're getting out of here. Things are really starting to warm up.\" \"I noticed, Dutch. I don't think I'm going to be able to stand the heat much longer either. See you in the morning. Ladies, I'm drowning in moonslight. Save me.\" \"Where are they going, Marshal?\" \"Walking in the moonslight.\" \"All of them?\" \"I'm the only one who's chosen a lady for the evening. They just have company. Would you like to take a walk in the moonslight, Bella?\" \"Yes, Marshal, I would.\" He smiled. She sounded surprised. He could feel her pleasure in the invitation and the surprise. \"Please, I'm only Marshal when I'm working. I am most definitely off duty. I'm Clete.\" \"I'm glad you're off duty, Clete.\" Dutch watched the street from the office. The town was nice and peaceful. It made him feel very nice. He'd had a nice night and didn't have the hangover he'd been planning before they'd showed off. He nodded to Bella and Clete on the walk across the street. \"That is a changed woman, Lane. She's beautiful.\" \"Amazing what a little bit of Clete's own brand of sunshine can do for a late bloomer. Nice thing is, it'll last. She's discovered she's beautiful, Dutch. Now she always will be. Ah, that's the judge. We need to get this done and find that mining company.\" \"Did you see him light up when Clete introduced Bella?\" \"Yes. So did Clete. That's one worry off his mind.\" \"I'm gone, Lane. Out the back. See you in court.\" Lane sighed and ached a bit for Dutch. He didn't blame him for not wanting to be there when the two approaching the door arrived. He needed a bit of time to bury the hurt a bit deeper. \"Hello, Parker. You must be Tessa. It's very nice to meet you.\" \"Tessa, this is Lane. Isn't Dutch here? We were goin' to ask him to lunch.\" \"Sorry, Parker, you just missed him. You two go on. Busy day. There are Sare and Billy Kendirk.\" \"Oh, what a pretty dress.\" \"Please tell her that, Tessa, and make sure Billy hears. He chose that material for her. He said it was the first store-bought present he'd ever given her.\" \"Lane, you're a nice man. All of you are nice. Dutch especially. I felt much better after we'd talked. It was like I had a big brother I could tell my worries.\" \"I'm sure he'd be complimented. I don't think anyone's ever said that to him before. Ah, Sare, Billy. You know Tessa and Parker, I believe.\" \"Hello, Tessa. Parker, you're looking well. You had us worried for awhile.\" \"I'm much better, Ma'am. Been healin' right well.\" \"Sare, that's a real pretty dress.\" \"Billy picked the material for me, Tessa.\" \"Think I'll have him come shoppin' with me. I never know what's goin' to be pretty made up. Not many men have the knack. Musta' got it from his pa. He always picks you pretty things too.\" Lane worked to keep his hurt for Dutch out of his eyes and smile. He really had found Snow White, but she'd already found her prince. \"Billy, I think Clete will want you. You'll be testifying. I think he'd like you to meet the judge. I saw them go into the hotel.\" \"I want to meet him too, Lane. It'll be easier sayin' what I got to say if'n he's not a stranger. I'll head over there. All right, Ma?\" \"Certainly is. You got important things to do. You get 'em done.\" She smiled as he ran across the street. Parker made a swipe as he went by and laughed when he missed. \"Amazin' how this town's changed since you boys come. How you been, Lane?\" \"I'm just fine, Sare.\" She watched Parker and Tessa enter the hotel, then turned and grinned at him. \"Yep. Amazin' how healthy everthin' got after the Gallant boys walked in from somewhere.\" Frontier justice was swift. The judge heard the testimony, asked the prisoners questions and made his decision. The fifteen men and women set the punishment. The six, who had attacked them, were given the maximum of twelve years \"confinement and labor.\" The other six, who had made a loud and foolish attempt to scare the town into letting them go, were given one year. If Lane had died, six would have also died. With the town and jail empty of 'bad guys' and Parker on his feet, they weren't really needed there any longer. Clete turned over his badge to Parker and they headed out to solve the real problem. \"Do we check the mine or the farm first?\" \"You choose.\" \"Again, huh? I hate doing this when we're riding, Lane. I'm afraid I'll hit something big and you'll fall off. The farm. CLETE! Help me get him down!\" \"I've got him! What happened, Dutch?\" \"I asked him farm or mine and he told me to choose.\" \"While we were riding?\" \"That's what I said.\" \"You picked?\" \"The farm. I don't think he expected this.\" \"I didn't. Find us some place in the shade. This is.…\" \"Bring the horses, Dutch. He's clear out. We hit something bigger than one planet in trouble. Shade. Get water. I hear a stream over that way.\" Clete settled Lane and sat down. \"Clete, wrong choice. Bad choice. Both wrong.\" \"Lane! Lane? Dutch, we've got to decide to do something totally different. We've got to change things fast.\" \"We use Melissa?\" \"Done.\" \"Roller coaster. Swoops and dives. Flying.\" \"Lane, we're going back to Melissa.\" \"Good choice, Dutch.\" \"Here. Cold water. Do you need me? Do you want me to come in?\" \"No. Just give it time to steady. They're not what they seem. Six of one. Half-dozen of the other. We have to choose the right ones. Our key. Snow White. Everything follows.\" \"The men we put away?\" \"No, Dutch. Twelve await. Our test. Our judgment. Our choice.\" \"Clete, he's not making a lot of sense.\" \"He's worried, but not lost. Still confused. Getting better. Scared a little. For us.\" \"I'm worried all right. We're about to undergo a very strange test. It's waiting for us in the clearing with Melissa. We'll be given one clue. Snow White. Just that. I don't know what it means, but that's what we're given. Each of us must make exactly the right choice. We're facing judgment. I'm ready.\" \"Do you have any images after we reach Melissa?\" \"No, Dutch. Once we ride into the clearing, everything ends. We're given the clue and told we must choose on our way there.\" \"No point in putting it off. I'll get the horses.\" \"Clete, somehow, everything we've done, everything we are, has been leading to this. Dutch is our center, but he still feels like the weak link. As if he doesn't really belong.\" \"I know. Our talents are obvious. He isn't really capable of envy, but he gets wistful about them. He puts his life in our hands with a trust that frightens me. If we asked him to die, he would cheerfully give up his life and only ask if we were sure it was necessary.\" \"That's some progress. A few years ago he wouldn't have asked. You know, he's the only one who belongs here. We're outsiders. Both born on the other side of the doorway. This is his home. He's our touchstone with this universe.\" \"The choice must be his.\" \"Yes, Clete, the choice is his. We have to believe in him, as he does in us. Are you ready to die if he says it's necessary?\" \"A very good question. I need-- No I don't. The answer is yes. His lack of faith in himself makes it hard for me. I have to look past it. I find it's his and not my own.\" \"Good. I think we have one major problem.\" \"Convincing him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"They weren't real happy about leaving that nice fresh clover. I finally convinced them. Told them too much would give them tummy aches. All right. You're both looking at me like... I don't know, but something's up.\" \"Yes, Dutch. It's time you carried your load. We're handing it to you.\" \"Lane, I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"He's telling you the choice is yours. Whatever it is, it will be the right one for us. We give you ourselves. Use us as you deem necessary. Stop it! Why can't you trust yourself? We have complete faith in you. You must know that. You don't know it. Lane, he just doesn't believe me.\" \"Then we show him. Sit down, Dutch. Between us. We're going to take you apart and put you back together again. Decide now. Are we doing the wrong thing?\" \"You never do the wrong thing.\" \"There it is. That's the problem. Of course I do, but I do the best I can. So does Clete. So do you. That's all that really matters. Take our hands. You must decide. We can't join together unless you will it. You are our binding force. I'm not even sure we'd exist in this universe without you.\" \"That's silly. Of course you'd exist.\" \"Would we, Dutch? Clete's from the past of another universe, created out of one woman's love and determination to give him existence, an impossible feat. I helped bring my own mother to my father, but you brought her into our reality. You are real. Your mother made a choice and used well-known biological techniques, the tested methods of science. Clete and I are impossible. You are not. We're dreams come true. You are firmly real.\" \"Lane, you're scaring him.\" \"Good. He needs the courage it takes to overcome fear. He can't go on being fearless. It's not real.\" \"All right. You want to show me. Do it.\" Dutch reached for them and pulled their minds to his. He fought down his fear and conquered it. They broke him apart. They showed him what he was to them, their faith in him. Their absolute, unquestioning, trust. The union was complete. He was one being and three. His doubt died. He learned himself. His was the power of choice. He was their freedom and his own. Mistakes were unimportant. Trust and striving were all. They gave him their love. The ultimate gesture of total trust. He showed them his. They had always known. He had been afraid of failing them. He learned he could not. He slowly separated them from himself and found they remained bound to him. He would always know where they were, when they were, and how they fared. He had taken his place and accepted his burden. \"Wow.\" \"I believe that expresses it nicely. All right, Dutch. Now I think we're ready. How about it?\" \"It'll take me awhile to get my feet back on the ground, Lane, but yes, we're ready.\" \"Good. I'm drowning in your pleasure. Put your backside in the saddle. Let's get this done.\" \"Clete, you're a fraud. You're singing inside.\" \"Dutch, if we don't start riding, it'll be outside too.\" Actually, they all sang several songs their father had taught them. The folk medley from the 'Sixties' just seemed appropriate somehow. They were going to be tested. They were ready. Dutch reined in and just stared at her for a few seconds. This was more than a likeness. \"Snow White, right out of the cel.\" \"Yes, Dutch. The test awaits you. It is life or death and you three must choose. You may choose only six. No more. The powers of this universe have met and you are their battleground.\" \"Good and evil.\" \"Do you think it that simple?\" \"No. Chaos and order; life and death, shadow and light, endings and beginnings. They can't exist without each other.\" \"You are so very young to have the wisdom to see it. I am here because it is your wish to serve that which also possesses the wisdom. Remember, no more than six.\" \"That's your clue, Dutch. We have faith in your decision.\" \"I know, Lane. I'm ready.\" They rode into the clearing and stopped in surprise. Twelve beautiful women stood awaiting them. They dismounted and their horses trotted off. One of the women stepped forward and smiled. \"We are companions for you. You have the choice of six.\" \"What happens to the others?\" \"They will be slain.\" \"And if I choose none? What happens to you?\" \"We will live, but you three will be slain. Do not choose that way. You are needed.\" \"I've made the choice. We'd rather die than be the cause of death to innocents. Kill us. We're prepared.\" The women lifted the bows laying at their feet and they fell in a rain of arrows. Lane whispered, \"It was the right choice, Dutch.\" He knew it was. He smiled as he died. \"Awaken.\" Dutch opened his eyes. Snow White sat on the ground near his feet. He sat up and checked Lane and Clete. \"They live, as do you.\" \"I'd assumed I was alive. I was dead?\" \"If life was not truly risked, it would not have been the testing you wanted. \" \"I guess we did, I did, want it. That's why you're Snow White and not Lane's or Clete's dream girl.\" \"Why did you choose this way? \"We want to protect life. Want to serve it. Choosing life for some and death for others may be necessary sometime, but if we had the choice, it would be life for all. The choice we were asked to make had no compassion. Without compassion, we are a force for destruction. It is not what we have chosen to be.\" \"You have chosen a symbol. It is fitting. Awaken your brothers.\" \"Clete, Lane, wake up. We have company. Seems I made our decision correctly.\" Lane and Clete sat up and grinned at him. They hadn't had any doubts. \"Kneel before me. You have been tested and found to be pure of heart. Your oath to serve life was given in your choice.\" Snow White produced a gleaming sword from somewhere and tapped Dutch, then Clete and Lane on both shoulders. \"Roberrin, I name you Knight Champion. Pericles, I name you Knight Guardian. Apollo, I name you Knight Judge.\" Suddenly she was gone from the clearing. \"How about that? We have official status. Our side, three. Opponent, zip.\" \"Dutch, I've got memories again. We've still got a change to make.\" \"And I'm absolutely awash in brotherly love. Horses or Melissa, Lane?\" \"Both, Clete. Round them up. I'll see if I can talk Melissa into a new shape. Dutch, I'll need you. She listens better if you're around.\" \"Right, Lane. Sure she does. You neglect to mention she only listens to you.\" They spent the night in Melissa and set out on the road in the morning. Lane had been successful. The bright painting on the side of the wagon said \"Gallant Brothers Traveling Show.\" The buckskins didn't mind pulling it. The black tossed his head and danced down the road ahead of them. They headed for the farm first. It didn't take them long to find the evidence they'd expected. \"We're on the right track, Lane. Tessa's father was working with radioactive materials. I found residual traces in his workshop. Is this the piece you meant?\" \"That's it. Dutch, come over here. What do you think of this?\" \"I think our time traveler is stranded without it. He wouldn't have left it behind unless... He doesn't want someone else to have time travel! He's a fool, but not intentionally destructive.\" \"Most of the stuff in the shed looks like they were working on power generation.\" \"That would make sense, Clete. All right. I've got a clear image of the way to the mining camp. Put that piece in Melissa. He kept it out of their hands. We have to do the same. Let's see... Dutch you drive. I really need some rest. I spent most of last night trying to pick a clear path through the jumble in my head. Wake me when you need me.\" \"Lane, why don't you go in and go to bed?\" \"I like the feel of the sun. Oh, hide our keys. Yours and mine. Clete can keep his around his neck. Three alike is too many. They'll... Ah, that's better. Good choice. They'll never notice.\" Dutch shook his head and tucked the keys into the horses' harness. They became one more decoration in the gaudy equipment. He smiled, as he looked at Lane curled up behind the seat of Melissa-as-wagon. He felt a surge of protectiveness. Clete grinned at him as he climbed up beside him. It was a new feeling from Dutch. He'd been waiting for it a long time. He chuckled softly when Dutch arranged himself to keep the sun off Lane's fair face. Clete tapped Lane awake at the crossroads. He pointed and went back to sleep. They maintained their cover by camping at a spot that showed frequent use. Lane stood watch while Clete and Dutch slept. They dawdled over breakfast and took their time breaking camp. They knew they were about to have company. Everything was put away and Dutch was hitching the horses when it rode in. \"What are you doin' here?\" \"Hitching a horse to a wagon. Oh. Traveling. We're showmen. The Gallant Brothers. I'm sure you've heard of us. I'm Dutch. My brothers are around here someplace. We took so long over breakfast, they decided to fix lunch.\" \"This road doesn't go anywhere.\" \"You mean it doesn't go up to a big mine?\" \"What do you know about that?\" \"I know where there are hard-working men, there's money to be made. Sounded like a big enough operation to be worth the trip. There are my brothers now. All right! We eat good today.\" \"Hi there. Company for lunch. Come on, Clete. Bring those fish over here. Let's stuff them. I've got some wild tubers and herbs. Dutch, where are your manners? Introduce us.\" \"Sorry, Lane, we hadn't gotten that far. I'll stir up the fire. Ouch! Stones are good and hot. Hmm... Ooh, those leaves smell good. The fish will be nice wrapped in them. Won't you join us Mister... \" \"Carna. Lef Carna. Don't mind if I do. Sure looks good.\" \"In a few minutes, it'll smell that way. I'm Clete. That's Lane. I catch the fish, but he turns them into a feast.\" \"How do, Mr. Carna.\" \"Jes, Lef. Where'd you boys come from?\" \"Down south lately. We've never really had a place to be from. Our dad's a traveling man, quite a magician. Never could figure out how he made all those flowers appear. We're on our own now. Put together our own kind of show. Got enough material we can vary it to suit the audience.\" \"Where'd you hear about the mine?\" \"Dutch, do you remember?\" \"Not right off hand, Lane. Yes I do. A pretty girl told me about it. I stuck it on our route.\" \"What was the girl's name?\" \"Lef, you just asked my brother a question he probably can't answer. He doesn't remember their names. Just tells them they're beautiful and gives them a farewell kiss.\" \"Clete, I remember their names. I just don't always remember which name went with which girl. I usually just give them one I think suits them. Let's see... I called her 'Snow White.' She had soft white skin and big blue eyes. Wasn't too long back. I spent an afternoon with her. I had dates for the evening. Twins I think. Sisters? Four of them, anyway. All with soft brown hair. No, they were just friends. Yeah, friends. Or...maybe that was the night I woke up with a whole bunch and I couldn't remember where I found them all.\" \"See what I mean? A question he can't answer.\" Lef laughed. He liked these boys. \"Well, the boss keeps a pretty tight lid on things. We don't see many strangers, but we could use a good show. We had a bunch of boys ride off with our supply list and they ain't come back. They were carryin' a little money, but not a lot. I figure they got drunk and spent it and lit out. You boys could make extra if you're carryin' good drink.\" \"Sorry, Lef. Got enough trouble with Dutch sober. Drunk he gets in more. Forgets to ask if they're married. Lane and I hate having to leave town in a hurry.\" \"Too bad. Even the saloon's gettin' low.\" \"You have a saloon?!\" \"Dutch, we got everthin'. Good-size town, all in all.\" \"Women?\" \"Them too. Jes be careful. Right number of 'em's married.\" \"Yippee! This isn't going to be as boring as I thought.\" They'd needed Lef. He got them through the guards and Dutch to the mine owner's office. That person wasn't pleased. \"Boss, we need somethin' new. They're jes' showmen. I jes' don' see no problem.\" \"You aren't paid to make decisions. I told you not to let people come here, not guide them in. Get out of here, Lef. Before I forget you're a good miner.\" \"Sir, we put on a good show. We're even getting pretty well-known places. We're here. Why don't you let us do what we're good at?\" \"All right, but keep to your own business.\" \"No problem. A mine is a mine. You've seen one hole in the ground, you've seen them all. I like sunshine and moonslight. And women. You don't find any of them in a hole.\" Dutch grinned at the man who made his skin crawl. He'd already figured out what was being hidden. There were other things being pulled out, but he was standing over a uranium mine. \"We'll put on a big show day after tomorrow.\" \"Why so long?\" \"You want to give everybody a day off? You do, we'll do it sooner. We just figured you'd want it on the day most of the men aren't working.\" \"Day after tomorrow.\" Dutch left the office and walked to the saloon. Lane had told him they needed to enhance their reputation a bit. He and Clete were already there. They'd taken rooms at the hotel. Dutch wasn't looking forward to the hangover he had been told to build. \"Day after tomorrow.\" \"Right. Clete, what's the feel of the place?\" \"Suppressed energy. Hard labor with not a lot of ways to unwind. Worry. Some fear. Unfocused. Lane, some of these men are in bad shape.\" \"I saw it. Radiation sickness. There's more here than just a mine. We could synthesize the drug, but I don't see any way to give it to them.\" \"I do, Lane. Let's set up a still, get real drunk tomorrow night and give it away. Real friendly.\" \"Ow, my head. Two hangovers in a row is too much to think about, Dutch.\" \"I think one is enough too, Clete. Tomorrow night we'll drink a substitute. They won't know the difference. We'll add some herbs to it. Sell it as a tonic, then 'get wasted' and give it away. Lane can make it taste good.\" \"Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"No, I'm all right. Not bad. Good change. Images clearing. We've got a path. A good one. All the way through. Damn. Well, it'll be worth it.\" \"Uh, Clete, did that 'damn' make you as nervous as it did me?\" \"Yeah, Dutch. Why is it I'm no longer worried about a hangover?\" \"We'll get through. Tessa's father and our traveler are in the mine. They think our nasty has Tessa. There's a girl here with the same coloring. He showed her from a distance and sent them a piece of her hair. Our time traveler is from this world. He's an incredible genius, but time travel was an accident. He found the mineral and figured out what he'd done after the fact. He wanted to stop the terrible chemical pollution of his time. Thought he could do it by creating nuclear power and bypassing the fossil fuel age. A bit dotty. Looked up Tessa's dad as a great inventor in the right area. He's just as worried about Tessa as her dad is. Nice old boy. He'll be willing to listen to what we have to say, but we have to show him his world comes out of its chemical slog. He's going to fall in love with Melissa.\" \"Lane, what are we going to get through?\" \"Dutch, you don't really want to know.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Where do we start?\" \"Right here. No, wait. We've got to get the still going. Clete, you and me. Dutch, find all the women you can. Go out of here with a bottle in one hand and your shirt in the other. Make a point of asking if they're married. Clete and I will join you in the same condition. We're going to do some heavy showing off. No guns. Pure physical stuff. Clete, it's going to be a very warm night. We're going to be spread a bit thin. We want the undivided attention of every single woman here.\" \"How many is that?\" \"About two dozen.\" \"No problem.\" Lane and Dutch laughed and Clete grinned. Lane still felt a little odd, but he was too wise to dwell on something before it happened. Dutch watched them leave, then went to the bar and ordered two bottles. Drunk was going to take quite a bit of the rather watered alcohol served in the place. He wondered what Lane would say if he asked for a hangover cure. They'd agreed not to use it. They had decided it was too easy. If they were going to abuse themselves, they should pay for it. This was different. It was in the line of duty. He decided they shouldn't suffer for it. Lane would see the decision and make the arrangements. He made a swift end to one bottle and started on the other. He knew what kind of single girls he would find in a mining camp, but by the time he got through the second bottle, they would be beautiful ladies. He grinned at the bartender's expression when he handed him the second empty bottle and ordered a third. He didn't open it. It would spill. That was it. He was ready. He took off his shirt and shook out his hair, gave a whoop and burst out the doors. He did a tumbling run down the middle of the road and grinned. Both shirt and bottle were a bit dusty, but neither was damaged. He asked the first woman he saw if she was married and did she have friends. She said no and yes and he started gathering them. They weren't shy. He was dizzy with kisses when Lane and Clete found them. They showed off. Miners coming off shift got in the spirit and challenged Clete to contests of strength. Dutch ran a race against a horse and won. Lane spun through the women and every lace was undone and in his hands. They did a perfect tumbling routine, then headed back to the saloon. They cleaned out the stocks and shared them around. The moons came up and Clete let loose. The night got warm, very warm. They'd gotten the women a bit drunk too. They'd found it was a good way to keep them from noticing their two heartbeats, until they stopped noticing period. When morning came, Lane handed Dutch and Clete small capsules and swallowed his own. Clete stretched and purred. They left a large group of sleeping people in the meadow and went to find a hot bath, shirts and breakfast. \"Clete, you're purring again. It makes my teeth rattle.\" \"Sorry, Dutch. I'm trying not to. Just takes a bit of shutdown time.\" \"You were wide open and broadcasting last night. Wonder how many people here in the camp picked it up.\" \"Look around, Dutch. A lot of them. Those three women over there are married.\" \"I see what you mean, Lane. They look very contented.\" \"They are. The only frustrated people in this camp are single men. All but three of them.\" \"Clete, you're smug. Since I am too, I'm sure it's appropriate. But the purring drives me crazy!\" \"Let's get to work. These are the herbs I need for flavor. Clete, you get them. Stay away from the mining operation. Dutch, you start the drug synthesis. I'm going to buy a lot of grain. Mention I need to replenish my mash.\" \"Lane, you're really going to fix these people up, aren't you?\" \"What do you mean, Clete?\" \"I recognize a few of these. Looked over your shoulder when you were analyzing the local plants. Our tonic is going to cure practically every disease on the planet and give them a good vitamin dose besides.\" \"It'll taste good too. They've got a magnificent biota. I don't blame Professor Princar for wanting to save it. Most of those plants are already being used. Their medicine shows are true aids, not fraudulent like the ones on Earth were. Their biota is why they're much healthier in general. Medicine shows bring herbal aids from elsewhere. Birth control in a tea and antibiotic in poultices, salves and powders. They're just beginning to learn why the things they've been using for centuries work. It's why our time-traveler is so desperate to save it and chose this as the time. Tessa's father is aware of what they'd be be losing. If there was something to help radiation sickness, I'd have used it instead of having Dutch synthesize. Oh, unlock Melissa for him. Ride out bare-chested and bareback, gathering bag over your shoulder.\" \"All right, but I'm taking a shirt. Dutch sometimes misses places when he spreads screen and I hate finding out about it when I get red spots.\" They laughed and went to work. By late afternoon, they were ready to sell their tonic. They didn't have to pitch it. Every working girl in the camp pitched it for them. Men started lining up as soon as they saw them setting up. They sold it by the dipper and by the bottle. A few special bottles were prepared just for children. They contained everything but the alcohol. They said they never charged for children's tonic. They drank copious amounts of fluid that looked like the same thing, but wasn't. The actual alcohol content of the tonic was fairly low. They started acting drunk and got generous. Dutch slipped extra doses into the dipper for men who were in more advanced stages of radiation poisoning. Clete did his sleight of hand with the medunit on a few men with the type of injuries that occurred among pick-and-shovel miners. Lane brought buckets of their tonic out and kept the big iron kettle brimming. They kept careful count and Dutch took a friendly half-dozen bottles to the saloon. He shared them with the bartender and the working girls. Clete gave take-home bottles to the shaft boss to give the men working the last shift. They bottled the last kettle-full and left the bottles sitting out, then went to the hotel for a good night's sleep, about four hours. They got ready to build their show arena early in the morning. Clete made sure they were all well-spread with a good sunscreen. Dutch said he didn't plan on getting any sun on \"that part\" of his anatomy. Clete told him to hold still. Lane made sure Clete didn't get spots, then they went for wood. The hammering attracted attention and an audience. Lane and Dutch grinned at each other when Clete took off his shirt. Several of the married women gasped, but they didn't leave, just stood and watched him split rails. He shook his head and laughed when Lane and Dutch dumped buckets of water over him. They finished the arena and grandstand by mid-afternoon and went to get ready. They asked the bartender to collect admission for them on the way to Melissa. They replicated three snow-white, silver-trimmed outfits and strapped on guns. They had trained the horses and added several pieces to routine three. Clete whistled and they started the show. The miners and others in the camp were a very appreciative audience. They didn't know some of the things they did couldn't have been done by someone from their world, but they were sure they'd just seen the best sharpshooting show on it. Dutch was feeling very nice when they rode out of the arena to thunderous applause. Clete was pleased too, but there was an undercurrent of tension in Lane that kept him from reveling in Dutch's pleasure. \"That went well. The horses are born performers.\" \"Clete, that's an understatement. They and we were magnificent.\" \"Dutch, give me your gunbelt. You too, Clete. We don't want them on us. I'm going to give them to the hotel manager and ask him to keep them for us. I already told the bartender to give him the gate receipts to put in the safe. Clete, do you have the medunit?\" \"Yes.\" \"Let me see... Dutch, put it behind the lamp at the mine entrance. We'll want it, but we don't want it found. Push it back in the niche. Do it, then meet us back here. Don't be seen. Move fast. Now.\" Clete watched Lane 'waiting.' He could feel his tension had become anticipation of something and it wasn't pleasant. \"Dutch is close and so is something else. Tell me what it is, Lane.\" \"Pain. Our nasty boys are real sick. They want us. We're going to have to let them have us. It's the path to the survival of this world.\" \"Can't we change it?\" \"We could. Do you want to risk it?\" \"Risk what?\" \"Changing something because it's hard on us, Dutch.\" \"A silly question. Don't you think so, Clete?\" \"Yeah. Sorry I asked.\" \"Oops. Unit's in place. Now what?\" \"A good meal. The boarding house porch. Enjoy it. It'll be our last for awhile.\" Lane nearly hoped something would change things, but nothing did. It happened just as he remembered. Before they'd quite finished dinner, they were taken to the mine owner's house. \"They were easy to take, Boss. We just held guns on everybody else in the place and they stood there and let us chain them up.\" \"Idiot. You made them heroes. Well, spread the word we found out they're wanted men and were after the payroll anyway. Maybe somebody will believe it.\" \"Nobody's going to come up here to the house for 'em, Boss.\" \"Lef might have, but I put him back out on the trail. Did you get their wagon?\" \"Yeah, but we can't get it open.\" \"Search them for keys. No, I think I'll do it myself. Hold very still if you don't want a bullet put through your brother's head.\" Lane held his breath. He could feel Clete's anger. He breathed in relief when he felt him clamp down on it. He held very still. He felt Dutch begin to pull them together. It worried him. It wasn't in his memories. He gasped and concentrated on the shifting images. Dutch had made a good choice. The path was still clear. Being together would make what they had to go through easier. He felt the gun at his head and watched as Dutch was searched. Clete's turn came last. The man found the key around his neck, but didn't realize what it was. He left it there. They laughed together in their minds. He had found the key to the universe and had not recognized it. Then it began. Endless hours of pain for one, then another. Dutch's love had 'added value' to the ordeal. They were more interesting, because they were stronger together. They would gain something from it, but that wasn't the reason it was worth it. It would strengthen the rule of law in the still sparsely settled land. It was Clete's turn again, and it was time. He waited for Dutch to begin the path. \"How much longer, Lane?\" \"Soon, Dutch. They don't want us to die of thirst. We're still strong enough to be interesting. Clete, come on. Come back to us. Dutch, do something.\" \"He's trying to shield us from his pain.\" \"I know what he's doing. It's just the wrong choice. Pull him back. Force him if necessary. Show him what I see. He must accept the bonding. Must let us help hold him above what he's going through. Do it, Dutch. Do it now. He'll die if he takes it alone. He'll take his and ours. Like he's always done. Stop him. This time stop him. This time you can.\" \"Lane... \" \"Dutch, this time you can. Now, stop him.\" Dutch fought Clete. Fought him with his love. Pulled him. Drove through the barriers he had built and wept for him. Tears he wouldn't shed for himself. He gathered them together and forced Clete to open himself. Forced him to accept their presence. To see why he must allow it. Forced him to accept their strength. He surrendered his pain. They had made the choice for him. \"They're bringing him back. They give us water. Not enough to rebuild ourselves, but enough to keep us alive. Dutch, prepare yourself for the blood. You felt the pain. You can't let the sight shock you. We'll lose him if you do.\" \"Can I be angry, Lane?\" \"Oh, yes. We can be very, very angry.\" Rage. Blinding, burning, rage. Fury like he'd known only once before. Lane and Dutch burned him clean with their anger. He struggled to lift his head and look at them. He smiled and slipped into unconsciousness. Lane sighed in relief. \"He's dying of thirst. We all are. If that's what you plan, tell us now. We'll be unconscious by nightfall.\" \"Give them water. I don't want them drying up and passing out. This one too. Give him some now and more later. I want all of them alive for awhile. We're not done with them. Bring that one downstairs. Make sure this one's secured.\" It was Lane's turn again. Dutch held his mind with his love and refused to let him count how many more times each of them would suffer, or the days until it would end. The very sick ones had learned they were \"something else.\" Lane said they would tell no one. They were interesting enough, they were given some food too. It gave them the energy to heal enough to live long enough. Lef set his glass down on the bar and leaned close to the bartender. The hair on his neck was standing up and he was sure he smelled something bad. \"They ain't. Ain't wanted by nobody. Did a stint as lawmen, I hear. He's lyin'. This smells bad.\" \"Lef, he said he was just gonna' keep 'em here til the judge passed through.\" \"When did he say it?\" \"Been 'bout eight days.\" \"Judge passed through more'n six days ago. Talked to him a spell. How I found out they been lawmen.\" \"They put on a good show, Lef. They got a bundle a' money in the hotel safe.\" \"I want ever' man believes in findin' out the truth a' this in here tonight. Keep it low. We don' want them special hired guns to hear. Get the miners. We got to know. This ain't right. The judge didn' get no wire to come up here. How long ago he take 'em?\" \"'Bout ten-eleven days.\" \"The day he sent me out. I's 'sposed to be gone four more. Too long. Longer'n ever 'fore. Smelled bad. Why I'm back. Damn. Hope they're alive.\" \"I'll send the girls out. They like them boys.\" \"I jes' hope we ain't too late.\" Lef learned how the Gallant boys had been taken and told the men they were fools. They started getting mad. Not at Lef, at the men who had made fools of them. They laid plans. They surrounded the house and took out the sentry. Lef looked in a window and ran. He knelt in the grass and was violently ill. He chose ten men and made them swear an oath of secrecy. All the others listened to the oath. The ten had guns. They would be the judges. They broke through doors and windows, saw and killed. They shot all but the boss. They hung him on his porch. Lane smiled when Lef released him. \"Hello, Lef. Take us to the mine entrance. I've got a miracle waiting there. Get the two men he was holding in the mine and bring them to us.\" Lef held Lane and cried. The men wrapped them in blankets and carried them to the mine. They found the locked door in the abandoned shaft and freed the two men. Lane whispered the location of the medunit to the professor and lost consciousness. Lane didn't know it was Tessa's father who healed them, or that Lef helped. The professor swore him to secrecy. One look at the medunit had told him they were from farther in the future than he was. Lef watched them healed and believed. He took seven men and destroyed the lab, then blew up the mine shaft. The professor watched in sorrow. His time craft was gone, and with it his dreams of saving his world. He was not sorry to see the bombs he had been forced to build buried under the mountain. When Lane regained consciousness, he told him his story. The camp broke up. Lef stayed until he knew they were all right, then said goodbye. He was going to the federal court to apply to become a judge. They'd accept him. He had letters from several men saying they were sure he'd be a good one. Dutch, Clete and Lane left soon after he did. They took the professor and Tessa's father with them. Their first stop was his farm. \"Let Tessa know you're all right.\" \"I thought he had her and all the time she was safe. I'm an old fool, Lane.\" \"No, just a loving father.\" \"Say hello to Bella for me. She's quite a woman.\" \"Do you mean my sister Bella?!\" \"That's the one.\" Clete grinned at the expression on his face. Dutch and Lane managed to keep from laughing, just. They drove out of the yard and stopped by the bank of a stream. Dutch climbed down and removed the keys from the harness. \"What do we do with the horses, Lane? If we set them free, they'll just be captured again.\" \"Clete, just how much did you tell Sare?\" \"Just what I told him to, Lane. Everything.\" \"That's where we take the horses. It's not far. Let's go. Professor, watch for berry bushes. We'll talk Sare out of one more meal. Wait'll you taste her pie.\" They had one more meal with Sare and Billy and left the horses in the barn. They carried their tack into Melissa and laughed at the professor's expression when he stepped into Lissa. He started toward the bridge and they redirected him. Clete held him up when he stepped into their living room. \"This is... is... \" \"Melissa, our ship. Make yourself comfortable while we stow this.\" \"Here, Dutch. I'll take yours too. You stick with him. Show him the kitchen and fix him a cup of tea. He needs it.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Come on, Professor. This way.\" \"This isn't possible!\" \"Neither are we. Well, Lane and Clete insist I am, but since my father doesn't exist in this universe, I have my doubts. Here. Sit down and drink this. I'll tell you why we're here. And why we're not sure why you are. Lane says we... interrupted the paradox, or shorted the loop.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"What you did here would have left your world a radioactive cinder in fifty years. Of course, you wouldn't have been born, so it wouldn't have happened. But then, you would have and it would, and round and round. We're new at this and still trying to figure that part out. Or we found it because we were supposed to change it. Dad says just fix and don't worry.\" \"Dutch, you're confusing him.\" \"I figured he might as well be as confused as we are, Lane.\" \"Help. I've set course for your world's future, Professor. I know you need to see it to truly believe it will change soon enough without changing the past. We're interested too. I know, but I want to see. We'll be landing soon.\" \"How soon, Lane? Does the professor have time for a tour?\" \"No, but we'll give him one anyway. Melissa loves to be shown off. Just the apartments though. We'll skip the ship proper. It would take years to explain finite infinity.\" \"Finite infinity is a self-contradictory statement.\" \"See what I mean? Come on. We'll start with the gym.\" They showed him Melissa, then his rich, green, and peaceful world. He promised to work to better his own time in his own time and they left him in his workshop mulling over the concept of finite infinity. They didn't return the rare element that made time travel possible. They 'forgot' to mention they had it. Dutch dropped onto a couch in the living room as Lane put them in flight. \"Lane, let's take a vacation.\" \"Exactly, Dutch. We're on our way, but I think you should know vacation runs right into work.\" \"Then we'd better start getting back in shape. The gym. Now.\" Dutch and Lane groaned, but followed Clete to the gym. They knew he was right. They had weight to regain and strength to rebuild. Vacations were more fun if they could show off.",

      "content": "Chapter Four They explored their universe through time. They became wanderers. They'd begun with an orderly exploration, but soon tossed away the plan. Lane told them their future was getting acquainted with their ship and the universe, for awhile. They enjoyed Earth in a great many periods of its history. They avoided wars. They knew how Earth's wars turned out and what they eventually led to. It was a rocky road, but she was exactly how they wanted her. They were having breakfast when Dutch sighed. \"I'm bored. Let's find something to do.\" \"Just what did you have in mind, Dutch?\" \"You're grinning at me. You were waiting for me to say it. All right, Lane, what's up?\" \"Time to make some changes. We're going to do some real traveling. I want to stock up on Earth. There are things that just can't be synthesized or replicated properly. Melissa is going to be very cooperative and take us in just like Lissa would. Put together lists of everything you want. Not too long. If it can be replicated successfully, don't include it.\" \"Champagne and caviar. Blue jeans. The real thing. Real cotton and silk kimonos. Leather boots.\" \"Dutch, most of that is very easy to replicate.\" \"I know, Clete, but we don't have a lot of the patterns I want. I know where to get them though. Old Meister will have almost everything, including the best roses ever grown. I wonder if he's still mad at me.\" \"Probably, fathers tend to get angry when their daughters are unhappy. If I remember, you made two of them unhappy.\" \"I never said I'd marry them, either of them. Why does every set of twins think I should choose between them?\" They landed Melissa at the spaceport and started their shopping trip. Jan Meister wasn't angry. In fact, he spent a great deal of time telling Dutch how happy his daughters were. Dutch didn't mind, though he did get a little tired of looking at grandchildren at about the two hundredth holoframe. Meister was a collector. He shared his collection by allowing replicator patterns to be made. Dutch shared his enthusiasm for real materials and sighed with him that no replicator would ever duplicate the feel of raw silk or the smell of real leather. Clete and Lane left the two sybarites and went to an antique book shop. Lane found several items he wanted. Clete discovered the collection of ancient films and asked for copies of several. He made an instant friend when he asked for Fantasia and Snow White. He walked out of the shop with a complete collection of full-length Disney animated classics. He also carried a carefully preserved cel. The old man in the shop had decided he should have it. He thought Clete would give it the care and love it deserved. Dutch was carrying a case of champagne into Melissa when they arrived. \"Just in time. I told interested parties I didn't want any of this to go through a transporter. They thought I was a little eccentric. I stored the replicator patterns on Lissa. Give me a hand.\" \"As soon as we store our own treasures. Wait'll you see what Clete got.\" Lane placed his books in his library and watched Clete very carefully hang the cel. It was from Snow White and in amazing condition. Clete ordered a slight change in the lighting. Dutch walked in with a case of champagne in his hands and just stood and looked at the cel. He'd loved early Disney animation since he was a small child. \"You know, she's probably the reason I've never really fallen in love. I've been looking for her since I was three.\" They moved all the items Dutch had stacked on grav carts into the ship, put them away, then opened a bottle of champagne. Melissa did her Lissa imitation and they left Earth. As soon as they'd cleared the watchful eyes of Earth control, Lane set coordinates for some real traveling. He remembered they were needed a third of the way across the universe and several thousand years in the past. They explored on the way, but inside the ship. One of their explorations was of the ancient books Lane had found, especially the cookbooks. Clete liked to cook too, but he liked 'homey hearty fare.' Dutch was the perfect person for whom to cook. He made coffee, and anticipated \"YUM!\" the entire time they worked. He truly appreciated it, and the synthesizer began to make more 'raw' than cooked foods. Lane was becoming an artist in the kitchen. Their father and Clete could do 'spectacular,' but Lane was the one who enjoyed it most. They were approaching the world when Dutch and Clete agreed he'd found a better recipe for wild mushroom and black walnut wine sauce, and he had a recipe his father would want. He and Clete were both 'after' their father's pizza sauce. Dutch chose a lovely brandy for after dinner. \"I'm awed, Lane.\" \"Thank you, Dutch. This one I will trade to Dad, then the sauce for your sausage, Clete.\" \"Nope, you'll share. You aren't going to make pizza as often as we like to eat it.\" \"I don't think you can change that one, Lane. I'll help talk him into making the sausage whenever you want to cook with it.\" \"I had no doubt of it, Dutch.\" \"Talk to us about the faint undercurrent of dread, Lane.\" \"It's an Earth-type planet with a similar development pattern. The culture is the closest we'll ever find to the Western culture of Earth, at least in this era. Humanoid in the extreme, though gravity is a bit lower.\" \"One of the worlds seeded with life a bit later than others?\" \"Dutch, Dad told me to leave the question of the seeded worlds alone when I was four. I don't think he knows why he's sure he, and we, should, but he is.\" \"OK. But it's still a valid question.\" \"He's right, Lane. Is there enough difference in gravity to need to retrain for it?\" \"No, not even enough for the people to show it much. They've got themselves in a real mess. They're about to destroy their world.\" \"Lane, you said it was in a stage about equal to the Earth's nineteenth century. How can they destroy themselves?\" \"I wish I had an answer to that, Dutch. We've got a real mystery. Technology makes a big leap, then in about twenty years, they blow themselves up in a nuclear war. We may have found another time traveler.\" \"That's not good. If you're right, we've got a real problem too. When are we?\" \"I'm following my memory, Clete. We find a blasted world, then journey into its past. At that point, we have to change things. There she is. A radioactive cinder. I remember us doing a thirty-year jump.\" \"Do fifty. See what happens.\" \"Well, that's it. Clete, take over. I'm down.\" Dutch grabbed him and got him to a couch. They'd made the first change. It was a fairly small one, so Lane should steady in a few moments. Melissa landed in a small clearing. There was a frontier city about a kilometer away. Lane moved them forward two years and a partial-season. \"All right, Lane, now what?\" \"Side arms practice, Dutch. Projectile weapons. Outside. Attracts the attention of a boy about twelve. He's our guide. Clete, put a corder and medunit in your pocket. This is going to be a rough go. I've got multiples. Nothing clear. Dutch, be careful. Snow White lives here, but you're the wrong prince.\" \"Figures. I'm going to meet the girl of my dreams and I'm not the boy of hers. You steady enough to hit the buttons on the replicator?\" \"Yes, but every choice we make will cause a few seconds of confusion. There are just too many images to find a clear path. I'm going to be semi-useless. We'll just have to play it out.\" \"Why am I carrying a corder and medunit?\" \"That happens right away. The corder locates us a small gold deposit. The medunit saves our young guide's life. His mom is going to be very grateful, Clete. Be gentle. She's very lonely. She thinks her husband is dead.\" \"And he's not.\" \"No. Good. That takes care of a half-dozen of the multiples. You made up your mind the right way, of course. These are about right. There you are, Dutch. Choose clothing and sidearms along those lines. Clete, you're going to look real big to these people.\" \"Yeah, I figured that out when you said we didn't need to retrain. Big man to knock down. I'm going to spend half my time trying not to break anyone.\" \"We're all going to have problems. I think I see a way to shortcut them, but we'll have to watch our... Yes, keep that medunit handy. We make some unscrupulous unfriends.\" \"What you mean is our backs sprout holes.\" \"Would you rather fight every man in town, Dutch? And every one that hits town? All one at a time? If we clean them up all at once, you'll have more time for ladies.\" \"Oh, well, what's a few holes?\" They'd spent a lot of time practicing with weapons used by various cultures, first with their father, then while they were in the academy. Though those were only from the cultures humans had met, there weren't great differences in them. They'd practiced more with 'variations' since. Clete really couldn't resist making them work as a team and Dutch couldn't resist turning anything into a show. It was going to prove very useful. Their guide arrived not long after they began practicing with replicas of Colt 45's outside Melissa. They were near enough like the guns common to the culture to be custom-made for show people. Their young guide arrived while they practiced. \"Gee, I've never seen anybody shoot like that!\" \"Hi. We practice a lot. Goes with the show.\" \"Trick shots, huh? Interestin' guns. Can see bigger wouldn' bother you guys none. You're kind of in the middle of nowhere for a medicine show. Who are you fellas?\" \"I'm Dutch. He's Clete and that's Lane. We're retired. The booth came down through the family. We're real sentimental about it. Usually leave it in a safe place. The clearing looked good.\" \"How'd you get it here? Where's your mounts? Are you stayin' in town? Want to have supper at our place?\" \"Whoa! Let's see. Lane, do you remember all those questions?\" \"In order: a friend dropped us off; don't have any; haven't decided yet; we'd love to, if we can pay back with a few chores. What's your name?\" \"Oh, sorry. Shoulda' said. I'm Billy Kendirk. Come on. We need to get goin' so Ma knows to make for more 'fore she starts dinner. We definitely got chores you can help with. Pa's been gone awhile and me and Ma ain't been keepin' up too good.\" Lane knew when it was coming. Billy was talking animatedly about his mom's berry pie. \"Look, I'll get some berries right over there. We'll have pie tonight.\" He ran right into a... Might as well call it a bear. Filled the same niche. Grew just as big. Was just as hairy and dangerous. Clete charged after him. He got swiped, but not bad. He decked the bear and went to work on Billy. Dutch and Lane picked berries. Billy had taken a beating for berry pie. He deserved to have it. \"I healed everything major. Left the superficial stuff. Just hit him with a dose of antibiotic. Lane, that could have been prevented.\" \"I know, Clete. This memory has a way for us to really help them.\" \"Good work, Clete. He'll be real proud of his scars. How about you?\" \"Dutch, scars don't last on me. You know that.\" \"That's not what I meant.\" \"Oh. No, I could heal me, but the shirt would still have holes. Wouldn't make sense.\" Dutch laughed and thumped Lane on the back. It completely surprised him and Clete laughed and picked up Billy. He'd regain consciousness soon. Lane was giggling and complaining he was dizzy, so Dutch steered him. It didn't happen often, but sometimes Dutch just surprised him with an \"I love you.\" Dutch was a blaze of love in his soul and the love between his two brothers the most wonderful feeling in existence. Lane located the gold. He handed the corder back to Clete and he and Dutch rolled over a rock in the stream and picked up a few nuggets of placer. They rolled the rock back. The deposit itself was a few hundred meters upstream. They'd help Billy file a claim. It would get him and his mom through the rough times until his father returned. They could see how rough they'd been as they walked into the yard. Billy's mother ran for them when she saw Clete was carrying her son. \"BILLY!!\" \"Easy, Ma'am! He's roughed up a bit, but he'll be all right. Had an argument over a berry patch. My name's Clete Gallant. My brothers Lane and Dutch. Let's get him inside.\" \"Yes. Thank you. I'm Sare Kendirk.\" \"Billy said you'd trade us a home-cooked meal for a few chores. My brothers are carrying a load of berries in their shirts. Figured Billy ought to get his pie.\" He laid Billy on the bed and smiled. \"Nice kid. You can be proud of him. He'll grow up to be a fine man.\" \"Thank you. Hurts a bit he's havin' to do it so fast. You're bleeding. Take your shirt off. Do you whilst I'm patchin' Billy. Where'd your brothers go?\" \"To find things that need fixing. I'd better go help.\" \"You sit right there til I get those claw marks cleaned out. Then I'll see if we got a shirt big enough to fit you. My husband wasn't near your size, but he liked things loose.\" \"You said was.\" \"I figure somethin' happened to him and he ain't comin' back. Been gone more'n a year. Went south to buy us a good startin' herd.\" \"Lot of things other than dying can delay a man. Give it time. A good man is worth waiting for.\" \"I don't know how long we can wait. Place is goin' downhill. Me'n Billy are just scratchin' by. I'm tryin' to hold the land, but I'm wonderin' if… \" Clete realized what he'd done. She'd been alone for a long time. He'd slipped out of his shirt and she'd stopped talking. Lane had warned him. Her need washed over him. He had to get out of the house, or distract her, or something. He wouldn't be able to resist that need long. Billy woke up. Clete thought, \"Whew, kid's got good timing,\" and grinned as her emotions became maternal. Billy chattered at her as she bandaged Clete. He kept her distracted until he could get into a shirt and make excuses about helping his brothers. It was a good thing Lane had told him her husband was alive. He wondered how he'd known. \"Hi, Clete. You look warm.\" \"Dutch, you're pushing it. This corral's in bad shape.\" \"Everything is. You can see they've been trying, but they need logs split and carried. Probably don't have money for nails either. Lane's in the shed putting an edge on the ax. Help me see how many of these nails we can pound back to usefulness. Pull that rail loose. We'll redo it. It's been over-nailed. I'd say Billy's work.\" \"He's getting better. There are only a couple bent nails on the most recent.\" In three hours, they'd accomplished more than Billy and his mom could have in a month. They were finishing repairs on the roof of the house when Sare called them to dinner. She stared at the rebuilt corrals, the rehung barn door, the repaired shed wall, the rebuilt buggy and the stack of rails laying next to the shed. They dropped off the roof and went to wash up. Billy yelled and she dashed in to get her pies out. She wondered what she'd done to deserve being blessed. She was glad she'd decided to fix a bit extra because of the size of the men. They definitely deserved it. They appreciated it. \"Billy, you were right. The best berry pie I ever had. Do you feel up to a little walk? I've got something to show you. Ma'am, I'm going to have to walk off that last piece of pie. I hope you don't mind if Billy goes with me.\" \"My name's Sare, Lane. And after what you boys did around here today, I wish you coulda' held three pieces of pie. Go on, Billy. I'll wash up.\" \"No, Sare, you won't. Dutch and I already drew straws on that chore. I wash. He dries. You get to sit on the porch and watch the evening settle in.\" \"Clete, you don't have to do that. You done enough already.\" \"You did the work of cooking for three extra and spent time on those pies. We'll take care of the extra cleanup. Now, outside. Go on. Don't you feel guilty. We don't have to do dishes often. It's a novelty.\" They joined her on the porch within minutes. They were watching the sunset when Lane and Billy walked into the yard. He looked very serious, but Clete could feel his mother saw the excitement beneath. \"Ma, I'm goin' into town with them in the mornin'. I've got somethin' to do. I'm goin' in and see if I can sleep. Night.\" \"Now, what was that all about?\" \"It's his story, Sare. He's decided how he wants to tell it. He really does have things to do in town. We'll be back tomorrow evening.\" \"Lane, I don' know what you're up to, but you're all in on it. All right. He can go. Just make sure he's home before dark. I hate waitin' supper.\" She smiled at them. They were real nice men. And Clete... \"Well, we've made ourselves a spot in the barn. Might as well get a good night's sleep. See you in the morning.\" \"We're right behind you, Clete. Come on, Dutch, turn-in time. Billy's going to want to make an early start. Goodnight, Sare. I really enjoyed dinner.\" \"They're rushing me off again. You have a pleasant night. You sleep in. We'll buy Billy breakfast in town. That way you'll both get a treat. Goodnight.\" \"Goodnight, Dutch. You boys sleep well.\" Dutch strolled into the barn and grinned at Clete. \"Warm evening.\" \"Give him a break, Dutch. Even I could feel how lonely she is.\" \"Me too, Lane. How do you know her husband's coming home?\" \"We pick up a telegram from him tomorrow. He was robbed and he spent the last year out on the range, working to earn a very good small herd, and enough to get them home, from a rancher. He didn't have money for a telegram before. Clete would have answered her need and she'd have hated herself. Her husband won't be home until spring, but she won't be so lonely once she knows he's coming. Now, she and Billy will have enough to see them through. All we have to do is get him to town and back. After tomorrow, he'll be safe.\" \"Uh, huh, just how does one trip make him safe?\" \"Clete's about to get a job.\" \"Why me? Why is it always me?\" \"Relax, Clete. The first thing you do is hire us.\" Dutch stared at the animals tied to hitching rails along the street of the town. They gave him a very odd feeling. \"Lane, they're horses.\" \"Like the bear and the people, Dutch, similar evolution on a seeded world. This is a very Earth-like planet. There was very little drift. I'm just glad we spent so many of our vacations at the academy learning to ride.\" \"I used to spend my offtime in the holosphere riding too. You'd be amazed at how many women like the smell of saddle leather.\" Lane and Clete laughed. Billy, who had been leading and a bit too excited to notice Dutch had suddenly stopped, when the horses came in sight, ran back to see what was going on. They told him they were teasing Dutch about finding a horse he liked. By then, they were. Lane assured it. They went to the assay office first, then convinced the clerk at the courthouse to file the claim in Billy's name. Billy insisted on buying them breakfast at the hotel. They left him shopping at the general store and headed for trouble. It was waiting for them at the saloon. \"Lane, that place shouldn't be open this early.\" \"It's not, Clete. It's open this late. The proprietor doesn't like it, but his current clientele become violently insistent. Lawmen aren't plentiful and the only remaining deputy in town is recovering from a very close call.\" \"I suppose I'm not supposed to break anyone.\" \"Right, Dutch. Very few of these are real nasties. They just follow along.\" \"How do we find the rotten apples?\" \"They find us. You'll know who they are. They're the ones that shoot me in the back.\" \"Lovely. I suppose you can't just point them out and save us the trouble of buying you a new shirt.\" \"I get shot in the back, Dutch. I don't see them.\" \"Noisy isn't it? This is a rowdy bunch. The bartender's nervous. NO!\" \"Where's he going?\" \"He's about to stop a bully. Get ready, Dutch. Clete's about to heat things up. No one hits someone smaller, especially a woman, if he can stop it. Take the man in red plaid first. He pulls a gun.\" Clete dropped the man from the balcony. He was careful. He dropped him on several others to break his fall. Dutch relieved the man of his gun and put him down for a nap. Clete dropped from the balcony and tucked several others in. Lane was busy too. He kept removing guns from people who were aiming at Dutch and Clete. They took care of the ones aiming at him. \"Over already and I was just getting warmed up.\" \"Two. Armed. Back room. Three. Same. Upstairs. Two. Doors.\" \"Clete says you get to play some more, Dutch. You get the back room. I'll remove our unfriends outside.\" Clete had already headed for the stairs. Lane slammed the doors outward, finished putting the two men to sleep and dragged them inside. Dutch was dragging two from the back room. \"Dutch, see that door up there. When it opens, draw and shoot the gun that sticks out. It'll be pointed at Clete's head.\" Dutch drew and fired. Clete reached through the door and hauled the man out. He held him in the air with one hand and put him to sleep with the other. \"Catch. They'll break if I drop them.\" Dutch and Lane caught the three Clete dropped over the balcony railing and stacked them with their friends. They made a total of twenty-three in the pile. The bartender decided it was safe to stick his nose above the bar. \"Who are you boys?\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Dutch. This is Lane. The big man calming the ladies upstairs is Clete. Damn, Lane, let's find a cold shower. Somebody's very grateful.\" \"Let's go get him. Billy's about to need us.\" \"We'd better hurry. He gets his shirt off and we'll be fighting women too. Clete! We don't have time for them to tell you they're grateful.\" \"Hey! You don't have to push.\" \"Sure we do, Clete. Lane says Billy needs us.\" \"Why didn't you say so?!\" Lane and Dutch shook their heads and laughed when Clete dropped from the balcony and went through the doors at a run. He had Billy's problem taken care of before they got there. He was dumping the man, who'd tried to make Billy give him money when the storekeeper went to the storeroom for more flour, on the walk when they arrived. The storekeeper was pleased. He told them the man wouldn't have tried it if the town had a lawman on his feet. Clete asked why it didn't. He'd have heard how worried he was about his town if he hadn't been able to feel it. Lane told him they'd make sure Billy got home safely with his supplies. \"Dutch, go with him to the livery stable. He needs a wagon and a team. See if they've got anything we'd like. Try to find a horse big enough Clete's feet won't drag the ground. There's some good-looking tack in here. We'll help the storekeep tally and get Billy's purchases moved outside. See if you can find horses not broken to a bit. I know. They bother me lots more than they do the horses.\" \"We'll probably have to take what they've got or break our own, Lane.\" \"You know how I feel about it.\" \"We gentle them ourselves. If possible.\" \"If possible.\" \"Come on, Billy. Let's go horse shopping.\" Billy was near abounce when they returned with a wagon and team. Dutch grinned and winked at Lane. He'd found what they wanted too. \"You did well, Billy. That's a nice team.\" \"They'll pull a plow too, Lane. Ma won't have to do her garden by hand. Do you think she'll like the material I picked?\" \"It'll make a very pretty dress. Clete, you and Dutch load. I'm going to the telegraph office to see if we have any messages. Billy, come with me.\" \"I ought to help load, Lane. It's our stuff.\" \"Come on. You stay, I'll feel guilty. They don't really need us. Look. We'd be in the way. Clete heaves from the walk and Dutch guides it into place. They'll probably beat us to the corral.\" Billy cried when he read the telegram. Lane and the clerk carried on a long discussion about the weather and pointedly didn't notice. The culture was much like Earth's nineteenth century in some ways, but 'real men' not crying wasn't one. The contents of the message were personal. They were being polite and giving him 'privacy' to deal with his emotions. After he told them what the message was, the clerk wished every \"wallop\" message that came in was good news, and was glad that he'd come that day. They didn't have a lawman to take it to the ranch, and he'd have been trying to figure a way to take the good news out to them, and might have 'bent' the rules to do it. Billy said he'd tell his mother he'd been \"real pleasured to give the good news.\" Lane smiled, as they walked out. Billy was working very hard on the way he spoke. He was 'a man of substance' now and intended to sound like it. His purchases had included two thick, quite expensive, books. Early education took place at home, not in schools. Those were for older children, who wanted to learn things they couldn't, working with a parent, older relative or family friend. It wasn't an apprenticeship system. The duty of teaching a child was strong enough in the culture it was near totally literate, but the books Billy had chosen weren't for the purpose of teaching children to read. Those were inexpensive and plentiful. He mentioned the books and Billy began the explanation he'd remembered. He saw how the culture could produce \"bad apples.\" It was where the memory came from. That was the way it worked. His memory was cluttered with would-have-been and it was wonderful. Dutch didn't allow nightmares and Clete told him if he had one. He ignored what he remembered, after a point. Dutch wouldn't choose that path, unless it was the right one. Clete was \"getting exasperated\" with his self-doubt. He was the one they knew could be trusted to make the best choice, always, and he didn't. Lane had the feeling that was going to change. He paid attention to feelings. Mick O'Herlihy had told him it would be weird if he didn't 'get hunches' and not training a very convenient talent was silly. And then gotten him into several situations he'd 'felt' his way out of, with his head spinning, and one he hadn't. He had a feeling Dutch had to accept he had their complete trust, as they had his, soon. It wasn't lack of self-esteem. It was intense admiration. He was their center, the love that filled them with joy was perfect and total, like their father's. He was going to have to accept that love inspired love, and himself. Billy and Lane reached the livery stable just as Clete and Dutch arrived with the wagon. There were a large number of people standing around. They'd heard someone had bought the big black stallion. They wanted to see what kind of fool would buy a horse that couldn't be broken. \"That's him, Clete. Only one big enough to carry you.\" \"You're right, Dutch, and he's as pretty as you said. Hand me the hackamore and the black blanket. He'll like this saddle. It'll fit well and look real good on him. I'll meet you by the other corral in a few minutes. He'll probably need shoeing. Tell the smith I want to do it myself. He's on your way.\" \"Aren't we going to stay and watch!?\" \"We really hadn't planned on it, Billy.\" \"Lane, nobody's ever ridden that horse! Nobody! He's wild. A killer.\" \"Nonsense. Horses don't kill unless they have a very good reason. We'll stay, just so you see all the horse needs is the right kind of treatment and what that is. Go ahead, Dutch. Take the wagon. We'll catch up.\" Clete was sitting on the ground in the middle of the corral softly singing. The black animal circled him several times and he ignored it. It wasn't afraid of him. He established as mutual. It became curious and edged toward him. He sang to it and looked in its eyes. He sang of rolling plains, sweet green grass and the friendship between man and beast. The black dipped its head and he gently rubbed its nose. It danced back a few steps, but soon returned. It wasn't really wild. It had just been out on the range since a colt. It had some familiarity with people and no bad experiences there, and had also been in the corral long enough to get used to people, in general. It just didn't trust them. Since most of the people around the corral felt the same way about the very big horse, it wasn't surprising. The horses of Clete's world were augmented, but it didn't take much longer for the black to decide he was more interesting than threatening. It really wasn't a 'wild horse.' Like evolution didn't mean species were identical. This animal was a bit more 'domesticated.' He'd been told it's daddy was a plow horse, and it was obvious to Clete that the animals had been pulling plows longer on that world. He slowly stood and stroked it. He held each piece of tack up and let it get acquainted with it, then laid it back on the ground. People gasped when he vaulted on its bare back and it reared. He rode it down and sang in its ears. He could feel when it calmed and slid off. He added a bit to his estimate of time domesticated. It accepted a rider \"belonged\" very quickly. He held the local version of the hackamore up and very slowly put it on. He ran his fingers under every strap to assure their placement, then picked up the blanket. He turned the animal's head with a gentle tug on the hackamore. He made sure it watched him put the blanket on. He then picked up the saddle. He turned it over in his hands and explained all the pieces. The words held no meaning for the horse, but the soft voice calmed it and the saddle became familiar. Clete made sure it was watching when he gently set the saddle in place. The horse danced a bit, but soon calmed. Lane knew when Clete cheated. He felt him spread a blanket of calm over the horse when he tightened the cinches. He was in a bit of a hurry. He swung up in the saddle and taught the black the signals of the reins. Lane opened the corral door and he rode out. No one watching got terribly excited. It had become a very calm afternoon all over town. Lane grinned. His horse was going to be very easy to 'gentle.' He watched Clete ride toward the smithy and he and Billy went to find Dutch. \"Very nice, Dutch. Stallions.\" \"They were the only ones not bit-broken, Lane. Besides, I thought the two buckskins went nice with Clete's black.\" \"Let's saddle up. Clete's at the smithy. We'll have him check these too.\" \"Oh, no! I'll bet he takes his shirt off. There go my chances with every woman in town.\" Lane laughed. He and Dutch weren't as massive as Clete, but they were all well-proportioned. Dutch never had any trouble finding willing companions, usually several at a time. He and Clete both knew the real reason Dutch preferred multiple ladies. He thought none of them would expect attraction to develop into a long-term special relationship, if there were several. He didn't seem to realize some of them still fell in love and wanted more, but at least they knew he didn't from the beginning. They all ended up taking off their shirts. The smithy was rather secluded, so they didn't attract too large a crowd. The blacksmith changed that. He decided to have a beer and told the bartender about the size of the men working in the smithy. The bartender told him about the fight. The barmaid, who had just started her day's work. overheard. She told the girls in the hotel kitchen. Word spread. Soon every knothole in the smithy had an eye and the doorway got very crowded. Clete knew they were there, but he was keeping things calm until he finished the horses. \"Lane, as soon as he's done, it's going to get very warm around here.\" \"I know, Dutch. We'll just have to try to get him out of town while he's still thinking about his horse.\" \"Sometimes I wonder why I stick with you guys.\" \"Spillover, Clete. You need us to keep you from being mobbed. You hate it when somebody gets left out.\" \"Dutch, you're the one that likes ladies in multiples. You look for twins.\" \"Had a soft spot for look-alike ladies ever since I met Cory and Cally at the academy.\" \"There. Done. Your 'soft spot' wasn't what I was talking about.\" Dutch dumped a bucket of water over him and Clete chased him out of the smithy. They ran back in. Lane sat down on the hard-packed dirt floor and laughed. Shirtless was not something one did in public in the 'nineteenth century.' They'd shocked a very large group of women. The shock didn't last long. It wasn't Earth's 'Western' culture, just one very similar. They didn't have the same reasons to teach 'sex is sinful.' Neither unwanted pregnancy nor venereal disease was a problem and the afternoon was getting warm. Clete grabbed his shirt, swung up on the black and winced. \"I'm out of here. I'll be at the first cold stream.\" Lane and Dutch pulled on their shirts and got ready to follow. It took them awhile. They kept having to lean against things. Billy wasn't sure why they were laughing so hard, but he laughed too. He had a gold claim, supplies and a telegram to take to his mother. He was a very happy boy. The day wasn't over. They were nearing the ranch when Clete felt a problem. \"We've got company, Lane.\" \"How many, Clete?\" \"Half-dozen. Mean. Mad. Greedy.\" \"Get them for me.\" \"NO! Dutch, get Billy out of here! Lane's down! I'm after the--\" \"Sons of bitches that shot him in the back! Grab on, Billy! I'm going to put you in those rocks. We'll catch the wagon later. They won't run far.\" Dutch dropped Billy off and raced back. He heard gunfire and swung off his horse. He started his circle and took out a man holding a rifle. He wasn't gentle. He was too mad to worry about breaking him. He felt Clete's blast of rage and heard horses scream. The ones who had tried to run away would be mountless. Most people caught very little of what Clete was feeling. Most animals caught most of it. Clete stopped his horse from killing the man who had tried to kill him. Dutch ran down the two who were running. He met Clete at Lane's side. \"Bad. Damn. Why doesn't he let us know sooner?\" \"He does when it's one of us, Clete. I broke some.\" \"Me too. Slug went through. Medunit says touch and go. How far are we from Melissa?\" \"Too far. Triage. Stabilize him.\" \"He's actually sturdier than we are, Dutch. He's on his way. Go get Billy. He'll have a survivable wound by the time you get back here with the wagon. We'll use that coil of rope to secure the... men, then borrow the wagon to take them back to town.\" \"Done.\" All six men were alive, but in bad shape. Clete made sure none of them were actually dying. Billy wanted to shoot them. Dutch told him Lane would want them legally tried and convicted. Billy decided Judge Herkmer would take care of them when he rode through. In his culture, a judge decided guilt or innocence. The jury of fifteen decided penalty, within limits. If Lane lived, the men wouldn't hang. Clete didn't treat any of them. They would all be treated by a physician when they got them to town. They'd live because he'd saved Lane. That was enough. They tied the men on their horses and gently laid Lane on top of the supplies in the wagon. When they got to the ranch, they carried Lane inside, then unloaded the wagon fast. Sare just didn't understand when they began making a place for Lane in it. \"You're not going to take him with you?!\" \"Yes, Sare, we are. It's the fastest way to get him to the doctor.\" \"That bouncin' will be bad on him, Clete.\" \"We'll take it easy. We've seen enough injuries to know he'll make it. He heals real fast. He'll be fine in a few days.\" \"You're just sayin' that. He ain't gonna' make it. He's shot through the lung. If he survives, he'll be... well nigh a cripple a long time.\" \"Tell her, Clete. She'll keep it secret.\" \"Dutch... \" \"Tell her or I will. Who we are, what we are, where we come from, why we're here. I'll keep Billy busy outside.\" \"What's he mean?\" \"Lane's not going to like this. Sare, Lane wasn't shot through the lung. He was shot through the heart. He has two. We all do. Put your hands on my chest. We're not from your world. We're from the far future. Our father is... too far away to describe. It's our legacy, our job, to carry on his work. We... save worlds. This one will be murdered if we don't change the future. It will die in war. Killed by weapons that are developed too soon. We're here because someone else is here. Someone from the future. You don't believe me and I'm scaring you. Watch. This is why Lane won't die.\" He pulled the medunit from his pocket and used it on Lane. Sare gasped as she watched tissues knit together. \"It's what I used on Billy. I healed all but the flesh wound. I thought he deserved to brag about his scars. Great. Now you believe me and you're terrified. Sare, we're the good guys. The Gallants. The white knights. My mother helped destroy an army and rebuilt a world. Dutch's mother was an officer in a service that maintains the highest ideals. She gave her life to save a world. Lane's mother... I don't know. She was searching for our father. He's the true hero. We're just in the family business. Better. At least you're not terrified.\" \"You're angels.\" \"Definitely not. If Lane hadn't told me your husband was alive, I'd have proved it.\" \"How did he... \" \"Know? He sees the future. When it's terrible, we go back in the past to change it. I feel what other people feel. Dutch is the power, the love, that binds us. Lane knew he was going to be shot. It wasn't important enough to change.\" \"I was right. You're angels.\" \"Nah, just the Gallant boys.\" \"Same thing and I don't think you know much about angels. I won't tell Lane you told me.\" \"Thanks and you're right. I don't know much about angels. Lane didn't give us much briefing on the culture other than it's a lot like one we know well. He didn't even really explain why this is a frontier.\" \"The government bought it from the people who were already here. It was about empty and waitin' for the time we could meet the price. We pay half our taxes in food to earn the land, and they get it for another 68 years. Farmin' just isn't what most like to do, and they kept their numbers down, so the land could support the people huntin' and roamin' over it with their herds. When they just started blendin' in with the city people other places; goin' to school, learnin' trades and such, they worked out a plan to take care of them all and build them some schools and nice parks, horse ranches and such. It's goin' to be one country on more'n half this continent when we get this land producin' and bring the west and east together, and richer for the blendin'. I'm tryin' to think who could war like you say. It would take somethin' that would make someone true afraid.\" \"Yes, something is learned too soon. Now, not in close to a century.\" It took two days for the people of the town to come to a decision about the men keeping watch over the ones they'd brought in and put in the jail. Lane was actually 'up and around' by the time the mayor and town council visited them. He was healing incredibly fast. They'd told everyone he was lucky. Not many people could say they'd been back shot, had the bullet bounce off a bone and ended up with not much more than a flesh wound. \"Mr. Mayor, it's an honor, but--\" \"Take the job, Clete.\" \"Lane, we aren't going to be here long. They need someone who wants to help build this country.\" \"They need someone now. Today. Next week will be too late.\" \"All right. Swear me in. You've got yourself a town marshal.\" The first thing Clete did was make Dutch and Lane deputies. As soon as the official party left, they held a conference. \"All right, Lane, what do you see?\" \"Snow White and the witch. Sorry, Clete. There's a very lovely young lady who's desperately worried. Somehow, she's the key. Dutch, you're the one she turns to. Clete, the witch is your problem. She's not really that bad. You'll get her straightened out.\" \"And just what will you be doing?\" \"Spending a lot of time dizzy, Dutch. It's already starting. I need a chair. Go mingle with the townsfolk. Get acquainted. I'll be all right. I'll even meet you in the saloon. Oh, Clete, you've got another deputy. He's ready to get back to light duty. He's at the boarding house. Look him up. His name is Parker Redlore. Now go. I'm tired of keeping you in focus.\" Clete found Parker Redlore. He was a serious young man recovering from a serious injury. Clete asked to see it and did a bit of sleight of hand with the medunit. Parker decided he was fit enough to stand a watch at the jail. He told Clete he felt lots better. Clete agreed \"a reason to get up and around\" made a lot of difference. Dutch was very good at getting acquainted with the townspeople, half of them anyway. He met some men too. Then he saw Snow White. She was fairytale beautiful; black hair and porcelain skin. Perfectly proportioned to fit in a man's arms and lips created for kissing. She was also being hustled down the walk by an older woman. She looked up and right into his eyes. His head swam. He was drowning in twin blue pools. The older woman gave her arm a yank and called her a hussy. She meekly dropped her eyes and hurried along. That's when the shooting started. Dutch dove for cover. Six men were barreling down the street on horseback. As soon as they passed him, he vaulted on behind the one trailing. He tossed him from the saddle and went after the next one. He was on his third when Clete dove from atop a porch and took the lead three out of their saddles. It had been a very short jail break attempt. Clete and Dutch grabbed two unconscious men each and dragged them toward the jail. It was getting very full. Clete went back for the last two and Dutch got acquainted with Parker. He really liked the kid. The townspeople were very pleased with their full jail. They decided to hold the ice cream social, stock sale and dance, they'd been considering canceling, after all. Four men took a big wagon up into the mountains to get ice. They were quite sure the social would be well-attended. Four days was plenty of time for word to spread to outlying ranches the town was now a safe place to bring families. Their new lawmen were personally invited by a large number of people. Early that afternoon, Dutch asked Lane who should watch when. He just smiled at him. \"All right, we draw straws. Short straw takes first watch. Long straw takes last.\" \"Make that four straws, Dutch. I'm in on this too.\" \"You got it, Parker. Four straws it is.\" Dutch grinned at his new friend. Clete had been busy. Every time Parker fell asleep on the cot in the office, Clete used the medunit on him. A few more naps and he'd have nothing but a scar to remind him of the hole in his side. \"Long straw. Well, at least I'll get to see the stock show and have ice cream at the church. A lawman's work is never done. Later.\" \"Dutch, you've got the short straw. Clete's and mine are the same length.\" \"Ah, well, I wasn't that interested in the stock show and I will get to go to the dance, but I'd sure appreciate it if you'd send me a dish of ice cream. You know, Parker's really dedicated. He's a lawman because he wants to make the 'frontier' safe for people. When we leave, he should be marshal, Lane.\" \"Yes, Dutch. A real prince of a guy.\" \"Oh.\" Lane led Clete to the ice cream social. He didn't have any trouble identifying Snow White. She was obvious even before he asked for ice cream for Dutch. He grinned at Lane when he identified the witch. \"I'll take it to him.\" \"You'll do no such-- Drat that girl. I'll never turn her into a proper lady. Her father should have sent her to me years ago.\" \"Ma'am, I think you're doing a fine job. She seems like a very nice girl.\" \"Oh, she's nice enough, but she just won't walk and talk like a lady. I mean, look at the way she ran out of here. No bonnet. Runnin' down the street with a dish in her hand.\" \"Ma'am, I think being a lady is something that comes from inside. Any woman can wear a bonnet and walk and talk proper. A lady is something more. She's got you as an example. She's bound to turn out right.\" \"Please call me Bella, Marshal. Won't you have another dish of ice cream?\" \"If you'd be willing to join me in that shady spot over there, I'd love one.\" \"Lispeth, I'm goin' to sit a bit with the marshal. You come dip.\" Clete smiled as she dropped her apron on a chair and came round the table. He noticed she hadn't put on her bonnet. Bella was a very handsome woman, if a bit strait-laced. He noticed the afternoon was getting warm in his vicinity and wondered if she was planning on loosening those laces a bit. He also knew exactly when Dutch got his ice cream. \"I brought you some ice cream. The marshal said you'd asked and I... \" She was breathless and blushing. Dutch decided he was going to get hurt. He was already in love. \"Thank you. I thought it was the only thing I was going to miss this afternoon. I seem to have been very wrong. But now, it's here and you're here and I haven't missed anything after all. Let's sit on the porch. I feel like a real villain eating ice cream and sharing lovely company in front of all those misguided people back there. They call me Dutch. What's your name?\" \"Tessa. I probably should get back. My aunt will be upset if I don't.\" \"Was your aunt with you in town a few days ago?\" \"Yes. I saw what you did. You were wonderful.\" Dutch looked into her eyes and got dizzy. \"Uh, just doing my job.\" He was in trouble. She was pure and sweet and innocent, and he'd have promised to stay with her forever in that instant. And would have. And counted himself lucky. \"Speaking of jobs, you came to see me for something. You wanted to talk to a lawman.\" \"That's just the way Parker says it, proud-like. I been tryin' to think of a way to see him, but my aunt would never believe it was just business.\" \"I see. You and he are more than friends.\" \"Fore my pa sent me to my aunt's place, he used to come over of a Sabbath and have dinner.\" \"Why did your father send you to your aunt?\" \"He said to learn proper lady things, but I don't believe it. He never said anything about it before. He was scared of somethin' and wanted me safe. I'm real worried. I ain't heard from him in more'n ten days and he wasn't in church on Sabbath.\" \"It sounds like he may be in trouble. Can you tell me any more?\" \"My pa's a good man. He's real smart. He makes all kinds of interestin' things. He sells some of 'em to people to make lots of 'em. Gets money for every one they sell. We do pretty good on it.\" \"A successful inventor. A very rare and talented individual. You said you thought something had scared him. Any idea what?\" \"I don't know more'n it started after a funny little man came to visit. I watched from my window. It was pretty late at night. He got Pa out of bed. He showed Pa somethin' and he got real excited. He put on his pants and went off with him. He snuck back in early in the mornin'. Acted funny when I asked him about it. Said he'd been busy makin' us rich and I shouldn't pry.\" Dutch made the mistake of looking into her eyes again. He swallowed. It didn't help the lump in his throat at all. He hadn't expected it to help the one in his chest. \"We thought something strange might be going on around here. This town sprouted more than its usual crop of nasties recently. We've been trying to figure out why.\" \"Well, two of them fellas I seen afore. They work for a minin' company Pa built some things for. They got a big dig up in the mountains. They come got the things Pa built.\" \"Tessa, I want you to go back to the fair and find my brother... Never mind. Why don't you go to the stock show? I think you'll see someone there who will be real pleased to see you.\" \"My aunt will be mad, says ladies don't belong in barns.\" \"Your aunt probably won't even notice. Unless I miss my guess, she's in the company of my brother Clete.\" \"The marshal?!\" \"That's the one. I doubt she'll be looking for you.\" \"Aunt Bella with the marshal, she's probably just as glad I'm not around.\" She giggled. Dutch thought it was the most beautiful sound he'd ever heard. \"Thank you, Dutch. I feel lots better.\" She flashed him a dazzling smile and walked away. He groaned and buried his face in his hands. \"Dammit, Clete. Not now!\" Lane walked around the corner of the building and sat down in the chair Tessa had just vacated. Dutch didn't even look up. \"Go to the saloon, Dutch. Find company. You two were running a feedback loop. Get drunk if necessary.\" \"Lane--\" \"Go. I'll take over. You don't want to be here when Parker comes in.\" \"You're right. He'll be floating on air and all I'll want to do is ground him. You all right?\" \"Yes. You've made the change. I needed a nice quiet place to let the images settle. Now, GO!\" Dutch was too busy meeting people to actually drink much, but he had several companions, two of whom were carrying unopened bottles, when he got to the large open area where the fair, which the people called a \"social,\" was being held. The sound of gunfire had attracted his attention. It didn't surprise him at all that Clete found him immediately. He was feeling pretty strange. \"Dutch, you're going to get drunk.\" \"Yes, Clete, I certainly am. Lane's orders. The girls are his idea too. What's going on?\" \"Sharpshooting show.\" \"About time for Lane to show up. Let's show off. I need it. Ego boost. Found out a knight loses to a prince.\" \"The way it has to be.\" \"Come on, girls. The Gallant boys are about to join the show.\" \"I'd have never known he'd been drinking. Do you really intend to be in the show?\" \"If Dutch says he needs it, he needs it. I'll find you a nice place to sit and watch, Bella. Just promise you won't go away. I plan on taking you dancing later.\" \"Don't you worry, Marshal. I'll be right where you can find me.\" \"Hi, Clete, Ma'am.\" \"You know what's going on, Lane?\" \"Yes. We'll be waiting for you. Routine three. The whole thing. The horses are standing behind the grandstand.\" \"He really does need a boost. Alcohol?\" \"He really does and you know he'd never pull a gun if he didn't know exactly how much he'd had and what its effect would be.\" \"Yeah, he wants the anesthesia, but needs the boost. Routine three should be enough of one to reduce the desire for the anesthesia. I'll be there.\" Clete found a place in the grandstand for Bella and met Dutch and Lane by the horses. The horses weren't trained for the routine, but they'd only use them for the intro. They vaulted on. They were riding bareback. Clete nodded and Lane signaled the emcee. They kicked the horses into motion and started boosting Dutch's ego. They rode, tumbled, shot, tumbled, shot again. Then they really started showing off. The finale was perfect. Dutch started his run. Lane did the lift and Clete tossed him. He soared into the air, did an impossible double fast draw, and shot the tops off six pennants at the top of his flight. He reholstered the guns and dropped onto their crossed arms. They tossed him into the air and did handsprings. They ended in a line and set six guns spinning in perfect synchronization. They spun and put two shots each through the center of the target, spun guns into holsters, turned toward the audience and bowed. Total silence. They whistled for their horses and vaulted on. They actually got out of the performing ring before the place exploded in cheers. \"I FEEL BETTER!\" Lane and Clete laughed. They told their horses they were wonderful and Lane led them back to their stalls, then he began looking for company. The band was tuning up and the dance would be foot-stomping fun. Company found him. A lot of it. Dutch swept through with more company and they hit the dance floor. Clete escorted Bella onto the floor and the town cut loose. They collected guns when a few men decided to shoot theirs into the air. The party didn't get much quieter, but it did get safer. \"Lane, we're getting out of here. Things are really starting to warm up.\" \"I noticed, Dutch. I don't think I'm going to be able to stand the heat much longer either. See you in the morning. Ladies, I'm drowning in moonslight. Save me.\" \"Where are they going, Marshal?\" \"Walking in the moonslight.\" \"All of them?\" \"I'm the only one who's chosen a lady for the evening. They just have company. Would you like to take a walk in the moonslight, Bella?\" \"Yes, Marshal, I would.\" He smiled. She sounded surprised. He could feel her pleasure in the invitation and the surprise. \"Please, I'm only Marshal when I'm working. I am most definitely off duty. I'm Clete.\" \"I'm glad you're off duty, Clete.\" Dutch watched the street from the office. The town was nice and peaceful. It made him feel very nice. He'd had a nice night and didn't have the hangover he'd been planning before they'd showed off. He nodded to Bella and Clete on the walk across the street. \"That is a changed woman, Lane. She's beautiful.\" \"Amazing what a little bit of Clete's own brand of sunshine can do for a late bloomer. Nice thing is, it'll last. She's discovered she's beautiful, Dutch. Now she always will be. Ah, that's the judge. We need to get this done and find that mining company.\" \"Did you see him light up when Clete introduced Bella?\" \"Yes. So did Clete. That's one worry off his mind.\" \"I'm gone, Lane. Out the back. See you in court.\" Lane sighed and ached a bit for Dutch. He didn't blame him for not wanting to be there when the two approaching the door arrived. He needed a bit of time to bury the hurt a bit deeper. \"Hello, Parker. You must be Tessa. It's very nice to meet you.\" \"Tessa, this is Lane. Isn't Dutch here? We were goin' to ask him to lunch.\" \"Sorry, Parker, you just missed him. You two go on. Busy day. There are Sare and Billy Kendirk.\" \"Oh, what a pretty dress.\" \"Please tell her that, Tessa, and make sure Billy hears. He chose that material for her. He said it was the first store-bought present he'd ever given her.\" \"Lane, you're a nice man. All of you are nice. Dutch especially. I felt much better after we'd talked. It was like I had a big brother I could tell my worries.\" \"I'm sure he'd be complimented. I don't think anyone's ever said that to him before. Ah, Sare, Billy. You know Tessa and Parker, I believe.\" \"Hello, Tessa. Parker, you're looking well. You had us worried for awhile.\" \"I'm much better, Ma'am. Been healin' right well.\" \"Sare, that's a real pretty dress.\" \"Billy picked the material for me, Tessa.\" \"Think I'll have him come shoppin' with me. I never know what's goin' to be pretty made up. Not many men have the knack. Musta' got it from his pa. He always picks you pretty things too.\" Lane worked to keep his hurt for Dutch out of his eyes and smile. He really had found Snow White, but she'd already found her prince. \"Billy, I think Clete will want you. You'll be testifying. I think he'd like you to meet the judge. I saw them go into the hotel.\" \"I want to meet him too, Lane. It'll be easier sayin' what I got to say if'n he's not a stranger. I'll head over there. All right, Ma?\" \"Certainly is. You got important things to do. You get 'em done.\" She smiled as he ran across the street. Parker made a swipe as he went by and laughed when he missed. \"Amazin' how this town's changed since you boys come. How you been, Lane?\" \"I'm just fine, Sare.\" She watched Parker and Tessa enter the hotel, then turned and grinned at him. \"Yep. Amazin' how healthy everthin' got after the Gallant boys walked in from somewhere.\" Frontier justice was swift. The judge heard the testimony, asked the prisoners questions and made his decision. The fifteen men and women set the punishment. The six, who had attacked them, were given the maximum of twelve years \"confinement and labor.\" The other six, who had made a loud and foolish attempt to scare the town into letting them go, were given one year. If Lane had died, six would have also died. With the town and jail empty of 'bad guys' and Parker on his feet, they weren't really needed there any longer. Clete turned over his badge to Parker and they headed out to solve the real problem. \"Do we check the mine or the farm first?\" \"You choose.\" \"Again, huh? I hate doing this when we're riding, Lane. I'm afraid I'll hit something big and you'll fall off. The farm. CLETE! Help me get him down!\" \"I've got him! What happened, Dutch?\" \"I asked him farm or mine and he told me to choose.\" \"While we were riding?\" \"That's what I said.\" \"You picked?\" \"The farm. I don't think he expected this.\" \"I didn't. Find us some place in the shade. This is.…\" \"Bring the horses, Dutch. He's clear out. We hit something bigger than one planet in trouble. Shade. Get water. I hear a stream over that way.\" Clete settled Lane and sat down. \"Clete, wrong choice. Bad choice. Both wrong.\" \"Lane! Lane? Dutch, we've got to decide to do something totally different. We've got to change things fast.\" \"We use Melissa?\" \"Done.\" \"Roller coaster. Swoops and dives. Flying.\" \"Lane, we're going back to Melissa.\" \"Good choice, Dutch.\" \"Here. Cold water. Do you need me? Do you want me to come in?\" \"No. Just give it time to steady. They're not what they seem. Six of one. Half-dozen of the other. We have to choose the right ones. Our key. Snow White. Everything follows.\" \"The men we put away?\" \"No, Dutch. Twelve await. Our test. Our judgment. Our choice.\" \"Clete, he's not making a lot of sense.\" \"He's worried, but not lost. Still confused. Getting better. Scared a little. For us.\" \"I'm worried all right. We're about to undergo a very strange test. It's waiting for us in the clearing with Melissa. We'll be given one clue. Snow White. Just that. I don't know what it means, but that's what we're given. Each of us must make exactly the right choice. We're facing judgment. I'm ready.\" \"Do you have any images after we reach Melissa?\" \"No, Dutch. Once we ride into the clearing, everything ends. We're given the clue and told we must choose on our way there.\" \"No point in putting it off. I'll get the horses.\" \"Clete, somehow, everything we've done, everything we are, has been leading to this. Dutch is our center, but he still feels like the weak link. As if he doesn't really belong.\" \"I know. Our talents are obvious. He isn't really capable of envy, but he gets wistful about them. He puts his life in our hands with a trust that frightens me. If we asked him to die, he would cheerfully give up his life and only ask if we were sure it was necessary.\" \"That's some progress. A few years ago he wouldn't have asked. You know, he's the only one who belongs here. We're outsiders. Both born on the other side of the doorway. This is his home. He's our touchstone with this universe.\" \"The choice must be his.\" \"Yes, Clete, the choice is his. We have to believe in him, as he does in us. Are you ready to die if he says it's necessary?\" \"A very good question. I need-- No I don't. The answer is yes. His lack of faith in himself makes it hard for me. I have to look past it. I find it's his and not my own.\" \"Good. I think we have one major problem.\" \"Convincing him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"They weren't real happy about leaving that nice fresh clover. I finally convinced them. Told them too much would give them tummy aches. All right. You're both looking at me like... I don't know, but something's up.\" \"Yes, Dutch. It's time you carried your load. We're handing it to you.\" \"Lane, I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"He's telling you the choice is yours. Whatever it is, it will be the right one for us. We give you ourselves. Use us as you deem necessary. Stop it! Why can't you trust yourself? We have complete faith in you. You must know that. You don't know it. Lane, he just doesn't believe me.\" \"Then we show him. Sit down, Dutch. Between us. We're going to take you apart and put you back together again. Decide now. Are we doing the wrong thing?\" \"You never do the wrong thing.\" \"There it is. That's the problem. Of course I do, but I do the best I can. So does Clete. So do you. That's all that really matters. Take our hands. You must decide. We can't join together unless you will it. You are our binding force. I'm not even sure we'd exist in this universe without you.\" \"That's silly. Of course you'd exist.\" \"Would we, Dutch? Clete's from the past of another universe, created out of one woman's love and determination to give him existence, an impossible feat. I helped bring my own mother to my father, but you brought her into our reality. You are real. Your mother made a choice and used well-known biological techniques, the tested methods of science. Clete and I are impossible. You are not. We're dreams come true. You are firmly real.\" \"Lane, you're scaring him.\" \"Good. He needs the courage it takes to overcome fear. He can't go on being fearless. It's not real.\" \"All right. You want to show me. Do it.\" Dutch reached for them and pulled their minds to his. He fought down his fear and conquered it. They broke him apart. They showed him what he was to them, their faith in him. Their absolute, unquestioning, trust. The union was complete. He was one being and three. His doubt died. He learned himself. His was the power of choice. He was their freedom and his own. Mistakes were unimportant. Trust and striving were all. They gave him their love. The ultimate gesture of total trust. He showed them his. They had always known. He had been afraid of failing them. He learned he could not. He slowly separated them from himself and found they remained bound to him. He would always know where they were, when they were, and how they fared. He had taken his place and accepted his burden. \"Wow.\" \"I believe that expresses it nicely. All right, Dutch. Now I think we're ready. How about it?\" \"It'll take me awhile to get my feet back on the ground, Lane, but yes, we're ready.\" \"Good. I'm drowning in your pleasure. Put your backside in the saddle. Let's get this done.\" \"Clete, you're a fraud. You're singing inside.\" \"Dutch, if we don't start riding, it'll be outside too.\" Actually, they all sang several songs their father had taught them. The folk medley from the 'Sixties' just seemed appropriate somehow. They were going to be tested. They were ready. Dutch reined in and just stared at her for a few seconds. This was more than a likeness. \"Snow White, right out of the cel.\" \"Yes, Dutch. The test awaits you. It is life or death and you three must choose. You may choose only six. No more. The powers of this universe have met and you are their battleground.\" \"Good and evil.\" \"Do you think it that simple?\" \"No. Chaos and order; life and death, shadow and light, endings and beginnings. They can't exist without each other.\" \"You are so very young to have the wisdom to see it. I am here because it is your wish to serve that which also possesses the wisdom. Remember, no more than six.\" \"That's your clue, Dutch. We have faith in your decision.\" \"I know, Lane. I'm ready.\" They rode into the clearing and stopped in surprise. Twelve beautiful women stood awaiting them. They dismounted and their horses trotted off. One of the women stepped forward and smiled. \"We are companions for you. You have the choice of six.\" \"What happens to the others?\" \"They will be slain.\" \"And if I choose none? What happens to you?\" \"We will live, but you three will be slain. Do not choose that way. You are needed.\" \"I've made the choice. We'd rather die than be the cause of death to innocents. Kill us. We're prepared.\" The women lifted the bows laying at their feet and they fell in a rain of arrows. Lane whispered, \"It was the right choice, Dutch.\" He knew it was. He smiled as he died. \"Awaken.\" Dutch opened his eyes. Snow White sat on the ground near his feet. He sat up and checked Lane and Clete. \"They live, as do you.\" \"I'd assumed I was alive. I was dead?\" \"If life was not truly risked, it would not have been the testing you wanted. \" \"I guess we did, I did, want it. That's why you're Snow White and not Lane's or Clete's dream girl.\" \"Why did you choose this way? \"We want to protect life. Want to serve it. Choosing life for some and death for others may be necessary sometime, but if we had the choice, it would be life for all. The choice we were asked to make had no compassion. Without compassion, we are a force for destruction. It is not what we have chosen to be.\" \"You have chosen a symbol. It is fitting. Awaken your brothers.\" \"Clete, Lane, wake up. We have company. Seems I made our decision correctly.\" Lane and Clete sat up and grinned at him. They hadn't had any doubts. \"Kneel before me. You have been tested and found to be pure of heart. Your oath to serve life was given in your choice.\" Snow White produced a gleaming sword from somewhere and tapped Dutch, then Clete and Lane on both shoulders. \"Roberrin, I name you Knight Champion. Pericles, I name you Knight Guardian. Apollo, I name you Knight Judge.\" Suddenly she was gone from the clearing. \"How about that? We have official status. Our side, three. Opponent, zip.\" \"Dutch, I've got memories again. We've still got a change to make.\" \"And I'm absolutely awash in brotherly love. Horses or Melissa, Lane?\" \"Both, Clete. Round them up. I'll see if I can talk Melissa into a new shape. Dutch, I'll need you. She listens better if you're around.\" \"Right, Lane. Sure she does. You neglect to mention she only listens to you.\" They spent the night in Melissa and set out on the road in the morning. Lane had been successful. The bright painting on the side of the wagon said \"Gallant Brothers Traveling Show.\" The buckskins didn't mind pulling it. The black tossed his head and danced down the road ahead of them. They headed for the farm first. It didn't take them long to find the evidence they'd expected. \"We're on the right track, Lane. Tessa's father was working with radioactive materials. I found residual traces in his workshop. Is this the piece you meant?\" \"That's it. Dutch, come over here. What do you think of this?\" \"I think our time traveler is stranded without it. He wouldn't have left it behind unless... He doesn't want someone else to have time travel! He's a fool, but not intentionally destructive.\" \"Most of the stuff in the shed looks like they were working on power generation.\" \"That would make sense, Clete. All right. I've got a clear image of the way to the mining camp. Put that piece in Melissa. He kept it out of their hands. We have to do the same. Let's see... Dutch you drive. I really need some rest. I spent most of last night trying to pick a clear path through the jumble in my head. Wake me when you need me.\" \"Lane, why don't you go in and go to bed?\" \"I like the feel of the sun. Oh, hide our keys. Yours and mine. Clete can keep his around his neck. Three alike is too many. They'll... Ah, that's better. Good choice. They'll never notice.\" Dutch shook his head and tucked the keys into the horses' harness. They became one more decoration in the gaudy equipment. He smiled, as he looked at Lane curled up behind the seat of Melissa-as-wagon. He felt a surge of protectiveness. Clete grinned at him as he climbed up beside him. It was a new feeling from Dutch. He'd been waiting for it a long time. He chuckled softly when Dutch arranged himself to keep the sun off Lane's fair face. Clete tapped Lane awake at the crossroads. He pointed and went back to sleep. They maintained their cover by camping at a spot that showed frequent use. Lane stood watch while Clete and Dutch slept. They dawdled over breakfast and took their time breaking camp. They knew they were about to have company. Everything was put away and Dutch was hitching the horses when it rode in. \"What are you doin' here?\" \"Hitching a horse to a wagon. Oh. Traveling. We're showmen. The Gallant Brothers. I'm sure you've heard of us. I'm Dutch. My brothers are around here someplace. We took so long over breakfast, they decided to fix lunch.\" \"This road doesn't go anywhere.\" \"You mean it doesn't go up to a big mine?\" \"What do you know about that?\" \"I know where there are hard-working men, there's money to be made. Sounded like a big enough operation to be worth the trip. There are my brothers now. All right! We eat good today.\" \"Hi there. Company for lunch. Come on, Clete. Bring those fish over here. Let's stuff them. I've got some wild tubers and herbs. Dutch, where are your manners? Introduce us.\" \"Sorry, Lane, we hadn't gotten that far. I'll stir up the fire. Ouch! Stones are good and hot. Hmm... Ooh, those leaves smell good. The fish will be nice wrapped in them. Won't you join us Mister... \" \"Carna. Lef Carna. Don't mind if I do. Sure looks good.\" \"In a few minutes, it'll smell that way. I'm Clete. That's Lane. I catch the fish, but he turns them into a feast.\" \"How do, Mr. Carna.\" \"Jes, Lef. Where'd you boys come from?\" \"Down south lately. We've never really had a place to be from. Our dad's a traveling man, quite a magician. Never could figure out how he made all those flowers appear. We're on our own now. Put together our own kind of show. Got enough material we can vary it to suit the audience.\" \"Where'd you hear about the mine?\" \"Dutch, do you remember?\" \"Not right off hand, Lane. Yes I do. A pretty girl told me about it. I stuck it on our route.\" \"What was the girl's name?\" \"Lef, you just asked my brother a question he probably can't answer. He doesn't remember their names. Just tells them they're beautiful and gives them a farewell kiss.\" \"Clete, I remember their names. I just don't always remember which name went with which girl. I usually just give them one I think suits them. Let's see... I called her 'Snow White.' She had soft white skin and big blue eyes. Wasn't too long back. I spent an afternoon with her. I had dates for the evening. Twins I think. Sisters? Four of them, anyway. All with soft brown hair. No, they were just friends. Yeah, friends. Or...maybe that was the night I woke up with a whole bunch and I couldn't remember where I found them all.\" \"See what I mean? A question he can't answer.\" Lef laughed. He liked these boys. \"Well, the boss keeps a pretty tight lid on things. We don't see many strangers, but we could use a good show. We had a bunch of boys ride off with our supply list and they ain't come back. They were carryin' a little money, but not a lot. I figure they got drunk and spent it and lit out. You boys could make extra if you're carryin' good drink.\" \"Sorry, Lef. Got enough trouble with Dutch sober. Drunk he gets in more. Forgets to ask if they're married. Lane and I hate having to leave town in a hurry.\" \"Too bad. Even the saloon's gettin' low.\" \"You have a saloon?!\" \"Dutch, we got everthin'. Good-size town, all in all.\" \"Women?\" \"Them too. Jes be careful. Right number of 'em's married.\" \"Yippee! This isn't going to be as boring as I thought.\" They'd needed Lef. He got them through the guards and Dutch to the mine owner's office. That person wasn't pleased. \"Boss, we need somethin' new. They're jes' showmen. I jes' don' see no problem.\" \"You aren't paid to make decisions. I told you not to let people come here, not guide them in. Get out of here, Lef. Before I forget you're a good miner.\" \"Sir, we put on a good show. We're even getting pretty well-known places. We're here. Why don't you let us do what we're good at?\" \"All right, but keep to your own business.\" \"No problem. A mine is a mine. You've seen one hole in the ground, you've seen them all. I like sunshine and moonslight. And women. You don't find any of them in a hole.\" Dutch grinned at the man who made his skin crawl. He'd already figured out what was being hidden. There were other things being pulled out, but he was standing over a uranium mine. \"We'll put on a big show day after tomorrow.\" \"Why so long?\" \"You want to give everybody a day off? You do, we'll do it sooner. We just figured you'd want it on the day most of the men aren't working.\" \"Day after tomorrow.\" Dutch left the office and walked to the saloon. Lane had told him they needed to enhance their reputation a bit. He and Clete were already there. They'd taken rooms at the hotel. Dutch wasn't looking forward to the hangover he had been told to build. \"Day after tomorrow.\" \"Right. Clete, what's the feel of the place?\" \"Suppressed energy. Hard labor with not a lot of ways to unwind. Worry. Some fear. Unfocused. Lane, some of these men are in bad shape.\" \"I saw it. Radiation sickness. There's more here than just a mine. We could synthesize the drug, but I don't see any way to give it to them.\" \"I do, Lane. Let's set up a still, get real drunk tomorrow night and give it away. Real friendly.\" \"Ow, my head. Two hangovers in a row is too much to think about, Dutch.\" \"I think one is enough too, Clete. Tomorrow night we'll drink a substitute. They won't know the difference. We'll add some herbs to it. Sell it as a tonic, then 'get wasted' and give it away. Lane can make it taste good.\" \"Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"No, I'm all right. Not bad. Good change. Images clearing. We've got a path. A good one. All the way through. Damn. Well, it'll be worth it.\" \"Uh, Clete, did that 'damn' make you as nervous as it did me?\" \"Yeah, Dutch. Why is it I'm no longer worried about a hangover?\" \"We'll get through. Tessa's father and our traveler are in the mine. They think our nasty has Tessa. There's a girl here with the same coloring. He showed her from a distance and sent them a piece of her hair. Our time traveler is from this world. He's an incredible genius, but time travel was an accident. He found the mineral and figured out what he'd done after the fact. He wanted to stop the terrible chemical pollution of his time. Thought he could do it by creating nuclear power and bypassing the fossil fuel age. A bit dotty. Looked up Tessa's dad as a great inventor in the right area. He's just as worried about Tessa as her dad is. Nice old boy. He'll be willing to listen to what we have to say, but we have to show him his world comes out of its chemical slog. He's going to fall in love with Melissa.\" \"Lane, what are we going to get through?\" \"Dutch, you don't really want to know.\" \"Yeah, you're right. Where do we start?\" \"Right here. No, wait. We've got to get the still going. Clete, you and me. Dutch, find all the women you can. Go out of here with a bottle in one hand and your shirt in the other. Make a point of asking if they're married. Clete and I will join you in the same condition. We're going to do some heavy showing off. No guns. Pure physical stuff. Clete, it's going to be a very warm night. We're going to be spread a bit thin. We want the undivided attention of every single woman here.\" \"How many is that?\" \"About two dozen.\" \"No problem.\" Lane and Dutch laughed and Clete grinned. Lane still felt a little odd, but he was too wise to dwell on something before it happened. Dutch watched them leave, then went to the bar and ordered two bottles. Drunk was going to take quite a bit of the rather watered alcohol served in the place. He wondered what Lane would say if he asked for a hangover cure. They'd agreed not to use it. They had decided it was too easy. If they were going to abuse themselves, they should pay for it. This was different. It was in the line of duty. He decided they shouldn't suffer for it. Lane would see the decision and make the arrangements. He made a swift end to one bottle and started on the other. He knew what kind of single girls he would find in a mining camp, but by the time he got through the second bottle, they would be beautiful ladies. He grinned at the bartender's expression when he handed him the second empty bottle and ordered a third. He didn't open it. It would spill. That was it. He was ready. He took off his shirt and shook out his hair, gave a whoop and burst out the doors. He did a tumbling run down the middle of the road and grinned. Both shirt and bottle were a bit dusty, but neither was damaged. He asked the first woman he saw if she was married and did she have friends. She said no and yes and he started gathering them. They weren't shy. He was dizzy with kisses when Lane and Clete found them. They showed off. Miners coming off shift got in the spirit and challenged Clete to contests of strength. Dutch ran a race against a horse and won. Lane spun through the women and every lace was undone and in his hands. They did a perfect tumbling routine, then headed back to the saloon. They cleaned out the stocks and shared them around. The moons came up and Clete let loose. The night got warm, very warm. They'd gotten the women a bit drunk too. They'd found it was a good way to keep them from noticing their two heartbeats, until they stopped noticing period. When morning came, Lane handed Dutch and Clete small capsules and swallowed his own. Clete stretched and purred. They left a large group of sleeping people in the meadow and went to find a hot bath, shirts and breakfast. \"Clete, you're purring again. It makes my teeth rattle.\" \"Sorry, Dutch. I'm trying not to. Just takes a bit of shutdown time.\" \"You were wide open and broadcasting last night. Wonder how many people here in the camp picked it up.\" \"Look around, Dutch. A lot of them. Those three women over there are married.\" \"I see what you mean, Lane. They look very contented.\" \"They are. The only frustrated people in this camp are single men. All but three of them.\" \"Clete, you're smug. Since I am too, I'm sure it's appropriate. But the purring drives me crazy!\" \"Let's get to work. These are the herbs I need for flavor. Clete, you get them. Stay away from the mining operation. Dutch, you start the drug synthesis. I'm going to buy a lot of grain. Mention I need to replenish my mash.\" \"Lane, you're really going to fix these people up, aren't you?\" \"What do you mean, Clete?\" \"I recognize a few of these. Looked over your shoulder when you were analyzing the local plants. Our tonic is going to cure practically every disease on the planet and give them a good vitamin dose besides.\" \"It'll taste good too. They've got a magnificent biota. I don't blame Professor Princar for wanting to save it. Most of those plants are already being used. Their medicine shows are true aids, not fraudulent like the ones on Earth were. Their biota is why they're much healthier in general. Medicine shows bring herbal aids from elsewhere. Birth control in a tea and antibiotic in poultices, salves and powders. They're just beginning to learn why the things they've been using for centuries work. It's why our time-traveler is so desperate to save it and chose this as the time. Tessa's father is aware of what they'd be be losing. If there was something to help radiation sickness, I'd have used it instead of having Dutch synthesize. Oh, unlock Melissa for him. Ride out bare-chested and bareback, gathering bag over your shoulder.\" \"All right, but I'm taking a shirt. Dutch sometimes misses places when he spreads screen and I hate finding out about it when I get red spots.\" They laughed and went to work. By late afternoon, they were ready to sell their tonic. They didn't have to pitch it. Every working girl in the camp pitched it for them. Men started lining up as soon as they saw them setting up. They sold it by the dipper and by the bottle. A few special bottles were prepared just for children. They contained everything but the alcohol. They said they never charged for children's tonic. They drank copious amounts of fluid that looked like the same thing, but wasn't. The actual alcohol content of the tonic was fairly low. They started acting drunk and got generous. Dutch slipped extra doses into the dipper for men who were in more advanced stages of radiation poisoning. Clete did his sleight of hand with the medunit on a few men with the type of injuries that occurred among pick-and-shovel miners. Lane brought buckets of their tonic out and kept the big iron kettle brimming. They kept careful count and Dutch took a friendly half-dozen bottles to the saloon. He shared them with the bartender and the working girls. Clete gave take-home bottles to the shaft boss to give the men working the last shift. They bottled the last kettle-full and left the bottles sitting out, then went to the hotel for a good night's sleep, about four hours. They got ready to build their show arena early in the morning. Clete made sure they were all well-spread with a good sunscreen. Dutch said he didn't plan on getting any sun on \"that part\" of his anatomy. Clete told him to hold still. Lane made sure Clete didn't get spots, then they went for wood. The hammering attracted attention and an audience. Lane and Dutch grinned at each other when Clete took off his shirt. Several of the married women gasped, but they didn't leave, just stood and watched him split rails. He shook his head and laughed when Lane and Dutch dumped buckets of water over him. They finished the arena and grandstand by mid-afternoon and went to get ready. They asked the bartender to collect admission for them on the way to Melissa. They replicated three snow-white, silver-trimmed outfits and strapped on guns. They had trained the horses and added several pieces to routine three. Clete whistled and they started the show. The miners and others in the camp were a very appreciative audience. They didn't know some of the things they did couldn't have been done by someone from their world, but they were sure they'd just seen the best sharpshooting show on it. Dutch was feeling very nice when they rode out of the arena to thunderous applause. Clete was pleased too, but there was an undercurrent of tension in Lane that kept him from reveling in Dutch's pleasure. \"That went well. The horses are born performers.\" \"Clete, that's an understatement. They and we were magnificent.\" \"Dutch, give me your gunbelt. You too, Clete. We don't want them on us. I'm going to give them to the hotel manager and ask him to keep them for us. I already told the bartender to give him the gate receipts to put in the safe. Clete, do you have the medunit?\" \"Yes.\" \"Let me see... Dutch, put it behind the lamp at the mine entrance. We'll want it, but we don't want it found. Push it back in the niche. Do it, then meet us back here. Don't be seen. Move fast. Now.\" Clete watched Lane 'waiting.' He could feel his tension had become anticipation of something and it wasn't pleasant. \"Dutch is close and so is something else. Tell me what it is, Lane.\" \"Pain. Our nasty boys are real sick. They want us. We're going to have to let them have us. It's the path to the survival of this world.\" \"Can't we change it?\" \"We could. Do you want to risk it?\" \"Risk what?\" \"Changing something because it's hard on us, Dutch.\" \"A silly question. Don't you think so, Clete?\" \"Yeah. Sorry I asked.\" \"Oops. Unit's in place. Now what?\" \"A good meal. The boarding house porch. Enjoy it. It'll be our last for awhile.\" Lane nearly hoped something would change things, but nothing did. It happened just as he remembered. Before they'd quite finished dinner, they were taken to the mine owner's house. \"They were easy to take, Boss. We just held guns on everybody else in the place and they stood there and let us chain them up.\" \"Idiot. You made them heroes. Well, spread the word we found out they're wanted men and were after the payroll anyway. Maybe somebody will believe it.\" \"Nobody's going to come up here to the house for 'em, Boss.\" \"Lef might have, but I put him back out on the trail. Did you get their wagon?\" \"Yeah, but we can't get it open.\" \"Search them for keys. No, I think I'll do it myself. Hold very still if you don't want a bullet put through your brother's head.\" Lane held his breath. He could feel Clete's anger. He breathed in relief when he felt him clamp down on it. He held very still. He felt Dutch begin to pull them together. It worried him. It wasn't in his memories. He gasped and concentrated on the shifting images. Dutch had made a good choice. The path was still clear. Being together would make what they had to go through easier. He felt the gun at his head and watched as Dutch was searched. Clete's turn came last. The man found the key around his neck, but didn't realize what it was. He left it there. They laughed together in their minds. He had found the key to the universe and had not recognized it. Then it began. Endless hours of pain for one, then another. Dutch's love had 'added value' to the ordeal. They were more interesting, because they were stronger together. They would gain something from it, but that wasn't the reason it was worth it. It would strengthen the rule of law in the still sparsely settled land. It was Clete's turn again, and it was time. He waited for Dutch to begin the path. \"How much longer, Lane?\" \"Soon, Dutch. They don't want us to die of thirst. We're still strong enough to be interesting. Clete, come on. Come back to us. Dutch, do something.\" \"He's trying to shield us from his pain.\" \"I know what he's doing. It's just the wrong choice. Pull him back. Force him if necessary. Show him what I see. He must accept the bonding. Must let us help hold him above what he's going through. Do it, Dutch. Do it now. He'll die if he takes it alone. He'll take his and ours. Like he's always done. Stop him. This time stop him. This time you can.\" \"Lane... \" \"Dutch, this time you can. Now, stop him.\" Dutch fought Clete. Fought him with his love. Pulled him. Drove through the barriers he had built and wept for him. Tears he wouldn't shed for himself. He gathered them together and forced Clete to open himself. Forced him to accept their presence. To see why he must allow it. Forced him to accept their strength. He surrendered his pain. They had made the choice for him. \"They're bringing him back. They give us water. Not enough to rebuild ourselves, but enough to keep us alive. Dutch, prepare yourself for the blood. You felt the pain. You can't let the sight shock you. We'll lose him if you do.\" \"Can I be angry, Lane?\" \"Oh, yes. We can be very, very angry.\" Rage. Blinding, burning, rage. Fury like he'd known only once before. Lane and Dutch burned him clean with their anger. He struggled to lift his head and look at them. He smiled and slipped into unconsciousness. Lane sighed in relief. \"He's dying of thirst. We all are. If that's what you plan, tell us now. We'll be unconscious by nightfall.\" \"Give them water. I don't want them drying up and passing out. This one too. Give him some now and more later. I want all of them alive for awhile. We're not done with them. Bring that one downstairs. Make sure this one's secured.\" It was Lane's turn again. Dutch held his mind with his love and refused to let him count how many more times each of them would suffer, or the days until it would end. The very sick ones had learned they were \"something else.\" Lane said they would tell no one. They were interesting enough, they were given some food too. It gave them the energy to heal enough to live long enough. Lef set his glass down on the bar and leaned close to the bartender. The hair on his neck was standing up and he was sure he smelled something bad. \"They ain't. Ain't wanted by nobody. Did a stint as lawmen, I hear. He's lyin'. This smells bad.\" \"Lef, he said he was just gonna' keep 'em here til the judge passed through.\" \"When did he say it?\" \"Been 'bout eight days.\" \"Judge passed through more'n six days ago. Talked to him a spell. How I found out they been lawmen.\" \"They put on a good show, Lef. They got a bundle a' money in the hotel safe.\" \"I want ever' man believes in findin' out the truth a' this in here tonight. Keep it low. We don' want them special hired guns to hear. Get the miners. We got to know. This ain't right. The judge didn' get no wire to come up here. How long ago he take 'em?\" \"'Bout ten-eleven days.\" \"The day he sent me out. I's 'sposed to be gone four more. Too long. Longer'n ever 'fore. Smelled bad. Why I'm back. Damn. Hope they're alive.\" \"I'll send the girls out. They like them boys.\" \"I jes' hope we ain't too late.\" Lef learned how the Gallant boys had been taken and told the men they were fools. They started getting mad. Not at Lef, at the men who had made fools of them. They laid plans. They surrounded the house and took out the sentry. Lef looked in a window and ran. He knelt in the grass and was violently ill. He chose ten men and made them swear an oath of secrecy. All the others listened to the oath. The ten had guns. They would be the judges. They broke through doors and windows, saw and killed. They shot all but the boss. They hung him on his porch. Lane smiled when Lef released him. \"Hello, Lef. Take us to the mine entrance. I've got a miracle waiting there. Get the two men he was holding in the mine and bring them to us.\" Lef held Lane and cried. The men wrapped them in blankets and carried them to the mine. They found the locked door in the abandoned shaft and freed the two men. Lane whispered the location of the medunit to the professor and lost consciousness. Lane didn't know it was Tessa's father who healed them, or that Lef helped. The professor swore him to secrecy. One look at the medunit had told him they were from farther in the future than he was. Lef watched them healed and believed. He took seven men and destroyed the lab, then blew up the mine shaft. The professor watched in sorrow. His time craft was gone, and with it his dreams of saving his world. He was not sorry to see the bombs he had been forced to build buried under the mountain. When Lane regained consciousness, he told him his story. The camp broke up. Lef stayed until he knew they were all right, then said goodbye. He was going to the federal court to apply to become a judge. They'd accept him. He had letters from several men saying they were sure he'd be a good one. Dutch, Clete and Lane left soon after he did. They took the professor and Tessa's father with them. Their first stop was his farm. \"Let Tessa know you're all right.\" \"I thought he had her and all the time she was safe. I'm an old fool, Lane.\" \"No, just a loving father.\" \"Say hello to Bella for me. She's quite a woman.\" \"Do you mean my sister Bella?!\" \"That's the one.\" Clete grinned at the expression on his face. Dutch and Lane managed to keep from laughing, just. They drove out of the yard and stopped by the bank of a stream. Dutch climbed down and removed the keys from the harness. \"What do we do with the horses, Lane? If we set them free, they'll just be captured again.\" \"Clete, just how much did you tell Sare?\" \"Just what I told him to, Lane. Everything.\" \"That's where we take the horses. It's not far. Let's go. Professor, watch for berry bushes. We'll talk Sare out of one more meal. Wait'll you taste her pie.\" They had one more meal with Sare and Billy and left the horses in the barn. They carried their tack into Melissa and laughed at the professor's expression when he stepped into Lissa. He started toward the bridge and they redirected him. Clete held him up when he stepped into their living room. \"This is... is... \" \"Melissa, our ship. Make yourself comfortable while we stow this.\" \"Here, Dutch. I'll take yours too. You stick with him. Show him the kitchen and fix him a cup of tea. He needs it.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Come on, Professor. This way.\" \"This isn't possible!\" \"Neither are we. Well, Lane and Clete insist I am, but since my father doesn't exist in this universe, I have my doubts. Here. Sit down and drink this. I'll tell you why we're here. And why we're not sure why you are. Lane says we... interrupted the paradox, or shorted the loop.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"What you did here would have left your world a radioactive cinder in fifty years. Of course, you wouldn't have been born, so it wouldn't have happened. But then, you would have and it would, and round and round. We're new at this and still trying to figure that part out. Or we found it because we were supposed to change it. Dad says just fix and don't worry.\" \"Dutch, you're confusing him.\" \"I figured he might as well be as confused as we are, Lane.\" \"Help. I've set course for your world's future, Professor. I know you need to see it to truly believe it will change soon enough without changing the past. We're interested too. I know, but I want to see. We'll be landing soon.\" \"How soon, Lane? Does the professor have time for a tour?\" \"No, but we'll give him one anyway. Melissa loves to be shown off. Just the apartments though. We'll skip the ship proper. It would take years to explain finite infinity.\" \"Finite infinity is a self-contradictory statement.\" \"See what I mean? Come on. We'll start with the gym.\" They showed him Melissa, then his rich, green, and peaceful world. He promised to work to better his own time in his own time and they left him in his workshop mulling over the concept of finite infinity. They didn't return the rare element that made time travel possible. They 'forgot' to mention they had it. Dutch dropped onto a couch in the living room as Lane put them in flight. \"Lane, let's take a vacation.\" \"Exactly, Dutch. We're on our way, but I think you should know vacation runs right into work.\" \"Then we'd better start getting back in shape. The gym. Now.\" Dutch and Lane groaned, but followed Clete to the gym. They knew he was right. They had weight to regain and strength to rebuild. Vacations were more fun if they could show off.",

He glanced over at Dutch and grabbed a shirt. \"Dutch, you're turning pink. You didn't use screen again. Put this on.\" \"Uh, oh. Thanks, Clete. I didn't expect to be in the sun this much or I'd have remembered.\" \"Sure you would.\" \"Lane's over there someplace.\" \"Yeah, and very relaxed, near somnolent. At least he'll have screen with him. That shirt's too big. We're still underweight.\" \"Muscle mass takes time to rebuild.\" \"I know. I'm worried about how much time we'll have. There's something wrong here. A nervous undercurrent. Tense. That ought to wake Lane up. Thought so.\" \"What did you do?\" \"Decided we go on a full ten-day training schedule tomorrow.\" \"Oh, Clete! We're supposed to be on vacation!\" \"Lane said it was going to turn into work. It just did. Ten/five/ten run. Dawn tomorrow. Dutch, I really believe it's necessary. I doubt we'll get in the full ten days. Feel like doing a few katas?\" \"No, but I will. Odds on how long before Lane shows up?\" \"I can feel how close he is. Tai chi. Begin.\" \"You knew I was coming. You could have waited for me.\" \"Get in line, Lane. Too fast, Dutch. From the beginning.\" Clete moved them into the shade. They could cure sunburn, but avoiding it was always first choice. He seldom forgot sunscreen and Lane would be severely teased if he did, but Dutch never seemed to remember it. By the time they finished three hours of what should have been light exercise, they knew they were in worse condition than they'd realized. Clete designed a diet for them. They'd been starved. They had used some of their body mass to stay alive. Dutch added a bit to their schedule, a meditation routine. He wanted to see if they could increase their ability to distance their minds from their bodies. If they could, they would never go through the kind of pain they had suffered again. He nearly gave up the idea in panic when Lane went under and he spent an hour trying to bring him back, but both Lane and Clete believed they should go on. They trained their bodies and began to learn to control them to the deepest physiological function. An 'accident' taught them how well they'd learned. \"DUTCH! Lane! Come on! He's hurt!\" Lane followed Clete into the sea. Dutch was in real trouble. How had he missed it? Why hadn't he seen it? The sudden shift in current had pulled Dutch against the wreck he had been exploring. His snorkeling partner was struggling to free him from the entangling weeds. Riss was hanging on against the panic she felt as she swam in the cloud of blood at his side. She swam to the surface and took him a lung full of air. Then started working to free him again. Suddenly his brothers were there. She got him another lung full of air and he smiled and motioned her up. They brought him up and began floating him to shore. Clete felt her fear and pulled her in. \"He'll be all right, Riss. He's in a state of trance. It slows his metabolism and reduces the blood loss. You saved his life. You did well.\" \"Oh, Clete, it came so sudden. It pushed him into the wreck and tangled him in weeds. I didn't have anything to cut him loose with and there was so much blood and I just--\" \"Easy, easy. It looked like a lot of blood because it dispersed so fast. He's not hurt as bad as you think he is.\" \"Clete, I know how bad it is. It was the first thing I checked.\" \"Riss... Oh, damn. We're not human, or not completely anyway. We're half something else.\" \"I know. He has two hearts. I like the double beat.\" \"Well, we've been learning to control our bodies. Dutch is the best. He's healing already. Go look.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"Clete, what did you tell her? Damn! Clete, she's right. It's not possible. The wound's closing. Healing as I watch it. In... twenty minutes it'll be gone.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"Come on. Let's get him above the tide line.\" \"Hello. Thanks, Riss. You saved... Why are you all staring at me?\" \"We're going to move you into the shade, Dutch. Go back into trance and finish healing yourself.\" \"What are you talking about, Clete?\" \"Just go back under. We'll talk about it when you wake up. Lane, I'm going to buy Riss and I a drink. We'll be back. Come on, Riss. You look like you need one as bad as I do. Hot cocoa with something minty.\" \"I'm with you.\" Lane watched them walk off and smiled. Clete didn't need a drink, but he must have thought Riss did, or at least that she needed the walk and something warm. Somehow Dutch had learned to put himself in a healing trance. The injury wasn't really bad, not much more than a nasty gash. The entangling weeds, blood loss and shock had been the real danger. He worked to get rid of the guilt he had missed the incident in his memory and put it in perspective. They had learned something invaluable from it and that was what was most important. Dutch came out of his trance after a very few minutes, looked at his side, grinned at Lane and went to sleep. Lane noted the sleep. It told him the healing trance required an energy expenditure. Normal trance conserved energy and revitalized. He had timed the trance. He would time the sleep. If it was about equal, they could assume at least Dutch had inherited another of their father's physical attributes. He thought about missing the memory of the incident and wondered if he hadn't been intended to. The fact he hadn't become dizzy... Clete looked slightly disgusted when they came back. He hadn't been extremely successful getting rid of the guilt. \"How is he?\" \"Asleep, Clete. Just grinned at me and went to sleep.\" \"Oh, I see.\" \"Well I don't.\" \"Riss, I can't explain it, but what he did made him tired.\" \"What are you besides human? Your blood's red. You look like us. That's not extremely unusual, but this is.\" \"Our father is... Well, he's from an older species, more physically advanced. He thinks most of his people are boring. Spends most of his time with humans. Prefers their company. Spent several years with Clete's mom.\" \"Lane, are you telling me you had a different mother than Clete?\" \"Oh, I'd say she was different. Wouldn't you, Clete?\" \"Very.\" \"The longer I'm around you guys, the more confused I get.\" Dutch lifted himself to his elbows and smiled. \"That's why you're with me. I'm a much simpler person.\" He looked from his two brothers to the pert little brunette he really liked and wondered why they were all laughing. They continued with the meditation routine and began to notice it was having more effects on them than expected. Lane answered the question in Dutch's eyes when he sat down across the counter from him in the kitchen. \"We're changing. Our temperatures are lower. Our resting pulse rates are slower. Our entire metabolisms have slowed.\" \"I get cold easily, Lane. I had to come back to Melissa for a sweater last night.\" \"You can speed up your metabolism to compensate, Dutch, probably to a much higher rate. With sufficient fuel, you'd probably barely notice sub-zero.\" \"I'm not sure I like it.\" \"Remember how easily Dad got chilled? We'd be broiling and he'd be wearing a jacket. Well, that's about where we are. Not quite that extreme, but moving that direction.\" \"I don't understand about you, Lane. We're half human. You're not. Why are you... Why weren't you like this before?\" \"You, Dutch.\" \"Duh.\" \"I spent my entire childhood waiting for you. Wanting to be with you. Wanting to be... more than just your half-brother.\" \"I never think of you that way. I never have.\" \"I know. Just goes to show how tight the bond of our father's heritage is. You didn't think of us as half-brothers from the moment you met Dad.\" \"Maybe more than even just brothers, the triplets everyone thought we were.\" \"Aren't we? Aren't we one who became three?\" \"Or are we three becoming one?\" \"Does it matter? Would you change it?\" \"What a silly question. And I can't say I mind becoming more like Dad either. In fact, I've decided I'm going to be rather smug about it.\" \"You look even more like him than we do, Goldilocks. Let's find Clete. I've remembered something.\" They found Clete, relieved him of his barbell, and pushed him toward the spa. He had regained nearly all the mass he'd lost and he pulled both of them in with him. He was pleased with the success of the training program and their timing was, if anything, better. They laughed and played a bit, then settled into quiet relaxation. Lane began to tell them of the images and the change that was needed. \"The current that caught Dutch is a fairly common occurrence. Ten years ago it was an occasional one; twenty, nonexistent. The entangling weeds weren't a result of the current. They caused it.\" \"I felt it! I didn't recognize it, but when I was trying to free him, I was feeling an... anger that wasn't my own. It wasn't focused. Just a formless anger.\" \"That's right, Clete, a formless anger. It's growing stronger.\" \"Lane, there's… evil here. Deep and ugly. A cold malevolence. A power of destruction. Strongest near the sea. I want to do something about it.\" \"That's the decision that gave me memories, Dutch. We find an island. It's in the southern ocean. It's the source of the hate. We feel the malevolence. It's not natural to this world. The island is volcanic. It hasn't been active for thousands of years. That changes abruptly.\" \"And?\" \"That's it, Dutch.\" \"All right, we know what you mean. How do we get to the island?\" \"By boat.\" \"I want to take Melissa.\" \"Changing. No good.\" \"I think we should start at the beginning. Twenty years ago.\" \"Good idea, Clete. Well, Lane?\" \"Changing. No. Same result.\" \"That's it then. We don't go to the island.\" \"What?\" \"The island's a trap. We refuse to spring it. We battle from here. We mock it in our thoughts and-- Well, we know it changes things. Let's get him out of the water.\" \"Dutch it's not the same! He's not unfocused! He's not there!\" Dutch grabbed Clete's mind with his and began the search for Lane. He poured his love and Clete's, their desperate need to find the one who was more than brother, into it. He felt an echo and found another who searched. He felt strength pour into his call. He smiled as he recognized the mind that searched with them. Another joined, gathered into the search by love and need. They found him and battle was joined. Power fought power. Love and life battled hate and death. Fought for Lane, for his spirit. They were losing until a will refused to lose. Refused to be defeated. Refused to allow it. Dutch found his own 'stubborn streak'. He would not allow it! He would not let Lane be taken from him! Clete added his passion. The fire of his spirit. The driving need for Lane in his life. His rage at his being taken. It burned through the channel the searching minds had created and became relentless. That which had taken Lane began to fear. Love, will and rage were forged into a weapon guided by Dutch's hand. A burning sword of power. Suddenly, Lane was with them, fighting with them to free himself. That which had held him fled into the darkness, mocked by their love and joy. The strange union began to dissolve. The dissolution was gently tinged with sadness. Two had touched one they had thought to touch no more. Clete wept for the poignancy of their partings. Dutch gathered his brothers and returned them to themselves. Lane softly whispered, \"Mother,\" in their minds. \"I'd say that changed things.\" \"Clete, you have an absolute gift for understatement. Lane, are you all right?\" \"I... Yes. No. I'm not sure. I feel... unreal.\" \"No.\" Clete reached out and pulled Lane to him. Wrapped him in his arms and held him. Dutch was a bit surprised, but trusted Clete's instincts. He joined in the embrace and they held him between them. Lane began to laugh. \"I know I'm real now. I'm being squished.\" Clete and Dutch joined in his laughter, but they didn't let him go, not for quite some time. They needed to feel he was real as much as he did. He didn't know something was odd until the next morning. After two days, he knew he had to share his worry. \"Dutch, the images are gone.\" \"Which images?\" \"My memories of the future. They're gone. That's why I felt unreal. I catch glimpses of near events. I know Clete is about to walk through that door, but nothing else.\" \"Sit down, Clete. Explain.\" \"I can't. When we decided to take on a task, I'd see an abrupt end if something happened to us. As soon as we found a solution, the future became myriad possibilities. The possibilities increased with every change we made. I started with one for my life. It became several when Dad didn't send me away. They became many. The many became myriad. Now they're gone. I'm useless to us.\" \"That's ridiculous! Don't ever say it again!\" \"I'm sorry, Clete. It's how I feel.\" \"I think it's ridiculous too, Lane. You knew Clete was coming in.\" \"Like I said. Near. Nothing that leads beyond the next moment. No memories beyond.\" \"Limbo. We all are.\" \"Your turn, Clete. Explain.\" \"We haven't made any plans. We haven't made any decisions. We haven't made any choices. Too delighted to have Lane with us to think beyond the moment. You're the key, Dutch. Have you made any decisions?\" \"No. You're right. I've just been existing. Something took Lane right out of Melissa. It shouldn't have been able to do that. I haven't wanted to make any decisions. It happened when I made a change.\" \"You're afraid. You don't want him to have memories. You don't want the power to put him into... well, under the influence of his changing memories. You're afraid it'll happen again. Dutch, you can't hold your breath forever. Choice is a function of who you are, of what we are together. If you refuse to make choices, you cripple yourself and suspend him in limbo.\" \"I need time.\" \"No, you need to pull yourself together now. We don't have to ride out to battle, but you must choose to do something. Even doing nothing is a choice. It just leads to nothing. If we do nothing, the enemy has won. Entropy defeats us.\" \"I don't know what to choose.\" \"Choose to face your fear. It isn't of dying. It's of losing us. What we have. What we are. Choose!\" \"I... choose to strengthen us. To learn more about us. To make what happened impossible.\" \"Yes. Yes! It's not the same, but it's there. A future. Not far. No splitting. To the point of another time of choice. Thank you.\" \"What's the first step, Dutch?\" \"We've learned to use your passion and my will. Lane is our weak link. We have to learn to use his intellect. Blend your passion and my will to the use of his reason. Bring him fully in. I think the key is his insatiable curiosity.\" \"I'm lost. I don't think I'm that curious.\" Dutch smiled and Clete burst into laughter. He really was \"lost.\" He just didn't see it. \"Lane, you're so curious, you've found a way to see the future.\" \"I was born with that, Clete. It's just there.\" \"Clete was always passionate. Probably gave hugs that bruised when he was two. I'm so stubborn, my mother said I reminded her of her Dutch grandfather. He refused to give up and spent five years in a crippled spaceship living on food concentrate and recycled water and air. He'd plotted his course and knew eventually he'd tumble through a space lane. He thought it would take twelve. Dutch isn't from Duchelle. It's for him. I had it by the time I was a year old.\" \"But my sisters see the future too.\" \"One future. Unchanging. You say they're quite happy that way. Would you be?\" \"I can answer that. You wouldn't. You get excited every time you anticipate a change, Lane. You can't wait to find out what happens. Like a kid at Christmas. Near breathless with anticipation.\" \"Am I really?\" \"Yes. You're surprised. You've always thought of yourself as rather cool and reserved. Almost envied Dutch and I our... drive. That's the best word I can come up with. Lane, you're about as cool as a stable star. Your reserve is stability. Nothing else. You can't resist a puzzle or a mystery. And... behind it all you may be a freer, wilder, spirit than either of us. You have no reserve when it comes to learning the truth of things. I agree with you, Dutch, insatiable curiosity.\" \"That's our key. Now all we have to do is figure out what to use it on. The lock it fits. I think we... Let's start with meditation and Melissa. She's a mystery. So are we.\" \"You just got him excited, Dutch.\" \"Good. We're on our way.\" Five days later, they were ready to begin working on the 'anger' again. They had already won the real battle. They knew it. \"Can you feel the difference, Clete?\" \"Yes, it's weaker. Still malevolent. Still angry. But weaker. Why, Dutch?\" \"Well, Lane? A mystery?\" \"Not really. Analogy: There used to be receivers that could run on either of two sources of power, current running along wires and directed to outlets, or storage batteries installed in the unit and replaced when exhausted. We unplugged it from the wall. Eventually, it would run down.\" \"How eventually?\" \"A very long time, Dutch. A lot of wrecks, drownings and fear long time.\" \"So we still need to take it out.\" \"Yes. It doesn't belong here.\" \"I pity it.\" \"Explain that statement, Clete.\" \"It doesn't belong anywhere, Dutch. It's not needed, not wanted and it has no home. I'll destroy it, but I'll pity it.\" \"Your pity and compassion are the greatest weapons in our arsenal, Clete. It has neither. We have an island to find. In Lissa. Melissa stays here. You know, she's not happy with her current shape. We should move her.\" \"Suggestions, Lane.\" \"Put her where she can be either of the two shapes she likes, Dutch. The spaceport or the carnival.\" \"Let's take her to the carnival.\" \"Whoa! Changes! Oh my. That was a good choice. We really are going to have fun when we get back. If we get back.\" \"You know, Clete, it doesn't even bother me any more when he says that.\" \"Says what, Dutch?\" \"If.\" Lane coaxed Melissa into being Lissa at the spaceport to drop her, then let her be her favorite shape at the carnival. They hung a closed sign on her and ran the fifteen K back to the spaceport, Clete's idea. The port manager muttered about idiot computers that lost landing records when the ship on pad three asked for clearance for liftoff. They flew to the island and landed. The volcano began to smoke. \"Is it in the volcano, Lane?\" \"No, not really. We climb it to see and it erupts.\" \"I don't like that. An eruption would cause tremendous damage along the shoreline for thousands of kilometers.\" \"Not to mention giving us very hot feet.\" Clete grinned when Dutch sat on the ground and laughed. \"Oh, it didn't like that. You decided not to climb it and laughed at it.\" \"Change. The gun! You're going to use Lissa's gun to vent the volcano!\" \"Yes, Lane. What does that do?\" \"Makes it decide to hurry. Back to the ship. NOW! Run, Dutch! RUN!\" Dutch put on a burst of speed and dove through the hatch. He was in the gun turret by the time Lane and Clete got to the ship. He chose his point and fired through the volcano. He tracked the beam down, cutting through the side and deep into the island base. He kept tracking down as Lane lifted off. The sea began to boil as molten magma poured from the rent in the volcanic shaft. Dutch laughed. It would be very angry now. \"That's cruel, Dutch. You're laughing because it's helpless against us.\" \"Yes, I am. Help me out of here. Give me your hand. If I unstrap, I'm going to land on my head. Ah. Better. I wondered when Lane was going to turn the ship back over.\" \"Just in time to nearly land me on my head. He's been pretty busy. A lot of people wanted to know exactly what we thought we were doing.\" \"Ooh, I'll bet he's been busy. Our nasty thing is very close, Clete.\" \"Yes. Let's get us all together. I think it's going to mount a personal attack.\" \"Lane!\" Clete followed Dutch the few meters to the bridge. Lane looked up and smiled. He reached out a hand and Dutch took it, then held out his other hand to Clete. They joined minds and waited. When the attack came, it was furious. And futile. Dutch exulted, then realized Clete's overwhelming feeling of pity was their true weapon. He willed the malevolent force to feel it. To know it. To see Clete's sadness for the pitiful thing that could know only hate. His compassion for something his love would destroy. It screamed into nonexistence and Clete wept for it. They requested landing clearance and set down on pad three. There was quite a reception committee waiting for them. Dutch apologized for firing a weapon in the planetary atmosphere, but explained all he could think about at the time was the loss of life and property an eruption would have caused. Then he had to apologize for landing on the island in the first place. He was getting rather aggravated with the whole affair when the media people burst into the room. They were suddenly heroes. The people who had been ranting at him were touting his quick thinking, posing with the three of them for the vid. Dutch looked at Lane and he winked. Dutch grinned. He now knew who had commed the media. Clete was grinning too. Lane didn't feel smug very often. Dutch and Lane groaned when he ran them back to the carnival. The port manager looked out and swore. Pad three was empty again. And no one could find the liftoff records. Two technicians spent some time looking for the glitch in the computer. Melissa chose a slightly different spot on the midway and they took down the closed sign. The first customer was a lovely girl. Dutch had no problem devining her immediate future. It started with dinner, then a show, then... Clete and Lane laughed. Dutch would never change. Lane watched the future take shape and hunted for a change. When he couldn't find one, he headed for the beach and Dutch quickly. They didn't have much time. \"Dutch, we need to talk.\" \"About?\" \"Clete. We need to do it fast. I'm worried and he'll be here soon.\" \"Start talking.\" \"He's going to fall in love. Helplessly in love.\" \"Lane, that's not a problem. It won't change things between us.\" \"Dutch, she's going to die. He's going to want us to stop it. Want us to change it.\" \"Then we change it.\" \"We can't. Let me rephrase that. If we do, thousands die. She makes the choice to save them. I've been doing what-ifs for hours. I kept thinking I'd find something. Dutch, she's carrying his child when it happens.\" \"Damn. We have to tell him. He'd never completely trust us again if we don't.\" \"I know. I've thought about rushing us off the planet. Getting us out of here before he meets her.\" \"That's not right either.\" \"I know. Here he comes.\" \"What's wrong, Lane?\" \"Let's go to Melissa. I want our home around us. A fire. A cup of cocoa. Us.\" \"You're hurting. You're both hurting.\" \"Yes, Clete. Come on. Lane will explain. You have a choice, but we know how you'll make it.\" \"All right, Dutch. We run. I want the hurt lessened until we get home.\" They ran. It did keep the pain at a distance. They settled by the fire in their living room. Lane told Clete what he had seen. Clete's choice was love, even for a short time. They had known it would be. They wouldn't leave. He met her the next day, a Fleet officer on leave, beautiful, passionate and loving. Her name was Helen. Dutch and Lane put the pain into the future and reveled in Clete's happiness. \"Dutch, Helen and I are going to the beach. Do you want to come?\" \"No, Clete. Lane and I have plans too. Have fun.\" \"We always do.\" \"Yeah, I know. Do me a favor. Try to keep things from getting too warm. At least til evening. We're getting tired of looking for places to take a cold shower.\" \"I'll try. I want to bring her here, Dutch. I want her to know who I am. I want to bring her home.\" \"All right. Take her out of the hotel. She stays here with us. With you. It's where she belongs.\" \"Tonight?\" \"Tonight.\" Dutch went to see how Lane was. He'd made a choice. In a way it was a betrayal. A violation. \"Will he hate me?\" \"No. He's going to be pretty mixed up about it for awhile. Let's get to work. We have a great deal to get ready.\" \"And not much time.\" \"Stop. We promised him we wouldn't dwell on it, would keep our minds on other things. He deserves to be happy for the time they have. She's quite a woman, Dutch. She will do what needs to be done.\" Clete brought Helen home. She learned what the man she had fallen in love with was. It didn't really surprise her. She'd known there was a uniqueness about the brothers that went beyond being half human. She became part of the family, one who belonged in their lives, a part of all of them. \"Dutch, Clete asked me to marry him.\" \"I never doubted he would Helen. I'm very happy for you both.\" \"No you're not. Neither is Lane. Oh, I'm welcome and you even love me, but you're not happy. I want to know why.\" \"The choice wasn't mine to make after all.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Helen, I... We... Damn. Did you extend your leave? Did you tell them you were getting married? Who to?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did your captain say?\" \"He told me Commander Telas said Clete's father would be pleased.\" \"He's our godfather.\" \"Your godfather?!\" \"Yes, and the best there is.\" \"I don't doubt that. It's just a very antiquated concept. What does that have to do with why you're not happy?\" \"We... I'm sorry, Lane. I'm sending her to you. I can't.\" \"You can't what?\" \"Find Lane. Ask him. He lives with the future. I don't have to that often. Just... find him. You have choices to make. He's a very good guide.\" Lane smiled gently when Clete walked into his room. He'd tried to ignore it, but he was too honest with himself to do it any longer. \"You told her. Lane, you told her.\" \"She asked, Clete. Would you have had me lie to her? I couldn't have even if you'd asked it. I respect her too much. Has it changed things between you?\" \"Yes. How else would I have known?\" \"Do you love each other less?\" \"Of course not, Lane, but now there's a desperation, a poignancy, about it. No one should have to know when they're going to die.\" \"I agree, but many of us do. My mother wasn't the same situation, but she knew. I'll know. Perhaps everyone does. She could have chosen not to. I told her that. A dozen ways. Dutch has known we'd have to tell her from the beginning. Even before I did. But he couldn't actually do it. It hurt him too much.\" \"The night he got drunk.\" \"Yes, to deaden the pain, so you wouldn't be burdened with it. Now go get ready. All weddings are both joyful and sad. Yours will be no different. You just know the reasons.\" \"Lane, I don't know if I can get through it.\" \"Clete, when you see her coming down the aisle, red hair, green eyes, turned up nose and freckles, you'll be the happiest man in this universe. Probably more than this one. We're going to live an incredibly long time. Well, if we don't get ourselves killed. We'll have to face this again and again. Father chooses to love and accept the pain of parting. You've made the same choice.\" \"Yes, I guess I have. Get ready. You're giving away the bride.\" \"That didn't surprise the magistrate as much as your first suggestion.\" \"I know. He just couldn't handle the concept of two best men. What will he do when you join Dutch beside me instead of sitting down?\" \"Stumble a little, then go on. He's more adaptable than he thinks.\" The wedding was beautiful and joyous. Helen and Clete went back to Melissa and Dutch and Lane went out on the town, looking for company. Everyone seemed to be. It was a very warm autumn night in the city. Helen had twelve more days of leave. Four days after Helen went back, Lane ran for Dutch. He hadn't been able to keep his brothers from knowing it would be soon, but they really didn't want to know when. He really didn't want to know, but he did. \"Find him! Find him fast!\" \"He's over there. Not far. Come on!\" Sand. Dutch hated running in sand. It slowed him. Dragged him down. He wasn't going to be there. Wasn't going to be fast enough. Clete would feel him coming. Would know what was coming. Clete's scream of pain and loss cut through him. Drove him to his knees. Lane caught his arm and dragged him up. They ran on through the pain, and the anguish, and the dragging, treacherous, sand. They caught him and held him. Kept him with them. Held his mind, when he would have thrown it after her. Held his body, when he would have thrown it into the sea. Held his life between them, when he thought it had ended. Along the beach, people saw two holding one and weeping, and wept with them. The official notification was delivered, personally, by Telas two days later. Dutch led him to Clete's rooms, where he'd shared so much with his wife of such a short time. Lane was waiting for him when he walked out. \"I've given him her message. I don't know how to judge his reaction. I did as she asked. It seemed the choice should be hers. She believed she died for a good cause. I asked her to let me take the mission. She refused.\" \"We knew she would, Telas. So did Clete.\" \"The ship would have killed thousands, Lane. I still tried to change it. We were close, but there was too much orbital traffic to risk firing a weapon to attempt to destroy it. Helen loaded everyone aboard into survival pods, stunned five to do it. There wasn't a self-destruct. It was just an old mining ship being dismantled for salvage. She didn't learn why a station-keeping jet suddenly fired and aimed it right for the planet. She used the one that hadn't fired to guide it into the moon. It was barely in the realm of possible, a feat of piloting I might not have been able to duplicate. She may have been the only one who could have done it. And she may have known it. I'll miss her too. Dutch, how is he?\" \"He needed to be alone. Lane, will he be--\" \"Dutch, he'll laugh again and love again. This time will become one of his most wonderful memories. He knows it already. He just doesn't feel it yet. You two have given him a gift from her. Someday, he'll be ready to receive it. You, Dutch, gave her another choice. Telas, you gave her the means. Thank you, Godfather, for interceding with the captain on her behalf.\" \"He thanked me. He too will miss her. He too understood... she made the decision not to change it.\" \"I looked for a way we could change it, Telas.\" \"I was sure you had, Lane. Dutch, help him get rid of some of the guilt he couldn't find one. He'll help. He thinks Clete's got too much to carry now without that too. Don't you?\" \"Yes, Godfather.\" He left them to return to his ship. He would watch over the tiny thing that awaited, suspended in sickbay, the caring and love Clete would give when he was ready. Someday, he would claim Helen's gift. And delight in the little boy who called him \"Daddy.\" Dutch was worried about both his brothers. They were just wandering around. They'd visited a couple beautiful worlds, looked at the lovely and peaceful scenery a few hours and... wandered. The time had been important, but it had been long enough. \"Lane, we need to do something fun.\" \"We're on our way to the pleasure planet of Jesera.\" \"That wasn't exactly what I had in mind.\" \"Yes it is, Dutch. You want to show off, show up the bad guys, be a hero, and meet lots of lovely ladies. Not necessarily in that order.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind.\" \"I thought so. Something fun. This will be good for Clete too. That's your next question.\" \"Will it?\" \"See? Next question.\" Lane ducked the playful swipe. He was looking forward to seeing Dutch's face when they landed in the midst of an interstellar showcase of muscle, madness and beauty. The madness was the work. The muscle and beauty were the fun. The work would be fun too. Dutch really disliked bullies and drug dealers. \"Tell Clete we're on full training schedule. Starting in ten minutes. Meet you in the gym.\" Dutch laughed and went to find Clete. It was time for him to rejoin the team. Time he learned he could still laugh. Time he remembered why he was alive. He was still laughing when he got to the gym. The incredulous look on Clete's face had been wonderful. No one but he had ever called a training schedule before. Lane put them through their paces. He told Clete to pay attention and shape up. Within a few hours, Clete had retaken his place as training director. He hadn't even realized he'd done it, just started following the schedule Lane had made and gradually slipped into it. They had been a very long way from where they were going. In twenty days, they had honed their bodies and their skills to perfection. When they landed, they were ready. Lane entered them in every event but the beauty contest and he signed them up as escorts for that. He carried their very busy schedule back to the hotel room Melissa had landed in and handed copies to Clete and Dutch. \"Lane, this isn't fair. We're faster and stronger than full humans.\" \"Clete, we aren't competing against humans in most events. The top weightlifter in your class is a targ. Dutch's main competition in the track events is a corduni. We're even going to lose a few contests.\" \"Hey! I just found my favorite event!\" Clete and Lane turned to Dutch and chorused, \"Beauty pageant escort.\" Then Lane told them why they were there. They swept through the events. They were listed as 'The Gallants, anthropoid mix' on the official charts. The only problems arose when Clete was entered in bodybuilding, weightlifting and wrestling events. There were some very warm audiences. They solved the problem by dousing him with cold water whenever they started to get warm. He spent a great deal of time wet. Lane was right. They did take second in a few events, never third. They also ended in a few ties. They laughed when they tied for first place as best all-around athlete. It was the only competition all three were in as individuals. They took every event they entered as a team. They built a showpiece out of martial arts routine six and sharp shooting routine three and presented it the night of the award presentations. The stunned silence of the stadium audience lasted nearly two minutes before the night was split with a roar of approbation. By the time they showed up for beauty pageant duty, females of every species were begging the stage manager/producer for one of them as escort. Dutch had an idea, of course. \"We'll escort them all on. Then you assign someone else for the rest of the duties. We'll bring them on two at a time so the schedule doesn't get off.\" \"I can't do that.\" \"Why not? Dutch has given you a solution that keeps you out of hot water.\" Lane smiled at the thoughtful look on the man's face. They all liked him and it was going to be very pleasant to help him out. \"Would you rather assign us one each and then try to walk past the other twenty-seven finalists? We'll even provide our own costumes, something that will contrast well with the dark formal attire of the other thirty escorts. You do have three alternates listed.\" \"Hmm, it would be unusual. You boys are an attraction. Wouldn't take long to spread the word. Would probably attract more women. Might even boost ticket sales.\" \"Yes, and no one would be late getting lined up to go on either.\" \"How would you boys like to travel with the show?\" \"We thought you'd never ask.\" They dressed in the full formal tradition of Earth's twentieth century, white tails and diamond studs with blue satin tie and cummerbund. They finished it with white capes lined in blue satin. They all loved the style and had since Alice had shown them an image of Gallant in it when he had been very young. The memory of hearing him nervously asking her how he looked, and the three of them giggling too hard to explain why, when he asked what was going on, brought smiles, as they got ready. Dutch and Clete thought they were done, then Lane handed each a white top hat, a silver-headed walking stick, a deep red rose and a diamond ear clip. Clete looked at the ear clip in his hand and grinned. He brushed his hair back and put it and the top hat on. He pinned on the rose, spun his walking stick and strolled out the door. Dutch and Lane laughed. The Gallant boys were going on the town and expecting trouble to find them. The producer stared at them in amazement. \"You didn't tell me you were going to dress like that!\" \"Is there something wrong with it, Frake?\" \"No, Dutch. I just didn't know anyone could actually wear something like that and, well, get away with it. You're going to outclass the contestants.\" \"Never. They're the gems. We're merely the sets to show them off. Trust us. Our dad taught us well. None of them has ever been more beautiful than they will be tonight. Show us the routine.\" Clete expressed their opinion of the 'usual' show for the pageant. He could feel it was unanimous. \"Dull.\" \"What?\" \"Clete said it was dull. He's right. It's a presentation, not a roll call. You just leave it to us.\" \"Dutch... \" Frake watched from backstage and was astounded. The beauties floated on the arms of the brothers, even the non-anthropoids. The three just knew how to walk with them so the grace of their species was seen. He'd surprised himself when he asked them to join the show, but he was getting sure it was one of the best decisions he'd ever made, real fast. When all thirty finalists were on-stage, the brothers slid from three directions to front center on their knees, threw their arms out to the audience, then turned and threw them out to the contestants. Who had taught them all to drop deep curtsies in unison? And how had they figured out a way for a coni'ith to do it? The house exploded in applause. Frake sighed contentedly. The pageant was a success and it hadn't even gotten past the introductions. Frake watched in awe. They were everywhere. A music board bench repaired, a harp restrung, a riser rebuilt, a nervous hand held, a spotlight replaced, a lightboard rewired, a pushy mother charmed, a coughing judge given water... Everywhere. They took over the final presentation too. They carried flowers, sash and cape and followed the previous year's winner on-stage. Clete smoothly stepped in to assist the tiny othvin to crown her human successor, reshaping the crown she'd worn on her crest to fit in the process. He draped the sash and stepped back. Lane smoothly fastened the cape and Dutch laid the flowers across her arm. They stepped into line, rolled their hats down their arms and bowed her onto the runway. The crowd went wild. Frake went back to divide up the receipts and sighed. They'd demanded sixty percent this time. Perhaps the house had been large enough he would be able to pay for some work on the ship, but he doubted it. He said \"Come in,\" before he thought about it when Dutch knocked. \"What are you doing?\" \"Counting our receipts and paying our bills, Dutch, the last chore before we move on.\" \"That's a very large bill you have laid out, Frake. Are you paying off some real estate? Say, maybe a planet?\" \"It's just one of the bills. Keeps the show on.\" \"Protection. A piece of the gross. A large piece. Getting larger all the time. You pay it, they don't hurt anyone. Stop paying it.\" \"You... guessed it. I can't stop. They showed me I can't. Grabbed two of the girls and addicted them to a drug. Called the police and told them I did it. The police didn't really believe it, but it ruined those poor kid's lives and they asked me not to come back.\" \"Stop paying. We'll take care of them.\" \"Dutch, I can't. They just upped it to sixty percent and I've got no choice. I can't even just shut down the show.\" \"I understand you felt like you didn't have a choice before, but you do now. We're taking the ladies out tonight. They'll be safe.\" \"All of them?!\" \"No, six are engaged or married, just the other twenty-four. Oh! Twenty-five. Last year's winner is coming too. Give me half the protection money. Tell them your new partners have it. Clete's in the mood to show off. So am I. Lane likes an audience of ladies too.\" \"Dutch, you don't know these people.\" \"Tell them we moved in on you, said we were taking half their cut. Be real scared. Tell them who we are. I'm about to give you a black eye. It'll keep you from getting really hurt. We'll fix it when we get back. Won't be late. Most of the girls have a curfew.\" \"OW!\" \"Sorry. There. That's half. Now get the rest of the money put away fast. Don't worry about paying us. Clete needs exercise and gym time costs. Besides, we have trouble finding sparring partners for him.\" Frake did exactly what Dutch told him. He didn't have any trouble acting scared. His black eye was very convincing. He was surprised when the two men took the thirty percent and didn't give him another one. They were mad someone was trying to 'muscle in' on their territory. Frake put an ice pack on his eye. He suddenly smiled. He wondered if the protection collectors had any idea what they were up against. They used some of the money to take the ladies out. They took them several places. Half of every crowd knew who they were. The other half knew who the ladies were. About midway through the evening, eight unpleasant men accosted them on the street. They helped the ladies step over them and continued their evening. They saw each and every lady safely home. Dutch borrowed Clete's medunit and went back to cure Frake's eye. \"Here. We used some to show the ladies a good time. Sorry. We looked over the ship. It needs work. Order these parts. We'll start on it tomorrow. Oh, we need you to pay our hotel bill. We also have one piece of equipment we'll be putting on the ship. We'll keep it in our cabin. We're sentimental about it.\" \"Didn't they find you, Dutch?\" \"Who? Oh, them. Yes. We didn't stay with them long. We were afraid we'd be fined for leaving eight large pieces of trash on the sidewalk. There. That should feel much better.\" Frake started to laugh. They were sorry they had used some of the money, were going to fix the ship, didn't need to be paid, and would he take care of their hotel bill. And they'd left 'trash' on the sidewalk. Just a little. Eight pieces. To top it all off they were incredible showmen. Somebody out there liked him. \"Dutch, you boys are amazing.\" \"True. Oh! Almost forgot. We'll be just a little late tomorrow. We're keeping watch on the ladies' hotels tonight and putting them all on their flights home. Won't be at the spaceport until just before noon. Try to get those parts delivered by then. Goodnight.\" Dutch hurried. Lane had said the first attack would come just about an hour after midnight. They probably wouldn't need him, but he hated to miss the fun. He dashed into the hotel and found them. Just in time. \"Four. Armed. Freight lift. I'll go.\" \"Clete, you can't have all the fun.\" \"There are only four, Dutch, and the lift is small.\" \"All right. Enjoy yourself. What's next, Lane?\" \"Three on the stairs. If we want to do anything, we'd better get there before Clete gets done on the lift.\" \"Let's go! He's probably finished.\" \"No. He'll be polite and put them in the trash bin out back.\" \"Good thinking. We'll do the same. Got to keep the hotel tidy. Oh goody. A banister. Let's slide down.\" \"Sounds like fun. About three flights.\" \"Wheeee! Oops. Hope I didn't break him.\" \"My goodness, Dutch. You have the trash all piled by the back door to go out.\" \"Sorry I forgot to leave you some. Help me carry it out anyway?\" \"Certainly. Hi, Clete. Next stop Hotel Caprice. Good, you got their injector. Here's ours. Clete, that isn't nice. You broke them. Oh, well. They didn't really need them.\" The hotel Caprice was a bit busier and the Ranforth more so. They gathered all the ladies for breakfast and walked them to the spaceport. They saw them off and moved Melissa to the show's ship. The parts were just arriving when they walked out of it. \"Good morning, Frake.\" \"I didn't see you boys get here!\" \"We slipped in quietly. Lane and Clete didn't want to be seen this late still in evening wear. Clete, life support; Lane, computers. I'll take the drive. We'll spread the rest around. Frake, have something ready for lunch in about two hours. We had a late breakfast, but I'm going to be hungry. Get clearance for liftoff in... six hours ought to do it. Ship needs a paint job. We'll get one next stop.\" \"Dutch, the repair estimate was forty hours and eight men.\" \"That sounds about right. Liftoff in six.\" Frake watched them for awhile, then fixed them lunch and scheduled liftoff. They'd be done in six hours. \"Where did you boys learn all this stuff, Dutch?\" \"Let's see. Some from our moms, some from our dad, some from our godfather, some at the academy.\" \"Academy?\" \"Would you believe Dutch was a lieutenant?\" \"So were you, Clete.\" \"Yeah, but I didn't figure he'd have any trouble believing Lane and I were, just you.\" \"You were ALL FLEET OFFICERS?!\" \"Easy, Frake. Small room. Hard on the ears. Yeah. Enjoyed it for awhile. Lane decided we should retire early. He missed us.\" \"True, Dutch, I did. I also decided it was time to move you around a bit. You kept running out of women and places to take them.\" \"That and they kept trying to get him to choose between them.\" \"I never did understand that. I gave all of them plenty of attention. Back to work. The drive was in bad shape. Let's see... cargo lifts. Later.\" \"He can't have the drive work done already!\" \"Sure he can, Frake. He kisses the power generators, tells them they're beautiful and they fix themselves up to please him. Lane, you get the dirty job. I'm too big for half the access shafts.\" \"An excuse, Clete, but one I'll accept. Besides, I just got the computers working properly. I'd rather not have you shoulder through a junction and fry them. Cable check it is. I suppose you're going to fix the galley.\" \"It needs it. I'll take care of surface plumbing too. Dutch can get the stuff behind the panels when he gets done with the lifts. He's already dirty from cleaning the exhaust tubes.\" \"Sounds good. I'll pick up command and nav. Later.\" \"Frake, you'll have to move. I'm about to take this place apart and put it back together. You can come back and make tea for us in a couple hours.\" \"Uh... sure, Clete. I think I'll just go to my cabin and sleep. I'm already dreaming.\" \"Frake, if you think we're fast, you should have seen my commander. He once told me Dutch's mom was faster.\" \"You don't have the same mother?\" \"Nope. All different, but they all had the same... first... name. Got it. Frake, I'm about to remove the deckplate you're standing on. Go.\" \"Uh... later.\" There was only one job left to do by the time they had tea, get everything and everyone else aboard. Frake just stood and watched while they took care of that too. Cargo was stowed, cabins assigned, rehearsal schedules handed out. People walked through the corridors with their mouths open. Even the bed in cabin eight had been fixed. He wasn't at all surprised when they took over the bridge and smoothly lifted off. \"Party time! Let's get acquainted. Cargo hold, I think. I'll get everyone.\" \"All right, Dutch. Clete and I will be there as soon as we get comm and nav clear and get her on auto.\" \"The autopilot doesn't work, Lane. Hasn't since before I bought it. Can't be fixed.\" \"That's why I built a new one, Frake. On course. Auto in. See you in the hold, Clete.\" \"Private ship Merriment out. Wait up. I'll go with you. Coming, Frake?\" \"Uh, you go ahead. I'll be there.\" He sat and stared around him at the smoothly-running ship and started to laugh. He wouldn't be paying any more 'protection' money. He had all the protection he needed. Somebody out there liked him. They'd sent him three guardian angels. He didn't know they were looking for a devil in the cargo hold. They returned to their cabin to talk about what they'd found. All of them were angry, but Dutch was furious. \"Traces everywhere. Everywhere but the bridge and Frake's cabin. Not enough to bully him into paying them off, they use him to smuggle drugs too.\" \"I picked up mean and nervous from a couple stagehands, Dutch. Big one with the bald spot and the little one with, well, shifty eyes. One of the women too. The pretty blond.\" \"Damn. Prettiest thing on the ship and she's dirty. Thanks for the warning, Clete. Anything, Lane?\" \"Clete's picked them. Let's see. Access panel nearest the hold. In the music board. The big costume box. Under the bed I'm laying on. We take it to Frake. He gets real sick. He hates drugs. Wants to space whoever brought them on board. We space the drugs. The blonde's got an injector, Dutch. I can't see any way out of it. She's going to hit you with it. Nasty stuff. Addictive.\" \"Easy, Dutch! Easy! It's not bliss! Lane, help! He wants to kill her. Kill all of them.\" \"Dutch, you trance through it! No effect! None! I promise! She's after someone else. You block. She's after the little brunette with the overbite and freckles. A couple others too. You'll stop her.\" \"Better. Still mad, but not killing mad.\" \"Let's collect drugs. I want them off this ship. I want it now. My skin crawls. Get off that bunk, Lane.\" \"No. We have to wait, Dutch. Just a few hours. Go home. In Melissa. Get away from it. Clete, dump him in the spa.\" \"Right, Lane. In he goes.\" \"Put me down, Clete! OW! Duck a little lower ne--\" Lane smiled as Melissa's door cut off Dutch's voice. Helping nice people get rid of a nasty problem was good for all of them. It was especially good for Clete. Helen had become his most beautiful memory, not an open wound. Clete was going to have trouble keeping Dutch from killing. The shifty fellow had an injector too. Lane knew he was his target. Dutch would teach him how to heal himself. Before the night was over, he and Clete would both learn. He drifted off to sleep. It would be how the shifty man would find him. Clete roared in fury and Dutch screamed his as they raced out of Melissa. Lane stopped them from going after the person, who had just cleared the cabin, with a lift of his hand. It was about all he could do, but he managed it. He had to slow Dutch, turn his anger a bit, focus it on himself to prevent a possible future. Clete would feel the need and help. Dutch's biting words told him he'd succeeded avoiding the first path to catastrophe. \"He knew this was coming, Clete. You know he did. I'm going to kill whoever did this.\" \"Dutch. Dutch! DAMMIT! LISTEN TO ME! He didn't tell you because he knew this is what you'd do, fly apart. You're no good to him or anybody else this way. Pull yourself together. This is the reason we go hunting drugs. He told us where. We take him with us. All the way through.\" \"Yeah, with... no... no...killing. Clete, stop him. Shifty man. Stop him. Bad choice. Bad choice.\" \"Dutch! It's what he doesn't want you to do! There's a reason! He let them hit him for a reason. Dutch?\" \"You're probably going to have to remind me several more times. Let's get him up. We're going drug hunting. This… stuff is fast. Let's get him moving. It should help.\" They collected the drugs. They ran into the shifty man coming out of the hold. Clete grabbed Dutch and yelled. \"STAND STILL! Stand very, very still. If you even breathe hard, I won't be able to keep him from killing you. Drop the weapon. Just let it fall. DO AS I TELL YOU! He can move before the beam hits him. Drop it. DAMMIT! I'm trying to save your life! Good. Now the injector. Dutch. Dutch, he's unarmed. Let him go back in the hold. Back up slowly. Very slowly. He's the fastest man alive. You can't get away from him. He'd really like you to try. You're terrified. That's good. You should be. I would be if he wanted to kill me. Dutch, find the drugs. Come on, Dutch. The drugs are more important. He won't move.\" \"I want him to move. Just move. I want to kill him. I want him to move.\" \"He's not going to. Leave him and find the drugs.\" \"Find the drugs, Dutch. We'll trance. Together. Find them. Don't kill. Bad choice.\" \"Lane, I want... All right. If he stands still, I might not kill him. But I want him to move.\" The shifty man stood very still. He had looked death in the face and it was waiting for him to move. He collapsed on the floor and sobbed his relief when they left and locked him in the hold. They took Lane and the drugs to Frake. He became violently ill. Clete shook his head. If anything, Frake hated drugs more than Dutch did. It was why the threat of their use had been such an effective method of coercion. Dutch went hunting the blond. Clete left Lane with Frake and spaced the drugs. He had to find Dutch before he killed her. He almost didn't make it. \"NO, DUTCH! If you hit her, you'll kill her! You haven't got the control to avoid it. You. Merith. Lock her in the cargo hold. It's the only place she'll be safe. She's drugged him and I might be able to stop him. Come back here. I'll try to keep him here til you get back. If you don't get back soon, he'll come hunting. The drug won't stop him. It just makes it easier for him to kill. Easy, Dutch. She's running for the hold.\" Clete struggled against Dutch's anger and hoped Merith returned quickly. She did. \"She opened it and ran in. There was a man in the hold. He begged me to lock it. He saved me. She was going to inject me. He got his hand in front of the injector before--\" \"Easy, Merith, I know. He's fast. Help me get him moving.\" \"I don't... need help. I need... to kill them.\" \"They're locked up.\" \"There's another.\" \"Not yet. He hasn't done anything yet. Come on. You need to help Lane. He needs you. He can't fight it like you can.\" \"You're right. Lane first. Come on.\" Clete gusted a sigh of relief. He'd barely held against Dutch's anger. He leaned against a bulkhead and dealt with his own. Merith watched Dutch move swiftly down the corridor. \"How can he even walk? He should be out of it.\" \"He's... stubborn. He just refuses to let the drug win. You come too. You don't want to be alone.\" \"You're right, I don't. He's coming back with your brother. Where are they going?\" \"To our cabin. Dutch and Lane are going to fight the drug together. I'll take you to-- Frake, where are you going?\" \"Lane said I was to come along and bring the girl to somebody named Melissa.\" \"Damn. I hope he knows what he's doing. Our cabin. Go on in. I'll show you the door to Melissa.\" He led them into Lissa and through to Melissa. He left them sitting on the floor, holding each other and giggling. He wondered again if Lane knew what he was doing. He found them on his bed. He'd looked everywhere else first. He had such a tight hold on himself, he hadn't been able to hunt for them by feel. He'd been about to head for the depths of the ship when he realized his door was open. \"We're waiting for you. You need to learn. Your bed is big enough. Give me your hand.\" \"All right, Dutch. I just hope... Never mind. Dutch took them into trance and they learned. Clete didn't need it so he surfaced almost immediately, but he now knew how. He went out to Merith and Frake and led them to the kitchen. He made cocoa and sat down in the breakfast nook. \"What is this thing?\" \"Our home, Frake, a ship. Her name is Melissa.\" \"This isn't possible.\" \"Merith, if it wasn't possible, it wouldn't exist.\" \"Clete, that's not what I meant. Or maybe it is what I meant. I don't know.\" \"I'd better get more cocoa ready. They'll want some. They'll probably sleep just a few minutes. Dutch is too keyed up to really rest. We need to make some plans.\" \"They'll be under that drug for hours, then screaming withdrawal for several more. I've seen it before. Horrible.\" \"Easy, Frake. They'd almost rid themselves of it when I left them. Dutch was in a hurry. He didn't like it.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"What's not possible? Hi, Merith. Scoot over.\" \"You're not possible!\" \"Yes I am. Clete and Lane say they might not be, but I definitely am. Ah, cocoa. Thanks, Clete.\" \"Lane?\" \"Sleeping. He won't be long. It was different, Clete. Easier. Just sort of broke it apart and made it... nothing. Lots easier than really healing something. I don't think I even really needed the trance. I started as soon as it hit me.\" \"The trance didn't hurt. It gave Lane and me a chance to learn how.\" \"True. So, Frake, what do you think of Melissa?\" \"I'm trying not to.\" Clete and Dutch laughed and soon Merith and Frake joined in. \"I hate missing nice laughter.\" \"Hello, Lane. Why did you tell Frake and Merith to come to Melissa?\" \"Did I? I guess I remembered them being here.\" \"Remembered?\" \"Lane remembers things that haven't happened yet, Merith. Dutch can link our minds together. Me, I'm just an ordinary empath. Dutch, you're making me warm!\" \"Sorry, Clete. I like sitting next to Merith. Let's take our cocoa to the living room. This may be a bit too cozy.\" \"Definitely!\" \"You know, I never knew guardian angels took heaven with them when they were working.\" \"Frake, you have a wonderful sense of humor. No wonder you're a showman.\" \"I lost it for awhile, Dutch. Thank you for helping me find it again.\" \"It's time to spread this operation out. If they were doing it to Frake, they're doing it to others.\" \"Choice. Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"Dutch, why don't you wait until he's sitting down?\" \"It's all right, Clete. I was waiting for it. We've got a straight path until the next choice. Motorcycles! He's decided he wants motorcycles!\" \"Too bad we don't have Dad to ride with us.\" \"We don't need him. It would be fun though. Dutch, we get a list from Frake. Others he thinks are paying. We take both him and Merith with us. We visit a large number. Space a lot of drugs. Dutch, you must not kill anyone. It's going to be hard not to. Especially the man in gray. He's a key to stopping it all, the link to the bosses. And you're going to want him very, very dead. The girl will be all right. We'll get her through. Oh, this is going to be fun. Clete... Oh, my. Yes. A lot of fun.\" \"Lane, what's the 'Clete, oh my?' It makes me nervous when you do that.\" \"Don't worry. You won't have any problem. Dutch and I can put up with our teeth rattling a few days.\" \"A FEW DAYS?!\" \"A sideline they're in. Yes! We learn the magic! Well, some of it. Not quite the way he did it. That's a function of who he is, but someday... Too bad. We should have kept a little to analyze. Cold turkey is hard, but they'll be grateful. That's it. Let's do it.\" \"Dutch, he got excited about magic and 'someday' was a promise.\" \"That doesn't surprise me, Clete. His eyes lit up every time Dad did a bit of magic. What's first, Lane?\" \"Frake's list. Hmm... Oh, I see. Easy. A horse race. No, two. How about that? Real leathers.\" \"Whoa. You're getting really excited, Lane, and Clete's about to start bouncing off walls. Since you'd probably say you hate to spoil fun surprises if I asked for specifics… Yeah, I thought so. All right, let's do this one step at a time. Frake, make us a list of everyone you know, or think you know, is paying protection, especially traveling shows, like yours. Give us their schedules, if you can. How does Merith fit in, Lane?\" \"She's our accountant, Dutch. She's a genius at estimating a house and keeping track of what money belongs to who. She can also figure out exactly what a show needs; costumes, props, equipment. The best little shopper on the net. You made a smart move when you hired her, Frake.\" \"I didn't. She just sort of attached herself to the company. Said she'd always wanted to be in show business. Promised she'd earn her keep. She looked hungry, so I fed her and said all right.\" \"I was hungry. I was also dodging an injector and one of those 'sidelines' this bunch are in.\" \"Why the blond was after you.\" \"Probably, Dutch. If your man in gray is the same as mine, he doesn't take no for an answer.\" \"Now I know why it's going to be hard not to kill him. I really don't like to kill. I haven't killed anyone since... in a very long time.\" \"Dutch, his bosses take care of him. He leads us to them. If he dies, they may get away.\" \"Remind me of that again when the time comes, Lane.\" \"I won't be there. Neither will Clete. You'll have to make the choice on your own.\" \"Here's the list. About fifteen. All I can think of. I guessed on most. Shows with good draw that are getting dilapidated. Barnard's is the worst. His ship is in worse shape than mine was. Nice old boy.\" \"He's first. They've got his niece. We'll get her and take her to him, then make sure his ship gets to where it's going. Dutch, it's going to break down in flight. We'll use Lissa and do a mayday answer. Replicate parts. Clean house for him. We have to let the two in the hold loose. They're our advertisement.\" \"Damn. Let's do it. Let's get Barnard's niece first. Who stays with Melissa?\" \"I do, but I meet you on the ship. We'll have to work fast. It'll take all of us. Yesterday.\" \"Let's move.\" It wasn't far to where Barnard's niece was being held. Clete went into the big house to get her. It didn't take him long to find her. He just followed the path of most resistance. He smiled at the bright-eyed little girl of about seven and squatted down. \"Hello, Jeannie. I'm Clete. Don't be afraid of me. I'm your friend, or I'd like to be. I've come to take you to your uncle. Wouldn't you like to leave here?\" \"Yes. I'm not afraid of you. I think you're here to rescue me.\" \"That's why.\" \"I was really hoping somebody would. They think I'm so dumb I wouldn't figure out why they won't let me go outside. They said they adopted me because Uncle Barnard didn't want me.\" \"They lied to you. They're making him pay lots of money. They told him they'd hurt you if he didn't.\" \"I guessed that, but I've been careful not to let them know. When Mommy and Daddy got killed, Uncle Barnard came and got me. He told me we're all the family we have and we have to stick together. He wouldn't decide he didn't want me. How did you get in? There's lots of not-nice men and Miss Perldick. She's not nice, either.\" \"Come on. I'll show you.\" He took the hand of the very bright young lady and led her through the house. She asked if the men were dead. He told her he didn't kill people if he could help it. They were just napping. They'd looked tired, so he'd tucked them in. She giggled. He led her into Melissa/Lissa and she sat on his lap on the bridge. Lane dropped Lissa free not far from the ship that had just sounded a mayday. \"Private yacht Lissa responding. We're on our way. Barnard, we have the parts you need and a surprise for you. Frake's on board. He'll fill you in.\" \"Your ship is very fast, Clete.\" \"Yes, Jeannie, she's as fast as any other ship in space. My brother Dutch is also a very good pilot.\" \"Uncle Barnard sounded surprised. He likes Mr. Herpith.\" \"You can call me Frake, Jeannie. You're his big surprise. He's been very worried about you.\" \"I've been worried about him too. He needs me to take care of him, so he can take care of everybody else. Clete, where did your other brother go?\" \"He went in the cargo hold, Jeannie.\" \"Come on, Clete. There isn't much time. We've got to get that ship fixed. That drive is bad. Frake, careful what you say about us. Come on, come on, get the hatch open. Hello, Barnard. I'm Dutch. Talk to Frake. I can hear-- Clete! Come on!\" \"I hear it! Bye, Jeannie.\" \"Who was-- Jeannie? JEANNIE!\" \"Hi, Uncle Barnard. Here's a tissue. You're getting the pretty dress Clete gave me all wet. Now stop crying. I'm safe. You haven't been taking care of yourself. You're a mess, but it'll be better now I'm here.\" \"Yes, Jeannie. Much better. Frake, what's going on?\" \"You've just acquired the best guardian angels in the business. Get your people together and keep them out of their way. And I'll tell you what real protection is. This is Merith. Oops. Wait'll they get by. Now, you get going. We'll meet you in your cabin. Questions later. Go!\" Lane ran into engineering with parts they needed now! They worked fast. After a few minutes, they actually had time to talk. \"Think Frake will be careful when he talks to Barnard?\" \"Yes, Clete, I do. Dutch, hand me that spanner. All right. Life support will hobble along until we get the rest of the parts replicated.\" \"I want to get that drive fixed first, Lane. Clete and I barely got it shut down in time. It was about to blow. We cut it a little fine.\" \"We had to wait for the mayday. You'll need an EVA suit. Don't use one of Barnard's. Get one from Lissa.\" \"Tubes fouled. I just knew it. Nasty job to do in space. Easy to hole a suit.\" \"Dutch, hold your breath and speed up your metabolism. Your body won't decompress. Get in within five minutes.\" \"I'm going to hole the suit. I hope you're right. What am I saying? You're always right. I hope.\" \"Clete, you handle the airlock for him. He's going to cut it fine. Override the automatics. Don't wait for it to pressurize. Make sure you tell me about it when you get him in. That's where the memory comes from. Get started now. He'll be ready to go. I'll replicate drive parts. See you on Lissa.\" \"Done.\" Lane got back with the first load of parts just in time to stop the fellow about to take the housing off the number one power generator. \"Don't touch that! Go find the rest of your people and stay with them. We'll show you what we did when we get done. Dutch is going to give you a very thorough lesson in drive maintenance. Get out of the way!\" Lane watched the man head back to the cargo hold. He was a decent mechanic, but not much of an engineer. He'd been out of his depth. As soon as he'd gone, he headed back to the replicator in Lissa. He had both arms full of parts when Clete joined him. \"Lane, he's in. Holed the suit. Held his breath, sped up his metabolism. Close. About five minutes. I overrode autos on the airlock. Popped it as soon as he got the hatch closed. He's hungry. Engineering.\" \"Bring the rest of the parts and food for him. High carbo content. I'm on my way with these.\" Lane found Dutch waiting for the parts he was carrying. When Clete arrived, he tore into the food like a starving man. They rebuilt drive, generators, life support and the galley. Barnard was a pretty good hand at the computers, comm and nav equipment. The bridge was in fair shape. Dutch, however, was steaming. \"You can come out and let your people know they're safe. Send your man to me in engineering. I'm going to have a long talk with him. Lane is sweeping up your ship. We'll space your extraneous cargo. Fire some people when you land. Clete will tell you which ones. He's on the bridge. Later.\" \"Is he always like that, Frake?\" \"No. Dutch is usually pretty friendly. Except when there are drugs involved. Come on, Barnard, Clete's waiting.\" \"And my ship is already repaired?\" \"No, already rebuilt. I told you. Guardian angels.\" Lane convinced Melissa to be inconspicuous and they landed at a racetrack on twentieth century Earth. He replicated a two dollar bill from a numismatic collection Meister had shared and won the exacta, visited another track and placed his winnings on a long shot. He collected, gave the woman from the IRS the government's cut and they went motorcycle shopping. Dutch decided he wanted outfits like the men at the shop were wearing. They told him they'd have to prove themselves. They didn't have any problems. They were careful not to break anyone. Getting the modified Sportsters through Lissa and into Melissa was a problem, so they took them apart. Water conversion to hydrogen fuel would be too obvious in the time they came from, so they changed them over to alcohol fuel and put them away. There was no point reassembling them, until they were needed. They went through Frake's list and Merith shopped. The money they collected for 'protection' returned the next day as ship parts, sets and costumes. Newly protected show owners happily followed instructions. Drugs were spaced and termination slips arranged. Frake and Merith were returned to the Merriment a few minutes after they'd left. It was time to shut down the sidelines. A few moments later, they were on the world and in the city where they would begin. \"This is where you meet the man in gray, Dutch. You'll tell me about it. It's going to be very hard not to kill him. Just remember, he's not going to get away with it. In fact, if you kill him, you'll be doing him a favor.\" \"I'll remember, Lane. What's the agenda?\" \"Clete and I are going to clean house. You're going to clean the streets. Send all the girls to Eight-three Harman Avenue. I'll start the detox program. Clete's going to take care of everything else.\" \"Terrific. I'll be dying from the heat.\" \"You'll be there before things get too warm out. Dutch, the kid comes through fine. We'll get her home. Get your bike and leathers.\" Dutch rode the city streets. The girls were all addicts, scared and abused. They really wanted his protection. After he removed several 'supervisors,' they believed he could give it to them. He sent them to Clete and Lane, nearly thirty of them. He found the man in gray recruiting, with his fists and an injector. \"Get away from her. Do it now. I'm not supposed to kill you. If you use that injector, I may not be able to keep my promise.\" \"I don't know who you are, but you'd better mind your own business. My boys don't like nosy people.\" \"This is my business. I'm Dutch. One of the Gallant boys. Your operation has just been acquired. You've been fired. Get away from that girl.\" \"Get him boys.\" There were only five of them, hulking brutes and slow. Dutch finished with them just as the man in gray injected the girl of about fifteen. She screamed and he slapped her down. It was nearly the last thing he ever did. Dutch held him in the air and looked in his eyes. He was shaking with rage. He wasn't going to be able to keep his promise. Then the girl whimpered. \"Thank her. I don't want her to see me rip your heart out. Say thank you and run. Run fast.\" \"Th...Thank you.\" He set the man on his feet and he ran. Dutch picked up the sobbing child and put her on the bike. He had to strap her to the backrest. She reached out an unsteady hand, touched the tears on his cheek, then passed out. He rode to the house and through the door Lane opened for him. A path had been cleared for him through the litter on the walk. Ten pieces of litter \"Bring her this way. I've got a room just for her.\" \"I found the man in gray, Lane. He beat her and injected her. I didn't finish with his boys fast enough to stop him. I've never wanted to kill anyone like I did him. She stopped me. She didn't need to see what I would have done. If she hadn't been conscious, I couldn't have stopped myself.\" \"I know, Dutch. Even I felt your pain and anger. It was real rough on Clete. Inject her with this, then use the medunit on her. Both will lessen the effect of the drug in her system. She'll sleep through the worst of it. When you're done, find us. The drug they're on has an additive. The girls you sent and the ones who were here have real needs. Detox takes three days. We have nine more cities on five worlds, then we go back to the show. We'll meet the gray man and his bosses on the second world the show hits. You have to not kill him again on the first. It'll be easier. Door at the top of the stairs when you're done here.\" Dutch nodded and went to work on the child. They couldn't 'reverse' the drug, but they could block the addiction. Lane would tell him when she'd awaken. He would be there and he'd get her home. He'd thought he was prepared when he opened the door. \"Whoa! Easy, easy. I'm here to help. Slowly. Help! Lane, I'm being smothered.\" \"They can't help it, Dutch. Clete's on his way. He synthesized something to help with detox.\" \"Damn! I hope he... hurries.\" \"I did. Here use this on them. Don't worry if you lose track. Extra doses won't hurt. Unh. Did you say three days, Lane?\" \"Yes, and nine... cities.\" \"Done.\" Dutch was sitting beside her when the girl awoke. She was shaking and sweating. She grabbed for him, but he held her off. \"It's the drug they gave you. You're almost through. We got a blocking agent into you to prevent the addiction. I can put you back to sleep if you want me to.\" \"No. Oh! Find me something! Something to do!\" \"Can you cook? There are a lot of women here who need food. They're all the way addicted. My brothers and I are... \" \"Busy, I'll bet. I'll cook. It's better if... I think you should show me the kitchen, then go away. I know what the stuff does. I'll fight it. It'll just be easier if you're not close.\" \"I'm Dutch. I'll show you the kitchen. What's your name?\" \"Chrissa. On second thought, you go on. I'll find the kitchen.\" Dutch grinned. She'd be out from under the influence of both drugs in a few hours. He'd take her home as soon as she was. Until then, he'd stay out of the kitchen. Clete was sleeping. He wished he could sleep, but his teeth felt like they were rattling. Clete purred in his sleep. \"Chrissa is cooking for us all. Some of you. Damn! Some of you go help. Bring... ow... easy... food back for us. Clete! Wake up! Go ahead. Wake him.\" \"Oh. Hello. Take a nap, Dutch.\" \"Lane needs one. I'm... fine.\" \"You heard. I need a nap. Clete, stop purring!\" Dutch needed a rest by the time all the women had been fed. Lane told him Crissa was ready to go home and he smiled as he headed for the kitchen. It was exactly the break he wanted. \"Hi, Chrissa. Ready to go home?\" \"Can you get along without a cook?\" \"Yes, the drugs are wearing off. We'll be making coffee and passing out pain killers for the next day-and-a-half.\" \"Dutch, a lot of these girls aren't much older than I am. That man did the same thing to them as he tried to do to me. He likes to beat them up. He deserves what you wanted to do to him.\" \"I know. It will happen, Chrissa. He won't get any more girls. I promise.\" He took her home and was very surprised when she kissed him. She whispered, \"It wasn't all the drug.\" He grinned as she ran in the front door. Her parents were good ones. She was proof of it. She'd called them, as soon as she awakened. Her father stepped out of the door, as he pulled away, quickly. He felt nice, but he already had all the thank-yous he could handle. He rode back to the house and sighed. His teeth were rattling again. It wasn't fun, but Clete found helping the women very pleasurable and his total understanding, including of what the drug did to them how, assured them of their identity as individuals. There was even laughter and shared humor. The purring was an irritation, but he didn't really resent it, nor look forward to the end of it. Clete would share their suffering, just as he did their pleasure and gratitude. Withdrawal wasn't easy for any of them. The women shook and cried and begged for the drug. Clete held the young ones who were terrified. Dutch and Lane did their best to help, but he was their most effective detox agent. Small doses of pain killer were given to the girls he said needed them badly. None of the girls had been addicts before they were recruited with an injector. There would be no relapses among them. Then they moved and started on a new city. When they rode their bikes back to Melissa after finishing that one, Dutch climbed off his and sighed. Clete raised an eyebrow and Lane smiled and nodded. \"What's the matter, Dutch?\" \"I wish they hadn't been quite so grateful, Lane.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm tired of my teeth rattling.\" \"You're just plain tired. We need rest. Leave the bike and hit the spa. Clete can load it. I'd love to see their faces when they find out we busted their sideline on five different planets on the same three days.\" \"Isn't that telling them something we don't want them to know?\" \"Do you want them to believe the man in gray when he tells them he's seen us in the show on one of the same days?\" \"No. You're right. Who'd believe it? Lane, what's wrong? Clete! Help me with him. The couch. Lane?\" \"He's dizzy, Dutch, but not... in trouble.\" \"I'm... all right. It all came back. I can see... forever again. Most of the dross is gone. Just one path again. All the roads not taken... aren't there. I'm fine. Go on. Get some rest. I'll look a bit.\" They spent forty-two days on five worlds, with recovery time between, all on the same three days, then landed Melissa on the Merriment ten minutes after they'd dropped Frake and Merith off. They started rehearsals and were ready when they landed two days later. Another beauty pageant was about to go on. Clete looked up in surprise when Frake walked over to where they were assembling risers. \"Exasperated? You feel like you're growling under your breath.\" \"Good description, Clete. They haven't done any paring down at all.\" \"I thought the place was too crowded. Left it all to you?\" \"I hope you boys don't mind. You and Merith are going to judge the preliminary rounds. We'll never get this thing on otherwise. No real problem. The scoring sheets are simple. This is all talent and personality. Beauty we leave to the judges picked by the sponsors. This is an all human pageant. You'll even know if the music is good. I'm going to visit the circus and have a look around.\" \"Frake you're going to find out they're paying too. Don't mention us. We have to do this one ourselves. It's very nasty. People will get killed if it's not handled exactly right. There are a whole bunch of bad apples in that barrel.\" \"Understood, Lane. I'll stick to my regular routine of 'Hi, we're the other attraction. How are the crowds?' and leave it at that.\" \"Good. We'll do our best here. Later.\" Merith had to remind them everyone wasn't perfect. They finally started giving realistic scores after they'd had to sit through two very bad performances twice. Merith was very fair. If they handed her something unrealistic, she called the entire group of six for a repeat. She was also good at keeping the contestants from trying to influence them. Dutch thought she was a little too good. He didn't really meet anyone. The contestants were grouped by type of performance, but the groups weren't all singers together, then all dancers. Just as they began to get tired of something, the type of performance changed. The 'personality interviews' were intersprersed with them as well. Merith noted there was a great deal more to Frake's job, and Frake, than was apparent on the surface. They all agreed. He'd set it up so what could have been a tedious task was actually pleasant. \"You know, I'm edgy. My teeth feel, well, funny.\" \"Merith, you're sitting too close to Clete. He's purring. Our teeth have been rattling for days.\" \"Purring? I don't understand, Dutch.\" \"Neither do we. He doesn't even know he's doing it. You must have a fairly high psi rating. Most people don't... That's why you're so good at estimating a house and knowing what people need!\" \"How about that? It's good for something after all. Six more, then I'll tabulate. Uh, oh, three of these list their talent as martial arts. I don't know anything about them.\" \"Don't worry. Just watch for gracefulness. We'll judge competency. That we do know.\" They got to the last contestant and things came to an abrupt halt. Lane expected it, but it didn't surprise Dutch when Clete suddenly stood either. \"Damn. Stop! I'm not going to sit here and watch you injure yourself. What's the matter with your sensei?\" \"Clete, calm down. Oh, well, there he goes.\" \"What's he doing, Dutch? I thought she was pretty good.\" \"She's practiced very hard, Merith, but she's practiced wrong. Give him five minutes. She deserves another chance.\" \"Dutch, a judge can't help a contestant. It's not fair.\" \"Lane?\" \"Merith, he couldn't let her go on. She was causing herself pain. We saw it too. She nearly dislocated her shoulder. She'll do something else. Wait'll you hear this, Dutch. You think Clete's purring. Hi, Clete.\" \"Lane, you knew this was coming.\" \"I also knew she wouldn't hurt herself badly before you stopped her. She needed what you showed her or she might have really damaged herself, Clete.\" \"Probably. She took some private lessons, but hasn't started university classes with a new sensei yet and has been practicing on her own. I told her we'd give her a few minutes. She said she'd actually planned on doing something else, but there were so many singers she changed her mind.\" They waited for her to change and warm up. She came back out and started to sing in a clear, sweet, soprano. She sang the words, \"Someday, my prince will come,\" and Dutch moaned in pleasure. She made the finals and a friend. \"Hi. I'm Dutch. You just sang my favorite song.\" \"I'm Sabitha Berke. Sabbi. I didn't think anyone would know it. It's ancient, but I've always loved it.\" \"Mid-twentieth century Disney; Snow White. We've got a complete collection. Clete's even got a perfectly preserved cel. Fantasia's a close second, but Snow White is my favorite.\" \"You're kidding. I thought I was the only person in existence who thought Snow White was the greatest of the classic animations.\" \"It was the first of it's kind. Look, we're done here. I'm no longer a judge. I don't think there's any rule that says we can't have dinner together. Would you be my guest?\" \"I'd like to, but I doubt it would make my mother happy. She worries about me. She didn't want me to do this. She's outside pacing.\" \"Some people have a low opinion of beauty pageants.\" \"Some worlds only have them for females, don't have a university grade-point minimum for entry and prizes are money. We have one for a six-year sports medicine scholarship called the Junior Apollo Pageant that makes the competition in this one look light. I feel sorry for some of those poor boys. Two years ago a pair of mothers got in a fist fight, when the artistic director said one of two in blue needed to change. My mom just thinks it's too much to do right now, but I want that scholarship for doctoral studies. I'm not counting on it, especially after seeing the competition, but it would certainly be nice not to have to scramble to put together a bunch of little ones for tuition.\" \"Dutch, take her mother too. They need you with them. Try not to break anyone.\" \"Right, Lane. That's it. We're having dinner. Is your mother as beautiful as you are?\" \"More. She's why I like Snow White so much, and she looks like her. When she's not worrying about me, she's a lot of fun.\" \"Let's not keep her waiting. She's probably worried already. By the way, I liked your answers to the questions too. Ah, your daughter is right. You are very beautiful. I'm Dutch. I'm your escort for this evening.\" \"Escort?\" \"Yes. Too many nasty people around. You're Snow White. How did you step out of my dreams?\" \"Snow White was a young girl. I'm almost fifty.\" \"I didn't say off the screen. I said out of my dreams. I like my dream women grown up.\" \"Sabbi, we have an escort. My name's Rose.\" \"It would have to be. Wait. Let me think. Oh, yes. I put them... there.\" Sabbi and Rose stared at the red roses he had pulled from the air and handed to them. Dutch loved it. He had spent days working out the math for the pocket of nontime just above his shoulder and stocking it with roses. He was using it for the first time and was delighted with the effect. \"Just a little trick copied from a real master. Took my brothers and me a long time to figure out how he did it. Now, I think dinner, then a show, a little dancing… Oops, I forgot. Sabbi has a curfew. An early evening then. A concert? There's one in the park a few blocks from here.\" \"The Grennert symphony with Braslerc conducting. I'd decided it probably wasn't a good idea for the two of us and was a bit disappointed we'd miss it.\" \"I'm delighted to be able to assure you don't, Rose. I'm in heaven. A beautiful woman on each arm.\" They had a wonderful time at dinner. Rose was a Disney authority. She taught media history at a small arts college in a distant city. Sabbi was a sociology student at the university in the same city. They were walking to the concert when a gang of young thugs attacked them. Dutch was careful. \"Good. I didn't break any of them. Addicts. Injectors in their pockets. I hate drugs, but they seem to be a symptom of societies that haven't reached the rewarding-work-for-all stage. Improvements in drive design will bring the travel time down and in fifty years you'll be part of the Fed and it just won't be. Sabbi, call the authorities. They'll put them in rehab. Maybe it'll take with one or two. Sabbi?\" \"Where did you learn that? How can you move so fast? There were six of them and they were armed.\" \"Martial arts are a family tradition and I got a lot more training when I attended the academy. I move that fast because my father isn't human. They were carrying weapons, but they really don't know how to use them. Now, let's call the authorities and go to the concert.\" Rose laughed and Sabbi made the call. Dutch took them to the concert and escorted them to their hotel. Rose said she didn't have a curfew. She and Dutch were dancing in the hotel lounge when Lane walked through the doors. He met them at their table. \"You were right, they needed me. Rose, this is my brother, Lane.\" \"Hi, Rose. I'm sorry to end your evening, but we need Dutch.\" \"I know someone who's expecting trouble when I see one. Thank you, Dutch. It was a nice evening.\" \"I enjoyed it immensely. Don't wait outside tomorrow. Come in. I'll see you to your room.\" \"No, I think I'll stay here awhile.\" \"Lane?\" \"She'll be fine. Trouble is other places. Goodnight, Rose. I'll wait, Dutch. Don't be long. We've got a time limit.\" Dutch said goodnight and followed Lane. He caught up with him a few steps down the back stairs of the hotel. \"What's up?\" \"Men with injectors in hotels, with weapons at the theater, sabotage at the circus. A very busy night. Clete is going to get hurt. So am I. Melissa is in the basement. We have to be several places at nearly the same time. There's just enough difference to make it seem possible. This is why we needed to learn the healing technique. Don't worry when we're under for a long time. We come through.\" \"I don't like it.\" \"I won't either. It's going to hurt. I muscled in on the circus earlier. Clete located a dozen roustabouts who needed firing and two performers who are addicts. One of the owners was the dealer. I bought him out. The other two owners were delighted. First stop Radmort Suites.\" They cleared five hotels, then removed six men at the circus. They repaired damaged equipment intended to injure performers and got rid of poisoned feed intended to kill animals. Lane put a hand out to stop them just before they went back into the theater where the pageant was being held. \"This is where things get rough, Dutch. These guys are different. They're pros and they're after us. I don't know how many you have to take alone after Clete and I go down. We get nine together. I sent everyone else away. Get ready. Clete, backstage. I'll take the balcony. Dutch, house. Go!\" Dutch ducked the beam and went after its source. He found him and went after the next. He heard firing on the stage and in the balcony. He started counting. When he got to eight, he felt Clete get hit. At nine, Lane. He took out the tenth and got wary. Everyone left would be looking for him. The tenth man had made a lot of noise. He decided he was in a hurry. He made himself a target. At least five more. He quit being careful with them. He took out four and listened. Nothing. He made himself a target again and someone nearly hit it. Three had fired at him. He found two of them. He heard a door slam and wondered if one had left. He decided it was a trick. He was right. He broke one of the two who had set up a crossfire near Clete. He checked him. He was in trance. He found the last man near Lane. He actually didn't mean to drop him from the balcony. Lane was in trance too. He carried him into Melissa, then got Clete. He put Melissa in flight and wondered where the coordinates Lane had set would take them. He was delighted when she landed at one of their favorite places to fish. He waited for them to come out of trance. It was a full day before Clete smiled at him, drank the water he held for him then went to sleep. Lane did the same about two hours later. Dutch breathed a sigh of relief and went fishing. They'd be hungry when they woke up. He spent about as much time checking on the two of them as he did fishing and kept a mental 'hand' on them the rest of the time, but he had plenty to cook when he built the fire and started frying them. Clete walked out of Melissa as he was cooking the last pan of fillets. \"Mmm. Bass. Enough for three?\" \"Actually, enough for five, Clete. I figured you'd be hungry. I'll bring these in when they're done. Fix something to go with them. I can feel Lane's about to wake up too. I'm sure bass, pan-fried over an open fire, was what he had in mind for breakfast. He's awake.\" \"You've been using a lot of energy monitoring us. Have you slept at all?\" \"Well... \" \"I thought not. Food then bed. I'll finish here. Lane will know. He'll be in the kitchen. Go find him.\" Clete was right. Lane was in the kitchen and had obviously made preparations before they went to find trouble. Dutch followed his nose. \"Eat. The bass will be here before you finish your salad. Fried potatoes coming up. You're out on your feet. You've barely slept in five days.\" \"I guess it has been five days. Didn't realize. Got in a couple hours when I got too groggy working on the math for my pocket. Then I played with it. After that we got busy. No wonder I'm tired.\" \"Bass.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Mmm, hungry too. Hey, you guys are the ones who were hurt. I'm supposed to be taking care of you.\" \"You already did. It's our turn. Clete, get him a hot bath ready. I'll have our plates fixed when you get back.\" \"A bath sounds good.\" \"Dutch, we need recuperation time. We're going to spend ten days here, then go back and clear the theater.\" \"You said you didn't know how many there were.\" \"I don't. Actually, I should have said you and Clete are going to clear the theater. I'm going to disarm the bomb under the stage.\" \"Lane, those people really don't like us.\" \"I know. Ain't it great?\" Dutch laughed, finished his meal and headed for his bath. Clete and Lane ate, then gently lifted him out of the water and tucked him in bed. He didn't awaken. They spent ten days recovering their strength and speed. They weren't quite in peak form, but Lane said they would be before they needed to be. They traveled back to the theater and he went to disarm the bomb. He didn't learn how many men had been left, but Clete did. They had taken nine together. Dutch had gotten the other ten alone and he'd only broken three of them. They left them stacked on the sidewalk with their broken weapons nearby. Dutch called the police and lodged a litter complaint. There were piles of trash in front of hotels, a theater, even in front of the civic arena. They spent the night working on creating and stocking pockets. It had taken them years to figure out their father's trick with the roses. They'd learned a great deal in the process, especially Clete. They'd all put on muscle too. Clete enjoyed math most with a barbell in his hands. Their father had put a reader above the weight bench when he'd complained he didn't have time for both lifting and math, and he'd been combining them ever since. Arguing they could work on the math with him without the barbells didn't work. Dutch had given up trying to change Lane's memory that it never would, while they were still in the academy. They wondered how long it would be before they could throw things into the air and have doves appear, or create showers of flower petals, or tap things into existence. Lane grinned and said awhile, but pulling a rose from the air for every lady escorted would make a nice addition to the show the next night. Frake found them putting the risers in place in the morning. \"Hi, boys. I have a little surprise for you. I had the programs printed up. I hope you like them.\" \"Featuring the Gallants as escorts. How about that? We're featured. Thanks, Frake.\" \"You're the best part of our show, Dutch. I wanted to tell you so. Where it counts.\" \"We'll costume appropriately. All right! You've expanded the show! I've got to find a horse. Later.\" \"A horse?\" \"Don't worry Frake. It'll be great. Merith chose the finalists for your featured performances, didn't she?\" \"Yes, Lane. She said Clete was impressed with the martial arts one. The other four were strictly her choice. Dancer, singer, dramatic reading, and musician. Said they were too good not to use. I need to get ready before the local crew arrive to open the ticket booth and the lobby lounge. My idea of how much is too much and that of bartenders don't always match. See you onstage.\" \"What's up, Lane? I like to know what I'm anticipating with relish.\" \"Well, tonight we costume as fairytale princes. Dutch is going to borrow a white horse from the circus.\" \"And?\" \"Clete, do you really want me to tell you who's going to win?\" \"No, it would be too hard to hold nervous hands and feel them hoping if I know they won't win.\" Dutch wasn't gone long. Lane and Clete were just putting the last riser in place. \"I found one and he's a beauty. Perfect. I know what to wear tonight too. I hope we've got a pattern.\" \"We don't, Dutch, but I'll go get us one. I'll see you in eight days and be back in ten minutes. I'll store a lot of costume patterns. We'll need them eventually.\" Lane knew where he had to go. Only one place would have everything, Earth in the twentieth century. He spent three nights and a morning there; one night in the wardrobe at Disneyland and the others at Universal Studios and Paramount. He copied only two women's costumes. He spent the morning at the floral market in Amsterdam. He spent the return trip storing flowers in nontime. He found Dutch and Clete reassembling the light bank, but they were nearly done. Clete growled his hello. \"I know, Clete, I need a nap. I've got real roses. Interested? I'll show you where I put them and tell you what I've got in mind.\" \"Clete, let's get this together quick. He's about asleep on his feet.\" \"Dutch, if you two don't quit abusing yourselves, we're never going to get back in top form. Lane says we're going to compete next stop. I'd like us to be ready.\" \"We'll be ready if it takes a month. There. Let's go. I want roses that are dew-touched and real.\" Lane showed them the flowers and gave Dutch the codes for the women's costumes. He'd know what to do with them. He laughed when Clete scooped him up, carried him to his room and dropped him on his bed. He'd forgotten it was going to happen. He'd had other things on his mind, like keeping Dutch from going after the gray man when he saw him in the audience. Sabbi just stared at Dutch with her mouth open. Rose laughed in delight. They both recognized the two garments he held. \"The song needed the costume, Sabbi. A lot more people than you realize will recognize it.\" \"Oh, Dutch, thank you! They're wonderful!\" \"I didn't do it. I'm just delivery boy. You have to thank Lane. He put a lot of work into getting them for you.\" \"Where is he?\" \"Asleep. Clete tossed him in bed.\" \"Did he spend all night getting these?\" \"More than all night. Those are the real Disney. The same ones they used at the Disney parks on Earth. He didn't tell me how he got them. Well, the pattern was of the real thing. The gown may be old-fashioned, but it's fairytale princess beautiful.\" \"Dutch, make sure I see him before the show. I want to give him a big kiss.\" \"He'll find you for that. You can bet on it.\" He did. He also told her to make sure to listen for her music and be ready to sing any time she heard it. He was a bit dazed. He had known he would be, but reality was much more intense. He suddenly decided he wanted to make a change. He was about wobbling by the time he found his brothers. \"Dutch, I want to ride the horse. Would you let me?\" \"Oh, boy. Clete, do you feel what I see?\" \"Uh, huh. This is a change. He's nervous about your answer. Doesn't know what you'll say.\" \"I say yes. Whoa!\" \"Nice catch, Dutch. Let's get him over there where he won't get dirty.\" \"Damn. It shouldn't have been that big a change, Clete. What did it do?\" \"Made him incredibly happy. Dutch, our brother's in love.\" \"I'm glad it's her mother I'm interested in. This could have been awkward.\" \"It still will be. I'm quite a bit older. Dutch, thank you. It doesn't change things on our current project, but it makes my future a lot richer. I'm going to marry her.\" \"What's the sadness?\" \"We won't have any children, Clete. Not of our own. She'll have hundreds to love. She's going to do exactly what she said she wanted to do.\" \"Build a place for unwanted children.\" \"Yes, Dutch, we help her. I won't see her enough for me, but a lot of time for her. At least, if nothing changes.\" \"Lane, changes we make other places shouldn't have any effect on her. You see her life. You're in it. We'll keep you from getting killed. You'll be there and so will she.\" \"Thank you, I... I was--\" \"Afraid of change. We'll watch over her. What? What is it?\" \"Clete... later. I'll ask later. I see it. I'll know. Sometimes I get in a hurry. I want it before its time.\" \"You missed this one, Lane. The answer is yes. When the time is right, we'll take Sabbi the son Helen found a way to give me. All you see is asking me when you're ready.\" \"How did you know?\" \"I suddenly realized there would be a place for him. We can't give him one. Now, since we've got her future all planned, don't you think we should get to work on her present?\" Things went smoothly until Dutch saw the gray man. He stood at the front of the stage dressed as a fairytale prince and looked like the hunter he was. Heads turned to see his prey. The gray man saw people looking at him and left quickly. Clete and Lane kept Dutch from following him. It wasn't easy. The incident had a strange effect. It should have made the crowd nervous, made the show tense. It didn't. When the gray man left, the audience stood and cheered. They didn't have any trouble telling heroes from villains. Sabbi's song brought a thunderous ovation. Dutch wondered why Lane hadn't ridden the horse. He suddenly realized why when he saw him talking to the orchestra conductor and smiled. Sabbi would sing again. The production numbers went well and all the performers were wonderful. The girls made their final costume change and the formal presentation in the ball gown competition began. The crowd went wild when roses were plucked from the air and given to each contestant. The presentation ended with the curtsy and the audience roared its approval. Dutch smiled and winked at Rose in the front row. Sabbi's very old-fashioned costume had brought gasps of recognition and whispers throughout the theater. The world was a bit 'arts crazy' in general and media history was a popular hobby. Two of the judges had recognized it, too. The runners-up were named and Clete and Dutch grinned at Lane. He looked like a runner in a race, waiting for the starting gun. Merith was holding the beautiful white horse in the wings and the orchestra conductor whispered instructions. They all knew. It had become obvious to everyone but her. Frake opened the envelope and called out, \"And the winner of the twenty-fifth annual Woman of Our Dreams Pageant is... Sabitha Berke!\" She looked stunned. Frake escorted her to center stage and the previous year's winner crowned her. Clete draped the sash and Dutch fastened the cape. Lane dropped down on one knee before her. There was a flash of light and he held a bouquet of eighteen, dew-fresh, long-stemmed, red roses up to her. He rose and laid them in her arms and they bowed her onto the runway. When she reached the end of it, the orchestra segued into her song. A hush fell over the audience and they watched. Lane rode out onto the runway on the magnificent white horse and lifted his beautiful baritone voice in duet. She turned, saw him, and watched him dismount \"I'm here, if you'll have me.\" He took her in his arms and kissed her. He lifted her onto the saddle and mounted. The crowd went crazy. They rode back to center stage and the other contestants showered them with their flowers. Sabbi settled into Lane's arms and leaned against his chest. Her prince had come. Dutch leapt off the stage, bowed, and offered Rose his arm. He escorted her to the stage and Clete bowed and offered his. Dutch grinned at Clete. \"Since it looks like we're going to be family, why don't you come to dinner in our home tonight?\" Frake cued a spotlight on Sabbi and Lane and brought the stage lights down. The conductor led the orchestra into a soft reprise of her song and the audience began to sing. At first, a soft voice here and there, but soon, a chorus that filled the theater with song and eyes with tears. No one would ever forget the night they saw a fairytale come true. Clete shook his head when Dutch escorted Rose into the kitchen after giving her a tour of Melissa. He'd have known what the headshake meant even if Rose hadn't voiced it as soon as she sat down. \"You do know this isn't possible?\" \"Why does everyone I bring home say that? It's possible or it wouldn't exist, Rose. It's just based on some very complicated physics. It's a dimensional matrix.\" \"Dutch, who are you? Who is my daughter so suddenly in love with? What are you doing with this show?\" \"We're half-brothers. We all have the same father. Gallant, Knight Hero. He's not human. The ship is his creation. We have been accepted as the defenders of life in this universe. Clete is Sir Pericles Buchannon, Knight Guardian. I'm Sir Roberrin Duchelle, Knight Champion. Lane is Sir Apollo Avelaine, Knight Judge. He's the son of two good and powerful beings. He sees the future. We're here to end a very nasty ring of extortion, forced prostitution and drug smuggling. This group of worlds can't become part of the Fed until that's done.\" \"The man tonight?\" \"I was just a bit too late to stop him from beating up a fifteen-year-old girl and injecting her with drugs. He was recruiting. We got her through it. I didn't kill him because Lane said he'll lead us to the bosses.\" \"But you wanted to.\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Good.\" \"Rose, you surprise me.\" \"My husband was a police officer, a detective. Five years ago he stumbled across something really evil. He was murdered on our doorstep. Overdosed with drugs. I didn't see the killer's face, but he wore gray. Now, how do you three cause enough trouble to break up something the size of what he found? It covered most of the unaligned planets in this sector.\" \"By being several places at once. You're in a ship that travels in time and space. Sabbi won't be alone most of the time.\" \"She's very young, Dutch.\" \"Lane knows. It's one of the first things he said. He's patient. He really does see the future. Remembers it.\" \"Why didn't he know about Sabbi before?\" \"You ask hard questions. We change the future. We make choices.\" \"Tell her true, Dutch. You change the future. Lane didn't know about Sabbi until you changed the future. You told him he could ride the horse.\" \"Thanks, Clete, you're a big help.\" \"Rose, each of us brings something to what we are. Lane is the investigator, the inquiring mind. I'm an empath, the feeling and the, might as well say it, passion. Dutch is the driving force, the will. Together, we make a pretty powerful team. We've chosen to make ourselves into a force for good.\" \"And who decides what good is?\" \"You're right, Dutch, she does ask hard questions. He had to earn it first, but Dutch was given the right and responsibility to decide. Don't ask by who. This one you have to take on faith, just as we did. Now, let's have supper. We've had to give this explanation too many times. You deserved it, so we did it again.\" \"Where are Sabbi and Lane?\" \"In his apartments. I'd say she's getting the same explanation you are. Come on, Rose, relax. You trust us in general. Trust Lane. He really is her prince.\" \"How old is he?\" \"Twenty-eight. Give or take a few million years and a universe or two.\" \"That answer was not reassuring.\" \"It wasn't meant to be. Rose, she loves him. He's worthy of it. That's enough. Now, let's eat. I'm starving.\" Clete didn't quite know what to do about her. She was still worried and nervous. Sabbi and Lane solved the problem. They walked in hand-in-hand and so obviously in love, she melted. All her reservations evaporated. Her daughter was happy. It was enough. The little kitchen nook became warm and cozy and they became family. Things even smoothed enough for Rose and Dutch to take notice of their mutual attraction again. Yes, warm and cozy. \"Clete!\" \"What? What did I do? Oh. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens when I feel content. I really can't do anything about it, Dutch.\" \"What's he mean? What's he doing?\" \"Rattling my teeth, Sabbi. He's purring!\"",

      "content": "Chapter Five A vacation on a lovely Fed planet was a nice surprise, but Clete knew Lane was right about it turning into work and they weren't in good condition yet. He glanced over at Dutch and grabbed a shirt. \"Dutch, you're turning pink. You didn't use screen again. Put this on.\" \"Uh, oh. Thanks, Clete. I didn't expect to be in the sun this much or I'd have remembered.\" \"Sure you would.\" \"Lane's over there someplace.\" \"Yeah, and very relaxed, near somnolent. At least he'll have screen with him. That shirt's too big. We're still underweight.\" \"Muscle mass takes time to rebuild.\" \"I know. I'm worried about how much time we'll have. There's something wrong here. A nervous undercurrent. Tense. That ought to wake Lane up. Thought so.\" \"What did you do?\" \"Decided we go on a full ten-day training schedule tomorrow.\" \"Oh, Clete! We're supposed to be on vacation!\" \"Lane said it was going to turn into work. It just did. Ten/five/ten run. Dawn tomorrow. Dutch, I really believe it's necessary. I doubt we'll get in the full ten days. Feel like doing a few katas?\" \"No, but I will. Odds on how long before Lane shows up?\" \"I can feel how close he is. Tai chi. Begin.\" \"You knew I was coming. You could have waited for me.\" \"Get in line, Lane. Too fast, Dutch. From the beginning.\" Clete moved them into the shade. They could cure sunburn, but avoiding it was always first choice. He seldom forgot sunscreen and Lane would be severely teased if he did, but Dutch never seemed to remember it. By the time they finished three hours of what should have been light exercise, they knew they were in worse condition than they'd realized. Clete designed a diet for them. They'd been starved. They had used some of their body mass to stay alive. Dutch added a bit to their schedule, a meditation routine. He wanted to see if they could increase their ability to distance their minds from their bodies. If they could, they would never go through the kind of pain they had suffered again. He nearly gave up the idea in panic when Lane went under and he spent an hour trying to bring him back, but both Lane and Clete believed they should go on. They trained their bodies and began to learn to control them to the deepest physiological function. An 'accident' taught them how well they'd learned. \"DUTCH! Lane! Come on! He's hurt!\" Lane followed Clete into the sea. Dutch was in real trouble. How had he missed it? Why hadn't he seen it? The sudden shift in current had pulled Dutch against the wreck he had been exploring. His snorkeling partner was struggling to free him from the entangling weeds. Riss was hanging on against the panic she felt as she swam in the cloud of blood at his side. She swam to the surface and took him a lung full of air. Then started working to free him again. Suddenly his brothers were there. She got him another lung full of air and he smiled and motioned her up. They brought him up and began floating him to shore. Clete felt her fear and pulled her in. \"He'll be all right, Riss. He's in a state of trance. It slows his metabolism and reduces the blood loss. You saved his life. You did well.\" \"Oh, Clete, it came so sudden. It pushed him into the wreck and tangled him in weeds. I didn't have anything to cut him loose with and there was so much blood and I just--\" \"Easy, easy. It looked like a lot of blood because it dispersed so fast. He's not hurt as bad as you think he is.\" \"Clete, I know how bad it is. It was the first thing I checked.\" \"Riss... Oh, damn. We're not human, or not completely anyway. We're half something else.\" \"I know. He has two hearts. I like the double beat.\" \"Well, we've been learning to control our bodies. Dutch is the best. He's healing already. Go look.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"Clete, what did you tell her? Damn! Clete, she's right. It's not possible. The wound's closing. Healing as I watch it. In... twenty minutes it'll be gone.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"Come on. Let's get him above the tide line.\" \"Hello. Thanks, Riss. You saved... Why are you all staring at me?\" \"We're going to move you into the shade, Dutch. Go back into trance and finish healing yourself.\" \"What are you talking about, Clete?\" \"Just go back under. We'll talk about it when you wake up. Lane, I'm going to buy Riss and I a drink. We'll be back. Come on, Riss. You look like you need one as bad as I do. Hot cocoa with something minty.\" \"I'm with you.\" Lane watched them walk off and smiled. Clete didn't need a drink, but he must have thought Riss did, or at least that she needed the walk and something warm. Somehow Dutch had learned to put himself in a healing trance. The injury wasn't really bad, not much more than a nasty gash. The entangling weeds, blood loss and shock had been the real danger. He worked to get rid of the guilt he had missed the incident in his memory and put it in perspective. They had learned something invaluable from it and that was what was most important. Dutch came out of his trance after a very few minutes, looked at his side, grinned at Lane and went to sleep. Lane noted the sleep. It told him the healing trance required an energy expenditure. Normal trance conserved energy and revitalized. He had timed the trance. He would time the sleep. If it was about equal, they could assume at least Dutch had inherited another of their father's physical attributes. He thought about missing the memory of the incident and wondered if he hadn't been intended to. The fact he hadn't become dizzy... Clete looked slightly disgusted when they came back. He hadn't been extremely successful getting rid of the guilt. \"How is he?\" \"Asleep, Clete. Just grinned at me and went to sleep.\" \"Oh, I see.\" \"Well I don't.\" \"Riss, I can't explain it, but what he did made him tired.\" \"What are you besides human? Your blood's red. You look like us. That's not extremely unusual, but this is.\" \"Our father is... Well, he's from an older species, more physically advanced. He thinks most of his people are boring. Spends most of his time with humans. Prefers their company. Spent several years with Clete's mom.\" \"Lane, are you telling me you had a different mother than Clete?\" \"Oh, I'd say she was different. Wouldn't you, Clete?\" \"Very.\" \"The longer I'm around you guys, the more confused I get.\" Dutch lifted himself to his elbows and smiled. \"That's why you're with me. I'm a much simpler person.\" He looked from his two brothers to the pert little brunette he really liked and wondered why they were all laughing. They continued with the meditation routine and began to notice it was having more effects on them than expected. Lane answered the question in Dutch's eyes when he sat down across the counter from him in the kitchen. \"We're changing. Our temperatures are lower. Our resting pulse rates are slower. Our entire metabolisms have slowed.\" \"I get cold easily, Lane. I had to come back to Melissa for a sweater last night.\" \"You can speed up your metabolism to compensate, Dutch, probably to a much higher rate. With sufficient fuel, you'd probably barely notice sub-zero.\" \"I'm not sure I like it.\" \"Remember how easily Dad got chilled? We'd be broiling and he'd be wearing a jacket. Well, that's about where we are. Not quite that extreme, but moving that direction.\" \"I don't understand about you, Lane. We're half human. You're not. Why are you... Why weren't you like this before?\" \"You, Dutch.\" \"Duh.\" \"I spent my entire childhood waiting for you. Wanting to be with you. Wanting to be... more than just your half-brother.\" \"I never think of you that way. I never have.\" \"I know. Just goes to show how tight the bond of our father's heritage is. You didn't think of us as half-brothers from the moment you met Dad.\" \"Maybe more than even just brothers, the triplets everyone thought we were.\" \"Aren't we? Aren't we one who became three?\" \"Or are we three becoming one?\" \"Does it matter? Would you change it?\" \"What a silly question. And I can't say I mind becoming more like Dad either. In fact, I've decided I'm going to be rather smug about it.\" \"You look even more like him than we do, Goldilocks. Let's find Clete. I've remembered something.\" They found Clete, relieved him of his barbell, and pushed him toward the spa. He had regained nearly all the mass he'd lost and he pulled both of them in with him. He was pleased with the success of the training program and their timing was, if anything, better. They laughed and played a bit, then settled into quiet relaxation. Lane began to tell them of the images and the change that was needed. \"The current that caught Dutch is a fairly common occurrence. Ten years ago it was an occasional one; twenty, nonexistent. The entangling weeds weren't a result of the current. They caused it.\" \"I felt it! I didn't recognize it, but when I was trying to free him, I was feeling an... anger that wasn't my own. It wasn't focused. Just a formless anger.\" \"That's right, Clete, a formless anger. It's growing stronger.\" \"Lane, there's… evil here. Deep and ugly. A cold malevolence. A power of destruction. Strongest near the sea. I want to do something about it.\" \"That's the decision that gave me memories, Dutch. We find an island. It's in the southern ocean. It's the source of the hate. We feel the malevolence. It's not natural to this world. The island is volcanic. It hasn't been active for thousands of years. That changes abruptly.\" \"And?\" \"That's it, Dutch.\" \"All right, we know what you mean. How do we get to the island?\" \"By boat.\" \"I want to take Melissa.\" \"Changing. No good.\" \"I think we should start at the beginning. Twenty years ago.\" \"Good idea, Clete. Well, Lane?\" \"Changing. No. Same result.\" \"That's it then. We don't go to the island.\" \"What?\" \"The island's a trap. We refuse to spring it. We battle from here. We mock it in our thoughts and-- Well, we know it changes things. Let's get him out of the water.\" \"Dutch it's not the same! He's not unfocused! He's not there!\" Dutch grabbed Clete's mind with his and began the search for Lane. He poured his love and Clete's, their desperate need to find the one who was more than brother, into it. He felt an echo and found another who searched. He felt strength pour into his call. He smiled as he recognized the mind that searched with them. Another joined, gathered into the search by love and need. They found him and battle was joined. Power fought power. Love and life battled hate and death. Fought for Lane, for his spirit. They were losing until a will refused to lose. Refused to be defeated. Refused to allow it. Dutch found his own 'stubborn streak'. He would not allow it! He would not let Lane be taken from him! Clete added his passion. The fire of his spirit. The driving need for Lane in his life. His rage at his being taken. It burned through the channel the searching minds had created and became relentless. That which had taken Lane began to fear. Love, will and rage were forged into a weapon guided by Dutch's hand. A burning sword of power. Suddenly, Lane was with them, fighting with them to free himself. That which had held him fled into the darkness, mocked by their love and joy. The strange union began to dissolve. The dissolution was gently tinged with sadness. Two had touched one they had thought to touch no more. Clete wept for the poignancy of their partings. Dutch gathered his brothers and returned them to themselves. Lane softly whispered, \"Mother,\" in their minds. \"I'd say that changed things.\" \"Clete, you have an absolute gift for understatement. Lane, are you all right?\" \"I... Yes. No. I'm not sure. I feel... unreal.\" \"No.\" Clete reached out and pulled Lane to him. Wrapped him in his arms and held him. Dutch was a bit surprised, but trusted Clete's instincts. He joined in the embrace and they held him between them. Lane began to laugh. \"I know I'm real now. I'm being squished.\" Clete and Dutch joined in his laughter, but they didn't let him go, not for quite some time. They needed to feel he was real as much as he did. He didn't know something was odd until the next morning. After two days, he knew he had to share his worry. \"Dutch, the images are gone.\" \"Which images?\" \"My memories of the future. They're gone. That's why I felt unreal. I catch glimpses of near events. I know Clete is about to walk through that door, but nothing else.\" \"Sit down, Clete. Explain.\" \"I can't. When we decided to take on a task, I'd see an abrupt end if something happened to us. As soon as we found a solution, the future became myriad possibilities. The possibilities increased with every change we made. I started with one for my life. It became several when Dad didn't send me away. They became many. The many became myriad. Now they're gone. I'm useless to us.\" \"That's ridiculous! Don't ever say it again!\" \"I'm sorry, Clete. It's how I feel.\" \"I think it's ridiculous too, Lane. You knew Clete was coming in.\" \"Like I said. Near. Nothing that leads beyond the next moment. No memories beyond.\" \"Limbo. We all are.\" \"Your turn, Clete. Explain.\" \"We haven't made any plans. We haven't made any decisions. We haven't made any choices. Too delighted to have Lane with us to think beyond the moment. You're the key, Dutch. Have you made any decisions?\" \"No. You're right. I've just been existing. Something took Lane right out of Melissa. It shouldn't have been able to do that. I haven't wanted to make any decisions. It happened when I made a change.\" \"You're afraid. You don't want him to have memories. You don't want the power to put him into... well, under the influence of his changing memories. You're afraid it'll happen again. Dutch, you can't hold your breath forever. Choice is a function of who you are, of what we are together. If you refuse to make choices, you cripple yourself and suspend him in limbo.\" \"I need time.\" \"No, you need to pull yourself together now. We don't have to ride out to battle, but you must choose to do something. Even doing nothing is a choice. It just leads to nothing. If we do nothing, the enemy has won. Entropy defeats us.\" \"I don't know what to choose.\" \"Choose to face your fear. It isn't of dying. It's of losing us. What we have. What we are. Choose!\" \"I... choose to strengthen us. To learn more about us. To make what happened impossible.\" \"Yes. Yes! It's not the same, but it's there. A future. Not far. No splitting. To the point of another time of choice. Thank you.\" \"What's the first step, Dutch?\" \"We've learned to use your passion and my will. Lane is our weak link. We have to learn to use his intellect. Blend your passion and my will to the use of his reason. Bring him fully in. I think the key is his insatiable curiosity.\" \"I'm lost. I don't think I'm that curious.\" Dutch smiled and Clete burst into laughter. He really was \"lost.\" He just didn't see it. \"Lane, you're so curious, you've found a way to see the future.\" \"I was born with that, Clete. It's just there.\" \"Clete was always passionate. Probably gave hugs that bruised when he was two. I'm so stubborn, my mother said I reminded her of her Dutch grandfather. He refused to give up and spent five years in a crippled spaceship living on food concentrate and recycled water and air. He'd plotted his course and knew eventually he'd tumble through a space lane. He thought it would take twelve. Dutch isn't from Duchelle. It's for him. I had it by the time I was a year old.\" \"But my sisters see the future too.\" \"One future. Unchanging. You say they're quite happy that way. Would you be?\" \"I can answer that. You wouldn't. You get excited every time you anticipate a change, Lane. You can't wait to find out what happens. Like a kid at Christmas. Near breathless with anticipation.\" \"Am I really?\" \"Yes. You're surprised. You've always thought of yourself as rather cool and reserved. Almost envied Dutch and I our... drive. That's the best word I can come up with. Lane, you're about as cool as a stable star. Your reserve is stability. Nothing else. You can't resist a puzzle or a mystery. And... behind it all you may be a freer, wilder, spirit than either of us. You have no reserve when it comes to learning the truth of things. I agree with you, Dutch, insatiable curiosity.\" \"That's our key. Now all we have to do is figure out what to use it on. The lock it fits. I think we... Let's start with meditation and Melissa. She's a mystery. So are we.\" \"You just got him excited, Dutch.\" \"Good. We're on our way.\" Five days later, they were ready to begin working on the 'anger' again. They had already won the real battle. They knew it. \"Can you feel the difference, Clete?\" \"Yes, it's weaker. Still malevolent. Still angry. But weaker. Why, Dutch?\" \"Well, Lane? A mystery?\" \"Not really.

We unplugged it from the wall. Eventually, it would run down.\" \"How eventually?\" \"A very long time, Dutch. A lot of wrecks, drownings and fear long time.\" \"So we still need to take it out.\" \"Yes. It doesn't belong here.\" \"I pity it.\" \"Explain that statement, Clete.\" \"It doesn't belong anywhere, Dutch. It's not needed, not wanted and it has no home. I'll destroy it, but I'll pity it.\" \"Your pity and compassion are the greatest weapons in our arsenal, Clete. It has neither. We have an island to find. In Lissa. Melissa stays here. You know, she's not happy with her current shape. We should move her.\" \"Suggestions, Lane.\" \"Put her where she can be either of the two shapes she likes, Dutch. The spaceport or the carnival.\" \"Let's take her to the carnival.\" \"Whoa! Changes! Oh my. That was a good choice. We really are going to have fun when we get back. If we get back.\" \"You know, Clete, it doesn't even bother me any more when he says that.\" \"Says what, Dutch?\" \"If.\" Lane coaxed Melissa into being Lissa at the spaceport to drop her, then let her be her favorite shape at the carnival. They hung a closed sign on her and ran the fifteen K back to the spaceport, Clete's idea. The port manager muttered about idiot computers that lost landing records when the ship on pad three asked for clearance for liftoff. They flew to the island and landed. The volcano began to smoke. \"Is it in the volcano, Lane?\" \"No, not really. We climb it to see and it erupts.\" \"I don't like that. An eruption would cause tremendous damage along the shoreline for thousands of kilometers.\" \"Not to mention giving us very hot feet.\" Clete grinned when Dutch sat on the ground and laughed. \"Oh, it didn't like that. You decided not to climb it and laughed at it.\" \"Change. The gun! You're going to use Lissa's gun to vent the volcano!\" \"Yes, Lane. What does that do?\" \"Makes it decide to hurry. Back to the ship. NOW! Run, Dutch! RUN!\" Dutch put on a burst of speed and dove through the hatch. He was in the gun turret by the time Lane and Clete got to the ship. He chose his point and fired through the volcano. He tracked the beam down, cutting through the side and deep into the island base. He kept tracking down as Lane lifted off. The sea began to boil as molten magma poured from the rent in the volcanic shaft. Dutch laughed. It would be very angry now. \"That's cruel, Dutch. You're laughing because it's helpless against us.\" \"Yes, I am. Help me out of here. Give me your hand. If I unstrap, I'm going to land on my head. Ah. Better. I wondered when Lane was going to turn the ship back over.\" \"Just in time to nearly land me on my head. He's been pretty busy. A lot of people wanted to know exactly what we thought we were doing.\" \"Ooh, I'll bet he's been busy. Our nasty thing is very close, Clete.\" \"Yes. Let's get us all together. I think it's going to mount a personal attack.\" \"Lane!\" Clete followed Dutch the few meters to the bridge. Lane looked up and smiled. He reached out a hand and Dutch took it, then held out his other hand to Clete. They joined minds and waited. When the attack came, it was furious. And futile. Dutch exulted, then realized Clete's overwhelming feeling of pity was their true weapon. He willed the malevolent force to feel it. To know it. To see Clete's sadness for the pitiful thing that could know only hate. His compassion for something his love would destroy. It screamed into nonexistence and Clete wept for it. They requested landing clearance and set down on pad three. There was quite a reception committee waiting for them. Dutch apologized for firing a weapon in the planetary atmosphere, but explained all he could think about at the time was the loss of life and property an eruption would have caused. Then he had to apologize for landing on the island in the first place. He was getting rather aggravated with the whole affair when the media people burst into the room. They were suddenly heroes. The people who had been ranting at him were touting his quick thinking, posing with the three of them for the vid. Dutch looked at Lane and he winked. Dutch grinned. He now knew who had commed the media. Clete was grinning too. Lane didn't feel smug very often. Dutch and Lane groaned when he ran them back to the carnival. The port manager looked out and swore. Pad three was empty again. And no one could find the liftoff records. Two technicians spent some time looking for the glitch in the computer. Melissa chose a slightly different spot on the midway and they took down the closed sign. The first customer was a lovely girl. Dutch had no problem devining her immediate future. It started with dinner, then a show, then... Clete and Lane laughed. Dutch would never change. Lane watched the future take shape and hunted for a change. When he couldn't find one, he headed for the beach and Dutch quickly. They didn't have much time. \"Dutch, we need to talk.\" \"About?\" \"Clete. We need to do it fast. I'm worried and he'll be here soon.\" \"Start talking.\" \"He's going to fall in love. Helplessly in love.\" \"Lane, that's not a problem. It won't change things between us.\" \"Dutch, she's going to die. He's going to want us to stop it. Want us to change it.\" \"Then we change it.\" \"We can't. Let me rephrase that. If we do, thousands die. She makes the choice to save them. I've been doing what-ifs for hours. I kept thinking I'd find something. Dutch, she's carrying his child when it happens.\" \"Damn. We have to tell him. He'd never completely trust us again if we don't.\" \"I know. I've thought about rushing us off the planet. Getting us out of here before he meets her.\" \"That's not right either.\" \"I know. Here he comes.\" \"What's wrong, Lane?\" \"Let's go to Melissa. I want our home around us. A fire. A cup of cocoa. Us.\" \"You're hurting. You're both hurting.\" \"Yes, Clete. Come on. Lane will explain. You have a choice, but we know how you'll make it.\" \"All right, Dutch. We run. I want the hurt lessened until we get home.\" They ran. It did keep the pain at a distance. They settled by the fire in their living room. Lane told Clete what he had seen. Clete's choice was love, even for a short time. They had known it would be. They wouldn't leave. He met her the next day, a Fleet officer on leave, beautiful, passionate and loving. Her name was Helen. Dutch and Lane put the pain into the future and reveled in Clete's happiness. \"Dutch, Helen and I are going to the beach. Do you want to come?\" \"No, Clete. Lane and I have plans too. Have fun.\" \"We always do.\" \"Yeah, I know. Do me a favor. Try to keep things from getting too warm. At least til evening. We're getting tired of looking for places to take a cold shower.\" \"I'll try. I want to bring her here, Dutch. I want her to know who I am. I want to bring her home.\" \"All right. Take her out of the hotel. She stays here with us. With you. It's where she belongs.\" \"Tonight?\" \"Tonight.\" Dutch went to see how Lane was. He'd made a choice. In a way it was a betrayal. A violation. \"Will he hate me?\" \"No. He's going to be pretty mixed up about it for awhile. Let's get to work. We have a great deal to get ready.\" \"And not much time.\" \"Stop. We promised him we wouldn't dwell on it, would keep our minds on other things. He deserves to be happy for the time they have. She's quite a woman, Dutch. She will do what needs to be done.\" Clete brought Helen home. She learned what the man she had fallen in love with was. It didn't really surprise her. She'd known there was a uniqueness about the brothers that went beyond being half human. She became part of the family, one who belonged in their lives, a part of all of them. \"Dutch, Clete asked me to marry him.\" \"I never doubted he would Helen. I'm very happy for you both.\" \"No you're not. Neither is Lane. Oh, I'm welcome and you even love me, but you're not happy. I want to know why.\" \"The choice wasn't mine to make after all.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Helen, I... We... Damn. Did you extend your leave? Did you tell them you were getting married? Who to?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did your captain say?\" \"He told me Commander Telas said Clete's father would be pleased.\" \"He's our godfather.\" \"Your godfather?!\" \"Yes, and the best there is.\" \"I don't doubt that. It's just a very antiquated concept. What does that have to do with why you're not happy?\" \"We... I'm sorry, Lane. I'm sending her to you. I can't.\" \"You can't what?\" \"Find Lane. Ask him. He lives with the future. I don't have to that often. Just... find him. You have choices to make. He's a very good guide.\" Lane smiled gently when Clete walked into his room. He'd tried to ignore it, but he was too honest with himself to do it any longer. \"You told her. Lane, you told her.\" \"She asked, Clete. Would you have had me lie to her? I couldn't have even if you'd asked it. I respect her too much. Has it changed things between you?\" \"Yes. How else would I have known?\" \"Do you love each other less?\" \"Of course not, Lane, but now there's a desperation, a poignancy, about it. No one should have to know when they're going to die.\" \"I agree, but many of us do. My mother wasn't the same situation, but she knew. I'll know. Perhaps everyone does. She could have chosen not to. I told her that. A dozen ways. Dutch has known we'd have to tell her from the beginning. Even before I did. But he couldn't actually do it. It hurt him too much.\" \"The night he got drunk.\" \"Yes, to deaden the pain, so you wouldn't be burdened with it. Now go get ready. All weddings are both joyful and sad. Yours will be no different. You just know the reasons.\" \"Lane, I don't know if I can get through it.\" \"Clete, when you see her coming down the aisle, red hair, green eyes, turned up nose and freckles, you'll be the happiest man in this universe. Probably more than this one. We're going to live an incredibly long time. Well, if we don't get ourselves killed. We'll have to face this again and again. Father chooses to love and accept the pain of parting. You've made the same choice.\" \"Yes, I guess I have. Get ready. You're giving away the bride.\" \"That didn't surprise the magistrate as much as your first suggestion.\" \"I know. He just couldn't handle the concept of two best men. What will he do when you join Dutch beside me instead of sitting down?\" \"Stumble a little, then go on. He's more adaptable than he thinks.\" The wedding was beautiful and joyous. Helen and Clete went back to Melissa and Dutch and Lane went out on the town, looking for company. Everyone seemed to be. It was a very warm autumn night in the city. Helen had twelve more days of leave. Four days after Helen went back, Lane ran for Dutch. He hadn't been able to keep his brothers from knowing it would be soon, but they really didn't want to know when. He really didn't want to know, but he did. \"Find him! Find him fast!\" \"He's over there. Not far. Come on!\" Sand. Dutch hated running in sand. It slowed him. Dragged him down. He wasn't going to be there. Wasn't going to be fast enough. Clete would feel him coming. Would know what was coming. Clete's scream of pain and loss cut through him. Drove him to his knees. Lane caught his arm and dragged him up. They ran on through the pain, and the anguish, and the dragging, treacherous, sand. They caught him and held him. Kept him with them. Held his mind, when he would have thrown it after her. Held his body, when he would have thrown it into the sea. Held his life between them, when he thought it had ended. Along the beach, people saw two holding one and weeping, and wept with them. The official notification was delivered, personally, by Telas two days later. Dutch led him to Clete's rooms, where he'd shared so much with his wife of such a short time. Lane was waiting for him when he walked out. \"I've given him her message. I don't know how to judge his reaction. I did as she asked. It seemed the choice should be hers. She believed she died for a good cause. I asked her to let me take the mission. She refused.\" \"We knew she would, Telas. So did Clete.\" \"The ship would have killed thousands, Lane. I still tried to change it. We were close, but there was too much orbital traffic to risk firing a weapon to attempt to destroy it. Helen loaded everyone aboard into survival pods, stunned five to do it. There wasn't a self-destruct. It was just an old mining ship being dismantled for salvage. She didn't learn why a station-keeping jet suddenly fired and aimed it right for the planet. She used the one that hadn't fired to guide it into the moon. It was barely in the realm of possible, a feat of piloting I might not have been able to duplicate. She may have been the only one who could have done it. And she may have known it. I'll miss her too. Dutch, how is he?\" \"He needed to be alone. Lane, will he be--\" \"Dutch, he'll laugh again and love again. This time will become one of his most wonderful memories. He knows it already. He just doesn't feel it yet. You two have given him a gift from her. Someday, he'll be ready to receive it. You, Dutch, gave her another choice. Telas, you gave her the means. Thank you, Godfather, for interceding with the captain on her behalf.\" \"He thanked me. He too will miss her. He too understood... she made the decision not to change it.\" \"I looked for a way we could change it, Telas.\" \"I was sure you had, Lane. Dutch, help him get rid of some of the guilt he couldn't find one. He'll help. He thinks Clete's got too much to carry now without that too. Don't you?\" \"Yes, Godfather.\" He left them to return to his ship. He would watch over the tiny thing that awaited, suspended in sickbay, the caring and love Clete would give when he was ready. Someday, he would claim Helen's gift. And delight in the little boy who called him \"Daddy.\" Dutch was worried about both his brothers. They were just wandering around. They'd visited a couple beautiful worlds, looked at the lovely and peaceful scenery a few hours and... wandered. The time had been important, but it had been long enough. \"Lane, we need to do something fun.\" \"We're on our way to the pleasure planet of Jesera.\" \"That wasn't exactly what I had in mind.\" \"Yes it is, Dutch. You want to show off, show up the bad guys, be a hero, and meet lots of lovely ladies. Not necessarily in that order.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind.\" \"I thought so. Something fun. This will be good for Clete too. That's your next question.\" \"Will it?\" \"See? Next question.\" Lane ducked the playful swipe. He was looking forward to seeing Dutch's face when they landed in the midst of an interstellar showcase of muscle, madness and beauty. The madness was the work. The muscle and beauty were the fun. The work would be fun too. Dutch really disliked bullies and drug dealers. \"Tell Clete we're on full training schedule. Starting in ten minutes. Meet you in the gym.\" Dutch laughed and went to find Clete. It was time for him to rejoin the team. Time he learned he could still laugh. Time he remembered why he was alive. He was still laughing when he got to the gym. The incredulous look on Clete's face had been wonderful. No one but he had ever called a training schedule before. Lane put them through their paces. He told Clete to pay attention and shape up. Within a few hours, Clete had retaken his place as training director. He hadn't even realized he'd done it, just started following the schedule Lane had made and gradually slipped into it. They had been a very long way from where they were going. In twenty days, they had honed their bodies and their skills to perfection. When they landed, they were ready. Lane entered them in every event but the beauty contest and he signed them up as escorts for that. He carried their very busy schedule back to the hotel room Melissa had landed in and handed copies to Clete and Dutch. \"Lane, this isn't fair. We're faster and stronger than full humans.\" \"Clete, we aren't competing against humans in most events. The top weightlifter in your class is a targ. Dutch's main competition in the track events is a corduni. We're even going to lose a few contests.\" \"Hey! I just found my favorite event!\" Clete and Lane turned to Dutch and chorused, \"Beauty pageant escort.\" Then Lane told them why they were there. They swept through the events. They were listed as 'The Gallants, anthropoid mix' on the official charts. The only problems arose when Clete was entered in bodybuilding, weightlifting and wrestling events. There were some very warm audiences. They solved the problem by dousing him with cold water whenever they started to get warm. He spent a great deal of time wet. Lane was right. They did take second in a few events, never third. They also ended in a few ties. They laughed when they tied for first place as best all-around athlete. It was the only competition all three were in as individuals. They took every event they entered as a team. They built a showpiece out of martial arts routine six and sharp shooting routine three and presented it the night of the award presentations. The stunned silence of the stadium audience lasted nearly two minutes before the night was split with a roar of approbation. By the time they showed up for beauty pageant duty, females of every species were begging the stage manager/producer for one of them as escort. Dutch had an idea, of course. \"We'll escort them all on. Then you assign someone else for the rest of the duties. We'll bring them on two at a time so the schedule doesn't get off.\" \"I can't do that.\" \"Why not? Dutch has given you a solution that keeps you out of hot water.\" Lane smiled at the thoughtful look on the man's face. They all liked him and it was going to be very pleasant to help him out. \"Would you rather assign us one each and then try to walk past the other twenty-seven finalists? We'll even provide our own costumes, something that will contrast well with the dark formal attire of the other thirty escorts. You do have three alternates listed.\" \"Hmm, it would be unusual. You boys are an attraction. Wouldn't take long to spread the word. Would probably attract more women. Might even boost ticket sales.\" \"Yes, and no one would be late getting lined up to go on either.\" \"How would you boys like to travel with the show?\" \"We thought you'd never ask.\" They dressed in the full formal tradition of Earth's twentieth century, white tails and diamond studs with blue satin tie and cummerbund. They finished it with white capes lined in blue satin. They all loved the style and had since Alice had shown them an image of Gallant in it when he had been very young. The memory of hearing him nervously asking her how he looked, and the three of them giggling too hard to explain why, when he asked what was going on, brought smiles, as they got ready. Dutch and Clete thought they were done, then Lane handed each a white top hat, a silver-headed walking stick, a deep red rose and a diamond ear clip. Clete looked at the ear clip in his hand and grinned. He brushed his hair back and put it and the top hat on. He pinned on the rose, spun his walking stick and strolled out the door. Dutch and Lane laughed. The Gallant boys were going on the town and expecting trouble to find them. The producer stared at them in amazement. \"You didn't tell me you were going to dress like that!\" \"Is there something wrong with it, Frake?\" \"No, Dutch. I just didn't know anyone could actually wear something like that and, well, get away with it. You're going to outclass the contestants.\" \"Never. They're the gems. We're merely the sets to show them off. Trust us. Our dad taught us well. None of them has ever been more beautiful than they will be tonight. Show us the routine.\" Clete expressed their opinion of the 'usual' show for the pageant. He could feel it was unanimous. \"Dull.\" \"What?\" \"Clete said it was dull. He's right. It's a presentation, not a roll call. You just leave it to us.\" \"Dutch... \" Frake watched from backstage and was astounded. The beauties floated on the arms of the brothers, even the non-anthropoids. The three just knew how to walk with them so the grace of their species was seen. He'd surprised himself when he asked them to join the show, but he was getting sure it was one of the best decisions he'd ever made, real fast. When all thirty finalists were on-stage, the brothers slid from three directions to front center on their knees, threw their arms out to the audience, then turned and threw them out to the contestants. Who had taught them all to drop deep curtsies in unison? And how had they figured out a way for a coni'ith to do it? The house exploded in applause. Frake sighed contentedly. The pageant was a success and it hadn't even gotten past the introductions. Frake watched in awe. They were everywhere. A music board bench repaired, a harp restrung, a riser rebuilt, a nervous hand held, a spotlight replaced, a lightboard rewired, a pushy mother charmed, a coughing judge given water... Everywhere. They took over the final presentation too. They carried flowers, sash and cape and followed the previous year's winner on-stage. Clete smoothly stepped in to assist the tiny othvin to crown her human successor, reshaping the crown she'd worn on her crest to fit in the process. He draped the sash and stepped back. Lane smoothly fastened the cape and Dutch laid the flowers across her arm. They stepped into line, rolled their hats down their arms and bowed her onto the runway. The crowd went wild. Frake went back to divide up the receipts and sighed. They'd demanded sixty percent this time. Perhaps the house had been large enough he would be able to pay for some work on the ship, but he doubted it. He said \"Come in,\" before he thought about it when Dutch knocked. \"What are you doing?\" \"Counting our receipts and paying our bills, Dutch, the last chore before we move on.\" \"That's a very large bill you have laid out, Frake. Are you paying off some real estate? Say, maybe a planet?\" \"It's just one of the bills. Keeps the show on.\" \"Protection. A piece of the gross. A large piece. Getting larger all the time. You pay it, they don't hurt anyone. Stop paying it.\" \"You... guessed it. I can't stop. They showed me I can't. Grabbed two of the girls and addicted them to a drug. Called the police and told them I did it. The police didn't really believe it, but it ruined those poor kid's lives and they asked me not to come back.\" \"Stop paying. We'll take care of them.\" \"Dutch, I can't. They just upped it to sixty percent and I've got no choice. I can't even just shut down the show.\" \"I understand you felt like you didn't have a choice before, but you do now. We're taking the ladies out tonight. They'll be safe.\" \"All of them?!\" \"No, six are engaged or married, just the other twenty-four. Oh! Twenty-five. Last year's winner is coming too. Give me half the protection money. Tell them your new partners have it. Clete's in the mood to show off. So am I. Lane likes an audience of ladies too.\" \"Dutch, you don't know these people.\" \"Tell them we moved in on you, said we were taking half their cut. Be real scared. Tell them who we are. I'm about to give you a black eye. It'll keep you from getting really hurt. We'll fix it when we get back. Won't be late. Most of the girls have a curfew.\" \"OW!\" \"Sorry. There. That's half. Now get the rest of the money put away fast. Don't worry about paying us. Clete needs exercise and gym time costs. Besides, we have trouble finding sparring partners for him.\" Frake did exactly what Dutch told him. He didn't have any trouble acting scared. His black eye was very convincing. He was surprised when the two men took the thirty percent and didn't give him another one. They were mad someone was trying to 'muscle in' on their territory. Frake put an ice pack on his eye. He suddenly smiled. He wondered if the protection collectors had any idea what they were up against. They used some of the money to take the ladies out. They took them several places. Half of every crowd knew who they were. The other half knew who the ladies were. About midway through the evening, eight unpleasant men accosted them on the street. They helped the ladies step over them and continued their evening. They saw each and every lady safely home. Dutch borrowed Clete's medunit and went back to cure Frake's eye. \"Here. We used some to show the ladies a good time. Sorry. We looked over the ship. It needs work. Order these parts. We'll start on it tomorrow. Oh, we need you to pay our hotel bill. We also have one piece of equipment we'll be putting on the ship. We'll keep it in our cabin. We're sentimental about it.\" \"Didn't they find you, Dutch?\" \"Who? Oh, them. Yes. We didn't stay with them long. We were afraid we'd be fined for leaving eight large pieces of trash on the sidewalk. There. That should feel much better.\" Frake started to laugh. They were sorry they had used some of the money, were going to fix the ship, didn't need to be paid, and would he take care of their hotel bill. And they'd left 'trash' on the sidewalk. Just a little. Eight pieces. To top it all off they were incredible showmen. Somebody out there liked him. \"Dutch, you boys are amazing.\" \"True. Oh! Almost forgot. We'll be just a little late tomorrow. We're keeping watch on the ladies' hotels tonight and putting them all on their flights home. Won't be at the spaceport until just before noon. Try to get those parts delivered by then. Goodnight.\" Dutch hurried. Lane had said the first attack would come just about an hour after midnight. They probably wouldn't need him, but he hated to miss the fun. He dashed into the hotel and found them. Just in time. \"Four. Armed. Freight lift. I'll go.\" \"Clete, you can't have all the fun.\" \"There are only four, Dutch, and the lift is small.\" \"All right. Enjoy yourself. What's next, Lane?\" \"Three on the stairs. If we want to do anything, we'd better get there before Clete gets done on the lift.\" \"Let's go! He's probably finished.\" \"No. He'll be polite and put them in the trash bin out back.\" \"Good thinking. We'll do the same. Got to keep the hotel tidy. Oh goody. A banister. Let's slide down.\" \"Sounds like fun. About three flights.\" \"Wheeee! Oops. Hope I didn't break him.\" \"My goodness, Dutch. You have the trash all piled by the back door to go out.\" \"Sorry I forgot to leave you some. Help me carry it out anyway?\" \"Certainly. Hi, Clete. Next stop Hotel Caprice. Good, you got their injector. Here's ours. Clete, that isn't nice. You broke them. Oh, well. They didn't really need them.\" The hotel Caprice was a bit busier and the Ranforth more so. They gathered all the ladies for breakfast and walked them to the spaceport. They saw them off and moved Melissa to the show's ship. The parts were just arriving when they walked out of it. \"Good morning, Frake.\" \"I didn't see you boys get here!\" \"We slipped in quietly. Lane and Clete didn't want to be seen this late still in evening wear. Clete, life support; Lane, computers. I'll take the drive. We'll spread the rest around. Frake, have something ready for lunch in about two hours. We had a late breakfast, but I'm going to be hungry. Get clearance for liftoff in... six hours ought to do it. Ship needs a paint job. We'll get one next stop.\" \"Dutch, the repair estimate was forty hours and eight men.\" \"That sounds about right. Liftoff in six.\" Frake watched them for awhile, then fixed them lunch and scheduled liftoff. They'd be done in six hours. \"Where did you boys learn all this stuff, Dutch?\" \"Let's see. Some from our moms, some from our dad, some from our godfather, some at the academy.\" \"Academy?\" \"Would you believe Dutch was a lieutenant?\" \"So were you, Clete.\" \"Yeah, but I didn't figure he'd have any trouble believing Lane and I were, just you.\" \"You were ALL FLEET OFFICERS?!\" \"Easy, Frake. Small room. Hard on the ears. Yeah. Enjoyed it for awhile. Lane decided we should retire early. He missed us.\" \"True, Dutch, I did. I also decided it was time to move you around a bit. You kept running out of women and places to take them.\" \"That and they kept trying to get him to choose between them.\" \"I never did understand that. I gave all of them plenty of attention. Back to work. The drive was in bad shape. Let's see... cargo lifts. Later.\" \"He can't have the drive work done already!\" \"Sure he can, Frake. He kisses the power generators, tells them they're beautiful and they fix themselves up to please him. Lane, you get the dirty job. I'm too big for half the access shafts.\" \"An excuse, Clete, but one I'll accept. Besides, I just got the computers working properly. I'd rather not have you shoulder through a junction and fry them. Cable check it is. I suppose you're going to fix the galley.\" \"It needs it. I'll take care of surface plumbing too. Dutch can get the stuff behind the panels when he gets done with the lifts. He's already dirty from cleaning the exhaust tubes.\" \"Sounds good. I'll pick up command and nav. Later.\" \"Frake, you'll have to move. I'm about to take this place apart and put it back together. You can come back and make tea for us in a couple hours.\" \"Uh... sure, Clete. I think I'll just go to my cabin and sleep. I'm already dreaming.\" \"Frake, if you think we're fast, you should have seen my commander. He once told me Dutch's mom was faster.\" \"You don't have the same mother?\" \"Nope. All different, but they all had the same... first... name. Got it. Frake, I'm about to remove the deckplate you're standing on. Go.\" \"Uh... later.\" There was only one job left to do by the time they had tea, get everything and everyone else aboard. Frake just stood and watched while they took care of that too. Cargo was stowed, cabins assigned, rehearsal schedules handed out. People walked through the corridors with their mouths open. Even the bed in cabin eight had been fixed. He wasn't at all surprised when they took over the bridge and smoothly lifted off. \"Party time! Let's get acquainted. Cargo hold, I think. I'll get everyone.\" \"All right, Dutch. Clete and I will be there as soon as we get comm and nav clear and get her on auto.\" \"The autopilot doesn't work, Lane. Hasn't since before I bought it. Can't be fixed.\" \"That's why I built a new one, Frake. On course. Auto in. See you in the hold, Clete.\" \"Private ship Merriment out. Wait up. I'll go with you. Coming, Frake?\" \"Uh, you go ahead. I'll be there.\" He sat and stared around him at the smoothly-running ship and started to laugh. He wouldn't be paying any more 'protection' money. He had all the protection he needed. Somebody out there liked him. They'd sent him three guardian angels. He didn't know they were looking for a devil in the cargo hold. They returned to their cabin to talk about what they'd found. All of them were angry, but Dutch was furious. \"Traces everywhere. Everywhere but the bridge and Frake's cabin. Not enough to bully him into paying them off, they use him to smuggle drugs too.\" \"I picked up mean and nervous from a couple stagehands, Dutch. Big one with the bald spot and the little one with, well, shifty eyes. One of the women too. The pretty blond.\" \"Damn. Prettiest thing on the ship and she's dirty. Thanks for the warning, Clete. Anything, Lane?\" \"Clete's picked them. Let's see. Access panel nearest the hold. In the music board. The big costume box. Under the bed I'm laying on. We take it to Frake. He gets real sick. He hates drugs. Wants to space whoever brought them on board. We space the drugs. The blonde's got an injector, Dutch. I can't see any way out of it. She's going to hit you with it. Nasty stuff. Addictive.\" \"Easy, Dutch! Easy! It's not bliss! Lane, help! He wants to kill her. Kill all of them.\" \"Dutch, you trance through it! No effect! None! I promise! She's after someone else. You block. She's after the little brunette with the overbite and freckles. A couple others too. You'll stop her.\" \"Better. Still mad, but not killing mad.\" \"Let's collect drugs. I want them off this ship. I want it now. My skin crawls. Get off that bunk, Lane.\" \"No. We have to wait, Dutch. Just a few hours. Go home. In Melissa. Get away from it. Clete, dump him in the spa.\" \"Right, Lane. In he goes.\" \"Put me down, Clete! OW! Duck a little lower ne--\" Lane smiled as Melissa's door cut off Dutch's voice. Helping nice people get rid of a nasty problem was good for all of them. It was especially good for Clete. Helen had become his most beautiful memory, not an open wound. Clete was going to have trouble keeping Dutch from killing. The shifty fellow had an injector too. Lane knew he was his target. Dutch would teach him how to heal himself. Before the night was over, he and Clete would both learn. He drifted off to sleep. It would be how the shifty man would find him. Clete roared in fury and Dutch screamed his as they raced out of Melissa. Lane stopped them from going after the person, who had just cleared the cabin, with a lift of his hand. It was about all he could do, but he managed it. He had to slow Dutch, turn his anger a bit, focus it on himself to prevent a possible future. Clete would feel the need and help. Dutch's biting words told him he'd succeeded avoiding the first path to catastrophe. \"He knew this was coming, Clete. You know he did. I'm going to kill whoever did this.\" \"Dutch. Dutch! DAMMIT! LISTEN TO ME! He didn't tell you because he knew this is what you'd do, fly apart. You're no good to him or anybody else this way. Pull yourself together. This is the reason we go hunting drugs. He told us where. We take him with us. All the way through.\" \"Yeah, with... no... no...killing. Clete, stop him. Shifty man. Stop him. Bad choice. Bad choice.\" \"Dutch! It's what he doesn't want you to do! There's a reason! He let them hit him for a reason. Dutch?\" \"You're probably going to have to remind me several more times. Let's get him up. We're going drug hunting. This… stuff is fast. Let's get him moving. It should help.\" They collected the drugs. They ran into the shifty man coming out of the hold. Clete grabbed Dutch and yelled. \"STAND STILL! Stand very, very still. If you even breathe hard, I won't be able to keep him from killing you. Drop the weapon. Just let it fall. DO AS I TELL YOU! He can move before the beam hits him. Drop it. DAMMIT! I'm trying to save your life! Good. Now the injector. Dutch. Dutch, he's unarmed. Let him go back in the hold. Back up slowly. Very slowly. He's the fastest man alive. You can't get away from him. He'd really like you to try. You're terrified. That's good. You should be. I would be if he wanted to kill me. Dutch, find the drugs. Come on, Dutch. The drugs are more important. He won't move.\" \"I want him to move. Just move. I want to kill him. I want him to move.\" \"He's not going to. Leave him and find the drugs.\" \"Find the drugs, Dutch. We'll trance. Together. Find them. Don't kill. Bad choice.\" \"Lane, I want... All right. If he stands still, I might not kill him. But I want him to move.\" The shifty man stood very still. He had looked death in the face and it was waiting for him to move. He collapsed on the floor and sobbed his relief when they left and locked him in the hold. They took Lane and the drugs to Frake. He became violently ill. Clete shook his head. If anything, Frake hated drugs more than Dutch did. It was why the threat of their use had been such an effective method of coercion. Dutch went hunting the blond. Clete left Lane with Frake and spaced the drugs. He had to find Dutch before he killed her. He almost didn't make it. \"NO, DUTCH! If you hit her, you'll kill her! You haven't got the control to avoid it. You. Merith. Lock her in the cargo hold. It's the only place she'll be safe. She's drugged him and I might be able to stop him. Come back here. I'll try to keep him here til you get back. If you don't get back soon, he'll come hunting. The drug won't stop him. It just makes it easier for him to kill. Easy, Dutch. She's running for the hold.\" Clete struggled against Dutch's anger and hoped Merith returned quickly. She did. \"She opened it and ran in. There was a man in the hold. He begged me to lock it. He saved me. She was going to inject me. He got his hand in front of the injector before--\" \"Easy, Merith, I know. He's fast. Help me get him moving.\" \"I don't... need help. I need... to kill them.\" \"They're locked up.\" \"There's another.\" \"Not yet. He hasn't done anything yet. Come on. You need to help Lane. He needs you. He can't fight it like you can.\" \"You're right. Lane first. Come on.\" Clete gusted a sigh of relief. He'd barely held against Dutch's anger. He leaned against a bulkhead and dealt with his own. Merith watched Dutch move swiftly down the corridor. \"How can he even walk? He should be out of it.\" \"He's... stubborn. He just refuses to let the drug win. You come too. You don't want to be alone.\" \"You're right, I don't. He's coming back with your brother. Where are they going?\" \"To our cabin. Dutch and Lane are going to fight the drug together. I'll take you to-- Frake, where are you going?\" \"Lane said I was to come along and bring the girl to somebody named Melissa.\" \"Damn. I hope he knows what he's doing. Our cabin. Go on in. I'll show you the door to Melissa.\" He led them into Lissa and through to Melissa. He left them sitting on the floor, holding each other and giggling. He wondered again if Lane knew what he was doing. He found them on his bed. He'd looked everywhere else first. He had such a tight hold on himself, he hadn't been able to hunt for them by feel. He'd been about to head for the depths of the ship when he realized his door was open. \"We're waiting for you. You need to learn. Your bed is big enough. Give me your hand.\" \"All right, Dutch. I just hope... Never mind. Dutch took them into trance and they learned. Clete didn't need it so he surfaced almost immediately, but he now knew how. He went out to Merith and Frake and led them to the kitchen. He made cocoa and sat down in the breakfast nook. \"What is this thing?\" \"Our home, Frake, a ship. Her name is Melissa.\" \"This isn't possible.\" \"Merith, if it wasn't possible, it wouldn't exist.\" \"Clete, that's not what I meant. Or maybe it is what I meant. I don't know.\" \"I'd better get more cocoa ready. They'll want some. They'll probably sleep just a few minutes. Dutch is too keyed up to really rest. We need to make some plans.\" \"They'll be under that drug for hours, then screaming withdrawal for several more. I've seen it before. Horrible.\" \"Easy, Frake. They'd almost rid themselves of it when I left them. Dutch was in a hurry. He didn't like it.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"What's not possible? Hi, Merith. Scoot over.\" \"You're not possible!\" \"Yes I am. Clete and Lane say they might not be, but I definitely am. Ah, cocoa. Thanks, Clete.\" \"Lane?\" \"Sleeping. He won't be long. It was different, Clete. Easier. Just sort of broke it apart and made it... nothing. Lots easier than really healing something. I don't think I even really needed the trance. I started as soon as it hit me.\" \"The trance didn't hurt. It gave Lane and me a chance to learn how.\" \"True. So, Frake, what do you think of Melissa?\" \"I'm trying not to.\" Clete and Dutch laughed and soon Merith and Frake joined in. \"I hate missing nice laughter.\" \"Hello, Lane. Why did you tell Frake and Merith to come to Melissa?\" \"Did I? I guess I remembered them being here.\" \"Remembered?\" \"Lane remembers things that haven't happened yet, Merith. Dutch can link our minds together. Me, I'm just an ordinary empath. Dutch, you're making me warm!\" \"Sorry, Clete. I like sitting next to Merith. Let's take our cocoa to the living room. This may be a bit too cozy.\" \"Definitely!\" \"You know, I never knew guardian angels took heaven with them when they were working.\" \"Frake, you have a wonderful sense of humor. No wonder you're a showman.\" \"I lost it for awhile, Dutch. Thank you for helping me find it again.\" \"It's time to spread this operation out. If they were doing it to Frake, they're doing it to others.\" \"Choice. Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"Dutch, why don't you wait until he's sitting down?\" \"It's all right, Clete. I was waiting for it. We've got a straight path until the next choice. Motorcycles! He's decided he wants motorcycles!\" \"Too bad we don't have Dad to ride with us.\" \"We don't need him. It would be fun though. Dutch, we get a list from Frake. Others he thinks are paying. We take both him and Merith with us. We visit a large number. Space a lot of drugs. Dutch, you must not kill anyone. It's going to be hard not to. Especially the man in gray. He's a key to stopping it all, the link to the bosses. And you're going to want him very, very dead. The girl will be all right. We'll get her through. Oh, this is going to be fun. Clete... Oh, my. Yes. A lot of fun.\" \"Lane, what's the 'Clete, oh my?' It makes me nervous when you do that.\" \"Don't worry. You won't have any problem. Dutch and I can put up with our teeth rattling a few days.\" \"A FEW DAYS?!\" \"A sideline they're in. Yes! We learn the magic! Well, some of it. Not quite the way he did it. That's a function of who he is, but someday... Too bad. We should have kept a little to analyze. Cold turkey is hard, but they'll be grateful. That's it. Let's do it.\" \"Dutch, he got excited about magic and 'someday' was a promise.\" \"That doesn't surprise me, Clete. His eyes lit up every time Dad did a bit of magic. What's first, Lane?\" \"Frake's list. Hmm... Oh, I see. Easy. A horse race. No, two. How about that? Real leathers.\" \"Whoa. You're getting really excited, Lane, and Clete's about to start bouncing off walls. Since you'd probably say you hate to spoil fun surprises if I asked for specifics… Yeah, I thought so. All right, let's do this one step at a time. Frake, make us a list of everyone you know, or think you know, is paying protection, especially traveling shows, like yours. Give us their schedules, if you can. How does Merith fit in, Lane?\" \"She's our accountant, Dutch. She's a genius at estimating a house and keeping track of what money belongs to who. She can also figure out exactly what a show needs; costumes, props, equipment. The best little shopper on the net. You made a smart move when you hired her, Frake.\" \"I didn't. She just sort of attached herself to the company. Said she'd always wanted to be in show business. Promised she'd earn her keep. She looked hungry, so I fed her and said all right.\" \"I was hungry. I was also dodging an injector and one of those 'sidelines' this bunch are in.\" \"Why the blond was after you.\" \"Probably, Dutch. If your man in gray is the same as mine, he doesn't take no for an answer.\" \"Now I know why it's going to be hard not to kill him. I really don't like to kill. I haven't killed anyone since... in a very long time.\" \"Dutch, his bosses take care of him. He leads us to them. If he dies, they may get away.\" \"Remind me of that again when the time comes, Lane.\" \"I won't be there. Neither will Clete. You'll have to make the choice on your own.\" \"Here's the list. About fifteen. All I can think of. I guessed on most. Shows with good draw that are getting dilapidated. Barnard's is the worst. His ship is in worse shape than mine was. Nice old boy.\" \"He's first. They've got his niece. We'll get her and take her to him, then make sure his ship gets to where it's going. Dutch, it's going to break down in flight. We'll use Lissa and do a mayday answer. Replicate parts. Clean house for him. We have to let the two in the hold loose. They're our advertisement.\" \"Damn. Let's do it. Let's get Barnard's niece first. Who stays with Melissa?\" \"I do, but I meet you on the ship. We'll have to work fast. It'll take all of us. Yesterday.\" \"Let's move.\" It wasn't far to where Barnard's niece was being held. Clete went into the big house to get her. It didn't take him long to find her. He just followed the path of most resistance. He smiled at the bright-eyed little girl of about seven and squatted down. \"Hello, Jeannie. I'm Clete. Don't be afraid of me. I'm your friend, or I'd like to be. I've come to take you to your uncle. Wouldn't you like to leave here?\" \"Yes. I'm not afraid of you. I think you're here to rescue me.\" \"That's why.\" \"I was really hoping somebody would. They think I'm so dumb I wouldn't figure out why they won't let me go outside. They said they adopted me because Uncle Barnard didn't want me.\" \"They lied to you. They're making him pay lots of money. They told him they'd hurt you if he didn't.\" \"I guessed that, but I've been careful not to let them know. When Mommy and Daddy got killed, Uncle Barnard came and got me. He told me we're all the family we have and we have to stick together. He wouldn't decide he didn't want me. How did you get in? There's lots of not-nice men and Miss Perldick. She's not nice, either.\" \"Come on. I'll show you.\" He took the hand of the very bright young lady and led her through the house. She asked if the men were dead. He told her he didn't kill people if he could help it. They were just napping. They'd looked tired, so he'd tucked them in. She giggled. He led her into Melissa/Lissa and she sat on his lap on the bridge. Lane dropped Lissa free not far from the ship that had just sounded a mayday. \"Private yacht Lissa responding. We're on our way. Barnard, we have the parts you need and a surprise for you. Frake's on board. He'll fill you in.\" \"Your ship is very fast, Clete.\" \"Yes, Jeannie, she's as fast as any other ship in space. My brother Dutch is also a very good pilot.\" \"Uncle Barnard sounded surprised. He likes Mr. Herpith.\" \"You can call me Frake, Jeannie. You're his big surprise. He's been very worried about you.\" \"I've been worried about him too. He needs me to take care of him, so he can take care of everybody else. Clete, where did your other brother go?\" \"He went in the cargo hold, Jeannie.\" \"Come on, Clete. There isn't much time. We've got to get that ship fixed. That drive is bad. Frake, careful what you say about us. Come on, come on, get the hatch open. Hello, Barnard. I'm Dutch. Talk to Frake. I can hear-- Clete! Come on!\" \"I hear it! Bye, Jeannie.\" \"Who was-- Jeannie? JEANNIE!\" \"Hi, Uncle Barnard. Here's a tissue. You're getting the pretty dress Clete gave me all wet. Now stop crying. I'm safe. You haven't been taking care of yourself. You're a mess, but it'll be better now I'm here.\" \"Yes, Jeannie. Much better. Frake, what's going on?\" \"You've just acquired the best guardian angels in the business. Get your people together and keep them out of their way. And I'll tell you what real protection is. This is Merith. Oops. Wait'll they get by. Now, you get going. We'll meet you in your cabin. Questions later. Go!\" Lane ran into engineering with parts they needed now! They worked fast. After a few minutes, they actually had time to talk. \"Think Frake will be careful when he talks to Barnard?\" \"Yes, Clete, I do. Dutch, hand me that spanner. All right. Life support will hobble along until we get the rest of the parts replicated.\" \"I want to get that drive fixed first, Lane. Clete and I barely got it shut down in time. It was about to blow. We cut it a little fine.\" \"We had to wait for the mayday. You'll need an EVA suit. Don't use one of Barnard's. Get one from Lissa.\" \"Tubes fouled. I just knew it. Nasty job to do in space. Easy to hole a suit.\" \"Dutch, hold your breath and speed up your metabolism. Your body won't decompress. Get in within five minutes.\" \"I'm going to hole the suit. I hope you're right. What am I saying? You're always right. I hope.\" \"Clete, you handle the airlock for him. He's going to cut it fine. Override the automatics. Don't wait for it to pressurize. Make sure you tell me about it when you get him in. That's where the memory comes from. Get started now. He'll be ready to go. I'll replicate drive parts. See you on Lissa.\" \"Done.\" Lane got back with the first load of parts just in time to stop the fellow about to take the housing off the number one power generator. \"Don't touch that! Go find the rest of your people and stay with them. We'll show you what we did when we get done. Dutch is going to give you a very thorough lesson in drive maintenance. Get out of the way!\" Lane watched the man head back to the cargo hold. He was a decent mechanic, but not much of an engineer. He'd been out of his depth. As soon as he'd gone, he headed back to the replicator in Lissa. He had both arms full of parts when Clete joined him. \"Lane, he's in. Holed the suit. Held his breath, sped up his metabolism. Close. About five minutes. I overrode autos on the airlock. Popped it as soon as he got the hatch closed. He's hungry. Engineering.\" \"Bring the rest of the parts and food for him. High carbo content. I'm on my way with these.\" Lane found Dutch waiting for the parts he was carrying. When Clete arrived, he tore into the food like a starving man. They rebuilt drive, generators, life support and the galley. Barnard was a pretty good hand at the computers, comm and nav equipment. The bridge was in fair shape. Dutch, however, was steaming. \"You can come out and let your people know they're safe. Send your man to me in engineering. I'm going to have a long talk with him. Lane is sweeping up your ship. We'll space your extraneous cargo. Fire some people when you land. Clete will tell you which ones. He's on the bridge. Later.\" \"Is he always like that, Frake?\" \"No. Dutch is usually pretty friendly. Except when there are drugs involved. Come on, Barnard, Clete's waiting.\" \"And my ship is already repaired?\" \"No, already rebuilt. I told you. Guardian angels.\" Lane convinced Melissa to be inconspicuous and they landed at a racetrack on twentieth century Earth. He replicated a two dollar bill from a numismatic collection Meister had shared and won the exacta, visited another track and placed his winnings on a long shot. He collected, gave the woman from the IRS the government's cut and they went motorcycle shopping. Dutch decided he wanted outfits like the men at the shop were wearing. They told him they'd have to prove themselves. They didn't have any problems. They were careful not to break anyone. Getting the modified Sportsters through Lissa and into Melissa was a problem, so they took them apart. Water conversion to hydrogen fuel would be too obvious in the time they came from, so they changed them over to alcohol fuel and put them away. There was no point reassembling them, until they were needed. They went through Frake's list and Merith shopped. The money they collected for 'protection' returned the next day as ship parts, sets and costumes. Newly protected show owners happily followed instructions. Drugs were spaced and termination slips arranged. Frake and Merith were returned to the Merriment a few minutes after they'd left. It was time to shut down the sidelines. A few moments later, they were on the world and in the city where they would begin. \"This is where you meet the man in gray, Dutch. You'll tell me about it. It's going to be very hard not to kill him. Just remember, he's not going to get away with it. In fact, if you kill him, you'll be doing him a favor.\" \"I'll remember, Lane. What's the agenda?\" \"Clete and I are going to clean house. You're going to clean the streets. Send all the girls to Eight-three Harman Avenue. I'll start the detox program. Clete's going to take care of everything else.\" \"Terrific. I'll be dying from the heat.\" \"You'll be there before things get too warm out. Dutch, the kid comes through fine. We'll get her home. Get your bike and leathers.\" Dutch rode the city streets. The girls were all addicts, scared and abused. They really wanted his protection. After he removed several 'supervisors,' they believed he could give it to them. He sent them to Clete and Lane, nearly thirty of them. He found the man in gray recruiting, with his fists and an injector. \"Get away from her. Do it now. I'm not supposed to kill you. If you use that injector, I may not be able to keep my promise.\" \"I don't know who you are, but you'd better mind your own business. My boys don't like nosy people.\" \"This is my business. I'm Dutch. One of the Gallant boys. Your operation has just been acquired. You've been fired. Get away from that girl.\" \"Get him boys.\" There were only five of them, hulking brutes and slow. Dutch finished with them just as the man in gray injected the girl of about fifteen. She screamed and he slapped her down. It was nearly the last thing he ever did. Dutch held him in the air and looked in his eyes. He was shaking with rage. He wasn't going to be able to keep his promise. Then the girl whimpered. \"Thank her. I don't want her to see me rip your heart out. Say thank you and run. Run fast.\" \"Th...Thank you.\" He set the man on his feet and he ran. Dutch picked up the sobbing child and put her on the bike. He had to strap her to the backrest. She reached out an unsteady hand, touched the tears on his cheek, then passed out. He rode to the house and through the door Lane opened for him. A path had been cleared for him through the litter on the walk. Ten pieces of litter \"Bring her this way. I've got a room just for her.\" \"I found the man in gray, Lane. He beat her and injected her. I didn't finish with his boys fast enough to stop him. I've never wanted to kill anyone like I did him. She stopped me. She didn't need to see what I would have done. If she hadn't been conscious, I couldn't have stopped myself.\" \"I know, Dutch. Even I felt your pain and anger. It was real rough on Clete. Inject her with this, then use the medunit on her. Both will lessen the effect of the drug in her system. She'll sleep through the worst of it. When you're done, find us. The drug they're on has an additive. The girls you sent and the ones who were here have real needs. Detox takes three days. We have nine more cities on five worlds, then we go back to the show. We'll meet the gray man and his bosses on the second world the show hits. You have to not kill him again on the first. It'll be easier. Door at the top of the stairs when you're done here.\" Dutch nodded and went to work on the child. They couldn't 'reverse' the drug, but they could block the addiction. Lane would tell him when she'd awaken. He would be there and he'd get her home. He'd thought he was prepared when he opened the door. \"Whoa! Easy, easy. I'm here to help. Slowly. Help! Lane, I'm being smothered.\" \"They can't help it, Dutch. Clete's on his way. He synthesized something to help with detox.\" \"Damn! I hope he... hurries.\" \"I did. Here use this on them. Don't worry if you lose track. Extra doses won't hurt. Unh. Did you say three days, Lane?\" \"Yes, and nine... cities.\" \"Done.\" Dutch was sitting beside her when the girl awoke. She was shaking and sweating. She grabbed for him, but he held her off. \"It's the drug they gave you. You're almost through. We got a blocking agent into you to prevent the addiction. I can put you back to sleep if you want me to.\" \"No. Oh! Find me something! Something to do!\" \"Can you cook? There are a lot of women here who need food. They're all the way addicted. My brothers and I are... \" \"Busy, I'll bet. I'll cook. It's better if... I think you should show me the kitchen, then go away. I know what the stuff does. I'll fight it. It'll just be easier if you're not close.\" \"I'm Dutch. I'll show you the kitchen. What's your name?\" \"Chrissa. On second thought, you go on. I'll find the kitchen.\" Dutch grinned. She'd be out from under the influence of both drugs in a few hours. He'd take her home as soon as she was. Until then, he'd stay out of the kitchen. Clete was sleeping. He wished he could sleep, but his teeth felt like they were rattling. Clete purred in his sleep. \"Chrissa is cooking for us all. Some of you. Damn! Some of you go help. Bring... ow... easy... food back for us. Clete! Wake up! Go ahead. Wake him.\" \"Oh. Hello. Take a nap, Dutch.\" \"Lane needs one. I'm... fine.\" \"You heard. I need a nap. Clete, stop purring!\" Dutch needed a rest by the time all the women had been fed. Lane told him Crissa was ready to go home and he smiled as he headed for the kitchen. It was exactly the break he wanted. \"Hi, Chrissa. Ready to go home?\" \"Can you get along without a cook?\" \"Yes, the drugs are wearing off. We'll be making coffee and passing out pain killers for the next day-and-a-half.\" \"Dutch, a lot of these girls aren't much older than I am. That man did the same thing to them as he tried to do to me. He likes to beat them up. He deserves what you wanted to do to him.\" \"I know. It will happen, Chrissa. He won't get any more girls. I promise.\" He took her home and was very surprised when she kissed him. She whispered, \"It wasn't all the drug.\" He grinned as she ran in the front door. Her parents were good ones. She was proof of it. She'd called them, as soon as she awakened. Her father stepped out of the door, as he pulled away, quickly. He felt nice, but he already had all the thank-yous he could handle. He rode back to the house and sighed. His teeth were rattling again. It wasn't fun, but Clete found helping the women very pleasurable and his total understanding, including of what the drug did to them how, assured them of their identity as individuals. There was even laughter and shared humor. The purring was an irritation, but he didn't really resent it, nor look forward to the end of it. Clete would share their suffering, just as he did their pleasure and gratitude. Withdrawal wasn't easy for any of them. The women shook and cried and begged for the drug. Clete held the young ones who were terrified. Dutch and Lane did their best to help, but he was their most effective detox agent. Small doses of pain killer were given to the girls he said needed them badly. None of the girls had been addicts before they were recruited with an injector. There would be no relapses among them. Then they moved and started on a new city. When they rode their bikes back to Melissa after finishing that one, Dutch climbed off his and sighed. Clete raised an eyebrow and Lane smiled and nodded. \"What's the matter, Dutch?\" \"I wish they hadn't been quite so grateful, Lane.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm tired of my teeth rattling.\" \"You're just plain tired. We need rest. Leave the bike and hit the spa. Clete can load it. I'd love to see their faces when they find out we busted their sideline on five different planets on the same three days.\" \"Isn't that telling them something we don't want them to know?\" \"Do you want them to believe the man in gray when he tells them he's seen us in the show on one of the same days?\" \"No. You're right. Who'd believe it? Lane, what's wrong? Clete! Help me with him. The couch. Lane?\" \"He's dizzy, Dutch, but not... in trouble.\" \"I'm... all right. It all came back. I can see... forever again. Most of the dross is gone. Just one path again. All the roads not taken... aren't there. I'm fine. Go on. Get some rest. I'll look a bit.\" They spent forty-two days on five worlds, with recovery time between, all on the same three days, then landed Melissa on the Merriment ten minutes after they'd dropped Frake and Merith off. They started rehearsals and were ready when they landed two days later. Another beauty pageant was about to go on. Clete looked up in surprise when Frake walked over to where they were assembling risers. \"Exasperated? You feel like you're growling under your breath.\" \"Good description, Clete. They haven't done any paring down at all.\" \"I thought the place was too crowded. Left it all to you?\" \"I hope you boys don't mind. You and Merith are going to judge the preliminary rounds. We'll never get this thing on otherwise. No real problem. The scoring sheets are simple. This is all talent and personality. Beauty we leave to the judges picked by the sponsors. This is an all human pageant. You'll even know if the music is good. I'm going to visit the circus and have a look around.\" \"Frake you're going to find out they're paying too. Don't mention us. We have to do this one ourselves. It's very nasty. People will get killed if it's not handled exactly right. There are a whole bunch of bad apples in that barrel.\" \"Understood, Lane. I'll stick to my regular routine of 'Hi, we're the other attraction. How are the crowds?' and leave it at that.\" \"Good. We'll do our best here. Later.\" Merith had to remind them everyone wasn't perfect. They finally started giving realistic scores after they'd had to sit through two very bad performances twice. Merith was very fair. If they handed her something unrealistic, she called the entire group of six for a repeat. She was also good at keeping the contestants from trying to influence them. Dutch thought she was a little too good. He didn't really meet anyone. The contestants were grouped by type of performance, but the groups weren't all singers together, then all dancers. Just as they began to get tired of something, the type of performance changed. The 'personality interviews' were intersprersed with them as well. Merith noted there was a great deal more to Frake's job, and Frake, than was apparent on the surface. They all agreed. He'd set it up so what could have been a tedious task was actually pleasant. \"You know, I'm edgy. My teeth feel, well, funny.\" \"Merith, you're sitting too close to Clete. He's purring. Our teeth have been rattling for days.\" \"Purring? I don't understand, Dutch.\" \"Neither do we. He doesn't even know he's doing it. You must have a fairly high psi rating. Most people don't... That's why you're so good at estimating a house and knowing what people need!\" \"How about that? It's good for something after all. Six more, then I'll tabulate. Uh, oh, three of these list their talent as martial arts. I don't know anything about them.\" \"Don't worry. Just watch for gracefulness. We'll judge competency. That we do know.\" They got to the last contestant and things came to an abrupt halt. Lane expected it, but it didn't surprise Dutch when Clete suddenly stood either. \"Damn. Stop! I'm not going to sit here and watch you injure yourself. What's the matter with your sensei?\" \"Clete, calm down. Oh, well, there he goes.\" \"What's he doing, Dutch? I thought she was pretty good.\" \"She's practiced very hard, Merith, but she's practiced wrong. Give him five minutes. She deserves another chance.\" \"Dutch, a judge can't help a contestant. It's not fair.\" \"Lane?\" \"Merith, he couldn't let her go on. She was causing herself pain. We saw it too. She nearly dislocated her shoulder. She'll do something else. Wait'll you hear this, Dutch. You think Clete's purring. Hi, Clete.\" \"Lane, you knew this was coming.\" \"I also knew she wouldn't hurt herself badly before you stopped her. She needed what you showed her or she might have really damaged herself, Clete.\" \"Probably. She took some private lessons, but hasn't started university classes with a new sensei yet and has been practicing on her own. I told her we'd give her a few minutes. She said she'd actually planned on doing something else, but there were so many singers she changed her mind.\" They waited for her to change and warm up. She came back out and started to sing in a clear, sweet, soprano. She sang the words, \"Someday, my prince will come,\" and Dutch moaned in pleasure. She made the finals and a friend. \"Hi. I'm Dutch. You just sang my favorite song.\" \"I'm Sabitha Berke. Sabbi. I didn't think anyone would know it. It's ancient, but I've always loved it.\" \"Mid-twentieth century Disney; Snow White. We've got a complete collection. Clete's even got a perfectly preserved cel. Fantasia's a close second, but Snow White is my favorite.\" \"You're kidding. I thought I was the only person in existence who thought Snow White was the greatest of the classic animations.\" \"It was the first of it's kind. Look, we're done here. I'm no longer a judge. I don't think there's any rule that says we can't have dinner together. Would you be my guest?\" \"I'd like to, but I doubt it would make my mother happy. She worries about me. She didn't want me to do this. She's outside pacing.\" \"Some people have a low opinion of beauty pageants.\" \"Some worlds only have them for females, don't have a university grade-point minimum for entry and prizes are money. We have one for a six-year sports medicine scholarship called the Junior Apollo Pageant that makes the competition in this one look light. I feel sorry for some of those poor boys. Two years ago a pair of mothers got in a fist fight, when the artistic director said one of two in blue needed to change. My mom just thinks it's too much to do right now, but I want that scholarship for doctoral studies. I'm not counting on it, especially after seeing the competition, but it would certainly be nice not to have to scramble to put together a bunch of little ones for tuition.\" \"Dutch, take her mother too. They need you with them. Try not to break anyone.\" \"Right, Lane. That's it. We're having dinner. Is your mother as beautiful as you are?\" \"More. She's why I like Snow White so much, and she looks like her. When she's not worrying about me, she's a lot of fun.\" \"Let's not keep her waiting. She's probably worried already. By the way, I liked your answers to the questions too. Ah, your daughter is right. You are very beautiful. I'm Dutch. I'm your escort for this evening.\" \"Escort?\" \"Yes. Too many nasty people around. You're Snow White. How did you step out of my dreams?\" \"Snow White was a young girl. I'm almost fifty.\" \"I didn't say off the screen. I said out of my dreams. I like my dream women grown up.\" \"Sabbi, we have an escort. My name's Rose.\" \"It would have to be. Wait. Let me think. Oh, yes. I put them... there.\" Sabbi and Rose stared at the red roses he had pulled from the air and handed to them. Dutch loved it. He had spent days working out the math for the pocket of nontime just above his shoulder and stocking it with roses. He was using it for the first time and was delighted with the effect. \"Just a little trick copied from a real master. Took my brothers and me a long time to figure out how he did it. Now, I think dinner, then a show, a little dancing… Oops, I forgot. Sabbi has a curfew. An early evening then. A concert? There's one in the park a few blocks from here.\" \"The Grennert symphony with Braslerc conducting. I'd decided it probably wasn't a good idea for the two of us and was a bit disappointed we'd miss it.\" \"I'm delighted to be able to assure you don't, Rose. I'm in heaven. A beautiful woman on each arm.\" They had a wonderful time at dinner. Rose was a Disney authority. She taught media history at a small arts college in a distant city. Sabbi was a sociology student at the university in the same city. They were walking to the concert when a gang of young thugs attacked them. Dutch was careful. \"Good. I didn't break any of them. Addicts. Injectors in their pockets. I hate drugs, but they seem to be a symptom of societies that haven't reached the rewarding-work-for-all stage. Improvements in drive design will bring the travel time down and in fifty years you'll be part of the Fed and it just won't be. Sabbi, call the authorities. They'll put them in rehab. Maybe it'll take with one or two. Sabbi?\" \"Where did you learn that? How can you move so fast? There were six of them and they were armed.\" \"Martial arts are a family tradition and I got a lot more training when I attended the academy. I move that fast because my father isn't human. They were carrying weapons, but they really don't know how to use them. Now, let's call the authorities and go to the concert.\" Rose laughed and Sabbi made the call. Dutch took them to the concert and escorted them to their hotel. Rose said she didn't have a curfew. She and Dutch were dancing in the hotel lounge when Lane walked through the doors. He met them at their table. \"You were right, they needed me. Rose, this is my brother, Lane.\" \"Hi, Rose. I'm sorry to end your evening, but we need Dutch.\" \"I know someone who's expecting trouble when I see one. Thank you, Dutch. It was a nice evening.\" \"I enjoyed it immensely. Don't wait outside tomorrow. Come in. I'll see you to your room.\" \"No, I think I'll stay here awhile.\" \"Lane?\" \"She'll be fine. Trouble is other places. Goodnight, Rose. I'll wait, Dutch. Don't be long. We've got a time limit.\" Dutch said goodnight and followed Lane. He caught up with him a few steps down the back stairs of the hotel. \"What's up?\" \"Men with injectors in hotels, with weapons at the theater, sabotage at the circus. A very busy night. Clete is going to get hurt. So am I. Melissa is in the basement. We have to be several places at nearly the same time. There's just enough difference to make it seem possible. This is why we needed to learn the healing technique. Don't worry when we're under for a long time. We come through.\" \"I don't like it.\" \"I won't either. It's going to hurt. I muscled in on the circus earlier. Clete located a dozen roustabouts who needed firing and two performers who are addicts. One of the owners was the dealer. I bought him out. The other two owners were delighted. First stop Radmort Suites.\" They cleared five hotels, then removed six men at the circus. They repaired damaged equipment intended to injure performers and got rid of poisoned feed intended to kill animals. Lane put a hand out to stop them just before they went back into the theater where the pageant was being held. \"This is where things get rough, Dutch. These guys are different. They're pros and they're after us. I don't know how many you have to take alone after Clete and I go down. We get nine together. I sent everyone else away. Get ready. Clete, backstage. I'll take the balcony. Dutch, house. Go!\" Dutch ducked the beam and went after its source. He found him and went after the next. He heard firing on the stage and in the balcony. He started counting. When he got to eight, he felt Clete get hit. At nine, Lane. He took out the tenth and got wary. Everyone left would be looking for him. The tenth man had made a lot of noise. He decided he was in a hurry. He made himself a target. At least five more. He quit being careful with them. He took out four and listened. Nothing. He made himself a target again and someone nearly hit it. Three had fired at him. He found two of them. He heard a door slam and wondered if one had left. He decided it was a trick. He was right. He broke one of the two who had set up a crossfire near Clete. He checked him. He was in trance. He found the last man near Lane. He actually didn't mean to drop him from the balcony. Lane was in trance too. He carried him into Melissa, then got Clete. He put Melissa in flight and wondered where the coordinates Lane had set would take them. He was delighted when she landed at one of their favorite places to fish. He waited for them to come out of trance. It was a full day before Clete smiled at him, drank the water he held for him then went to sleep. Lane did the same about two hours later. Dutch breathed a sigh of relief and went fishing. They'd be hungry when they woke up. He spent about as much time checking on the two of them as he did fishing and kept a mental 'hand' on them the rest of the time, but he had plenty to cook when he built the fire and started frying them. Clete walked out of Melissa as he was cooking the last pan of fillets. \"Mmm. Bass. Enough for three?\" \"Actually, enough for five, Clete. I figured you'd be hungry. I'll bring these in when they're done. Fix something to go with them. I can feel Lane's about to wake up too. I'm sure bass, pan-fried over an open fire, was what he had in mind for breakfast. He's awake.\" \"You've been using a lot of energy monitoring us. Have you slept at all?\" \"Well... \" \"I thought not. Food then bed. I'll finish here. Lane will know. He'll be in the kitchen. Go find him.\" Clete was right. Lane was in the kitchen and had obviously made preparations before they went to find trouble. Dutch followed his nose. \"Eat. The bass will be here before you finish your salad. Fried potatoes coming up. You're out on your feet. You've barely slept in five days.\" \"I guess it has been five days. Didn't realize. Got in a couple hours when I got too groggy working on the math for my pocket. Then I played with it. After that we got busy. No wonder I'm tired.\" \"Bass.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Mmm, hungry too. Hey, you guys are the ones who were hurt. I'm supposed to be taking care of you.\" \"You already did. It's our turn. Clete, get him a hot bath ready. I'll have our plates fixed when you get back.\" \"A bath sounds good.\" \"Dutch, we need recuperation time. We're going to spend ten days here, then go back and clear the theater.\" \"You said you didn't know how many there were.\" \"I don't. Actually, I should have said you and Clete are going to clear the theater. I'm going to disarm the bomb under the stage.\" \"Lane, those people really don't like us.\" \"I know. Ain't it great?\" Dutch laughed, finished his meal and headed for his bath. Clete and Lane ate, then gently lifted him out of the water and tucked him in bed. He didn't awaken. They spent ten days recovering their strength and speed. They weren't quite in peak form, but Lane said they would be before they needed to be. They traveled back to the theater and he went to disarm the bomb. He didn't learn how many men had been left, but Clete did. They had taken nine together. Dutch had gotten the other ten alone and he'd only broken three of them. They left them stacked on the sidewalk with their broken weapons nearby. Dutch called the police and lodged a litter complaint. There were piles of trash in front of hotels, a theater, even in front of the civic arena. They spent the night working on creating and stocking pockets. It had taken them years to figure out their father's trick with the roses. They'd learned a great deal in the process, especially Clete. They'd all put on muscle too. Clete enjoyed math most with a barbell in his hands. Their father had put a reader above the weight bench when he'd complained he didn't have time for both lifting and math, and he'd been combining them ever since. Arguing they could work on the math with him without the barbells didn't work. Dutch had given up trying to change Lane's memory that it never would, while they were still in the academy. They wondered how long it would be before they could throw things into the air and have doves appear, or create showers of flower petals, or tap things into existence. Lane grinned and said awhile, but pulling a rose from the air for every lady escorted would make a nice addition to the show the next night. Frake found them putting the risers in place in the morning. \"Hi, boys. I have a little surprise for you. I had the programs printed up. I hope you like them.\" \"Featuring the Gallants as escorts. How about that? We're featured. Thanks, Frake.\" \"You're the best part of our show, Dutch. I wanted to tell you so. Where it counts.\" \"We'll costume appropriately. All right! You've expanded the show! I've got to find a horse. Later.\" \"A horse?\" \"Don't worry Frake. It'll be great. Merith chose the finalists for your featured performances, didn't she?\" \"Yes, Lane. She said Clete was impressed with the martial arts one. The other four were strictly her choice. Dancer, singer, dramatic reading, and musician. Said they were too good not to use. I need to get ready before the local crew arrive to open the ticket booth and the lobby lounge. My idea of how much is too much and that of bartenders don't always match. See you onstage.\" \"What's up, Lane? I like to know what I'm anticipating with relish.\" \"Well, tonight we costume as fairytale princes. Dutch is going to borrow a white horse from the circus.\" \"And?\" \"Clete, do you really want me to tell you who's going to win?\" \"No, it would be too hard to hold nervous hands and feel them hoping if I know they won't win.\" Dutch wasn't gone long. Lane and Clete were just putting the last riser in place. \"I found one and he's a beauty. Perfect. I know what to wear tonight too. I hope we've got a pattern.\" \"We don't, Dutch, but I'll go get us one. I'll see you in eight days and be back in ten minutes. I'll store a lot of costume patterns. We'll need them eventually.\" Lane knew where he had to go. Only one place would have everything, Earth in the twentieth century. He spent three nights and a morning there; one night in the wardrobe at Disneyland and the others at Universal Studios and Paramount. He copied only two women's costumes. He spent the morning at the floral market in Amsterdam. He spent the return trip storing flowers in nontime. He found Dutch and Clete reassembling the light bank, but they were nearly done. Clete growled his hello. \"I know, Clete, I need a nap. I've got real roses. Interested? I'll show you where I put them and tell you what I've got in mind.\" \"Clete, let's get this together quick. He's about asleep on his feet.\" \"Dutch, if you two don't quit abusing yourselves, we're never going to get back in top form. Lane says we're going to compete next stop. I'd like us to be ready.\" \"We'll be ready if it takes a month. There. Let's go. I want roses that are dew-touched and real.\" Lane showed them the flowers and gave Dutch the codes for the women's costumes. He'd know what to do with them. He laughed when Clete scooped him up, carried him to his room and dropped him on his bed. He'd forgotten it was going to happen. He'd had other things on his mind, like keeping Dutch from going after the gray man when he saw him in the audience. Sabbi just stared at Dutch with her mouth open. Rose laughed in delight. They both recognized the two garments he held. \"The song needed the costume, Sabbi. A lot more people than you realize will recognize it.\" \"Oh, Dutch, thank you! They're wonderful!\" \"I didn't do it. I'm just delivery boy. You have to thank Lane. He put a lot of work into getting them for you.\" \"Where is he?\" \"Asleep. Clete tossed him in bed.\" \"Did he spend all night getting these?\" \"More than all night. Those are the real Disney. The same ones they used at the Disney parks on Earth. He didn't tell me how he got them. Well, the pattern was of the real thing. The gown may be old-fashioned, but it's fairytale princess beautiful.\" \"Dutch, make sure I see him before the show. I want to give him a big kiss.\" \"He'll find you for that. You can bet on it.\" He did. He also told her to make sure to listen for her music and be ready to sing any time she heard it. He was a bit dazed. He had known he would be, but reality was much more intense. He suddenly decided he wanted to make a change. He was about wobbling by the time he found his brothers. \"Dutch, I want to ride the horse. Would you let me?\" \"Oh, boy. Clete, do you feel what I see?\" \"Uh, huh. This is a change. He's nervous about your answer. Doesn't know what you'll say.\" \"I say yes. Whoa!\" \"Nice catch, Dutch. Let's get him over there where he won't get dirty.\" \"Damn. It shouldn't have been that big a change, Clete. What did it do?\" \"Made him incredibly happy. Dutch, our brother's in love.\" \"I'm glad it's her mother I'm interested in. This could have been awkward.\" \"It still will be. I'm quite a bit older. Dutch, thank you. It doesn't change things on our current project, but it makes my future a lot richer. I'm going to marry her.\" \"What's the sadness?\" \"We won't have any children, Clete. Not of our own. She'll have hundreds to love. She's going to do exactly what she said she wanted to do.\" \"Build a place for unwanted children.\" \"Yes, Dutch, we help her. I won't see her enough for me, but a lot of time for her. At least, if nothing changes.\" \"Lane, changes we make other places shouldn't have any effect on her. You see her life. You're in it. We'll keep you from getting killed. You'll be there and so will she.\" \"Thank you, I... I was--\" \"Afraid of change. We'll watch over her. What? What is it?\" \"Clete... later. I'll ask later. I see it. I'll know. Sometimes I get in a hurry. I want it before its time.\" \"You missed this one, Lane. The answer is yes. When the time is right, we'll take Sabbi the son Helen found a way to give me. All you see is asking me when you're ready.\" \"How did you know?\" \"I suddenly realized there would be a place for him. We can't give him one. Now, since we've got her future all planned, don't you think we should get to work on her present?\" Things went smoothly until Dutch saw the gray man. He stood at the front of the stage dressed as a fairytale prince and looked like the hunter he was. Heads turned to see his prey. The gray man saw people looking at him and left quickly. Clete and Lane kept Dutch from following him. It wasn't easy. The incident had a strange effect. It should have made the crowd nervous, made the show tense. It didn't. When the gray man left, the audience stood and cheered. They didn't have any trouble telling heroes from villains. Sabbi's song brought a thunderous ovation. Dutch wondered why Lane hadn't ridden the horse. He suddenly realized why when he saw him talking to the orchestra conductor and smiled. Sabbi would sing again. The production numbers went well and all the performers were wonderful. The girls made their final costume change and the formal presentation in the ball gown competition began. The crowd went wild when roses were plucked from the air and given to each contestant. The presentation ended with the curtsy and the audience roared its approval. Dutch smiled and winked at Rose in the front row. Sabbi's very old-fashioned costume had brought gasps of recognition and whispers throughout the theater. The world was a bit 'arts crazy' in general and media history was a popular hobby. Two of the judges had recognized it, too. The runners-up were named and Clete and Dutch grinned at Lane. He looked like a runner in a race, waiting for the starting gun. Merith was holding the beautiful white horse in the wings and the orchestra conductor whispered instructions. They all knew. It had become obvious to everyone but her. Frake opened the envelope and called out, \"And the winner of the twenty-fifth annual Woman of Our Dreams Pageant is... Sabitha Berke!\" She looked stunned. Frake escorted her to center stage and the previous year's winner crowned her. Clete draped the sash and Dutch fastened the cape. Lane dropped down on one knee before her. There was a flash of light and he held a bouquet of eighteen, dew-fresh, long-stemmed, red roses up to her. He rose and laid them in her arms and they bowed her onto the runway. When she reached the end of it, the orchestra segued into her song. A hush fell over the audience and they watched. Lane rode out onto the runway on the magnificent white horse and lifted his beautiful baritone voice in duet. She turned, saw him, and watched him dismount \"I'm here, if you'll have me.\" He took her in his arms and kissed her. He lifted her onto the saddle and mounted. The crowd went crazy. They rode back to center stage and the other contestants showered them with their flowers. Sabbi settled into Lane's arms and leaned against his chest. Her prince had come. Dutch leapt off the stage, bowed, and offered Rose his arm. He escorted her to the stage and Clete bowed and offered his. Dutch grinned at Clete. \"Since it looks like we're going to be family, why don't you come to dinner in our home tonight?\" Frake cued a spotlight on Sabbi and Lane and brought the stage lights down. The conductor led the orchestra into a soft reprise of her song and the audience began to sing. At first, a soft voice here and there, but soon, a chorus that filled the theater with song and eyes with tears. No one would ever forget the night they saw a fairytale come true. Clete shook his head when Dutch escorted Rose into the kitchen after giving her a tour of Melissa. He'd have known what the headshake meant even if Rose hadn't voiced it as soon as she sat down. \"You do know this isn't possible?\" \"Why does everyone I bring home say that? It's possible or it wouldn't exist, Rose. It's just based on some very complicated physics. It's a dimensional matrix.\" \"Dutch, who are you? Who is my daughter so suddenly in love with? What are you doing with this show?\" \"We're half-brothers. We all have the same father. Gallant, Knight Hero. He's not human. The ship is his creation. We have been accepted as the defenders of life in this universe. Clete is Sir Pericles Buchannon, Knight Guardian. I'm Sir Roberrin Duchelle, Knight Champion. Lane is Sir Apollo Avelaine, Knight Judge. He's the son of two good and powerful beings. He sees the future. We're here to end a very nasty ring of extortion, forced prostitution and drug smuggling. This group of worlds can't become part of the Fed until that's done.\" \"The man tonight?\" \"I was just a bit too late to stop him from beating up a fifteen-year-old girl and injecting her with drugs. He was recruiting. We got her through it. I didn't kill him because Lane said he'll lead us to the bosses.\" \"But you wanted to.\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Good.\" \"Rose, you surprise me.\" \"My husband was a police officer, a detective. Five years ago he stumbled across something really evil. He was murdered on our doorstep. Overdosed with drugs. I didn't see the killer's face, but he wore gray. Now, how do you three cause enough trouble to break up something the size of what he found? It covered most of the unaligned planets in this sector.\" \"By being several places at once. You're in a ship that travels in time and space. Sabbi won't be alone most of the time.\" \"She's very young, Dutch.\" \"Lane knows. It's one of the first things he said. He's patient. He really does see the future. Remembers it.\" \"Why didn't he know about Sabbi before?\" \"You ask hard questions. We change the future. We make choices.\" \"Tell her true, Dutch. You change the future. Lane didn't know about Sabbi until you changed the future. You told him he could ride the horse.\" \"Thanks, Clete, you're a big help.\" \"Rose, each of us brings something to what we are. Lane is the investigator, the inquiring mind. I'm an empath, the feeling and the, might as well say it, passion. Dutch is the driving force, the will. Together, we make a pretty powerful team. We've chosen to make ourselves into a force for good.\" \"And who decides what good is?\" \"You're right, Dutch, she does ask hard questions. He had to earn it first, but Dutch was given the right and responsibility to decide. Don't ask by who. This one you have to take on faith, just as we did. Now, let's have supper. We've had to give this explanation too many times. You deserved it, so we did it again.\" \"Where are Sabbi and Lane?\" \"In his apartments. I'd say she's getting the same explanation you are. Come on, Rose, relax. You trust us in general. Trust Lane. He really is her prince.\" \"How old is he?\" \"Twenty-eight. Give or take a few million years and a universe or two.\" \"That answer was not reassuring.\" \"It wasn't meant to be. Rose, she loves him. He's worthy of it. That's enough. Now, let's eat. I'm starving.\" Clete didn't quite know what to do about her. She was still worried and nervous. Sabbi and Lane solved the problem. They walked in hand-in-hand and so obviously in love, she melted. All her reservations evaporated. Her daughter was happy. It was enough. The little kitchen nook became warm and cozy and they became family. Things even smoothed enough for Rose and Dutch to take notice of their mutual attraction again. Yes, warm and cozy. \"Clete!\" \"What? What did I do? Oh. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens when I feel content. I really can't do anything about it, Dutch.\" \"What's he mean? What's he doing?\" \"Rattling my teeth, Sabbi. He's purring!\"",

      "content": "Chapter Five A vacation on a lovely Fed planet was a nice surprise, but Clete knew Lane was right about it turning into work and they weren't in good condition yet. He glanced over at Dutch and grabbed a shirt. \"Dutch, you're turning pink. You didn't use screen again. Put this on.\" \"Uh, oh. Thanks, Clete. I didn't expect to be in the sun this much or I'd have remembered.\" \"Sure you would.\" \"Lane's over there someplace.\" \"Yeah, and very relaxed, near somnolent. At least he'll have screen with him. That shirt's too big. We're still underweight.\" \"Muscle mass takes time to rebuild.\" \"I know. I'm worried about how much time we'll have. There's something wrong here. A nervous undercurrent. Tense. That ought to wake Lane up. Thought so.\" \"What did you do?\" \"Decided we go on a full ten-day training schedule tomorrow.\" \"Oh, Clete! We're supposed to be on vacation!\" \"Lane said it was going to turn into work. It just did. Ten/five/ten run. Dawn tomorrow. Dutch, I really believe it's necessary. I doubt we'll get in the full ten days. Feel like doing a few katas?\" \"No, but I will. Odds on how long before Lane shows up?\" \"I can feel how close he is. Tai chi. Begin.\" \"You knew I was coming. You could have waited for me.\" \"Get in line, Lane. Too fast, Dutch. From the beginning.\" Clete moved them into the shade. They could cure sunburn, but avoiding it was always first choice. He seldom forgot sunscreen and Lane would be severely teased if he did, but Dutch never seemed to remember it. By the time they finished three hours of what should have been light exercise, they knew they were in worse condition than they'd realized. Clete designed a diet for them. They'd been starved. They had used some of their body mass to stay alive. Dutch added a bit to their schedule, a meditation routine. He wanted to see if they could increase their ability to distance their minds from their bodies. If they could, they would never go through the kind of pain they had suffered again. He nearly gave up the idea in panic when Lane went under and he spent an hour trying to bring him back, but both Lane and Clete believed they should go on. They trained their bodies and began to learn to control them to the deepest physiological function. An 'accident' taught them how well they'd learned. \"DUTCH! Lane! Come on! He's hurt!\" Lane followed Clete into the sea. Dutch was in real trouble. How had he missed it? Why hadn't he seen it? The sudden shift in current had pulled Dutch against the wreck he had been exploring. His snorkeling partner was struggling to free him from the entangling weeds. Riss was hanging on against the panic she felt as she swam in the cloud of blood at his side. She swam to the surface and took him a lung full of air. Then started working to free him again. Suddenly his brothers were there. She got him another lung full of air and he smiled and motioned her up. They brought him up and began floating him to shore. Clete felt her fear and pulled her in. \"He'll be all right, Riss. He's in a state of trance. It slows his metabolism and reduces the blood loss. You saved his life. You did well.\" \"Oh, Clete, it came so sudden. It pushed him into the wreck and tangled him in weeds. I didn't have anything to cut him loose with and there was so much blood and I just--\" \"Easy, easy. It looked like a lot of blood because it dispersed so fast. He's not hurt as bad as you think he is.\" \"Clete, I know how bad it is. It was the first thing I checked.\" \"Riss... Oh, damn. We're not human, or not completely anyway. We're half something else.\" \"I know. He has two hearts. I like the double beat.\" \"Well, we've been learning to control our bodies. Dutch is the best. He's healing already. Go look.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"Clete, what did you tell her? Damn! Clete, she's right. It's not possible. The wound's closing. Healing as I watch it. In... twenty minutes it'll be gone.\" \"WHAT?!\" \"Come on. Let's get him above the tide line.\" \"Hello. Thanks, Riss. You saved... Why are you all staring at me?\" \"We're going to move you into the shade, Dutch. Go back into trance and finish healing yourself.\" \"What are you talking about, Clete?\" \"Just go back under. We'll talk about it when you wake up. Lane, I'm going to buy Riss and I a drink. We'll be back. Come on, Riss. You look like you need one as bad as I do. Hot cocoa with something minty.\" \"I'm with you.\" Lane watched them walk off and smiled. Clete didn't need a drink, but he must have thought Riss did, or at least that she needed the walk and something warm. Somehow Dutch had learned to put himself in a healing trance. The injury wasn't really bad, not much more than a nasty gash. The entangling weeds, blood loss and shock had been the real danger. He worked to get rid of the guilt he had missed the incident in his memory and put it in perspective. They had learned something invaluable from it and that was what was most important. Dutch came out of his trance after a very few minutes, looked at his side, grinned at Lane and went to sleep. Lane noted the sleep. It told him the healing trance required an energy expenditure. Normal trance conserved energy and revitalized. He had timed the trance. He would time the sleep. If it was about equal, they could assume at least Dutch had inherited another of their father's physical attributes. He thought about missing the memory of the incident and wondered if he hadn't been intended to. The fact he hadn't become dizzy... Clete looked slightly disgusted when they came back. He hadn't been extremely successful getting rid of the guilt. \"How is he?\" \"Asleep, Clete. Just grinned at me and went to sleep.\" \"Oh, I see.\" \"Well I don't.\" \"Riss, I can't explain it, but what he did made him tired.\" \"What are you besides human? Your blood's red. You look like us. That's not extremely unusual, but this is.\" \"Our father is... Well, he's from an older species, more physically advanced. He thinks most of his people are boring. Spends most of his time with humans. Prefers their company. Spent several years with Clete's mom.\" \"Lane, are you telling me you had a different mother than Clete?\" \"Oh, I'd say she was different. Wouldn't you, Clete?\" \"Very.\" \"The longer I'm around you guys, the more confused I get.\" Dutch lifted himself to his elbows and smiled. \"That's why you're with me. I'm a much simpler person.\" He looked from his two brothers to the pert little brunette he really liked and wondered why they were all laughing. They continued with the meditation routine and began to notice it was having more effects on them than expected. Lane answered the question in Dutch's eyes when he sat down across the counter from him in the kitchen. \"We're changing. Our temperatures are lower. Our resting pulse rates are slower. Our entire metabolisms have slowed.\" \"I get cold easily, Lane. I had to come back to Melissa for a sweater last night.\" \"You can speed up your metabolism to compensate, Dutch, probably to a much higher rate. With sufficient fuel, you'd probably barely notice sub-zero.\" \"I'm not sure I like it.\" \"Remember how easily Dad got chilled? We'd be broiling and he'd be wearing a jacket. Well, that's about where we are. Not quite that extreme, but moving that direction.\" \"I don't understand about you, Lane. We're half human. You're not. Why are you... Why weren't you like this before?\" \"You, Dutch.\" \"Duh.\" \"I spent my entire childhood waiting for you. Wanting to be with you. Wanting to be... more than just your half-brother.\" \"I never think of you that way. I never have.\" \"I know. Just goes to show how tight the bond of our father's heritage is. You didn't think of us as half-brothers from the moment you met Dad.\" \"Maybe more than even just brothers, the triplets everyone thought we were.\" \"Aren't we? Aren't we one who became three?\" \"Or are we three becoming one?\" \"Does it matter? Would you change it?\" \"What a silly question. And I can't say I mind becoming more like Dad either. In fact, I've decided I'm going to be rather smug about it.\" \"You look even more like him than we do, Goldilocks. Let's find Clete. I've remembered something.\" They found Clete, relieved him of his barbell, and pushed him toward the spa. He had regained nearly all the mass he'd lost and he pulled both of them in with him. He was pleased with the success of the training program and their timing was, if anything, better. They laughed and played a bit, then settled into quiet relaxation. Lane began to tell them of the images and the change that was needed. \"The current that caught Dutch is a fairly common occurrence. Ten years ago it was an occasional one; twenty, nonexistent. The entangling weeds weren't a result of the current. They caused it.\" \"I felt it! I didn't recognize it, but when I was trying to free him, I was feeling an... anger that wasn't my own. It wasn't focused. Just a formless anger.\" \"That's right, Clete, a formless anger. It's growing stronger.\" \"Lane, there's… evil here. Deep and ugly. A cold malevolence. A power of destruction. Strongest near the sea. I want to do something about it.\" \"That's the decision that gave me memories, Dutch. We find an island. It's in the southern ocean. It's the source of the hate. We feel the malevolence. It's not natural to this world. The island is volcanic. It hasn't been active for thousands of years. That changes abruptly.\" \"And?\" \"That's it, Dutch.\" \"All right, we know what you mean. How do we get to the island?\" \"By boat.\" \"I want to take Melissa.\" \"Changing. No good.\" \"I think we should start at the beginning. Twenty years ago.\" \"Good idea, Clete. Well, Lane?\" \"Changing. No. Same result.\" \"That's it then. We don't go to the island.\" \"What?\" \"The island's a trap. We refuse to spring it. We battle from here. We mock it in our thoughts and-- Well, we know it changes things. Let's get him out of the water.\" \"Dutch it's not the same! He's not unfocused! He's not there!\" Dutch grabbed Clete's mind with his and began the search for Lane. He poured his love and Clete's, their desperate need to find the one who was more than brother, into it. He felt an echo and found another who searched. He felt strength pour into his call. He smiled as he recognized the mind that searched with them. Another joined, gathered into the search by love and need. They found him and battle was joined. Power fought power. Love and life battled hate and death. Fought for Lane, for his spirit. They were losing until a will refused to lose. Refused to be defeated. Refused to allow it. Dutch found his own 'stubborn streak'. He would not allow it! He would not let Lane be taken from him! Clete added his passion. The fire of his spirit. The driving need for Lane in his life. His rage at his being taken. It burned through the channel the searching minds had created and became relentless. That which had taken Lane began to fear. Love, will and rage were forged into a weapon guided by Dutch's hand. A burning sword of power. Suddenly, Lane was with them, fighting with them to free himself. That which had held him fled into the darkness, mocked by their love and joy. The strange union began to dissolve. The dissolution was gently tinged with sadness. Two had touched one they had thought to touch no more. Clete wept for the poignancy of their partings. Dutch gathered his brothers and returned them to themselves. Lane softly whispered, \"Mother,\" in their minds. \"I'd say that changed things.\" \"Clete, you have an absolute gift for understatement. Lane, are you all right?\" \"I... Yes. No. I'm not sure. I feel... unreal.\" \"No.\" Clete reached out and pulled Lane to him. Wrapped him in his arms and held him. Dutch was a bit surprised, but trusted Clete's instincts. He joined in the embrace and they held him between them. Lane began to laugh. \"I know I'm real now. I'm being squished.\" Clete and Dutch joined in his laughter, but they didn't let him go, not for quite some time. They needed to feel he was real as much as he did. He didn't know something was odd until the next morning. After two days, he knew he had to share his worry. \"Dutch, the images are gone.\" \"Which images?\" \"My memories of the future. They're gone. That's why I felt unreal. I catch glimpses of near events. I know Clete is about to walk through that door, but nothing else.\" \"Sit down, Clete. Explain.\" \"I can't. When we decided to take on a task, I'd see an abrupt end if something happened to us. As soon as we found a solution, the future became myriad possibilities. The possibilities increased with every change we made. I started with one for my life. It became several when Dad didn't send me away. They became many. The many became myriad. Now they're gone. I'm useless to us.\" \"That's ridiculous! Don't ever say it again!\" \"I'm sorry, Clete. It's how I feel.\" \"I think it's ridiculous too, Lane. You knew Clete was coming in.\" \"Like I said. Near. Nothing that leads beyond the next moment. No memories beyond.\" \"Limbo. We all are.\" \"Your turn, Clete. Explain.\" \"We haven't made any plans. We haven't made any decisions. We haven't made any choices. Too delighted to have Lane with us to think beyond the moment. You're the key, Dutch. Have you made any decisions?\" \"No. You're right. I've just been existing. Something took Lane right out of Melissa. It shouldn't have been able to do that. I haven't wanted to make any decisions. It happened when I made a change.\" \"You're afraid. You don't want him to have memories. You don't want the power to put him into... well, under the influence of his changing memories. You're afraid it'll happen again. Dutch, you can't hold your breath forever. Choice is a function of who you are, of what we are together. If you refuse to make choices, you cripple yourself and suspend him in limbo.\" \"I need time.\" \"No, you need to pull yourself together now. We don't have to ride out to battle, but you must choose to do something. Even doing nothing is a choice. It just leads to nothing. If we do nothing, the enemy has won. Entropy defeats us.\" \"I don't know what to choose.\" \"Choose to face your fear. It isn't of dying. It's of losing us. What we have. What we are. Choose!\" \"I... choose to strengthen us. To learn more about us. To make what happened impossible.\" \"Yes. Yes! It's not the same, but it's there. A future. Not far. No splitting. To the point of another time of choice. Thank you.\" \"What's the first step, Dutch?\" \"We've learned to use your passion and my will. Lane is our weak link. We have to learn to use his intellect. Blend your passion and my will to the use of his reason. Bring him fully in. I think the key is his insatiable curiosity.\" \"I'm lost. I don't think I'm that curious.\" Dutch smiled and Clete burst into laughter. He really was \"lost.\" He just didn't see it. \"Lane, you're so curious, you've found a way to see the future.\" \"I was born with that, Clete. It's just there.\" \"Clete was always passionate. Probably gave hugs that bruised when he was two. I'm so stubborn, my mother said I reminded her of her Dutch grandfather. He refused to give up and spent five years in a crippled spaceship living on food concentrate and recycled water and air. He'd plotted his course and knew eventually he'd tumble through a space lane. He thought it would take twelve. Dutch isn't from Duchelle. It's for him. I had it by the time I was a year old.\" \"But my sisters see the future too.\" \"One future. Unchanging. You say they're quite happy that way. Would you be?\" \"I can answer that. You wouldn't. You get excited every time you anticipate a change, Lane. You can't wait to find out what happens. Like a kid at Christmas. Near breathless with anticipation.\" \"Am I really?\" \"Yes. You're surprised. You've always thought of yourself as rather cool and reserved. Almost envied Dutch and I our... drive. That's the best word I can come up with. Lane, you're about as cool as a stable star. Your reserve is stability. Nothing else. You can't resist a puzzle or a mystery. And... behind it all you may be a freer, wilder, spirit than either of us. You have no reserve when it comes to learning the truth of things. I agree with you, Dutch, insatiable curiosity.\" \"That's our key. Now all we have to do is figure out what to use it on. The lock it fits. I think we... Let's start with meditation and Melissa. She's a mystery. So are we.\" \"You just got him excited, Dutch.\" \"Good. We're on our way.\" Five days later, they were ready to begin working on the 'anger' again. They had already won the real battle. They knew it. \"Can you feel the difference, Clete?\" \"Yes, it's weaker. Still malevolent. Still angry. But weaker. Why, Dutch?\" \"Well, Lane? A mystery?\" \"Not really. Analogy: There used to be receivers that could run on either of two sources of power, current running along wires and directed to outlets, or storage batteries installed in the unit and replaced when exhausted. We unplugged it from the wall. Eventually, it would run down.\" \"How eventually?\" \"A very long time, Dutch. A lot of wrecks, drownings and fear long time.\" \"So we still need to take it out.\" \"Yes. It doesn't belong here.\" \"I pity it.\" \"Explain that statement, Clete.\" \"It doesn't belong anywhere, Dutch. It's not needed, not wanted and it has no home. I'll destroy it, but I'll pity it.\" \"Your pity and compassion are the greatest weapons in our arsenal, Clete. It has neither. We have an island to find. In Lissa. Melissa stays here. You know, she's not happy with her current shape. We should move her.\" \"Suggestions, Lane.\" \"Put her where she can be either of the two shapes she likes, Dutch. The spaceport or the carnival.\" \"Let's take her to the carnival.\" \"Whoa! Changes! Oh my. That was a good choice. We really are going to have fun when we get back. If we get back.\" \"You know, Clete, it doesn't even bother me any more when he says that.\" \"Says what, Dutch?\" \"If.\" Lane coaxed Melissa into being Lissa at the spaceport to drop her, then let her be her favorite shape at the carnival. They hung a closed sign on her and ran the fifteen K back to the spaceport, Clete's idea. The port manager muttered about idiot computers that lost landing records when the ship on pad three asked for clearance for liftoff. They flew to the island and landed. The volcano began to smoke. \"Is it in the volcano, Lane?\" \"No, not really. We climb it to see and it erupts.\" \"I don't like that. An eruption would cause tremendous damage along the shoreline for thousands of kilometers.\" \"Not to mention giving us very hot feet.\" Clete grinned when Dutch sat on the ground and laughed. \"Oh, it didn't like that. You decided not to climb it and laughed at it.\" \"Change. The gun! You're going to use Lissa's gun to vent the volcano!\" \"Yes, Lane. What does that do?\" \"Makes it decide to hurry. Back to the ship. NOW! Run, Dutch! RUN!\" Dutch put on a burst of speed and dove through the hatch. He was in the gun turret by the time Lane and Clete got to the ship. He chose his point and fired through the volcano. He tracked the beam down, cutting through the side and deep into the island base. He kept tracking down as Lane lifted off. The sea began to boil as molten magma poured from the rent in the volcanic shaft. Dutch laughed. It would be very angry now. \"That's cruel, Dutch. You're laughing because it's helpless against us.\" \"Yes, I am. Help me out of here. Give me your hand. If I unstrap, I'm going to land on my head. Ah. Better. I wondered when Lane was going to turn the ship back over.\" \"Just in time to nearly land me on my head. He's been pretty busy. A lot of people wanted to know exactly what we thought we were doing.\" \"Ooh, I'll bet he's been busy. Our nasty thing is very close, Clete.\" \"Yes. Let's get us all together. I think it's going to mount a personal attack.\" \"Lane!\" Clete followed Dutch the few meters to the bridge. Lane looked up and smiled. He reached out a hand and Dutch took it, then held out his other hand to Clete. They joined minds and waited. When the attack came, it was furious. And futile. Dutch exulted, then realized Clete's overwhelming feeling of pity was their true weapon. He willed the malevolent force to feel it. To know it. To see Clete's sadness for the pitiful thing that could know only hate. His compassion for something his love would destroy. It screamed into nonexistence and Clete wept for it. They requested landing clearance and set down on pad three. There was quite a reception committee waiting for them. Dutch apologized for firing a weapon in the planetary atmosphere, but explained all he could think about at the time was the loss of life and property an eruption would have caused. Then he had to apologize for landing on the island in the first place. He was getting rather aggravated with the whole affair when the media people burst into the room. They were suddenly heroes. The people who had been ranting at him were touting his quick thinking, posing with the three of them for the vid. Dutch looked at Lane and he winked. Dutch grinned. He now knew who had commed the media. Clete was grinning too. Lane didn't feel smug very often. Dutch and Lane groaned when he ran them back to the carnival. The port manager looked out and swore. Pad three was empty again. And no one could find the liftoff records. Two technicians spent some time looking for the glitch in the computer. Melissa chose a slightly different spot on the midway and they took down the closed sign. The first customer was a lovely girl. Dutch had no problem devining her immediate future. It started with dinner, then a show, then... Clete and Lane laughed. Dutch would never change. Lane watched the future take shape and hunted for a change. When he couldn't find one, he headed for the beach and Dutch quickly. They didn't have much time. \"Dutch, we need to talk.\" \"About?\" \"Clete. We need to do it fast. I'm worried and he'll be here soon.\" \"Start talking.\" \"He's going to fall in love. Helplessly in love.\" \"Lane, that's not a problem. It won't change things between us.\" \"Dutch, she's going to die. He's going to want us to stop it. Want us to change it.\" \"Then we change it.\" \"We can't. Let me rephrase that. If we do, thousands die. She makes the choice to save them. I've been doing what-ifs for hours. I kept thinking I'd find something. Dutch, she's carrying his child when it happens.\" \"Damn. We have to tell him. He'd never completely trust us again if we don't.\" \"I know. I've thought about rushing us off the planet. Getting us out of here before he meets her.\" \"That's not right either.\" \"I know. Here he comes.\" \"What's wrong, Lane?\" \"Let's go to Melissa. I want our home around us. A fire. A cup of cocoa. Us.\" \"You're hurting. You're both hurting.\" \"Yes, Clete. Come on. Lane will explain. You have a choice, but we know how you'll make it.\" \"All right, Dutch. We run. I want the hurt lessened until we get home.\" They ran. It did keep the pain at a distance. They settled by the fire in their living room. Lane told Clete what he had seen. Clete's choice was love, even for a short time. They had known it would be. They wouldn't leave. He met her the next day, a Fleet officer on leave, beautiful, passionate and loving. Her name was Helen. Dutch and Lane put the pain into the future and reveled in Clete's happiness. \"Dutch, Helen and I are going to the beach. Do you want to come?\" \"No, Clete. Lane and I have plans too. Have fun.\" \"We always do.\" \"Yeah, I know. Do me a favor. Try to keep things from getting too warm. At least til evening. We're getting tired of looking for places to take a cold shower.\" \"I'll try. I want to bring her here, Dutch. I want her to know who I am. I want to bring her home.\" \"All right. Take her out of the hotel. She stays here with us. With you. It's where she belongs.\" \"Tonight?\" \"Tonight.\" Dutch went to see how Lane was. He'd made a choice. In a way it was a betrayal. A violation. \"Will he hate me?\" \"No. He's going to be pretty mixed up about it for awhile. Let's get to work. We have a great deal to get ready.\" \"And not much time.\" \"Stop. We promised him we wouldn't dwell on it, would keep our minds on other things. He deserves to be happy for the time they have. She's quite a woman, Dutch. She will do what needs to be done.\" Clete brought Helen home. She learned what the man she had fallen in love with was. It didn't really surprise her. She'd known there was a uniqueness about the brothers that went beyond being half human. She became part of the family, one who belonged in their lives, a part of all of them. \"Dutch, Clete asked me to marry him.\" \"I never doubted he would Helen. I'm very happy for you both.\" \"No you're not. Neither is Lane. Oh, I'm welcome and you even love me, but you're not happy. I want to know why.\" \"The choice wasn't mine to make after all.\" \"I don't understand.\" \"Helen, I... We... Damn. Did you extend your leave? Did you tell them you were getting married? Who to?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did your captain say?\" \"He told me Commander Telas said Clete's father would be pleased.\" \"He's our godfather.\" \"Your godfather?!\" \"Yes, and the best there is.\" \"I don't doubt that. It's just a very antiquated concept. What does that have to do with why you're not happy?\" \"We... I'm sorry, Lane. I'm sending her to you. I can't.\" \"You can't what?\" \"Find Lane. Ask him. He lives with the future. I don't have to that often. Just... find him. You have choices to make. He's a very good guide.\" Lane smiled gently when Clete walked into his room. He'd tried to ignore it, but he was too honest with himself to do it any longer. \"You told her. Lane, you told her.\" \"She asked, Clete. Would you have had me lie to her? I couldn't have even if you'd asked it. I respect her too much. Has it changed things between you?\" \"Yes. How else would I have known?\" \"Do you love each other less?\" \"Of course not, Lane, but now there's a desperation, a poignancy, about it. No one should have to know when they're going to die.\" \"I agree, but many of us do. My mother wasn't the same situation, but she knew. I'll know. Perhaps everyone does. She could have chosen not to. I told her that. A dozen ways. Dutch has known we'd have to tell her from the beginning. Even before I did. But he couldn't actually do it. It hurt him too much.\" \"The night he got drunk.\" \"Yes, to deaden the pain, so you wouldn't be burdened with it. Now go get ready. All weddings are both joyful and sad. Yours will be no different. You just know the reasons.\" \"Lane, I don't know if I can get through it.\" \"Clete, when you see her coming down the aisle, red hair, green eyes, turned up nose and freckles, you'll be the happiest man in this universe. Probably more than this one. We're going to live an incredibly long time. Well, if we don't get ourselves killed. We'll have to face this again and again. Father chooses to love and accept the pain of parting. You've made the same choice.\" \"Yes, I guess I have. Get ready. You're giving away the bride.\" \"That didn't surprise the magistrate as much as your first suggestion.\" \"I know. He just couldn't handle the concept of two best men. What will he do when you join Dutch beside me instead of sitting down?\" \"Stumble a little, then go on. He's more adaptable than he thinks.\" The wedding was beautiful and joyous. Helen and Clete went back to Melissa and Dutch and Lane went out on the town, looking for company. Everyone seemed to be. It was a very warm autumn night in the city. Helen had twelve more days of leave. Four days after Helen went back, Lane ran for Dutch. He hadn't been able to keep his brothers from knowing it would be soon, but they really didn't want to know when. He really didn't want to know, but he did. \"Find him! Find him fast!\" \"He's over there. Not far. Come on!\" Sand. Dutch hated running in sand. It slowed him. Dragged him down. He wasn't going to be there. Wasn't going to be fast enough. Clete would feel him coming. Would know what was coming. Clete's scream of pain and loss cut through him. Drove him to his knees. Lane caught his arm and dragged him up. They ran on through the pain, and the anguish, and the dragging, treacherous, sand. They caught him and held him. Kept him with them. Held his mind, when he would have thrown it after her. Held his body, when he would have thrown it into the sea. Held his life between them, when he thought it had ended. Along the beach, people saw two holding one and weeping, and wept with them. The official notification was delivered, personally, by Telas two days later. Dutch led him to Clete's rooms, where he'd shared so much with his wife of such a short time. Lane was waiting for him when he walked out. \"I've given him her message. I don't know how to judge his reaction. I did as she asked. It seemed the choice should be hers. She believed she died for a good cause. I asked her to let me take the mission. She refused.\" \"We knew she would, Telas. So did Clete.\" \"The ship would have killed thousands, Lane. I still tried to change it. We were close, but there was too much orbital traffic to risk firing a weapon to attempt to destroy it. Helen loaded everyone aboard into survival pods, stunned five to do it. There wasn't a self-destruct. It was just an old mining ship being dismantled for salvage. She didn't learn why a station-keeping jet suddenly fired and aimed it right for the planet. She used the one that hadn't fired to guide it into the moon. It was barely in the realm of possible, a feat of piloting I might not have been able to duplicate. She may have been the only one who could have done it. And she may have known it. I'll miss her too. Dutch, how is he?\" \"He needed to be alone. Lane, will he be--\" \"Dutch, he'll laugh again and love again. This time will become one of his most wonderful memories. He knows it already. He just doesn't feel it yet. You two have given him a gift from her. Someday, he'll be ready to receive it. You, Dutch, gave her another choice. Telas, you gave her the means. Thank you, Godfather, for interceding with the captain on her behalf.\" \"He thanked me. He too will miss her. He too understood... she made the decision not to change it.\" \"I looked for a way we could change it, Telas.\" \"I was sure you had, Lane. Dutch, help him get rid of some of the guilt he couldn't find one. He'll help. He thinks Clete's got too much to carry now without that too. Don't you?\" \"Yes, Godfather.\" He left them to return to his ship. He would watch over the tiny thing that awaited, suspended in sickbay, the caring and love Clete would give when he was ready. Someday, he would claim Helen's gift. And delight in the little boy who called him \"Daddy.\" Dutch was worried about both his brothers. They were just wandering around. They'd visited a couple beautiful worlds, looked at the lovely and peaceful scenery a few hours and... wandered. The time had been important, but it had been long enough. \"Lane, we need to do something fun.\" \"We're on our way to the pleasure planet of Jesera.\" \"That wasn't exactly what I had in mind.\" \"Yes it is, Dutch. You want to show off, show up the bad guys, be a hero, and meet lots of lovely ladies. Not necessarily in that order.\" \"Exactly what I had in mind.\" \"I thought so. Something fun. This will be good for Clete too. That's your next question.\" \"Will it?\" \"See? Next question.\" Lane ducked the playful swipe. He was looking forward to seeing Dutch's face when they landed in the midst of an interstellar showcase of muscle, madness and beauty. The madness was the work. The muscle and beauty were the fun. The work would be fun too. Dutch really disliked bullies and drug dealers. \"Tell Clete we're on full training schedule. Starting in ten minutes. Meet you in the gym.\" Dutch laughed and went to find Clete. It was time for him to rejoin the team. Time he learned he could still laugh. Time he remembered why he was alive. He was still laughing when he got to the gym. The incredulous look on Clete's face had been wonderful. No one but he had ever called a training schedule before. Lane put them through their paces. He told Clete to pay attention and shape up. Within a few hours, Clete had retaken his place as training director. He hadn't even realized he'd done it, just started following the schedule Lane had made and gradually slipped into it. They had been a very long way from where they were going. In twenty days, they had honed their bodies and their skills to perfection. When they landed, they were ready. Lane entered them in every event but the beauty contest and he signed them up as escorts for that. He carried their very busy schedule back to the hotel room Melissa had landed in and handed copies to Clete and Dutch. \"Lane, this isn't fair. We're faster and stronger than full humans.\" \"Clete, we aren't competing against humans in most events. The top weightlifter in your class is a targ. Dutch's main competition in the track events is a corduni. We're even going to lose a few contests.\" \"Hey! I just found my favorite event!\" Clete and Lane turned to Dutch and chorused, \"Beauty pageant escort.\" Then Lane told them why they were there. They swept through the events. They were listed as 'The Gallants, anthropoid mix' on the official charts. The only problems arose when Clete was entered in bodybuilding, weightlifting and wrestling events. There were some very warm audiences. They solved the problem by dousing him with cold water whenever they started to get warm. He spent a great deal of time wet. Lane was right. They did take second in a few events, never third. They also ended in a few ties. They laughed when they tied for first place as best all-around athlete. It was the only competition all three were in as individuals. They took every event they entered as a team. They built a showpiece out of martial arts routine six and sharp shooting routine three and presented it the night of the award presentations. The stunned silence of the stadium audience lasted nearly two minutes before the night was split with a roar of approbation. By the time they showed up for beauty pageant duty, females of every species were begging the stage manager/producer for one of them as escort. Dutch had an idea, of course. \"We'll escort them all on. Then you assign someone else for the rest of the duties. We'll bring them on two at a time so the schedule doesn't get off.\" \"I can't do that.\" \"Why not? Dutch has given you a solution that keeps you out of hot water.\" Lane smiled at the thoughtful look on the man's face. They all liked him and it was going to be very pleasant to help him out. \"Would you rather assign us one each and then try to walk past the other twenty-seven finalists? We'll even provide our own costumes, something that will contrast well with the dark formal attire of the other thirty escorts. You do have three alternates listed.\" \"Hmm, it would be unusual. You boys are an attraction. Wouldn't take long to spread the word. Would probably attract more women. Might even boost ticket sales.\" \"Yes, and no one would be late getting lined up to go on either.\" \"How would you boys like to travel with the show?\" \"We thought you'd never ask.\" They dressed in the full formal tradition of Earth's twentieth century, white tails and diamond studs with blue satin tie and cummerbund. They finished it with white capes lined in blue satin. They all loved the style and had since Alice had shown them an image of Gallant in it when he had been very young. The memory of hearing him nervously asking her how he looked, and the three of them giggling too hard to explain why, when he asked what was going on, brought smiles, as they got ready. Dutch and Clete thought they were done, then Lane handed each a white top hat, a silver-headed walking stick, a deep red rose and a diamond ear clip. Clete looked at the ear clip in his hand and grinned. He brushed his hair back and put it and the top hat on. He pinned on the rose, spun his walking stick and strolled out the door. Dutch and Lane laughed. The Gallant boys were going on the town and expecting trouble to find them. The producer stared at them in amazement. \"You didn't tell me you were going to dress like that!\" \"Is there something wrong with it, Frake?\" \"No, Dutch. I just didn't know anyone could actually wear something like that and, well, get away with it. You're going to outclass the contestants.\" \"Never. They're the gems. We're merely the sets to show them off. Trust us. Our dad taught us well. None of them has ever been more beautiful than they will be tonight. Show us the routine.\" Clete expressed their opinion of the 'usual' show for the pageant. He could feel it was unanimous. \"Dull.\" \"What?\" \"Clete said it was dull. He's right. It's a presentation, not a roll call. You just leave it to us.\" \"Dutch... \" Frake watched from backstage and was astounded. The beauties floated on the arms of the brothers, even the non-anthropoids. The three just knew how to walk with them so the grace of their species was seen. He'd surprised himself when he asked them to join the show, but he was getting sure it was one of the best decisions he'd ever made, real fast. When all thirty finalists were on-stage, the brothers slid from three directions to front center on their knees, threw their arms out to the audience, then turned and threw them out to the contestants. Who had taught them all to drop deep curtsies in unison? And how had they figured out a way for a coni'ith to do it? The house exploded in applause. Frake sighed contentedly. The pageant was a success and it hadn't even gotten past the introductions. Frake watched in awe. They were everywhere. A music board bench repaired, a harp restrung, a riser rebuilt, a nervous hand held, a spotlight replaced, a lightboard rewired, a pushy mother charmed, a coughing judge given water... Everywhere. They took over the final presentation too. They carried flowers, sash and cape and followed the previous year's winner on-stage. Clete smoothly stepped in to assist the tiny othvin to crown her human successor, reshaping the crown she'd worn on her crest to fit in the process. He draped the sash and stepped back. Lane smoothly fastened the cape and Dutch laid the flowers across her arm. They stepped into line, rolled their hats down their arms and bowed her onto the runway. The crowd went wild. Frake went back to divide up the receipts and sighed. They'd demanded sixty percent this time. Perhaps the house had been large enough he would be able to pay for some work on the ship, but he doubted it. He said \"Come in,\" before he thought about it when Dutch knocked. \"What are you doing?\" \"Counting our receipts and paying our bills, Dutch, the last chore before we move on.\" \"That's a very large bill you have laid out, Frake. Are you paying off some real estate? Say, maybe a planet?\" \"It's just one of the bills. Keeps the show on.\" \"Protection. A piece of the gross. A large piece. Getting larger all the time. You pay it, they don't hurt anyone. Stop paying it.\" \"You... guessed it. I can't stop. They showed me I can't. Grabbed two of the girls and addicted them to a drug. Called the police and told them I did it. The police didn't really believe it, but it ruined those poor kid's lives and they asked me not to come back.\" \"Stop paying. We'll take care of them.\" \"Dutch, I can't. They just upped it to sixty percent and I've got no choice. I can't even just shut down the show.\" \"I understand you felt like you didn't have a choice before, but you do now. We're taking the ladies out tonight. They'll be safe.\" \"All of them?!\" \"No, six are engaged or married, just the other twenty-four. Oh! Twenty-five. Last year's winner is coming too. Give me half the protection money. Tell them your new partners have it. Clete's in the mood to show off. So am I. Lane likes an audience of ladies too.\" \"Dutch, you don't know these people.\" \"Tell them we moved in on you, said we were taking half their cut. Be real scared. Tell them who we are. I'm about to give you a black eye. It'll keep you from getting really hurt. We'll fix it when we get back. Won't be late. Most of the girls have a curfew.\" \"OW!\" \"Sorry. There. That's half. Now get the rest of the money put away fast. Don't worry about paying us. Clete needs exercise and gym time costs. Besides, we have trouble finding sparring partners for him.\" Frake did exactly what Dutch told him. He didn't have any trouble acting scared. His black eye was very convincing. He was surprised when the two men took the thirty percent and didn't give him another one. They were mad someone was trying to 'muscle in' on their territory. Frake put an ice pack on his eye. He suddenly smiled. He wondered if the protection collectors had any idea what they were up against. They used some of the money to take the ladies out. They took them several places. Half of every crowd knew who they were. The other half knew who the ladies were. About midway through the evening, eight unpleasant men accosted them on the street. They helped the ladies step over them and continued their evening. They saw each and every lady safely home. Dutch borrowed Clete's medunit and went back to cure Frake's eye. \"Here. We used some to show the ladies a good time. Sorry. We looked over the ship. It needs work. Order these parts. We'll start on it tomorrow. Oh, we need you to pay our hotel bill. We also have one piece of equipment we'll be putting on the ship. We'll keep it in our cabin. We're sentimental about it.\" \"Didn't they find you, Dutch?\" \"Who? Oh, them. Yes. We didn't stay with them long. We were afraid we'd be fined for leaving eight large pieces of trash on the sidewalk. There. That should feel much better.\" Frake started to laugh. They were sorry they had used some of the money, were going to fix the ship, didn't need to be paid, and would he take care of their hotel bill. And they'd left 'trash' on the sidewalk. Just a little. Eight pieces. To top it all off they were incredible showmen. Somebody out there liked him. \"Dutch, you boys are amazing.\" \"True. Oh! Almost forgot. We'll be just a little late tomorrow. We're keeping watch on the ladies' hotels tonight and putting them all on their flights home. Won't be at the spaceport until just before noon. Try to get those parts delivered by then. Goodnight.\" Dutch hurried. Lane had said the first attack would come just about an hour after midnight. They probably wouldn't need him, but he hated to miss the fun. He dashed into the hotel and found them. Just in time. \"Four. Armed. Freight lift. I'll go.\" \"Clete, you can't have all the fun.\" \"There are only four, Dutch, and the lift is small.\" \"All right. Enjoy yourself. What's next, Lane?\" \"Three on the stairs. If we want to do anything, we'd better get there before Clete gets done on the lift.\" \"Let's go! He's probably finished.\" \"No. He'll be polite and put them in the trash bin out back.\" \"Good thinking. We'll do the same. Got to keep the hotel tidy. Oh goody. A banister. Let's slide down.\" \"Sounds like fun. About three flights.\" \"Wheeee! Oops. Hope I didn't break him.\" \"My goodness, Dutch. You have the trash all piled by the back door to go out.\" \"Sorry I forgot to leave you some. Help me carry it out anyway?\" \"Certainly. Hi, Clete. Next stop Hotel Caprice. Good, you got their injector. Here's ours. Clete, that isn't nice. You broke them. Oh, well. They didn't really need them.\" The hotel Caprice was a bit busier and the Ranforth more so. They gathered all the ladies for breakfast and walked them to the spaceport. They saw them off and moved Melissa to the show's ship. The parts were just arriving when they walked out of it. \"Good morning, Frake.\" \"I didn't see you boys get here!\" \"We slipped in quietly. Lane and Clete didn't want to be seen this late still in evening wear. Clete, life support; Lane, computers. I'll take the drive. We'll spread the rest around. Frake, have something ready for lunch in about two hours. We had a late breakfast, but I'm going to be hungry. Get clearance for liftoff in... six hours ought to do it. Ship needs a paint job. We'll get one next stop.\" \"Dutch, the repair estimate was forty hours and eight men.\" \"That sounds about right. Liftoff in six.\" Frake watched them for awhile, then fixed them lunch and scheduled liftoff. They'd be done in six hours. \"Where did you boys learn all this stuff, Dutch?\" \"Let's see. Some from our moms, some from our dad, some from our godfather, some at the academy.\" \"Academy?\" \"Would you believe Dutch was a lieutenant?\" \"So were you, Clete.\" \"Yeah, but I didn't figure he'd have any trouble believing Lane and I were, just you.\" \"You were ALL FLEET OFFICERS?!\" \"Easy, Frake. Small room. Hard on the ears. Yeah. Enjoyed it for awhile. Lane decided we should retire early. He missed us.\" \"True, Dutch, I did. I also decided it was time to move you around a bit. You kept running out of women and places to take them.\" \"That and they kept trying to get him to choose between them.\" \"I never did understand that. I gave all of them plenty of attention. Back to work. The drive was in bad shape. Let's see... cargo lifts. Later.\" \"He can't have the drive work done already!\" \"Sure he can, Frake. He kisses the power generators, tells them they're beautiful and they fix themselves up to please him. Lane, you get the dirty job. I'm too big for half the access shafts.\" \"An excuse, Clete, but one I'll accept. Besides, I just got the computers working properly. I'd rather not have you shoulder through a junction and fry them. Cable check it is. I suppose you're going to fix the galley.\" \"It needs it. I'll take care of surface plumbing too. Dutch can get the stuff behind the panels when he gets done with the lifts. He's already dirty from cleaning the exhaust tubes.\" \"Sounds good. I'll pick up command and nav. Later.\" \"Frake, you'll have to move. I'm about to take this place apart and put it back together. You can come back and make tea for us in a couple hours.\" \"Uh... sure, Clete. I think I'll just go to my cabin and sleep. I'm already dreaming.\" \"Frake, if you think we're fast, you should have seen my commander. He once told me Dutch's mom was faster.\" \"You don't have the same mother?\" \"Nope. All different, but they all had the same... first... name. Got it. Frake, I'm about to remove the deckplate you're standing on. Go.\" \"Uh... later.\" There was only one job left to do by the time they had tea, get everything and everyone else aboard. Frake just stood and watched while they took care of that too. Cargo was stowed, cabins assigned, rehearsal schedules handed out. People walked through the corridors with their mouths open. Even the bed in cabin eight had been fixed. He wasn't at all surprised when they took over the bridge and smoothly lifted off. \"Party time! Let's get acquainted. Cargo hold, I think. I'll get everyone.\" \"All right, Dutch. Clete and I will be there as soon as we get comm and nav clear and get her on auto.\" \"The autopilot doesn't work, Lane. Hasn't since before I bought it. Can't be fixed.\" \"That's why I built a new one, Frake. On course. Auto in. See you in the hold, Clete.\" \"Private ship Merriment out. Wait up. I'll go with you. Coming, Frake?\" \"Uh, you go ahead. I'll be there.\" He sat and stared around him at the smoothly-running ship and started to laugh. He wouldn't be paying any more 'protection' money. He had all the protection he needed. Somebody out there liked him. They'd sent him three guardian angels. He didn't know they were looking for a devil in the cargo hold. They returned to their cabin to talk about what they'd found. All of them were angry, but Dutch was furious. \"Traces everywhere. Everywhere but the bridge and Frake's cabin. Not enough to bully him into paying them off, they use him to smuggle drugs too.\" \"I picked up mean and nervous from a couple stagehands, Dutch. Big one with the bald spot and the little one with, well, shifty eyes. One of the women too. The pretty blond.\" \"Damn. Prettiest thing on the ship and she's dirty. Thanks for the warning, Clete. Anything, Lane?\" \"Clete's picked them. Let's see. Access panel nearest the hold. In the music board. The big costume box. Under the bed I'm laying on. We take it to Frake. He gets real sick. He hates drugs. Wants to space whoever brought them on board. We space the drugs. The blonde's got an injector, Dutch. I can't see any way out of it. She's going to hit you with it. Nasty stuff. Addictive.\" \"Easy, Dutch! Easy! It's not bliss! Lane, help! He wants to kill her. Kill all of them.\" \"Dutch, you trance through it! No effect! None! I promise! She's after someone else. You block. She's after the little brunette with the overbite and freckles. A couple others too. You'll stop her.\" \"Better. Still mad, but not killing mad.\" \"Let's collect drugs. I want them off this ship. I want it now. My skin crawls. Get off that bunk, Lane.\" \"No. We have to wait, Dutch. Just a few hours. Go home. In Melissa. Get away from it. Clete, dump him in the spa.\" \"Right, Lane. In he goes.\" \"Put me down, Clete! OW! Duck a little lower ne--\" Lane smiled as Melissa's door cut off Dutch's voice. Helping nice people get rid of a nasty problem was good for all of them. It was especially good for Clete. Helen had become his most beautiful memory, not an open wound. Clete was going to have trouble keeping Dutch from killing. The shifty fellow had an injector too. Lane knew he was his target. Dutch would teach him how to heal himself. Before the night was over, he and Clete would both learn. He drifted off to sleep. It would be how the shifty man would find him. Clete roared in fury and Dutch screamed his as they raced out of Melissa. Lane stopped them from going after the person, who had just cleared the cabin, with a lift of his hand. It was about all he could do, but he managed it. He had to slow Dutch, turn his anger a bit, focus it on himself to prevent a possible future. Clete would feel the need and help. Dutch's biting words told him he'd succeeded avoiding the first path to catastrophe. \"He knew this was coming, Clete. You know he did. I'm going to kill whoever did this.\" \"Dutch. Dutch! DAMMIT! LISTEN TO ME! He didn't tell you because he knew this is what you'd do, fly apart. You're no good to him or anybody else this way. Pull yourself together. This is the reason we go hunting drugs. He told us where. We take him with us. All the way through.\" \"Yeah, with... no... no...killing. Clete, stop him. Shifty man. Stop him. Bad choice. Bad choice.\" \"Dutch! It's what he doesn't want you to do! There's a reason! He let them hit him for a reason. Dutch?\" \"You're probably going to have to remind me several more times. Let's get him up. We're going drug hunting. This… stuff is fast. Let's get him moving. It should help.\" They collected the drugs. They ran into the shifty man coming out of the hold. Clete grabbed Dutch and yelled. \"STAND STILL! Stand very, very still. If you even breathe hard, I won't be able to keep him from killing you. Drop the weapon. Just let it fall. DO AS I TELL YOU! He can move before the beam hits him. Drop it. DAMMIT! I'm trying to save your life! Good. Now the injector. Dutch. Dutch, he's unarmed. Let him go back in the hold. Back up slowly. Very slowly. He's the fastest man alive. You can't get away from him. He'd really like you to try. You're terrified. That's good. You should be. I would be if he wanted to kill me. Dutch, find the drugs. Come on, Dutch. The drugs are more important. He won't move.\" \"I want him to move. Just move. I want to kill him. I want him to move.\" \"He's not going to. Leave him and find the drugs.\" \"Find the drugs, Dutch. We'll trance. Together. Find them. Don't kill. Bad choice.\" \"Lane, I want... All right. If he stands still, I might not kill him. But I want him to move.\" The shifty man stood very still. He had looked death in the face and it was waiting for him to move. He collapsed on the floor and sobbed his relief when they left and locked him in the hold. They took Lane and the drugs to Frake. He became violently ill. Clete shook his head. If anything, Frake hated drugs more than Dutch did. It was why the threat of their use had been such an effective method of coercion. Dutch went hunting the blond. Clete left Lane with Frake and spaced the drugs. He had to find Dutch before he killed her. He almost didn't make it. \"NO, DUTCH! If you hit her, you'll kill her! You haven't got the control to avoid it. You. Merith. Lock her in the cargo hold. It's the only place she'll be safe. She's drugged him and I might be able to stop him. Come back here. I'll try to keep him here til you get back. If you don't get back soon, he'll come hunting. The drug won't stop him. It just makes it easier for him to kill. Easy, Dutch. She's running for the hold.\" Clete struggled against Dutch's anger and hoped Merith returned quickly. She did. \"She opened it and ran in. There was a man in the hold. He begged me to lock it. He saved me. She was going to inject me. He got his hand in front of the injector before--\" \"Easy, Merith, I know. He's fast. Help me get him moving.\" \"I don't... need help. I need... to kill them.\" \"They're locked up.\" \"There's another.\" \"Not yet. He hasn't done anything yet. Come on. You need to help Lane. He needs you. He can't fight it like you can.\" \"You're right. Lane first. Come on.\" Clete gusted a sigh of relief. He'd barely held against Dutch's anger. He leaned against a bulkhead and dealt with his own. Merith watched Dutch move swiftly down the corridor. \"How can he even walk? He should be out of it.\" \"He's... stubborn. He just refuses to let the drug win. You come too. You don't want to be alone.\" \"You're right, I don't. He's coming back with your brother. Where are they going?\" \"To our cabin. Dutch and Lane are going to fight the drug together. I'll take you to-- Frake, where are you going?\" \"Lane said I was to come along and bring the girl to somebody named Melissa.\" \"Damn. I hope he knows what he's doing. Our cabin. Go on in. I'll show you the door to Melissa.\" He led them into Lissa and through to Melissa. He left them sitting on the floor, holding each other and giggling. He wondered again if Lane knew what he was doing. He found them on his bed. He'd looked everywhere else first. He had such a tight hold on himself, he hadn't been able to hunt for them by feel. He'd been about to head for the depths of the ship when he realized his door was open. \"We're waiting for you. You need to learn. Your bed is big enough. Give me your hand.\" \"All right, Dutch. I just hope... Never mind. Dutch took them into trance and they learned. Clete didn't need it so he surfaced almost immediately, but he now knew how. He went out to Merith and Frake and led them to the kitchen. He made cocoa and sat down in the breakfast nook. \"What is this thing?\" \"Our home, Frake, a ship. Her name is Melissa.\" \"This isn't possible.\" \"Merith, if it wasn't possible, it wouldn't exist.\" \"Clete, that's not what I meant. Or maybe it is what I meant. I don't know.\" \"I'd better get more cocoa ready. They'll want some. They'll probably sleep just a few minutes. Dutch is too keyed up to really rest. We need to make some plans.\" \"They'll be under that drug for hours, then screaming withdrawal for several more. I've seen it before. Horrible.\" \"Easy, Frake. They'd almost rid themselves of it when I left them. Dutch was in a hurry. He didn't like it.\" \"That's not possible!\" \"What's not possible? Hi, Merith. Scoot over.\" \"You're not possible!\" \"Yes I am. Clete and Lane say they might not be, but I definitely am. Ah, cocoa. Thanks, Clete.\" \"Lane?\" \"Sleeping. He won't be long. It was different, Clete. Easier. Just sort of broke it apart and made it... nothing. Lots easier than really healing something. I don't think I even really needed the trance. I started as soon as it hit me.\" \"The trance didn't hurt. It gave Lane and me a chance to learn how.\" \"True. So, Frake, what do you think of Melissa?\" \"I'm trying not to.\" Clete and Dutch laughed and soon Merith and Frake joined in. \"I hate missing nice laughter.\" \"Hello, Lane. Why did you tell Frake and Merith to come to Melissa?\" \"Did I? I guess I remembered them being here.\" \"Remembered?\" \"Lane remembers things that haven't happened yet, Merith. Dutch can link our minds together. Me, I'm just an ordinary empath. Dutch, you're making me warm!\" \"Sorry, Clete. I like sitting next to Merith. Let's take our cocoa to the living room. This may be a bit too cozy.\" \"Definitely!\" \"You know, I never knew guardian angels took heaven with them when they were working.\" \"Frake, you have a wonderful sense of humor. No wonder you're a showman.\" \"I lost it for awhile, Dutch. Thank you for helping me find it again.\" \"It's time to spread this operation out. If they were doing it to Frake, they're doing it to others.\" \"Choice. Change.\" \"Grab him, Clete!\" \"Dutch, why don't you wait until he's sitting down?\" \"It's all right, Clete. I was waiting for it. We've got a straight path until the next choice. Motorcycles! He's decided he wants motorcycles!\" \"Too bad we don't have Dad to ride with us.\" \"We don't need him. It would be fun though. Dutch, we get a list from Frake. Others he thinks are paying. We take both him and Merith with us. We visit a large number. Space a lot of drugs. Dutch, you must not kill anyone. It's going to be hard not to. Especially the man in gray. He's a key to stopping it all, the link to the bosses. And you're going to want him very, very dead. The girl will be all right. We'll get her through. Oh, this is going to be fun. Clete... Oh, my. Yes. A lot of fun.\" \"Lane, what's the 'Clete, oh my?' It makes me nervous when you do that.\" \"Don't worry. You won't have any problem. Dutch and I can put up with our teeth rattling a few days.\" \"A FEW DAYS?!\" \"A sideline they're in. Yes! We learn the magic! Well, some of it. Not quite the way he did it. That's a function of who he is, but someday... Too bad. We should have kept a little to analyze. Cold turkey is hard, but they'll be grateful. That's it. Let's do it.\" \"Dutch, he got excited about magic and 'someday' was a promise.\" \"That doesn't surprise me, Clete. His eyes lit up every time Dad did a bit of magic. What's first, Lane?\" \"Frake's list. Hmm... Oh, I see. Easy. A horse race. No, two. How about that? Real leathers.\" \"Whoa. You're getting really excited, Lane, and Clete's about to start bouncing off walls. Since you'd probably say you hate to spoil fun surprises if I asked for specifics… Yeah, I thought so. All right, let's do this one step at a time. Frake, make us a list of everyone you know, or think you know, is paying protection, especially traveling shows, like yours. Give us their schedules, if you can. How does Merith fit in, Lane?\" \"She's our accountant, Dutch. She's a genius at estimating a house and keeping track of what money belongs to who. She can also figure out exactly what a show needs; costumes, props, equipment. The best little shopper on the net. You made a smart move when you hired her, Frake.\" \"I didn't. She just sort of attached herself to the company. Said she'd always wanted to be in show business. Promised she'd earn her keep. She looked hungry, so I fed her and said all right.\" \"I was hungry. I was also dodging an injector and one of those 'sidelines' this bunch are in.\" \"Why the blond was after you.\" \"Probably, Dutch. If your man in gray is the same as mine, he doesn't take no for an answer.\" \"Now I know why it's going to be hard not to kill him. I really don't like to kill. I haven't killed anyone since... in a very long time.\" \"Dutch, his bosses take care of him. He leads us to them. If he dies, they may get away.\" \"Remind me of that again when the time comes, Lane.\" \"I won't be there. Neither will Clete. You'll have to make the choice on your own.\" \"Here's the list. About fifteen. All I can think of. I guessed on most. Shows with good draw that are getting dilapidated. Barnard's is the worst. His ship is in worse shape than mine was. Nice old boy.\" \"He's first. They've got his niece. We'll get her and take her to him, then make sure his ship gets to where it's going. Dutch, it's going to break down in flight. We'll use Lissa and do a mayday answer. Replicate parts. Clean house for him. We have to let the two in the hold loose. They're our advertisement.\" \"Damn. Let's do it. Let's get Barnard's niece first. Who stays with Melissa?\" \"I do, but I meet you on the ship. We'll have to work fast. It'll take all of us. Yesterday.\" \"Let's move.\" It wasn't far to where Barnard's niece was being held. Clete went into the big house to get her. It didn't take him long to find her. He just followed the path of most resistance. He smiled at the bright-eyed little girl of about seven and squatted down. \"Hello, Jeannie. I'm Clete. Don't be afraid of me. I'm your friend, or I'd like to be. I've come to take you to your uncle. Wouldn't you like to leave here?\" \"Yes. I'm not afraid of you. I think you're here to rescue me.\" \"That's why.\" \"I was really hoping somebody would. They think I'm so dumb I wouldn't figure out why they won't let me go outside. They said they adopted me because Uncle Barnard didn't want me.\" \"They lied to you. They're making him pay lots of money. They told him they'd hurt you if he didn't.\" \"I guessed that, but I've been careful not to let them know. When Mommy and Daddy got killed, Uncle Barnard came and got me. He told me we're all the family we have and we have to stick together. He wouldn't decide he didn't want me. How did you get in? There's lots of not-nice men and Miss Perldick. She's not nice, either.\" \"Come on. I'll show you.\" He took the hand of the very bright young lady and led her through the house. She asked if the men were dead. He told her he didn't kill people if he could help it. They were just napping. They'd looked tired, so he'd tucked them in. She giggled. He led her into Melissa/Lissa and she sat on his lap on the bridge. Lane dropped Lissa free not far from the ship that had just sounded a mayday. \"Private yacht Lissa responding. We're on our way. Barnard, we have the parts you need and a surprise for you. Frake's on board. He'll fill you in.\" \"Your ship is very fast, Clete.\" \"Yes, Jeannie, she's as fast as any other ship in space. My brother Dutch is also a very good pilot.\" \"Uncle Barnard sounded surprised. He likes Mr. Herpith.\" \"You can call me Frake, Jeannie. You're his big surprise. He's been very worried about you.\" \"I've been worried about him too. He needs me to take care of him, so he can take care of everybody else. Clete, where did your other brother go?\" \"He went in the cargo hold, Jeannie.\" \"Come on, Clete. There isn't much time. We've got to get that ship fixed. That drive is bad. Frake, careful what you say about us. Come on, come on, get the hatch open. Hello, Barnard. I'm Dutch. Talk to Frake. I can hear-- Clete! Come on!\" \"I hear it! Bye, Jeannie.\" \"Who was-- Jeannie? JEANNIE!\" \"Hi, Uncle Barnard. Here's a tissue. You're getting the pretty dress Clete gave me all wet. Now stop crying. I'm safe. You haven't been taking care of yourself. You're a mess, but it'll be better now I'm here.\" \"Yes, Jeannie. Much better. Frake, what's going on?\" \"You've just acquired the best guardian angels in the business. Get your people together and keep them out of their way. And I'll tell you what real protection is. This is Merith. Oops. Wait'll they get by. Now, you get going. We'll meet you in your cabin. Questions later. Go!\" Lane ran into engineering with parts they needed now! They worked fast. After a few minutes, they actually had time to talk. \"Think Frake will be careful when he talks to Barnard?\" \"Yes, Clete, I do. Dutch, hand me that spanner. All right. Life support will hobble along until we get the rest of the parts replicated.\" \"I want to get that drive fixed first, Lane. Clete and I barely got it shut down in time. It was about to blow. We cut it a little fine.\" \"We had to wait for the mayday. You'll need an EVA suit. Don't use one of Barnard's. Get one from Lissa.\" \"Tubes fouled. I just knew it. Nasty job to do in space. Easy to hole a suit.\" \"Dutch, hold your breath and speed up your metabolism. Your body won't decompress. Get in within five minutes.\" \"I'm going to hole the suit. I hope you're right. What am I saying? You're always right. I hope.\" \"Clete, you handle the airlock for him. He's going to cut it fine. Override the automatics. Don't wait for it to pressurize. Make sure you tell me about it when you get him in. That's where the memory comes from. Get started now. He'll be ready to go. I'll replicate drive parts. See you on Lissa.\" \"Done.\" Lane got back with the first load of parts just in time to stop the fellow about to take the housing off the number one power generator. \"Don't touch that! Go find the rest of your people and stay with them. We'll show you what we did when we get done. Dutch is going to give you a very thorough lesson in drive maintenance. Get out of the way!\" Lane watched the man head back to the cargo hold. He was a decent mechanic, but not much of an engineer. He'd been out of his depth. As soon as he'd gone, he headed back to the replicator in Lissa. He had both arms full of parts when Clete joined him. \"Lane, he's in. Holed the suit. Held his breath, sped up his metabolism. Close. About five minutes. I overrode autos on the airlock. Popped it as soon as he got the hatch closed. He's hungry. Engineering.\" \"Bring the rest of the parts and food for him. High carbo content. I'm on my way with these.\" Lane found Dutch waiting for the parts he was carrying. When Clete arrived, he tore into the food like a starving man. They rebuilt drive, generators, life support and the galley. Barnard was a pretty good hand at the computers, comm and nav equipment. The bridge was in fair shape. Dutch, however, was steaming. \"You can come out and let your people know they're safe. Send your man to me in engineering. I'm going to have a long talk with him. Lane is sweeping up your ship. We'll space your extraneous cargo. Fire some people when you land. Clete will tell you which ones. He's on the bridge. Later.\" \"Is he always like that, Frake?\" \"No. Dutch is usually pretty friendly. Except when there are drugs involved. Come on, Barnard, Clete's waiting.\" \"And my ship is already repaired?\" \"No, already rebuilt. I told you. Guardian angels.\" Lane convinced Melissa to be inconspicuous and they landed at a racetrack on twentieth century Earth. He replicated a two dollar bill from a numismatic collection Meister had shared and won the exacta, visited another track and placed his winnings on a long shot. He collected, gave the woman from the IRS the government's cut and they went motorcycle shopping. Dutch decided he wanted outfits like the men at the shop were wearing. They told him they'd have to prove themselves. They didn't have any problems. They were careful not to break anyone. Getting the modified Sportsters through Lissa and into Melissa was a problem, so they took them apart. Water conversion to hydrogen fuel would be too obvious in the time they came from, so they changed them over to alcohol fuel and put them away. There was no point reassembling them, until they were needed. They went through Frake's list and Merith shopped. The money they collected for 'protection' returned the next day as ship parts, sets and costumes. Newly protected show owners happily followed instructions. Drugs were spaced and termination slips arranged. Frake and Merith were returned to the Merriment a few minutes after they'd left. It was time to shut down the sidelines. A few moments later, they were on the world and in the city where they would begin. \"This is where you meet the man in gray, Dutch. You'll tell me about it. It's going to be very hard not to kill him. Just remember, he's not going to get away with it. In fact, if you kill him, you'll be doing him a favor.\" \"I'll remember, Lane. What's the agenda?\" \"Clete and I are going to clean house. You're going to clean the streets. Send all the girls to Eight-three Harman Avenue. I'll start the detox program. Clete's going to take care of everything else.\" \"Terrific. I'll be dying from the heat.\" \"You'll be there before things get too warm out. Dutch, the kid comes through fine. We'll get her home. Get your bike and leathers.\" Dutch rode the city streets. The girls were all addicts, scared and abused. They really wanted his protection. After he removed several 'supervisors,' they believed he could give it to them. He sent them to Clete and Lane, nearly thirty of them. He found the man in gray recruiting, with his fists and an injector. \"Get away from her. Do it now. I'm not supposed to kill you. If you use that injector, I may not be able to keep my promise.\" \"I don't know who you are, but you'd better mind your own business. My boys don't like nosy people.\" \"This is my business. I'm Dutch. One of the Gallant boys. Your operation has just been acquired. You've been fired. Get away from that girl.\" \"Get him boys.\" There were only five of them, hulking brutes and slow. Dutch finished with them just as the man in gray injected the girl of about fifteen. She screamed and he slapped her down. It was nearly the last thing he ever did. Dutch held him in the air and looked in his eyes. He was shaking with rage. He wasn't going to be able to keep his promise. Then the girl whimpered. \"Thank her. I don't want her to see me rip your heart out. Say thank you and run. Run fast.\" \"Th...Thank you.\" He set the man on his feet and he ran. Dutch picked up the sobbing child and put her on the bike. He had to strap her to the backrest. She reached out an unsteady hand, touched the tears on his cheek, then passed out. He rode to the house and through the door Lane opened for him. A path had been cleared for him through the litter on the walk. Ten pieces of litter \"Bring her this way. I've got a room just for her.\" \"I found the man in gray, Lane. He beat her and injected her. I didn't finish with his boys fast enough to stop him. I've never wanted to kill anyone like I did him. She stopped me. She didn't need to see what I would have done. If she hadn't been conscious, I couldn't have stopped myself.\" \"I know, Dutch. Even I felt your pain and anger. It was real rough on Clete. Inject her with this, then use the medunit on her. Both will lessen the effect of the drug in her system. She'll sleep through the worst of it. When you're done, find us. The drug they're on has an additive. The girls you sent and the ones who were here have real needs. Detox takes three days. We have nine more cities on five worlds, then we go back to the show. We'll meet the gray man and his bosses on the second world the show hits. You have to not kill him again on the first. It'll be easier. Door at the top of the stairs when you're done here.\" Dutch nodded and went to work on the child. They couldn't 'reverse' the drug, but they could block the addiction. Lane would tell him when she'd awaken. He would be there and he'd get her home. He'd thought he was prepared when he opened the door. \"Whoa! Easy, easy. I'm here to help. Slowly. Help! Lane, I'm being smothered.\" \"They can't help it, Dutch. Clete's on his way. He synthesized something to help with detox.\" \"Damn! I hope he... hurries.\" \"I did. Here use this on them. Don't worry if you lose track. Extra doses won't hurt. Unh. Did you say three days, Lane?\" \"Yes, and nine... cities.\" \"Done.\" Dutch was sitting beside her when the girl awoke. She was shaking and sweating. She grabbed for him, but he held her off. \"It's the drug they gave you. You're almost through. We got a blocking agent into you to prevent the addiction. I can put you back to sleep if you want me to.\" \"No. Oh! Find me something! Something to do!\" \"Can you cook? There are a lot of women here who need food. They're all the way addicted. My brothers and I are... \" \"Busy, I'll bet. I'll cook. It's better if... I think you should show me the kitchen, then go away. I know what the stuff does. I'll fight it. It'll just be easier if you're not close.\" \"I'm Dutch. I'll show you the kitchen. What's your name?\" \"Chrissa. On second thought, you go on. I'll find the kitchen.\" Dutch grinned. She'd be out from under the influence of both drugs in a few hours. He'd take her home as soon as she was. Until then, he'd stay out of the kitchen. Clete was sleeping. He wished he could sleep, but his teeth felt like they were rattling. Clete purred in his sleep. \"Chrissa is cooking for us all. Some of you. Damn! Some of you go help. Bring... ow... easy... food back for us. Clete! Wake up! Go ahead. Wake him.\" \"Oh. Hello. Take a nap, Dutch.\" \"Lane needs one. I'm... fine.\" \"You heard. I need a nap. Clete, stop purring!\" Dutch needed a rest by the time all the women had been fed. Lane told him Crissa was ready to go home and he smiled as he headed for the kitchen. It was exactly the break he wanted. \"Hi, Chrissa. Ready to go home?\" \"Can you get along without a cook?\" \"Yes, the drugs are wearing off. We'll be making coffee and passing out pain killers for the next day-and-a-half.\" \"Dutch, a lot of these girls aren't much older than I am. That man did the same thing to them as he tried to do to me. He likes to beat them up. He deserves what you wanted to do to him.\" \"I know. It will happen, Chrissa. He won't get any more girls. I promise.\" He took her home and was very surprised when she kissed him. She whispered, \"It wasn't all the drug.\" He grinned as she ran in the front door. Her parents were good ones. She was proof of it. She'd called them, as soon as she awakened. Her father stepped out of the door, as he pulled away, quickly. He felt nice, but he already had all the thank-yous he could handle. He rode back to the house and sighed. His teeth were rattling again. It wasn't fun, but Clete found helping the women very pleasurable and his total understanding, including of what the drug did to them how, assured them of their identity as individuals. There was even laughter and shared humor. The purring was an irritation, but he didn't really resent it, nor look forward to the end of it. Clete would share their suffering, just as he did their pleasure and gratitude. Withdrawal wasn't easy for any of them. The women shook and cried and begged for the drug. Clete held the young ones who were terrified. Dutch and Lane did their best to help, but he was their most effective detox agent. Small doses of pain killer were given to the girls he said needed them badly. None of the girls had been addicts before they were recruited with an injector. There would be no relapses among them. Then they moved and started on a new city. When they rode their bikes back to Melissa after finishing that one, Dutch climbed off his and sighed. Clete raised an eyebrow and Lane smiled and nodded. \"What's the matter, Dutch?\" \"I wish they hadn't been quite so grateful, Lane.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I'm tired of my teeth rattling.\" \"You're just plain tired. We need rest. Leave the bike and hit the spa. Clete can load it. I'd love to see their faces when they find out we busted their sideline on five different planets on the same three days.\" \"Isn't that telling them something we don't want them to know?\" \"Do you want them to believe the man in gray when he tells them he's seen us in the show on one of the same days?\" \"No. You're right. Who'd believe it? Lane, what's wrong? Clete! Help me with him. The couch. Lane?\" \"He's dizzy, Dutch, but not... in trouble.\" \"I'm... all right. It all came back. I can see... forever again. Most of the dross is gone. Just one path again. All the roads not taken... aren't there. I'm fine. Go on. Get some rest. I'll look a bit.\" They spent forty-two days on five worlds, with recovery time between, all on the same three days, then landed Melissa on the Merriment ten minutes after they'd dropped Frake and Merith off. They started rehearsals and were ready when they landed two days later. Another beauty pageant was about to go on. Clete looked up in surprise when Frake walked over to where they were assembling risers. \"Exasperated? You feel like you're growling under your breath.\" \"Good description, Clete. They haven't done any paring down at all.\" \"I thought the place was too crowded. Left it all to you?\" \"I hope you boys don't mind. You and Merith are going to judge the preliminary rounds. We'll never get this thing on otherwise. No real problem. The scoring sheets are simple. This is all talent and personality. Beauty we leave to the judges picked by the sponsors. This is an all human pageant. You'll even know if the music is good. I'm going to visit the circus and have a look around.\" \"Frake you're going to find out they're paying too. Don't mention us. We have to do this one ourselves. It's very nasty. People will get killed if it's not handled exactly right. There are a whole bunch of bad apples in that barrel.\" \"Understood, Lane. I'll stick to my regular routine of 'Hi, we're the other attraction. How are the crowds?' and leave it at that.\" \"Good. We'll do our best here. Later.\" Merith had to remind them everyone wasn't perfect. They finally started giving realistic scores after they'd had to sit through two very bad performances twice. Merith was very fair. If they handed her something unrealistic, she called the entire group of six for a repeat. She was also good at keeping the contestants from trying to influence them. Dutch thought she was a little too good. He didn't really meet anyone. The contestants were grouped by type of performance, but the groups weren't all singers together, then all dancers. Just as they began to get tired of something, the type of performance changed. The 'personality interviews' were intersprersed with them as well. Merith noted there was a great deal more to Frake's job, and Frake, than was apparent on the surface. They all agreed. He'd set it up so what could have been a tedious task was actually pleasant. \"You know, I'm edgy. My teeth feel, well, funny.\" \"Merith, you're sitting too close to Clete. He's purring. Our teeth have been rattling for days.\" \"Purring? I don't understand, Dutch.\" \"Neither do we. He doesn't even know he's doing it. You must have a fairly high psi rating. Most people don't... That's why you're so good at estimating a house and knowing what people need!\" \"How about that? It's good for something after all. Six more, then I'll tabulate. Uh, oh, three of these list their talent as martial arts. I don't know anything about them.\" \"Don't worry. Just watch for gracefulness. We'll judge competency. That we do know.\" They got to the last contestant and things came to an abrupt halt. Lane expected it, but it didn't surprise Dutch when Clete suddenly stood either. \"Damn. Stop! I'm not going to sit here and watch you injure yourself. What's the matter with your sensei?\" \"Clete, calm down. Oh, well, there he goes.\" \"What's he doing, Dutch? I thought she was pretty good.\" \"She's practiced very hard, Merith, but she's practiced wrong. Give him five minutes. She deserves another chance.\" \"Dutch, a judge can't help a contestant. It's not fair.\" \"Lane?\" \"Merith, he couldn't let her go on. She was causing herself pain. We saw it too. She nearly dislocated her shoulder. She'll do something else. Wait'll you hear this, Dutch. You think Clete's purring. Hi, Clete.\" \"Lane, you knew this was coming.\" \"I also knew she wouldn't hurt herself badly before you stopped her. She needed what you showed her or she might have really damaged herself, Clete.\" \"Probably. She took some private lessons, but hasn't started university classes with a new sensei yet and has been practicing on her own. I told her we'd give her a few minutes. She said she'd actually planned on doing something else, but there were so many singers she changed her mind.\" They waited for her to change and warm up. She came back out and started to sing in a clear, sweet, soprano. She sang the words, \"Someday, my prince will come,\" and Dutch moaned in pleasure. She made the finals and a friend. \"Hi. I'm Dutch. You just sang my favorite song.\" \"I'm Sabitha Berke. Sabbi. I didn't think anyone would know it. It's ancient, but I've always loved it.\" \"Mid-twentieth century Disney; Snow White. We've got a complete collection. Clete's even got a perfectly preserved cel. Fantasia's a close second, but Snow White is my favorite.\" \"You're kidding. I thought I was the only person in existence who thought Snow White was the greatest of the classic animations.\" \"It was the first of it's kind. Look, we're done here. I'm no longer a judge. I don't think there's any rule that says we can't have dinner together. Would you be my guest?\" \"I'd like to, but I doubt it would make my mother happy. She worries about me. She didn't want me to do this. She's outside pacing.\" \"Some people have a low opinion of beauty pageants.\" \"Some worlds only have them for females, don't have a university grade-point minimum for entry and prizes are money. We have one for a six-year sports medicine scholarship called the Junior Apollo Pageant that makes the competition in this one look light. I feel sorry for some of those poor boys. Two years ago a pair of mothers got in a fist fight, when the artistic director said one of two in blue needed to change. My mom just thinks it's too much to do right now, but I want that scholarship for doctoral studies. I'm not counting on it, especially after seeing the competition, but it would certainly be nice not to have to scramble to put together a bunch of little ones for tuition.\" \"Dutch, take her mother too. They need you with them. Try not to break anyone.\" \"Right, Lane. That's it. We're having dinner. Is your mother as beautiful as you are?\" \"More. She's why I like Snow White so much, and she looks like her. When she's not worrying about me, she's a lot of fun.\" \"Let's not keep her waiting. She's probably worried already. By the way, I liked your answers to the questions too. Ah, your daughter is right. You are very beautiful. I'm Dutch. I'm your escort for this evening.\" \"Escort?\" \"Yes. Too many nasty people around. You're Snow White. How did you step out of my dreams?\" \"Snow White was a young girl. I'm almost fifty.\" \"I didn't say off the screen. I said out of my dreams. I like my dream women grown up.\" \"Sabbi, we have an escort. My name's Rose.\" \"It would have to be. Wait. Let me think. Oh, yes. I put them... there.\" Sabbi and Rose stared at the red roses he had pulled from the air and handed to them. Dutch loved it. He had spent days working out the math for the pocket of nontime just above his shoulder and stocking it with roses. He was using it for the first time and was delighted with the effect. \"Just a little trick copied from a real master. Took my brothers and me a long time to figure out how he did it. Now, I think dinner, then a show, a little dancing… Oops, I forgot. Sabbi has a curfew. An early evening then. A concert? There's one in the park a few blocks from here.\" \"The Grennert symphony with Braslerc conducting. I'd decided it probably wasn't a good idea for the two of us and was a bit disappointed we'd miss it.\" \"I'm delighted to be able to assure you don't, Rose. I'm in heaven. A beautiful woman on each arm.\" They had a wonderful time at dinner. Rose was a Disney authority. She taught media history at a small arts college in a distant city. Sabbi was a sociology student at the university in the same city. They were walking to the concert when a gang of young thugs attacked them. Dutch was careful. \"Good. I didn't break any of them. Addicts. Injectors in their pockets. I hate drugs, but they seem to be a symptom of societies that haven't reached the rewarding-work-for-all stage. Improvements in drive design will bring the travel time down and in fifty years you'll be part of the Fed and it just won't be. Sabbi, call the authorities. They'll put them in rehab. Maybe it'll take with one or two. Sabbi?\" \"Where did you learn that? How can you move so fast? There were six of them and they were armed.\" \"Martial arts are a family tradition and I got a lot more training when I attended the academy. I move that fast because my father isn't human. They were carrying weapons, but they really don't know how to use them. Now, let's call the authorities and go to the concert.\" Rose laughed and Sabbi made the call. Dutch took them to the concert and escorted them to their hotel. Rose said she didn't have a curfew. She and Dutch were dancing in the hotel lounge when Lane walked through the doors. He met them at their table. \"You were right, they needed me. Rose, this is my brother, Lane.\" \"Hi, Rose. I'm sorry to end your evening, but we need Dutch.\" \"I know someone who's expecting trouble when I see one. Thank you, Dutch. It was a nice evening.\" \"I enjoyed it immensely. Don't wait outside tomorrow. Come in. I'll see you to your room.\" \"No, I think I'll stay here awhile.\" \"Lane?\" \"She'll be fine. Trouble is other places. Goodnight, Rose. I'll wait, Dutch. Don't be long. We've got a time limit.\" Dutch said goodnight and followed Lane. He caught up with him a few steps down the back stairs of the hotel. \"What's up?\" \"Men with injectors in hotels, with weapons at the theater, sabotage at the circus. A very busy night. Clete is going to get hurt. So am I. Melissa is in the basement. We have to be several places at nearly the same time. There's just enough difference to make it seem possible. This is why we needed to learn the healing technique. Don't worry when we're under for a long time. We come through.\" \"I don't like it.\" \"I won't either. It's going to hurt. I muscled in on the circus earlier. Clete located a dozen roustabouts who needed firing and two performers who are addicts. One of the owners was the dealer. I bought him out. The other two owners were delighted. First stop Radmort Suites.\" They cleared five hotels, then removed six men at the circus. They repaired damaged equipment intended to injure performers and got rid of poisoned feed intended to kill animals. Lane put a hand out to stop them just before they went back into the theater where the pageant was being held. \"This is where things get rough, Dutch. These guys are different. They're pros and they're after us. I don't know how many you have to take alone after Clete and I go down. We get nine together. I sent everyone else away. Get ready. Clete, backstage. I'll take the balcony. Dutch, house. Go!\" Dutch ducked the beam and went after its source. He found him and went after the next. He heard firing on the stage and in the balcony. He started counting. When he got to eight, he felt Clete get hit. At nine, Lane. He took out the tenth and got wary. Everyone left would be looking for him. The tenth man had made a lot of noise. He decided he was in a hurry. He made himself a target. At least five more. He quit being careful with them. He took out four and listened. Nothing. He made himself a target again and someone nearly hit it. Three had fired at him. He found two of them. He heard a door slam and wondered if one had left. He decided it was a trick. He was right. He broke one of the two who had set up a crossfire near Clete. He checked him. He was in trance. He found the last man near Lane. He actually didn't mean to drop him from the balcony. Lane was in trance too. He carried him into Melissa, then got Clete. He put Melissa in flight and wondered where the coordinates Lane had set would take them. He was delighted when she landed at one of their favorite places to fish. He waited for them to come out of trance. It was a full day before Clete smiled at him, drank the water he held for him then went to sleep. Lane did the same about two hours later. Dutch breathed a sigh of relief and went fishing. They'd be hungry when they woke up. He spent about as much time checking on the two of them as he did fishing and kept a mental 'hand' on them the rest of the time, but he had plenty to cook when he built the fire and started frying them. Clete walked out of Melissa as he was cooking the last pan of fillets. \"Mmm. Bass. Enough for three?\" \"Actually, enough for five, Clete. I figured you'd be hungry. I'll bring these in when they're done. Fix something to go with them. I can feel Lane's about to wake up too. I'm sure bass, pan-fried over an open fire, was what he had in mind for breakfast. He's awake.\" \"You've been using a lot of energy monitoring us. Have you slept at all?\" \"Well... \" \"I thought not. Food then bed. I'll finish here. Lane will know. He'll be in the kitchen. Go find him.\" Clete was right. Lane was in the kitchen and had obviously made preparations before they went to find trouble. Dutch followed his nose. \"Eat. The bass will be here before you finish your salad. Fried potatoes coming up. You're out on your feet. You've barely slept in five days.\" \"I guess it has been five days. Didn't realize. Got in a couple hours when I got too groggy working on the math for my pocket. Then I played with it. After that we got busy. No wonder I'm tired.\" \"Bass.\" \"Thanks, Clete. Mmm, hungry too. Hey, you guys are the ones who were hurt. I'm supposed to be taking care of you.\" \"You already did. It's our turn. Clete, get him a hot bath ready. I'll have our plates fixed when you get back.\" \"A bath sounds good.\" \"Dutch, we need recuperation time. We're going to spend ten days here, then go back and clear the theater.\" \"You said you didn't know how many there were.\" \"I don't. Actually, I should have said you and Clete are going to clear the theater. I'm going to disarm the bomb under the stage.\" \"Lane, those people really don't like us.\" \"I know. Ain't it great?\" Dutch laughed, finished his meal and headed for his bath. Clete and Lane ate, then gently lifted him out of the water and tucked him in bed. He didn't awaken. They spent ten days recovering their strength and speed. They weren't quite in peak form, but Lane said they would be before they needed to be. They traveled back to the theater and he went to disarm the bomb. He didn't learn how many men had been left, but Clete did. They had taken nine together. Dutch had gotten the other ten alone and he'd only broken three of them. They left them stacked on the sidewalk with their broken weapons nearby. Dutch called the police and lodged a litter complaint. There were piles of trash in front of hotels, a theater, even in front of the civic arena. They spent the night working on creating and stocking pockets. It had taken them years to figure out their father's trick with the roses. They'd learned a great deal in the process, especially Clete. They'd all put on muscle too. Clete enjoyed math most with a barbell in his hands. Their father had put a reader above the weight bench when he'd complained he didn't have time for both lifting and math, and he'd been combining them ever since. Arguing they could work on the math with him without the barbells didn't work. Dutch had given up trying to change Lane's memory that it never would, while they were still in the academy. They wondered how long it would be before they could throw things into the air and have doves appear, or create showers of flower petals, or tap things into existence. Lane grinned and said awhile, but pulling a rose from the air for every lady escorted would make a nice addition to the show the next night. Frake found them putting the risers in place in the morning. \"Hi, boys. I have a little surprise for you. I had the programs printed up. I hope you like them.\" \"Featuring the Gallants as escorts. How about that? We're featured. Thanks, Frake.\" \"You're the best part of our show, Dutch. I wanted to tell you so. Where it counts.\" \"We'll costume appropriately. All right! You've expanded the show! I've got to find a horse. Later.\" \"A horse?\" \"Don't worry Frake. It'll be great. Merith chose the finalists for your featured performances, didn't she?\" \"Yes, Lane. She said Clete was impressed with the martial arts one. The other four were strictly her choice. Dancer, singer, dramatic reading, and musician. Said they were too good not to use. I need to get ready before the local crew arrive to open the ticket booth and the lobby lounge. My idea of how much is too much and that of bartenders don't always match. See you onstage.\" \"What's up, Lane? I like to know what I'm anticipating with relish.\" \"Well, tonight we costume as fairytale princes. Dutch is going to borrow a white horse from the circus.\" \"And?\" \"Clete, do you really want me to tell you who's going to win?\" \"No, it would be too hard to hold nervous hands and feel them hoping if I know they won't win.\" Dutch wasn't gone long. Lane and Clete were just putting the last riser in place. \"I found one and he's a beauty. Perfect. I know what to wear tonight too. I hope we've got a pattern.\" \"We don't, Dutch, but I'll go get us one. I'll see you in eight days and be back in ten minutes. I'll store a lot of costume patterns. We'll need them eventually.\" Lane knew where he had to go. Only one place would have everything, Earth in the twentieth century. He spent three nights and a morning there; one night in the wardrobe at Disneyland and the others at Universal Studios and Paramount. He copied only two women's costumes. He spent the morning at the floral market in Amsterdam. He spent the return trip storing flowers in nontime. He found Dutch and Clete reassembling the light bank, but they were nearly done. Clete growled his hello. \"I know, Clete, I need a nap. I've got real roses. Interested? I'll show you where I put them and tell you what I've got in mind.\" \"Clete, let's get this together quick. He's about asleep on his feet.\" \"Dutch, if you two don't quit abusing yourselves, we're never going to get back in top form. Lane says we're going to compete next stop. I'd like us to be ready.\" \"We'll be ready if it takes a month. There. Let's go. I want roses that are dew-touched and real.\" Lane showed them the flowers and gave Dutch the codes for the women's costumes. He'd know what to do with them. He laughed when Clete scooped him up, carried him to his room and dropped him on his bed. He'd forgotten it was going to happen. He'd had other things on his mind, like keeping Dutch from going after the gray man when he saw him in the audience. Sabbi just stared at Dutch with her mouth open. Rose laughed in delight. They both recognized the two garments he held. \"The song needed the costume, Sabbi. A lot more people than you realize will recognize it.\" \"Oh, Dutch, thank you! They're wonderful!\" \"I didn't do it. I'm just delivery boy. You have to thank Lane. He put a lot of work into getting them for you.\" \"Where is he?\" \"Asleep. Clete tossed him in bed.\" \"Did he spend all night getting these?\" \"More than all night. Those are the real Disney. The same ones they used at the Disney parks on Earth. He didn't tell me how he got them. Well, the pattern was of the real thing. The gown may be old-fashioned, but it's fairytale princess beautiful.\" \"Dutch, make sure I see him before the show. I want to give him a big kiss.\" \"He'll find you for that. You can bet on it.\" He did. He also told her to make sure to listen for her music and be ready to sing any time she heard it. He was a bit dazed. He had known he would be, but reality was much more intense. He suddenly decided he wanted to make a change. He was about wobbling by the time he found his brothers. \"Dutch, I want to ride the horse. Would you let me?\" \"Oh, boy. Clete, do you feel what I see?\" \"Uh, huh. This is a change. He's nervous about your answer. Doesn't know what you'll say.\" \"I say yes. Whoa!\" \"Nice catch, Dutch. Let's get him over there where he won't get dirty.\" \"Damn. It shouldn't have been that big a change, Clete. What did it do?\" \"Made him incredibly happy. Dutch, our brother's in love.\" \"I'm glad it's her mother I'm interested in. This could have been awkward.\" \"It still will be. I'm quite a bit older. Dutch, thank you. It doesn't change things on our current project, but it makes my future a lot richer. I'm going to marry her.\" \"What's the sadness?\" \"We won't have any children, Clete. Not of our own. She'll have hundreds to love. She's going to do exactly what she said she wanted to do.\" \"Build a place for unwanted children.\" \"Yes, Dutch, we help her. I won't see her enough for me, but a lot of time for her. At least, if nothing changes.\" \"Lane, changes we make other places shouldn't have any effect on her. You see her life. You're in it. We'll keep you from getting killed. You'll be there and so will she.\" \"Thank you, I... I was--\" \"Afraid of change. We'll watch over her. What? What is it?\" \"Clete... later. I'll ask later. I see it. I'll know. Sometimes I get in a hurry. I want it before its time.\" \"You missed this one, Lane. The answer is yes. When the time is right, we'll take Sabbi the son Helen found a way to give me. All you see is asking me when you're ready.\" \"How did you know?\" \"I suddenly realized there would be a place for him. We can't give him one. Now, since we've got her future all planned, don't you think we should get to work on her present?\" Things went smoothly until Dutch saw the gray man. He stood at the front of the stage dressed as a fairytale prince and looked like the hunter he was. Heads turned to see his prey. The gray man saw people looking at him and left quickly. Clete and Lane kept Dutch from following him. It wasn't easy. The incident had a strange effect. It should have made the crowd nervous, made the show tense. It didn't. When the gray man left, the audience stood and cheered. They didn't have any trouble telling heroes from villains. Sabbi's song brought a thunderous ovation. Dutch wondered why Lane hadn't ridden the horse. He suddenly realized why when he saw him talking to the orchestra conductor and smiled. Sabbi would sing again. The production numbers went well and all the performers were wonderful. The girls made their final costume change and the formal presentation in the ball gown competition began. The crowd went wild when roses were plucked from the air and given to each contestant. The presentation ended with the curtsy and the audience roared its approval. Dutch smiled and winked at Rose in the front row. Sabbi's very old-fashioned costume had brought gasps of recognition and whispers throughout the theater. The world was a bit 'arts crazy' in general and media history was a popular hobby. Two of the judges had recognized it, too. The runners-up were named and Clete and Dutch grinned at Lane. He looked like a runner in a race, waiting for the starting gun. Merith was holding the beautiful white horse in the wings and the orchestra conductor whispered instructions. They all knew. It had become obvious to everyone but her. Frake opened the envelope and called out, \"And the winner of the twenty-fifth annual Woman of Our Dreams Pageant is... Sabitha Berke!\" She looked stunned. Frake escorted her to center stage and the previous year's winner crowned her. Clete draped the sash and Dutch fastened the cape. Lane dropped down on one knee before her. There was a flash of light and he held a bouquet of eighteen, dew-fresh, long-stemmed, red roses up to her. He rose and laid them in her arms and they bowed her onto the runway. When she reached the end of it, the orchestra segued into her song. A hush fell over the audience and they watched. Lane rode out onto the runway on the magnificent white horse and lifted his beautiful baritone voice in duet. She turned, saw him, and watched him dismount \"I'm here, if you'll have me.\" He took her in his arms and kissed her. He lifted her onto the saddle and mounted. The crowd went crazy. They rode back to center stage and the other contestants showered them with their flowers. Sabbi settled into Lane's arms and leaned against his chest. Her prince had come. Dutch leapt off the stage, bowed, and offered Rose his arm. He escorted her to the stage and Clete bowed and offered his. Dutch grinned at Clete. \"Since it looks like we're going to be family, why don't you come to dinner in our home tonight?\" Frake cued a spotlight on Sabbi and Lane and brought the stage lights down. The conductor led the orchestra into a soft reprise of her song and the audience began to sing. At first, a soft voice here and there, but soon, a chorus that filled the theater with song and eyes with tears. No one would ever forget the night they saw a fairytale come true. Clete shook his head when Dutch escorted Rose into the kitchen after giving her a tour of Melissa. He'd have known what the headshake meant even if Rose hadn't voiced it as soon as she sat down. \"You do know this isn't possible?\" \"Why does everyone I bring home say that? It's possible or it wouldn't exist, Rose. It's just based on some very complicated physics. It's a dimensional matrix.\" \"Dutch, who are you? Who is my daughter so suddenly in love with? What are you doing with this show?\" \"We're half-brothers. We all have the same father. Gallant, Knight Hero. He's not human. The ship is his creation. We have been accepted as the defenders of life in this universe. Clete is Sir Pericles Buchannon, Knight Guardian. I'm Sir Roberrin Duchelle, Knight Champion. Lane is Sir Apollo Avelaine, Knight Judge. He's the son of two good and powerful beings. He sees the future. We're here to end a very nasty ring of extortion, forced prostitution and drug smuggling. This group of worlds can't become part of the Fed until that's done.\" \"The man tonight?\" \"I was just a bit too late to stop him from beating up a fifteen-year-old girl and injecting her with drugs. He was recruiting. We got her through it. I didn't kill him because Lane said he'll lead us to the bosses.\" \"But you wanted to.\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"Good.\" \"Rose, you surprise me.\" \"My husband was a police officer, a detective. Five years ago he stumbled across something really evil. He was murdered on our doorstep. Overdosed with drugs. I didn't see the killer's face, but he wore gray. Now, how do you three cause enough trouble to break up something the size of what he found? It covered most of the unaligned planets in this sector.\" \"By being several places at once. You're in a ship that travels in time and space. Sabbi won't be alone most of the time.\" \"She's very young, Dutch.\" \"Lane knows. It's one of the first things he said. He's patient. He really does see the future. Remembers it.\" \"Why didn't he know about Sabbi before?\" \"You ask hard questions. We change the future. We make choices.\" \"Tell her true, Dutch. You change the future. Lane didn't know about Sabbi until you changed the future. You told him he could ride the horse.\" \"Thanks, Clete, you're a big help.\" \"Rose, each of us brings something to what we are. Lane is the investigator, the inquiring mind. I'm an empath, the feeling and the, might as well say it, passion. Dutch is the driving force, the will. Together, we make a pretty powerful team. We've chosen to make ourselves into a force for good.\" \"And who decides what good is?\" \"You're right, Dutch, she does ask hard questions. He had to earn it first, but Dutch was given the right and responsibility to decide. Don't ask by who. This one you have to take on faith, just as we did. Now, let's have supper. We've had to give this explanation too many times. You deserved it, so we did it again.\" \"Where are Sabbi and Lane?\" \"In his apartments. I'd say she's getting the same explanation you are. Come on, Rose, relax. You trust us in general. Trust Lane. He really is her prince.\" \"How old is he?\" \"Twenty-eight. Give or take a few million years and a universe or two.\" \"That answer was not reassuring.\" \"It wasn't meant to be. Rose, she loves him. He's worthy of it. That's enough. Now, let's eat. I'm starving.\" Clete didn't quite know what to do about her. She was still worried and nervous. Sabbi and Lane solved the problem. They walked in hand-in-hand and so obviously in love, she melted. All her reservations evaporated. Her daughter was happy. It was enough. The little kitchen nook became warm and cozy and they became family. Things even smoothed enough for Rose and Dutch to take notice of their mutual attraction again. Yes, warm and cozy. \"Clete!\" \"What? What did I do? Oh. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens when I feel content. I really can't do anything about it, Dutch.\" \"What's he mean? What's he doing?\" \"Rattling my teeth, Sabbi. He's purring!\"",

I am not going to spend days wondering. What?\" \"Lane. He aches for her. Needs her. Wants her. Wants her so much he's like a caged animal.\" \"No. Not this time. The future is too good. I won't risk it. It's not worth chancing. I think a lot of it is this trip. Two days on this ship with nothing to do but think about her.\" \"He's going to be useless by the time we get to Harvelle, worn ragged. We're supposed to compete. We're going to be out of it.\" \"You just came up with the answer. I'll bet if we spent two full days training, we'd be ready. And it's not really a change. We're still on the ship. Still traveling with the show. We'll give Frake Melissa's call signal. Lane didn't see anything, but it will keep Frake from getting nervous.\" \"Done. Ten minutes. In the gym.\" Lane was waiting for them when they got there. Dutch almost changed his mind. He looked fevered. He was pale and shaky-looking. \"I know. You don't have to tell me. I'm in rough shape. Put me to work. I'm full of tomorrow's memories and I need them to be now.\" Clete put them to work. He worked them every waking hour of the two days. Lane dropped into bed exhausted and slept. It was what he needed. They were ready when they landed. \"Dutch, we are about to turn this world on its ear. This is the base. Where it's all coming from. A pleasant, homey, little ball of vice, crime, corruption, and upright citizen crooks. It starts with the competition we're going to enter and the gray man. He's a mad dog they set loose. We're sending him back to them. This is the one world where they don't want him. He followed us. Now, the competition's fixed. We're about to unfix it.\" \"How do they fix a martial arts competition, Lane? A fight I could see, but this is huge, competitors from everywhere.\" \"They start with referees and judges and supplement with beatings and drugs. We're going to have a lot of very good help. Wait'll you meet Master Pon and Jerona, Clete. Dutch, you'll really like the Perisks. This is team and individual. A large amount of money is wagered. The betting is legal and our bad boys use it to pay off the help.\" \"Tell them who to bet on to collect their pay.\" \"Right, Clete. The first thing we do is find Master Pon. His school is registered. We're about to be students. He's even going to teach us some things. You'll love it. Let's help get the show set up. We're going to be conspicuously present several places at once.\" They helped unload and get things to the concert hall, then slipped quietly back to the ship. It was time to travel. They found Master Pon two days before, settled into lotus position near him on the beach and waited. They greeted the rising sun and moved smoothly into the tai chi ch'uan with him. He began a series of complex katas. They followed. It was quite some time before he found one they didn't know. They knelt and watched. When he had completed it, Clete spoke for them. \"Master, we ask you teach us.\" \"Who are you that I should spend my most valuable time?\" \"We are ones who have learned the value of knowledge.\" \"Do you then think you are wise?\" \"Only in knowing wisdom must be sought.\" \"It is a beginning. I will teach you.\" \"Thank you, Master. We will seek to learn well.\" \"Good. Now, who are you guys and where did you come from? I thought I knew most of the really advanced people in the sector.\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Clete. My brothers Lane and Dutch. We're from outside the sector. We've got wind of something real smelly in the competition coming up. We want to clear the air and we need your help.\" \"Sounds interesting. Let's go find late lunch. I'm starved.\" Master Pon was a delightful little man in his seventies. He had a quick wit and an easy laugh. They took him to Melissa for lunch. He looked around and grinned. When they told him what they planned to do, he smiled widely and officially 'enrolled' them in his school. He was the first person they'd shown Melissa who didn't say she was impossible. They went with him to meet their fellow students and Dutch just shook his head. Lane hadn't told them all Master Pon's other students were female. \"Jerona, Keli, Kera, I want you to meet someone. These are the newest students in our school; Dutch, Clete and Lane.\" \"Pon, I seldom question any decision you make, but aren't they just a bit unusual?\" \"More than you realize, Jerona. They're the best I've ever seen. Except myself, of course. They plan on taking apart a gambling fix on the competition. They also want to put a drug smuggling ring, with a sideline in forced prostitution, out of business in the process. Interested?\" \"This sounds like our kind of fun. Keli, Kera?\" \"You bet. The company's not bad to look at either. Hi, I'm Keli Perisk. The quiet one drooling over there is my sister Kera.\" \"Dutch. The drooling's mutual. I'm crazy about twins. Especially beautiful, red-haired twins. How'd you like to help me blow up a few warehouses and labs?\" \"Oh, I just love fireworks. Tell us all about it.\" \"Hmm, I'll bet I can fit three on my bike.\" Clete and Lane laughed as they watched Dutch walk off with a lady on each arm. He was in absolute heaven. He was telling them all about \"bikes.\" \"Clete, Jerona is my assistant. More than a student. A perfectionist to the core. You want to learn that kata, she can show you.\" \"All right! Lead on, Jerona. I'd follow you anywhere.\" \"You got it, big man. My, you are big. I'm taller than half the men I meet. You make me feel petite. I think I like it.\" \"Well, Lane, looks like we're left out in the cold. Of course, my wife frowns on it if I stay warm.\" \"I think your wife and my fiancé would get along. They seem to have some things in common.\" \"Shall we find a quiet place to talk and make some immediate plans?\" \"A good idea. Uh, oh. Sensei, that little girl in back needs a word.\" \"Damn. She's at it again. She just wants to learn so badly, she tries things more advanced students are doing. I'll... Well, I guess that's taken care of. He's really giving her a lecture.\" \"Don't worry. Clete gives very gentle lectures. I figured he'd see her. Probably felt her hurting herself. He's an empath.\" \"I wondered how he knew. He had his back to her. Are you all empaths?\" \"No, just Clete.\" \"And do you and Dutch have talents?\" \"I suppose you could call them that. I see the future. Dutch changes it.\" \"That must be most intriguing.\" \"It has its moments.\" Lane and Pon worked out logistics and made a list of things they'd need. Pon was delighted with the idea of it all happening during the competition and pageant. He shook his head in sadness when Lane told him the names of the people they were after. They were known and respected. They worked out the arrangements to save spouses and children from suffering shame and humiliation. Pon would add nineteen to his list of staff and students. They would travel to another world and another competition with him. Once there, they would become new people. Wagers on the competition would provide the funds for homes and upkeep. Merith had a list of eight new employees and would make the wagers. Dutch, Keli and Kera were sitting in Lissa happily constructing bombs. They would need a great many. Clete and Jerona were setting up the competition schedule. They were getting along famously. Things were running very smoothly when Clete suddenly groaned. \"Damn, Dutch! Sorry, Jerona, I can't think. I'm going to find a cold shower.\" \"What's the problem? What's happening?\" \"Dutch, Keli, and Kera are what's happening. They're also the problem.\" \"Oh, I see. Come with me.\" Jerona led Clete back to the shower room, but the water she turned on wasn't cold. Lane took a deep breath. \"Pon, I need a drink, a cold shower, and probably an anesthetic.\" \"I feel a bit warm myself. Your brothers?\" \"They have help.\" \"Yes, the ladies are helpful. Come on. Let's grab a few beers and go for a swim. We'll take the kids with us. Nothing like a cold ocean and a batch of little girls to keep things in perspective.\" \"Pon, you're a genius.\" \"Yes, but I've also been married forty-five years and been teaching women for twenty-seven. This genius is based on experience.\" \"I think we should hurry.\" \"Watch this. Salute your sensei! Time to play! Hit the beach!\" Lane watched and grinned. Every student gave formal thanks, then a mad scramble began. In two minutes, he and Pon were strolling behind forty, running, chattering, squealing girls toward the sea. Some were carrying beach chairs and sports equipment. One pair carried a coldkeep between them. By the time they caught up, two chairs, an umbrella and the keep were awaiting them. They laughed, pulled off their shirts and ran for the sea. The next day, Master Pon submitted his lists for the competition. They were stamped approved. They weren't even read. He'd never had male students. No one realized they were there. He hurried to the concert hall where his three students and his three assistants awaited in Melissa. They had a large number of beatings and druggings to prevent. Lane slid Melissa a few hours into the future and they went to work. Groups of men expecting to find one or two sleeping in a room met several awake outside the door. They broke into three teams after they had taken care of the large groups. Clete and Jerona had developed a smooth working relationship. Dutch, Keli and Kera had tremendous fun. Pon and Lane disposed of men who would have abused young people. They got a full day's rest in Melissa. Lane and Pon spent a good deal of time in the cold water of the swimming pool. They returned to the time they'd left. Dutch, Clete and Lane went to work preparing for the \"Our Special Girl\" pageant and Pon and the ladies went back to the dojo to organize students and equipment. Pon commed the masters of other schools in the competition and arranged a meeting. They would eject referees and judges who were unfair. Merith met Pon's brother-in-law and gave him funds and a list of wagers to make. Pon did not wish to know the outcome of the competition. His brother-in-law placed the bets with a very large grin on his face. He'd made a few small wagers of his own the day before. Lane recorded the tips to five honest men; three detective captains, a prosecutor and a news editor. He set the timer to send out the calls. He took Melissa to a restaurant and placed a tiny tracking device in the hem of the gray man's coat. It would lead Dutch, Clete and him to the board meeting and seal the gray man's fate. The murderer of Sabbi's father would die at the hands of his employers. She'd seen that changing that would change who she and her mother had become, without needing to be guided to it. The men on the board would be betrayed by some very unhappy, unpaid, employees, when the honest authorities found them in possession of large quantities of drugs. They'd be sure they'd been set up. They would be, but not by their bosses. Sabbi and he had agreed that would be satisfying too. He smiled as he replicated 'colors' for Pon and the ladies. They would enjoy the leathers and the wild ride. He also installed a set of pegs and built a new seat for Dutch's bike. It was a surprise. It was designed for three. Dutch would be a bit closer to the bars, but he wouldn't mind. He'd still be able to lift the front wheel off the ground. He rested in the past, then returned to the time of his departure. He had a team kata rehearsal. Pon put them to work as soon as he arrived. \"Yes, the appearance is aesthetically pleasing. Now, begin. No. Dutch, you must move a bit more slowly. You complete the moves a fraction too soon, then must pause before beginning the next. Again. Clete, control your power. The punches of all must be equal. Again.\" Pon smiled at the three big, blond men and the three big, red-haired women. They'd take the advanced mixed competition. He still felt the splitting of the competitors by sex was wrong, but Lane had explained it was part of the \"fix\" and very profitable to a pair of unpleasant men who provided bullies for the business. It was why none of his girls were targets. The presence of Clete, Dutch and Lane had placed his school in the overall points event. They had added possible points in a total of seven events. Pon expected his girls to complete a near sweep of their schedule. If the three men did as well as he knew they should, it would be the first overall his school had taken. He'd never had entries in the heavy and super-heavy classes. He longed for the 'old days' when all competitors were grouped only by levels of skill and not broken into age and weight classes. It was a technique of the sponsors and promoters, more events and more wagers. He smiled. He had entered himself in three events. It had been a long time. He expected to add the points for masters' level men to their total. The two men he hadn't been sure he wouldn't break in pieces wouldn't be competing. He'd never doubted his instincts about them, just thought testing his control for a few points that made no difference was foolish. The show people, contestants, escorts and all the students of Pon's school went to dinner together. Frake made the arrangements. A large restaurant became very busy. Lane smiled as Dutch tensed and shook his head. The gray man stood across the street and gazed at them taking seats by the window. He would be on his way to see his bosses. Dutch knew he would be going nowhere else. Ever. Dinner was a great success. Frake had a bill prepared and signed for it. It too would be covered out of Merith's wagers. It delighted him to know the money would come from the coffers of the people who had used him to smuggle drugs. He had noticed the two Lane had released from the hold and the third he had fired were on the planet. Lane had told him one of them would become a fount of information for the prosecutor. He wished he could stay to see it, but the show would move on. He knew Lane, Clete and Dutch would not be going with them. Their work would be done and they would find another who needed guardian angels. Frake and Pon became friends over dinner. The friendship would last until their deaths many years in the future. \"We have to leave. We have something to do tonight. We'll see you all tomorrow. Come on, let's set this thing in motion.\" \"With you in a minute, Lane. I just want to say goodnight to the ladies. OW! All right! I'm going. I'm going.\" Clete grinned, let go of Dutch's ear and followed him out the door, around the corner and into the alley where Lane had 'parked' Melissa. They moved her to an office and walked into the \"Boardroom\" across the hall from it. Dutch smiled at the nine very shocked people and sat on the end of the table. \"Hello, we're the Gallants. This is your notice we're shutting you down. Permanently.\" \"How did you get in here? How did you find this place?\" \"We put a tracker on your man in gray. It's in the hem of his coat. I believe I hear him coming now.\" \"YOU! You can't be here! I just saw you sitting down to dinner. You can't be... You're not natural. You're some kind of spooks.\" \"Oh, we're quite real. You're going to be sorry I didn't kill you. Goodby.\" Dutch laughed as he walked through the door and heard the gray man protesting he couldn't have been followed. He slept well that night. The news headlines the morning of the competition were about the beaten and mutilated body found floating in the bay. Lane would have liked to hear the 'board' trying to figure out how all those chains had come undone. He was rather fond of the little laser knife he carried in his pocket. It worked well on packing crates too. The tournament was interesting, especially when the senseis ejected four referees and three judges. They chose new ones from the expert aficionados in the audience. Pon's school swept through the competition. Two schools dominated most of the events for young males. They did not take any of the men's heavy or super-heavy events. They didn't take the master's either. The team kata competitions drew cheers from the crowd. When the winning men's team and the winning women's team combined and won the mixed event, they went wild. Pon accepted the overall point award for his school with a determinedly humble bow. He received a standing ovation from both the audience and fellow competitors. The day had already been wonderful and the fun was just beginning. Pon and his three assistants had box seats for the pageant. He smiled at the gasps of delight when the escorts in white produced a rose from the air for each contestant. He made a mental note to send flowers to his wife in celebration of their victory, then decided to add \"at first opportunity\" to it. Without her patience and support, it would not have been possible. Frake and Merith took the contestants out for supper. The Gallants would be busy. They started by hopping backward in time. They went from world to world and time to time. They thwarted every attempt made on shows that had come under their protection. It took them eight days. They landed outside Pon's school a few minutes after the pageant was over and Pon introduced the Gallants to his wife Ellith. She smiled in delight when Lane pulled a rose from the air and presented it to her. She mentioned Pon had sent a huge bouquet, which had been delivered moments before. Pon was very pleased he'd called and ordered them during the pageant. Jerona, Keli and Kera received roses as well. Clete pulled one, and Dutch two, from the air. They asked Ellith to put them in water. They would reclaim them in a short while. Pon told his wife he would be back in a few moments and returned with the others to Melissa to begin an evening of fun. He had smiled at his wife's tale of a crime ring's sudden fall during the evening hours. He didn't tell her he was on his way to help make it happen. She might worry. About his sanity. When they landed, Dutch found his present. \"Lane, you're terrific! It's great! Now I really can ride three.\" \"Happy whatever, Dutch. We're going to have to take them apart and put them together a lot. It clips in. Oh! I have other surprises as well. Ladies, these are your colors. Pon, this set is for you. Diamond clips for the ears and mirrored lenses for the eyes. Shall we change and terrorize a crime ring?\" They all smiled in delight as they stood before the mirrored wall Melissa made for them in the living room and looked at their reflections. They put the bikes together and roared into the day. Keli and Kera flipped to see who would sit behind Dutch first. They would take turns, changing places each time they hit another city. The seven of them roared into warehouse after warehouse and lab after lab. They left all the personnel napping outside and blew them up. They 'planted' a large quantity of drug for the police to find when they followed Lane's tips, then rode back to Melissa. They had spent seven hours in the city. They got a good night's rest and spent a pleasant day together. Lane and Pon spent some time swimming and Dutch complained about his teeth rattling at dinner. They landed, assembled the bikes, and spent the same seven hours in another city. In all, they spent sixteen days in the task, all in the same seven hours. They landed back at the school ten minutes after they'd left. They put together the evacuation plan for the innocents and began working on it. When they had everything ready, they went to the first house and Dutch slipped inside and smiled widely at the woman who was too pained to be shocked when he walked into the room. \"Hello, I'm Dutch. I'm here to get you and your children out of this mess. We've got a vehicle out back and a way for you to disappear. Bring your cat and anything you can't bear to part with, but not more than you can carry in one bag. Please, I know it's very hard to trust right now, but we will help.\" \"How did you get in? Can you really get us through all those reporters? And not for... a story?\" \"I got in because you need me. Yes, we can and no story is wanted. We've got transport offplanet and a new home and identities ready for you.\" \"I'll get my cat and coat. Merrie, get your teddy bear. Jord, bring your gliss game. We're leaving.\" No one paid much attention to one more news crew giving up on a locked house. The news vehicle stopped a few blocks away and two children and a woman carrying a cat climbed into a grav car with a lovely redhead driving it. The scene was repeated again and again, twice with dogs and once more with a cat and with various numbers of various-age children. One man struggled not to weep as he hustled four children into a van and left the home his wife's 'inheritance' had bought nine years before. Merith drove a closed vehicle onto the ship's cargo lift and drove it out again moments later. Ellith had a large number of houseguests overnight, then kissed Pon good luck and watched two chartered transports take his staff, chosen students and him to the spaceport for a chartered flight to a competition on a nearby world. Merith collected her winnings, then met Pon's brother-in-law and he gave her his. Lane had explained Harvelle had been the perfect place for the ring's base because there were no income taxes due to the vast mineral wealth. The incident that made it as accessible as it was on Earth wasn't the same, but the result was and the government collected money on every gram exported. It was also why gaming taxes were low. She cheerfully paid the two percent of the gross. She deposited the rest in numbered accounts and purchased real estate on another world by comm. The show was broken down and the ship loaded. Merith realized Frake would have to hire several people to replace the three who were leaving. She brushed tears from her eyes and went back to work. There were furnishings to order and clothes to provide. Kitchens must also be stocked. \"Merith, we're on our way. We'll have everything ready for them when they get there. We'll see you at your destination.\" \"All right, Lane. Lane... \" \"Yes? Come on, Merith, you know how it works. You have to ask before I can have the memory. You ask.\" \"If I tell Frake I'm in love with him, what would he... Would he... Oh, dear.\" \"Save me a dance at your reception. I love dancing with ladies in white.\" He smiled, pulled a white rose from the air and handed it to her. She stared at it in surprise. It was cool and moist with dew. She inhaled the fragrance of the first rose she'd ever held that hadn't been replicated. She laughed in delight as Lane waved and walked away. She took a deep breath and hunted for Frake. She had something to tell him. Lane was smiling when he walked into Melissa. \"All right, that's taken care of. Now, on to our next destination. We're about to become deliverymen. Dutch, here's the list of merchants and items. Set schedules for pickup. You met them all, figure out what should go where and to whom. We need to insert computer records for all the kids in schools so they can be transferred to their new ones. I'll pull their real ones and change the identities. We'll need to do marriage, divorce, etceteras, for every one of them. Clete, you take care of birth and medical records. Here's the list of people and their new identities. Let's get to work.\" \"Lane, why are you so happy? You're just bubbling.\" \"Well, Clete, when we get this chore finished, we're going to a wedding. The bride has just promised me a dance at the reception. You guys will get one too, but you'll enjoy dancing with the bridesmaids more.\" \"Frake and Merith!\" \"You got it. Jerona, Keli and Kera are going to be bridesmaids. Guess who the groomsmen are.\" \"All right! I like being in weddings.\" The sudden wistful look on Clete's face made Dutch wish he hadn't said it. \"It's all right, Dutch. I like being in weddings, too.\" \"Clete, it'll be a little rough in places. Tell Jerona why. She's a good friend. She'll be willing to help.\" \"She always does.\" Clete smiled a slow warm smile. It went with a very nice memory. \"Damn, Lane. He's doing it again!\" \"I noticed. Let's get to work, Dutch.\" \"I hate trying to think when my teeth are rattling!\" A woman was still very nervous when she walked into her new house. The pain of finding out what her husband was hadn't really eased. She stopped and stared around in amazement. It was beautiful. She wandered from room to beautifully furnished room, carrying her cat and dragging her coat unnoticed behind her. She heard her daughter squeal, dropped cat and coat and ran. \"Look, Mommy, toys and dolls and my closet's full. Jord's too. Is yours full too, Mommy?\" She went to check. It was. She found a large packet on her dresser. It contained complete documents for all of them, including school enrollment for Merrie and Jord. Their first names were the same, but the last had been changed. The message light was blinking on the comm unit. It was from the bank and it thanked her for choosing them for her accounts. She pulled up the records and started to laugh. There was an amazing amount all set up as interest-bearing trusts. She would have a comfortable regular income and the children's education was provided for. She began to put the documents away and found a short handwritten note. \"The name on the decree is fictitious, but the divorce is real. Forget the past. Enjoy your new life. P.S. I set the coffeepot to turn on when you answered the comm unit.\" She went to the kitchen and poured herself a cup of coffee. The house didn't have a food synthesizer, but she'd never really liked them. She opened cabinets and found them stocked. She sat down at the table and giggled. Frake had told her not to worry, she had the best guardian angels in the business. He'd been absolutely right. She wondered if one of them was called Dutch. The scene was repeated in eight homes that day. Most homes had synthesizers. Those that didn't were for ladies and the man who preferred to cook. Reporters searched passenger lists for days. The families of the eight men and one woman had just disappeared, including dogs and cats. Frake and Merith didn't wait long. It was a good time for all their real friends to attend, but it was less wait for the Gallants. None of them wanted to wait thirty-two days to go to the wedding. \"Congratulations, Frake, you're a very lucky man.\" \"I know it. Lane, I don't think I'd have ever gotten up the nerve, but she just walked up and said she loved me and what was I going to do about it. I asked her to marry me. Surprised myself. Didn't surprise her though. She handed me a guest list.\" \"Thanks for asking me to be best man. It meant a lot. Barnard and Jeannie looked pleased too.\" \"Well, Merith doesn't have any family. She likes Barnard and decided to ask him to give her away. Jeannie was natural for flower girl. Old Earth traditional all the way. It was those costumes you guys wore. I'm glad Pon and Ellith could come. I've got a lot of old friends here, but Merith... Well, she needed some on her side of the aisle.\" \"Frake, I'm going to dance with your wife. I'm going to give her a kiss too. It's the one time I know my fiancé wouldn't mind.\" \"That's true. I wish Sabbi and Rose could've come. Merith asked them.\" \"Work and school. They just couldn't get away.\" \"Lane, you could've... you know, got them.\" \"No. My life with Sabbi is going to be wonderful. I don't need to make any changes in it. I am looking forward to the next time I see her though. I dream about it.\" \"Special reason?\" \"Yes. Her mother won't be around.\" Frake laughed and Lane went to dance with his wife and give her a kiss. Pon joined him at the punch bowl a short time later. \"It will be a warm night.\" \"Yeah, Clete and Dutch are going to bring Jerona, Keli and Kera home for a late supper. And breakfast.\" \"I'm sorry, my friend, Ellith has decided it will be a warm night too. You'll have to swim alone.\" Lane laughed and clapped him on the back. Clete watched Lane sit down for dinner in Melissa. Dutch grinned widely. They all felt good, but Lane was flying. \"All right, tell us.\" \"Tell you what, Clete?\" \"You know. What's up. Why you're three feet off the ground and humming under your breath. Come on, Lane, tell us.\" \"I'm going to see Sabbi. There's a dance at her university and we're going to it. We're going to make it official. I've just been thinking about it.\" \"There's more.\" \"Yes! Yes, there is. Her mother won't be there! I'm going to whisk her away and spend some time with her. I've been enjoying thinking about you two taking your turn.\" \"Our turn at what?\" \"Doing countless laps in the pool!\" Clete and Dutch burst into laughter. It really was their turn. Lane got more excited as the time drew near. One night Clete hauled him out of bed, carried him, protesting, from his room and dumped him in the pool. Lane sputtered and laughed. Clete shook his head, grinned and went back to bed. Maybe his room wouldn't be quite so warm. Three days later, Lane's memory finally agreed it was time. Clete and Dutch both walked in to his room grinning widely. They'd both felt his sudden surge of excitement and knew exactly what it meant. \"So, how do we dress? Is this formal, informal, a beach party, what?\" \"Homecoming. Called The Queen's Ball.\" \"White tuxes?\" \"Not this time, Dutch. You and Clete wear black tuxes. I'm the only one who wears white.\" \"Oh, ho, you want to outshine us.\" \"I most certainly do.\" \"Going to tell us why?\" \"No, you'll see. You won't be bored or go unnoticed. You'll get all the attention you need. I just want more.\" \"All right, Lane. Clete, black tuxes.\" \"Done.\" Lane smiled, told Melissa to execute the flight plan and began getting ready. Dutch and Clete would wear black tuxes with red satin cummerbunds, ties and roses. He would wear all white including an opera cape. He planned on putting on quite a show. Sabbi would love it. She was a true romantic and so was he. He made his preparations and smiled. Clete hadn't caught on to the purpose of all the equations he'd given him to work on while he lifted weights. He'd just been happy to have some new ones to \"play with,\" while the barbell went up and down. The girl checking tickets at the door didn't ask them if they had them. Dutch handed her a rose and asked her for a dance later. The plain little girl became a beautiful woman in an instant. He was sure she was and she really couldn't doubt it. Lane smiled at Clete's wide grin when love for them both rose in a warm wave in him, then suddenly became a thought of Sabbi and a great deal warmer. They stepped through the doors and Dutch grinned, too. They followed two paces behind Lane as he walked across the dance floor. People stopped to watch and an aisle cleared. Sabbi looked up and saw him. Her face lit with delight. She waited. The gleam in his eye and his smile told her he was up to something. He made a full formal bow and produced a bouquet of white roses from the air. He dropped on one knee before her. His deep rich voice carried through the room. \"I, Sir Apollo Avelaine Gallant, ask for your hand in marriage.\" \"Yes.\" He pulled a ring set with a huge diamond from the air and placed it on her finger. She began to sing her song and he lifted her to her feet. He joined her in duet and they danced. When they finished the song, he kissed her and flower petals drifted down around them. The room erupted in applause. Clete and Dutch grinned. Lane had figured out the flower petal trick and used it to good effect. He'd been spectacular. The prince had crashed the homecoming and walked off with the queen. Clete and Dutch bowed to them and moved toward the refreshment table. Dutch filled two cups and carried them to the girl at the table in the hall. Clete felt the slightly awkward determination of a group of young women who had no special companion for the most romantic event of the year, but weren't about to miss it. He walked into the midst of them. \"Hi. I'm Clete. Can I be your date? I hate being at things like this alone.\" He pulled rose after rose from the air and handed one to each. A chubby young woman with a delightful smile suddenly laughed. \"Absolutely, and I think you're big enough to actually go around.\" \"Oh, I do my best. Would you like to dance?\" Dutch found the shy girls in the hall, the ones who had built the floats and decorated the room. The ones who had worked long and hard, then dressed up and peeked through the door at other people enjoying the fruits of their labors. He sat on the ticket table, gave out roses and gently teased. Before long, he shooed them through the doors ahead of him, found a table and seated each and every one. He bowed and led the little ticket girl onto the floor. Boys next. They'd be harder, but a bit less shy to start. There would also be fewer. For some reason, a pair of very shy girls were likely to talk each other into things and a pair of very shy boys were likely to talk each other out of them. The three women and two men faculty members and the group of alumnus smiled. They had no idea who the big men who had 'crashed the gate' were, but they were very welcome. They had made the night magical and brought the outsiders in. And in the center of the floor, the queen danced with her prince. The last song was announced and couples moved onto the floor to hold each other and move to the slow song. On the last chord, the man in white flipped several things into the air in quick succession. There were sudden flashes of light all over the room and something began to drift down. A botany professor picked one up and gasped in amazement. \"It's real! The rose petals are real! They're not replicated! They're real!\" All over the room, young university students caught drifting petals and tucked them away, memories of a magical, romantic, night. \"Time for supper. Tell me, ladies, where would you like to continue this evening?\" \"Clete, you can't be serious.\" \"Teri, I think you ladies have enjoyed my company. I know I've enjoyed yours. Whyever would you be surprised I want to take you to supper? Choose some place nice. I want to show you off. The boys and I feel quite smug having you all to ourselves. Don't we, Cliff?\" \"Yes. How about Tres Jacque?\" \"Ah, a suggestion. Sounds like a good one. Now, transport?\" \"We can walk. It's about six blocks and I'd love to be seen with a whole bunch of pretty girls.\" \"Ladies, would you walk six blocks on a warm autumn evening so Cliff, Darrell and I can show off?\" \"We'll get our coats.\" \"Teri, please allow us to use it as a way to say we're pleased to be with you. A bunch more people in line getting coats one at a time is silly and it's a nice opportunity.\" They collected the checks and walked to the coat room. \"Clete, you're an absolute master. I'm having a great time learning from you.\" \"No, Cliff. See that man over there? That's my brother Dutch. I always thought he was a master. Tonight, I learned the true master is my brother Lane.\" \"The one who asked Sabbi to marry him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"I see what you mean.\" \"Ah, you really are learning.\" \"Clete?\" \"Yes, Darrell?\" \"Um, well, Tres Jacque is... well... \" \"Don't worry. We'll cover it. It seems someone recently decided he owed me some back pay.\" \"Who? Oops, sorry. I didn't mean to pry.\" \"Then you won't mind if I don't tell you. It's rather embarrassing to be paid to escort the most beautiful women on a planet across a stage.\" \"Hi, Clete. Where are we taking the ladies?\" \"Cliff suggests Tres Jacque, Dutch.\" \"Excellent. Thanks, Cliff. I couldn't get a name from anyone. Just 'anyplace' and 'you choose.' I take it we're within strolling distance.\" \"Yes. Dutch, make sure you reassure student budgets.\" \"True. We were pretty spoiled at the academy, in the Federation in general. I may never get used to the idea of needing to carry money. I'll comm ahead. Get us the center of the room. Lane and Sabbi?\" \"Yes, definitely. Check. He may have already made the reservations.\" \"You're right. I'll bet he did. Weeks ago. Hang on, Kip. I'll take some of those. Ah, Lane. Reservations Tres Jacque?\" \"Weeks ago. Hi, Clete, Cliff, Darrell. You lost a coat check. Teri's. Middle of the dance floor.\" \"Got it. Here, guys, be right back.\" \"How'd you know?\" \"What?\" \"About the coat check and our names.\" \"Easy, Cliff. Sabbi told me your names and Clete tells me about the coat check.\" \"Teri's coat check. In the middle of the dance floor.\" \"See?\" \"Lane, not fair. You're making them nervous.\" \"You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just showing off. Like the lights and flower petals. I asked the girl of my dreams to marry me and she said yes. I'm feeling pretty smug.\" \"There's a lot of that going around. I came all alone tonight and I'm leaving with at least a girl on each arm. I'm feeling pretty good.\" \"Cliff, I like you. Ah. No, this won't do. Too drab for tonight. She needs something special.\" \"Lane, what are you going to do?\" \"Just watch, Clete.\" \"Hand her the tickets, guys. This we want to see. Dutch!\" Dutch turned from aiding young ladies with coats and Clete nodded toward Lane. They watched as he reached her, looked at her, looked at the coat, back at her and shook his head. He tossed the coat in the air. There was a flash of light and a full-length, snowy-white satin cape dropped onto his arm. When he lifted it to drape around her shoulders, the way the light glinted from it identified it as Carenna Satin. She laughed and kissed him. Clete laughed when Cliff said he thought he'd keep learning from him because he was too awed to ask Lane questions. When he turned, the two girls from the coat room were standing behind him, still holding the tickets. \"Lane! Two more for supper!\" \"Done!\" \"Do you mean... us?\" \"I most certainly do. You're almost done here. You've worked hard all evening to help make this night special and raise funds for your organization. You definitely deserve supper.\" \"Yes! I mean thanks. Come on, Jen. Let's get these coats.\" They were nearly the last to leave. Lane and Sabbi led the way. They were followed by a large group of happy girls carrying roses. Amidst the girls were five near ecstatic boys, Dutch and Clete. Tres Jacque was awaiting them. The maitre d' bowed to them. \"The queen's party has arrived!\" Suddenly every waiter and busperson was aiding with coats. The maitre d' led them to the center of the restaurant and bowed deeply. Lane removed Sabbi's cape and handed it to him. He pulled a chair out for her and every other girl found herself with a chair held for her. They were all seated and handed menus. Everyone but the maitre d' vanished. \"May I suggest?\" \"That would be most kind.\" Sabbi was having a wonderful time. She knew Lane had set everything up. The kitchen would even know what to prepare. She listened in near rapture to the delights Lane had chosen as the maitre d' named them. Mouths dropped open around the table when she nodded. \"Yes, I think that would be suitable, but do see if anyone prefers something lighter.\" \"Ladies, gentlemen, do you prefer something other?\" Dutch grinned at Clete and folded his menu. Lane was flying and neither of them was firmly on the ground. \"No, I believe the queen has spoken for us all. Thank you, Milady.\" \"Very well. It will be but a few moments.\" As soon as he'd left, Sabbi burst into giggles. \"Oh, Lane, what a meal. They don't even serve half the things he named.\" \"They do tonight. Well, at least at this table.\" \"That's another thing. A table for twenty-seven?\" \"I had them build it. The U shape was the most efficient use of space. Kept us all close enough to chat.\" The feast started arriving in minutes. It was wonderful. The chef came out and thanked them for allowing her to prepare such a wonderful menu. Sabbi said they thanked her for preparing it superbly. When the evening ended, each coat was held for the right person. No bill was presented. Cliff worried privately to Clete about it. He reassured him everything, including very generous tips, had been arranged. Cliff nodded. \"A master.\" \"Lane, we're going to see the ladies home. We'll see you shortly.\" \"I doubt that, Clete. Have a nice swim.\" Dutch and Clete both burst into laughter. When asked what they were laughing about, they just shook their heads and grinned. They escorted the girls to dorms and co-op houses and said goodnight to the boys. Clete and Dutch looked at each other and laughed. They ran back to Melissa. They were going for a swim. It was a very long one, but Clete was very happily fixing breakfast when Sabbi walked into the kitchen rather early the next morning. \"Hi. Mmm, smells good.\" \"Good morning, Sabbi. Breakfast in about five. Coffee's ready.\" \"Why do you cook?\" \"What?\" \"I mean, you have a food synthesizer, but you don't use it much. You prepare most of your own meals. Why?\" \"Well, I suppose because we enjoy doing it. We use the synth if we're in a hurry. Or if Dutch cooks. Most of the things we cook come from it. Maybe it just seems too easy.\" \"I think part of it is you're olfactory oriented.\" \"What?\" \"The smell of cooking food makes you hungrier, more appreciative. Makes a home more homey. Do you remember the smells of your boyhood?\" \"Oh, yes. Prairie grasses on a hot summer day, spring rain, a wood fire, my mother's skin when she gave me a hug.\" \"Lane's the same way. Real roses, because replicated ones don't smell fresh. Tells me every ocean smells different. Recognizes places by smell. Dutch too?\" \"Dutch too what?\" \"Oh, hi, Dutch. Recognize places by their smell.\" \"Maybe not smell so much as a... gestalt of things. Light, sound, the feel of the air, the smell and taste. I guess smell plays a very big part in it. Why?\" \"It all started when she asked me why we cooked instead of using the synth.\" \"Sabbi, I think you've hit something. I grew up in space. Starships and space stations. Clete and Lane didn't. I suppose I notice all the things I mentioned because my environment was so controlled. I collect clothes made of real materials when we go into the past because I like the way they feel on my skin. And, as for the cooking, a synthesizer doesn't make my mouth water the way Clete and Lane's cooking does. That looks great, Clete.\" \"Simple and fast, but sometimes bacon and eggs are just perfect. Enjoy. Where's Lane, Sabbi?\" \"I'm not quite sure. He handed me this dressing gown, gave me a kiss, and said to tell you he'd be here before his eggs got cold.\" \"I am. Ah, breakfast. I was looking for where we're going. Comparing star charts with my memories.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"Tenepeth, Dutch. It's a beautiful place. Rich and green. Warm seas and beautiful beaches. Yellow sun and three moons. Earth-like without all the people.\" \"Just how many people is it without?\" \"Don't worry. I'm not taking us anywhere totally uninhabited. You'll find playmates. Clete, this world will be very interesting for you. The people are empathic. Makes it a very peaceful place.\" \"I hate to mention this, Lane, but I have to get back to the university. I have classes tomorrow.\" \"Sabbi, this is a timeship. You could be gone years and make your next class. We're only going for three days. You won't forget your subjects. We're going to Tenepeth for a reason. About ten years before we'll arrive, a disease devastated the planet. Children under the age of about five weren't hit very hard. A mild fever and a quick recovery. Older kids had it quite a bit worse. About sixty percent of them died. The adults were decimated. I want you to see how they cared for all those children. Hundreds of them to four or five adults and thirty or so older kids.\" \"Oh, Lane, it's perfect! Yes, take me there.\" \"We're on our way. We'll be very welcome, especially Clete.\" \"Why me?\" \"They're trying to rebuild their population. Ten months after we leave, the birth rate doubles.\" \"Wait a minute! I'm not responsible for that!\" \"Not directly. Your presence just warms things up a bit. Look at it this way, at least you won't look like a prune from spending three days in the swimming pool.\" Sabbi suddenly realized what he meant and blushed. \"I didn't think about... I forgot... I just--\" \"Sabbi, we don't think about it either. Lane's spent a lot of time in that pool. Lots more than three days. Dutch and I are very happy for you two. Love is a wonderful thing to be near. You're family. You've become a piece of what makes us what we are. A part of the love.\" \"Clete's right. You belong with Lane. We both feel it. I'd be absolutely ecstatic about it if it weren't for one thing. Clete's so damn happy about it my teeth are rattling!\" \"Rattling? Oh, that's right. You've said that before.\" \"Happens every time things get really nice. We're not even sure exactly what it is he's doing. He doesn't seem to be able to control it. It bothers Dutch more than it does me. I find it a mild distraction, but it drives Dutch crazy.\" \"It's like... Have you ever rested your head against a cat when it's purring?\" \"Hmm, yes, but it didn't rattle my teeth, Dutch.\" \"Imagine what it would have been like if the cat was Clete's size.\" \"Oh, my.\" \"Yes, oh my. You're extremely welcome here, Sabbi. The proof is in my head. I'd be walking on air if Clete would just stop purring!\" \"Dutch, I'd stop if I could. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens.\" Sabbi looked at the three of them. Dutch looked disgusted. Clete looked chagrined. Lane was wearing a wide grin. She burst into laughter. They were family and she was part of it. She wondered if she was purring too. Lane suggested they give her a martial arts lesson. She had been working quite hard and it showed. Clete was delighted with the progress she'd made. One day she'd be very good. Lane told them they'd be landing shortly after lunch and he and Sabbi would prepare it. Sabbi decided she liked to cook, but wasn't fond of doing dishes. \"We've landed. Come on, Sabbi. Let's go look around. This is one of the havens the people built for the children. It's still in use, but most of the kids are in their teens. Don't be surprised by young-looking pregnant girls. They're watched over carefully. There's a real gap between generations. A lot of young teenagers, but very few kids between two and nine. Remember, there are a hundred empty cities out there and every child is needed.\" \"All right, Lane. I'll remember. Oh! It's beautiful!\" The sun seemed to shine softly on low, tree-shaded, buildings of a soft tan color. Bright-colored playground equipment dotted large grassy lawns. There were clusters of buildings scattered across a huge area. Each cluster enclosed a play area for very small children. Lane led her to a cluster where happy toddlers played. They introduced themselves to two girls, who looked about fifteen, who were watching the children and one of them called for someone to show them their home. Each building was designed to house about a dozen young children and one or two young adults. Rooms were large and comfortable. Bedrooms were shared by two or three children of the same sex, but not quite the same age. Oldest being furthest from the adults, youngest closest. There were playrooms and study rooms, dining rooms and kitchens. Three small rooms puzzled Sabbi until she learned they were included so there were places children could go to be alone. One room was called the \"thinking room.\" It was furnished simply and had nice windows, but no toys or other forms of entertainment. She learned it was where children were taken when they had badly misbehaved. It was a place to think things over. One young boy was sitting by a window and looking out. The girl guiding their tour asked him if he'd thought about why he was there. When he told her he had, she gave him a hug and sent him out to play. Sabbi was impressed with the affection that was obvious. Each building was a real home, warm and nurturing. \"Lane, I want to do this. Even on my very-civilized world, there are people who have children and really don't want them. They think they do, but find out later they didn't. I want to make a place they're wanted.\" \"You will, Sabbi. We'll help. I'll help. Clete will be a wonder with the kids and Dutch will be everyone's favorite uncle. You'll find others who have enough love to give it to lots of children. You're going to be Mom to dozens of wonderful people and I'm going to love being called 'Daddy.' Come on, let's find a place by ourselves. I want to tell you a story about a very special child and how he came to be. We need to get a ways away from Clete. This is the best place to tell you. The people here will help him deal with your sadness.\" \"Lane, he is sad, isn't he? Somewhere inside he's been terribly hurt. He has too much depth not to have known great pain.\" \"Sabbi, you will always amaze me. You care so deeply about others. Clete's caring is easy for me to understand. He feels other's feelings. Yours is a wonder to me and always will be. You work to know how others feel. Your love is boundless. I'm going to bask in it and wonder at it all our lives together.\" \"Hi, you headed for the beach?\" \"No, Dutch, a walk through the forest. Find Clete. Find some people for him to be around. I'm going to tell Sabbi about Helen.\" \"Give me a few minutes to find him and meet some people. I saw a group of young women sitting on the beach. I'll take him there, then make myself scarce.\" \"Find yourself some company too, Dutch. Clete's pretty attuned to Sabbi right now. It'll hit you hard too.\" \"Yeah. Later.\" \"Why is Clete attuned to me?\" \"Catnip \" \"What!?\" \"Having you around makes us all happy. Your presence makes him purr.\" \"Because of you.\" \"Some, but a lot of it's you. You radiate warmth and caring. It delights him. I'm going to tell you how much.\" Dutch 'tracked' Clete and moved fast. He wanted to find him before he started hunting for them to find out what was wrong. \"Come on, Clete.\" \"Where to, Dutch?\" \"Down the beach a ways. You're about to make some friends. Lane sent me.\" \"Oh. All right.\" \"I'm going to take you where you're going and take off. I have some friends of my own to make.\" \"This is all rather mysterious.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"Dutch, you're hurting.\" \"Yeah. A bit. I'm going to find somebody to help make it go away. You've stopped purring. First time I was ever sorry my teeth weren't rattling. There are your friends. Later.\" \"Hello, I'm Talla. What has you puzzled and worried?\" \"My brother. He just led me here and said make friends. He's hurting and didn't tell me why. My other brother is sad too. NO! Not... Oh, Lane, I'm not ready.\" \"Peli! Tiva! Help me! Oh, such pain! Such sadness. His loss is too great. Help me comfort him.\" They cradled him and cried with him. They shared the story that had pained Sabbi so deeply. They held Clete as Lane held Sabbi, helping ease the pain by sharing it. Dutch hadn't been so lucky. Two girls found him curled on the ground crying. \"Please, let us help you.\" \"It'll pass. I'll be all right. I'm sorry. I know I'm hurting you.\" \"Yes, you are hurting us. Stop being foolish and let us help us all feel better. Lethe, what shall we do with him?\" \"Make him forget about it, Dida. We know how.\" \"Yes. Oh! I've shocked him. That wasn't what I had in mind at all.\" \"You're children!\" \"No. Not on this world. We know the way it was. It must be different now. Come on, Lethe. He'll get over the silliness. Tell us your name.\" \"Dutch. Stop! You don't know what you're doing!\" \"Oh, Dutch! We know exactly what we're doing. Lethe, he's beautiful.\" \"All right, I believe you! You know what you're doing. Now, stop it!\" \"Dida, kiss him, then he'll stop shouting. Oh! That's better. His mind is still protesting, but his body is most definitely not.\" Dutch surrendered. He didn't really have a choice in the matter. The two empaths felt his response to every touch, each caress. He moaned as Lane's passion suddenly burned through the link he had with his brothers. When Clete caught fire, he was lost. Suddenly, there were more of them. Dozens of them. Touching him. Loving him. He knew when Clete loosed the tight hold he kept on his passion. The world caught fire. The moons were rising when he began to think coherently. He was surrounded by children. \"Stop that! You're embarrassed. Just stop it! No one of us is a child. Children don't respond. You're on our world. We'll show you again we're not children.\" Dutch started to laugh. He was used to the intimacy of sharing his brothers' passion. Lane had landed him on a world where all shared that intimacy. He was trying to impose his values in a place they just didn't work. The age of adulthood was different. There was no struggling with misunderstood feelings. No fears of being different or unliked. No loneliness. No frightening adolescence. It was still a struggle not think of those around him as children, but his reason told him they were adults. There didn't seem to be any nudity taboos either. \"Ooh, your skin is so white in the moonslight. And so soft. Especially, here... and here. You're shocked again. You're just going to have to get over that. I'm Teli and I just won't stand for it. I'm going to stop it right now.\" \"Teli! Leave him alone. There are lots of silly taboos where he comes from and you're breaking dozens of them. You're being mean! This is more than cultural. He just doesn't want you. He's totally hetero. You aren't going to change it.\" \"You're right, Dida. I'm sorry, Dutch. I wasn't paying attention to what you were really feeling. You're just so beautiful, I got carried away. I hope we can be friends. All right! I'm forgiven. Too bad though, I'd really--\" \"Teli!\" \"Yeah, yeah. Behave myself. I'm going for a swim. Anybody else?\" \"We'll all go. Come on, Dutch. Teli will be good. I promise. If not, I'll get mad.\" \"Oh, I'll be good. The last time Dida got mad at me, my head rang for a fiveday. I felt singed for twenty. Half my friends wouldn't talk to me. When Dida gets mad, everbody gets singed.\" \"I've got a brother like that.\" \"We noticed your brother. Everyone on the planet noticed your brother. We're still noticing him. What is he doing? My teeth feel... \" \"Like they're rattling. Yeah, I know. Do you know what a cat is, Dida? Do you have an animal... How do I explain it? It's just Clete. He's content. He's purring. It drives me crazy!\" They laughed and pulled him toward the sea. He looked around for things, but couldn't find them. He gave it up as hopeless. When on Tenepeth... He hadn't been skinny-dipping in a warm sea in a long time. \"Hello, Dutch. Nice night.\" \"It would be if you'd stop rattling my teeth!\" \"I can't help it. You know I can't.\" \"This is obviously your brother, Clete.\" \"Yes. Clete, this is Dida. You're making her teeth rattle too.\" \"Oh, sorry. I really wish I knew how to stop it. It... just happens.\" \"Don't worry about it. Oh, my. You're huge. Everywhere.\" \"Uh, Dutch, they're kids.\" \"No, Clete, they're not. Believe me. They're just small adults. I've gotten a very long lecture about it. And a rather effective demonstra-- CLETE!\" \"Dutch, she's making me warm. Very warm.\" \"Hi. I'm Lethe. That's just Dida. She makes everybody warm, but not as warm as you do. You are the most magnificent male I have ever seen. Go away Teli. This one's the same.\" \"Not fair!\" \"Dutch, I'm going to have real problems in this place. How long did... Lane say we're... staying?\" \"About two more days.\" Clete groaned and Dutch laughed. They had a too-good time for the two days, but they learned a great deal too. Dutch 'won' his battle with himself to accept what he knew was the truth of the culture, but Clete knew he was still working on it a bit when Lane was saying farewell to Sabbi. \"I suppose I didn't really get over it til I found out Dida was a mother, Dutch. It helped when I met Carva.\" \"Nothing like having a seventy-year-old patriarch treat them as adults to make it easier to accept them as such. Clete, we've got to ask Lane some things.\" \"Like what, Dutch?\" \"Tiva didn't seem to have any doubts about you and I fathering children on her world. The gestation period is about right and the physiology is similar.\" \"Well, two hearts is a start. Helen got help. Decided before I married her. Just made up her mind and got medical assistance.\" \"Like my mom. 'I want a baby. You're going to be the father.' Clete, I want to know. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I've never even thought about it before. And they're so young.\" \"Do you know how old Dida was?\" \"Not old enough.\" \"You're wrong. They're a small people. You got a lecture because she thought you needed it. She made me promise not to tell you til we left.\" \"Tell me what?\" \"Dutch, Dida has three children. The oldest is four. She's twenty-three. Not one of those kids was under eighteen. They mature fairly slowly. Puberty hits between seventeen and eighteen. Tiva's in her thirties.\" Dutch started to laugh. She'd told him children didn't respond. He hadn't asked her at what age they stopped being children. She'd told him her world was different and he'd forced himself to accept it, but he hadn't really understood it. He'd still thought of them as being the same. No wonder she'd been surprised at his shock. He hadn't explained he came from a place where puberty began at twelve or thirteen, in many people. Some even younger. He realized communication was more than just being able to speak and understand the language. \"Hi. That was really hard to do. I don't suppose saying... I can't even say the word. I couldn't even say farewell. I ended up with, 'See you soon.' It'll never get easier, but I will see her again fairly soon. Now ask me.\" \"Lane, will any of those women on Tenepeth bear our children?\" \"I don't know.\" \"TERRIFIC!\" \"Easy, Dutch. I don't. They don't really know either. Paternity isn't really important to them. Every child is loved and needed. If a male and female pairbond, they take her children and seven or eight more and set up a household. Your friend Teli was pairbonded. He just saw you as a very attractive, non-threatening, diversion. He wasn't interested in the women. He has a heterosexual mate. They'll probably find another male to bond with eventually, since he seems to be so inclined.\" \"But he was on the beach with us.\" \"So was she. I doubt you were exactly aware of what was going on around you. Why do you think Sabbi and I were left alone?\" \"Because you were pairbonded.\" \"Exactly. You and Clete weren't. Teli is nearly as old as we are. Pairbonding doesn't usually take place until the mid twenties. Sometimes never.\" \"That explains what Dida said about you, Dutch.\" \"What did she say?\" \"You stirred her too much. She stayed away from you because you would not be ready when she was. You might never be. I was safer. I had been mated.\" \"Tenepethans bond for life, Dutch. If one of them dies, they never bond again. That's why Carva didn't have a mate. Once in a while a bond forms one way. It's a sad thing. One loving the other and knowing that one does not love in return. Only responsive to one person and that person wanting more. It's less common than a three-way bond. Dida was falling in love with you, so she turned to Clete to stop the process. I hope it worked.\" \"Lane, don't you ever get me into something like that again! There's a woman I may have injured and children who may be mine. And I won't ever know. Don't let it happen again!\" \"Dutch, it had to be. You had to grow up sometime. You're a heartbreaker. Women have fallen in love with you before. You never even noticed. Just kissed them goodby and went on your merry way. Now maybe you'll think about it before you turn on the charm and fill some poor girl with dreams she learns, the hard way, won't come true. Humans don't usually bond for life. If a heart breaks, it mends and loves again. Usually. And you're too different biologically to father children unless a woman seeks help. You don't catch or carry diseases. Tenepeth was for you. Clete was something that helped them, but you were the reason we were there. I could have taken Sabbi to other places that were good examples. I won't do it again. I won't have to. You'll accept responsibility for your actions. Oh, sometimes women will fall in love with you and you'll hurt them. It happens to Dad. But you'll never just blithely ignore their feelings again.\" \"I do, don't I? Assume they're into having a good time just like I am and never look deeper.\" \"Dutch, most of them are. You just have to notice when it gets beyond that point. Ask Clete why Riss just suddenly disappeared. He knows. Even in the midst of his falling in love, he felt her pain when she said, 'Well, Dutch, it's been fun,' and walked off. I saw it too.\" \"And I didn't. Damn. I feel like a complete heel.\" \"You aren't or you wouldn't feel like one. You'll always love women, and they'll always love you. Don't stop charming them and loving them. Just be aware if you're hurting them and be gentle.\" \"Thanks, Lane. I learned a lot of lessons on Tenepeth. I want to go back there someday. But not until Dida's bonded.\" \"Did you have to do that? Oh!\" \"Do what? What did I do?\" \"Decide to go back. Lord, what a mess. Well, it's not that bad. The answer is you think so. Some of the kids are pretty big, but you don't ask Clete to check. In their culture, it's just not important and it's a very healthy one for kids.\" \"Yes, Lane, I got that part of the lesson too.\" \"I was sure you had. Let's go fishing. I'm in the mood for Rocky Mountain trout and the smell of pines.\" \"Good idea. Let's go. Clete, get your hip boots on. Fresh fish tonight.\" The last evening of the fishing trip, Clete suddenly looked up from cleaning up after dinner. \"Dutch, you're tense. What's wrong?\" \"I don't know. I feel watched. Icy breath on the back of my neck. A feeling of... being plotted against. Evil intent. Directed at us, Clete. Lane, do you see anything? Any changes?\" \"No. Fishing trip is over. We're headed for the future to explore. We find interesting people and places. We head back and I take Sabbi to the winter formal. Nothing new. Including this conversation. It... isn't there.\" \"Let's finish cleaning our cooking area and get going. This forest just doesn't feel as friendly as it did.\" \"Done. I'll load the fishing gear. You put the fire out. Lane, lay in the coordinates. I'm ready to get out of here too. Dutch? Dutch?\" \"Like laughter. Cold and mocking.\" \"Lane, get the fire. I'm going to get him in.\" \"Got it. Out. Place looks good. Damn. Here, give me the gear. Clete?\" \"Yeah. I've got him. Push. He's not moving.\" \"What? Oh. We're ready. Good. Let's get out of here. Why are you two pushing me?\" \"Because you stopped moving. Inside fast. Lane and I want away. Whatever you're picking up, we don't like it either. Door closed. Better?\" \"Yeah. Still feel... wary. Lane, get us on our way.\" \"Coordinates in. We're gone.\" They sat and talked for awhile and Dutch relaxed. The fire and the feel of home lulled them. They went to bed settled and comfortable. Clete jerked awake with Lane's raging loss burning through him. Suddenly, Dutch was enraged, then shocked cold. He ran for Dutch' s room and pulled Lane off him and held him as he screamed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?! SHE'S GONE!! YOU CHANGED IT!! SHE'S GONE!!\" \"CLETE, I ALMOST KILLED HIM! HE WAS AT MY THROAT! I ALMOST KILLED HIM!\" \"SHUT UP!! Damn!\" Clete slugged Lane. He couldn't hold him. He was incoherent and wild. He dropped him and grabbed Dutch. He was collapsing in near hysteria. \"Easy. Easy. You were under attack and you weren't awake. Dutch, you weren't even fighting him.\" \"I couldn't. I almost killed him in the first instant. I was afraid to. I was afraid I'd kill him. He couldn't have known what he was doing or I'd be dead. What happened, Clete? What did he mean?\" \"Come on. Let's get to neutral ground. I'm going to drop him in the pool. If he doesn't wake up, we'll have to pull him out. I'm going to hang onto him until he's coherent. I want you to help.\" \"I can't. Clete, I nearly killed him.\" \"YOU SAID THAT BEFORE!! NOW MOVE!!\" Clete shook him. It was a very dangerous thing to do. Dutch was nearly as wild as Lane had been. He sighed in relief when the crazed look went out of his eyes and he nodded. \"Good. 'She' can only be Sabbi. Let's find out what happened.\" \"He thought I'd made a change, Clete. Made a decision that took her from him. He's still going to think that when he wakes up.\" \"Did you?\" \"No. Nothing. I've been searching my mind for something I might have done subconsciously. There's nothing there. Except... \" \"Except what?\" \"The memory of mocking laughter.\" \"Dutch, we've been attacked. Personally. And very badly injured. A healing trance won't cure this. Get in the pool. I'll drop him in and be right behind you.\" \"I don't... All right. Do it.\" Dutch grabbed Lane and shoved him against the wall. The shock of the cold water brought him to. Clete jumped in and they held him as he started to fight. \"Lane! He didn't do it! Dutch didn't do it! Dutch didn't change things! Easy. Easy. Now tell us. Tell us, Lane. Dutch didn't make a change. You said there was one. Tell us.\" \"I... I woke up with my head spinning with change. Real deep change. I couldn't do anything but lay there and wait for it to clear. When it did, she was gone. My life with Sabbi was gone. No home. No love. Gone. I guess I went a little crazy.\" \"No, you went a lot crazy. Do you remember trying to kill Dutch?\" \"I... No. Yes. I guess. I wanted him to change it back. To make him... bring her back.\" \"Lane, I didn't make any changes. None. Not even subconsciously. You've been attacked. We've been attacked. What I felt in the forest. It has to be.\" \"We've been hurt. Bad. Not just you. All of us. And it was set up well. Your long future memory came back just in time for your meeting with her. Just in time for you to see a future and have it ripped away. You nearly killed Dutch. He nearly killed you. The attack came close to completely destroying us. It nearly defeated us with one stroke. We were totally defenseless against it. We love her too. If she's gone from your life, she's gone from ours, Dutch's, mine and my son's. If one of you had killed the other, could that one have lived with it? Could I? It knocked us down, but we can get up.\" \"You're right. Oh, Clete. Your son. I only saw my pain, my emptiness. I'm sorry. Dutch--\" \"You don't even need to say it. Let's get out of here. I'm shivering and I'm not even sure I'm cold.\" \"Reaction. I'll get towels. Sorry about the punch, Lane. I couldn't think of anything else to do.\" \"It's probably the only thing you could do. A week in a healing trance should make my jaw feel normal again.\" \"Weak humor, but better. Here. Hand up. Towel. Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. I'm weak in the knees. They feel like jelly.\" \"Let's go to the kitchen. I'm ordering cocoa with something in it for us all. I'm wobbly too. Adrenaline reaction. Things went crazy in a hurry. Come on, Lane.\" Clete and Dutch each put an arm around Lane and guided him to the kitchen. Clete got them both down at the table and fixed them a hot drink. Both were shivering. He put a bit of liqueur in the cocoa and sat down with them. \"Drink. Let's talk. Something out there is out to get us. It made a change. I don't know if we can unmake it, but we can try.\" \"No, Clete. I don't think we can. It changed something and I think we're stuck with it.\" \"Why not, Lane? Why can't we change it?\" \"Because Sabbi's going to marry someone else. Elope. She's very sorry, but I was so romantic she thought she was in love with me. As soon as she met him, she realized she was wrong. Maybe that's true. Maybe she was always supposed to marry him and the real attack came when I fell in love with her. He's a nice guy. He'll make her a wonderful husband. A builder. Widower with two kids. Wants to build her dream for her. We'll see them again. Won't be long for us, but about twenty years for them. He'll build it. Clete, they offer to give your son a home.\" \"No. We'll find another way. Tell them thanks for offering.\" \"I will. Let's get this over with. I want it done. This round to the enemy. Score one zip.\" \"Wrong, Lane. We're ahead on points. This just feels worse. It was a knockdown. Almost a knockout. It's the first round we've lost and it was a hit below the belt. We fight fair. We always will. It doesn't. Doesn't know how. Wouldn't want to. That's why it's the enemy.\" \"You're right, Dutch. Definitely below the belt. At least we don't have to take turns in the swimming pool.\" Dutch and Clete laughed. Soon Lane joined in. It was weak and edged with hysteria, but it was laughter. \"Now what? What did you mean you wanted to get it over with?\" \"I'm setting the coordinates to go back to see Sabbi, Dutch. Let her tell me goodby.\" \"Lane, we could go back and get her right after we left her. Stop her from meeting him. Make a change.\" \"No, Dutch, that would be using its methods. We don't do that. You don't do that. But thanks for offering. I'll survive. Like Clete, I'll have some wonderful memories. They aren't enough, but they're what I have. I'm going to set the coordinates. Clete, would you make us another drink and bring it to the living room? I don't feel much like sleeping.\" \"Done. Go on, Dutch. Keep him company. He'll want to be alone later, but right now he needs us.\" Clete fixed more cocoa with the mint liqueur and carried it to the living room. They sat and watched the fire in silence until Lane went to dress. Clete decided he didn't want him going alone and Dutch agreed. They dressed and were waiting for him when he returned. \"I want to go to the door alone, but I'd like you with me as far as the lift to her apartment. She's moving out. You'll meet him. He'll know who you are. Clete, he hurts for me, but he loves her. You'll feel it. Let's go.\" They walked with him as far as the building lobby and waited. A fellow carrying a chair came out of the lift Lane had taken up. \"Hi, I'm Mike Renfield. Damn, this is awkward. Look, I... \" \"It's all right, Mike. We love her too. Take good care of her.\" \"She's an impossible dream come true. I really do love her. You're Clete, right? I don't know how I could have gotten so lucky. She's right. I'd have known you guys anywhere. Rose called you the three most beautiful men there are. Hair like that. She said the big strawberry blond was Clete. Lane was the one with hair like moonlight and Dutch's was of spun gold. Supposed to tell you Snow White will see you in her dreams, Dutch. I don't think she quite knows what Sabbi sees in a chubby fellow like me without enough hair to cover. Neither do I. I'm babbling. Sorry.\" \"That's all right, Mike. We understand. Let me help you with that chair.\" \"Nah, I'll get it. You wait for your brother. The chair doesn't need you.\" Dutch watched Mike struggle through the door with the chair, then turned back to the lift. They both knew Lane was coming down. \"Lane was right, Clete, a nice guy.\" \"And he does love her. Feels real... almost ashamed about hurting Lane.\" \"Yes, and he'll be with her more than I would have been. Let's go.\" \"You all right, Lane?\" \"No, Dutch, but I'll limp along. One more hurdle.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"Yeah, Mike. I know. We'll stop by in about twenty years to look at how you make her dreams come true.\" \"I'll do it, Lane. I really will. Oh, oh, here come the kids. Ice cream everywhere.\" \"Here, take my handkerchief. We'll see you when you've built her dream. Good-by.\" \"Good-by, Lane. I hope... Well, you know.\" \"Yeah. I know.\" Lane shook his hand and they walked away from where he was laughing and wiping ice cream off the faces of two pretty little girls. \"Take me to a bar. A loud, obnoxious, beer and whiskey bar. Several of them. Get me drunk and in a half dozen brawls. I promise I won't break anyone. No one will break me either. Unfortunately, that's already been done. I want a lady who's not one on each arm and one in my lap. I want to pass out sometime tomorrow and not dream. I want to wake up with such a bad hangover I can't think. Then I want to laugh at the thing that laughed at us. Dutch, I know where we're going. Adith. Pirates. Bad ones. Insane. The enemy is there. Got a strong hold on them.\" \"Sounds like it needs to be changed. Let's do it.\" \"I found a bar. A whole bunch of them. I can feel the wildness.\" \"Lead on, Clete. The three Gallant boys are going to cut loose.\" \"Done.\"",

I am not going to spend days wondering. What?\" \"Lane. He aches for her. Needs her. Wants her. Wants her so much he's like a caged animal.\" \"No. Not this time. The future is too good. I won't risk it. It's not worth chancing. I think a lot of it is this trip. Two days on this ship with nothing to do but think about her.\" \"He's going to be useless by the time we get to Harvelle, worn ragged. We're supposed to compete. We're going to be out of it.\" \"You just came up with the answer. I'll bet if we spent two full days training, we'd be ready. And it's not really a change. We're still on the ship. Still traveling with the show. We'll give Frake Melissa's call signal. Lane didn't see anything, but it will keep Frake from getting nervous.\" \"Done. Ten minutes. In the gym.\" Lane was waiting for them when they got there. Dutch almost changed his mind. He looked fevered. He was pale and shaky-looking. \"I know. You don't have to tell me. I'm in rough shape. Put me to work. I'm full of tomorrow's memories and I need them to be now.\" Clete put them to work. He worked them every waking hour of the two days. Lane dropped into bed exhausted and slept. It was what he needed. They were ready when they landed. \"Dutch, we are about to turn this world on its ear. This is the base. Where it's all coming from. A pleasant, homey, little ball of vice, crime, corruption, and upright citizen crooks. It starts with the competition we're going to enter and the gray man. He's a mad dog they set loose. We're sending him back to them. This is the one world where they don't want him. He followed us. Now, the competition's fixed. We're about to unfix it.\" \"How do they fix a martial arts competition, Lane? A fight I could see, but this is huge, competitors from everywhere.\" \"They start with referees and judges and supplement with beatings and drugs. We're going to have a lot of very good help. Wait'll you meet Master Pon and Jerona, Clete. Dutch, you'll really like the Perisks. This is team and individual. A large amount of money is wagered. The betting is legal and our bad boys use it to pay off the help.\" \"Tell them who to bet on to collect their pay.\" \"Right, Clete. The first thing we do is find Master Pon. His school is registered. We're about to be students. He's even going to teach us some things. You'll love it. Let's help get the show set up. We're going to be conspicuously present several places at once.\" They helped unload and get things to the concert hall, then slipped quietly back to the ship. It was time to travel. They found Master Pon two days before, settled into lotus position near him on the beach and waited. They greeted the rising sun and moved smoothly into the tai chi ch'uan with him. He began a series of complex katas. They followed. It was quite some time before he found one they didn't know. They knelt and watched. When he had completed it, Clete spoke for them. \"Master, we ask you teach us.\" \"Who are you that I should spend my most valuable time?\" \"We are ones who have learned the value of knowledge.\" \"Do you then think you are wise?\" \"Only in knowing wisdom must be sought.\" \"It is a beginning. I will teach you.\" \"Thank you, Master. We will seek to learn well.\" \"Good. Now, who are you guys and where did you come from? I thought I knew most of the really advanced people in the sector.\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Clete. My brothers Lane and Dutch. We're from outside the sector. We've got wind of something real smelly in the competition coming up. We want to clear the air and we need your help.\" \"Sounds interesting. Let's go find late lunch. I'm starved.\" Master Pon was a delightful little man in his seventies. He had a quick wit and an easy laugh. They took him to Melissa for lunch. He looked around and grinned. When they told him what they planned to do, he smiled widely and officially 'enrolled' them in his school. He was the first person they'd shown Melissa who didn't say she was impossible. They went with him to meet their fellow students and Dutch just shook his head. Lane hadn't told them all Master Pon's other students were female. \"Jerona, Keli, Kera, I want you to meet someone. These are the newest students in our school; Dutch, Clete and Lane.\" \"Pon, I seldom question any decision you make, but aren't they just a bit unusual?\" \"More than you realize, Jerona. They're the best I've ever seen. Except myself, of course. They plan on taking apart a gambling fix on the competition. They also want to put a drug smuggling ring, with a sideline in forced prostitution, out of business in the process. Interested?\" \"This sounds like our kind of fun. Keli, Kera?\" \"You bet. The company's not bad to look at either. Hi, I'm Keli Perisk. The quiet one drooling over there is my sister Kera.\" \"Dutch. The drooling's mutual. I'm crazy about twins. Especially beautiful, red-haired twins. How'd you like to help me blow up a few warehouses and labs?\" \"Oh, I just love fireworks. Tell us all about it.\" \"Hmm, I'll bet I can fit three on my bike.\" Clete and Lane laughed as they watched Dutch walk off with a lady on each arm. He was in absolute heaven. He was telling them all about \"bikes.\" \"Clete, Jerona is my assistant. More than a student. A perfectionist to the core. You want to learn that kata, she can show you.\" \"All right! Lead on, Jerona. I'd follow you anywhere.\" \"You got it, big man. My, you are big. I'm taller than half the men I meet. You make me feel petite. I think I like it.\" \"Well, Lane, looks like we're left out in the cold. Of course, my wife frowns on it if I stay warm.\" \"I think your wife and my fiancé would get along. They seem to have some things in common.\" \"Shall we find a quiet place to talk and make some immediate plans?\" \"A good idea. Uh, oh. Sensei, that little girl in back needs a word.\" \"Damn. She's at it again. She just wants to learn so badly, she tries things more advanced students are doing. I'll... Well, I guess that's taken care of. He's really giving her a lecture.\" \"Don't worry. Clete gives very gentle lectures. I figured he'd see her. Probably felt her hurting herself. He's an empath.\" \"I wondered how he knew. He had his back to her. Are you all empaths?\" \"No, just Clete.\" \"And do you and Dutch have talents?\" \"I suppose you could call them that. I see the future. Dutch changes it.\" \"That must be most intriguing.\" \"It has its moments.\" Lane and Pon worked out logistics and made a list of things they'd need. Pon was delighted with the idea of it all happening during the competition and pageant. He shook his head in sadness when Lane told him the names of the people they were after. They were known and respected. They worked out the arrangements to save spouses and children from suffering shame and humiliation. Pon would add nineteen to his list of staff and students. They would travel to another world and another competition with him. Once there, they would become new people. Wagers on the competition would provide the funds for homes and upkeep. Merith had a list of eight new employees and would make the wagers. Dutch, Keli and Kera were sitting in Lissa happily constructing bombs. They would need a great many. Clete and Jerona were setting up the competition schedule. They were getting along famously. Things were running very smoothly when Clete suddenly groaned. \"Damn, Dutch! Sorry, Jerona, I can't think. I'm going to find a cold shower.\" \"What's the problem? What's happening?\" \"Dutch, Keli, and Kera are what's happening. They're also the problem.\" \"Oh, I see. Come with me.\" Jerona led Clete back to the shower room, but the water she turned on wasn't cold. Lane took a deep breath. \"Pon, I need a drink, a cold shower, and probably an anesthetic.\" \"I feel a bit warm myself. Your brothers?\" \"They have help.\" \"Yes, the ladies are helpful. Come on. Let's grab a few beers and go for a swim. We'll take the kids with us. Nothing like a cold ocean and a batch of little girls to keep things in perspective.\" \"Pon, you're a genius.\" \"Yes, but I've also been married forty-five years and been teaching women for twenty-seven. This genius is based on experience.\" \"I think we should hurry.\" \"Watch this. Salute your sensei! Time to play! Hit the beach!\" Lane watched and grinned. Every student gave formal thanks, then a mad scramble began. In two minutes, he and Pon were strolling behind forty, running, chattering, squealing girls toward the sea. Some were carrying beach chairs and sports equipment. One pair carried a coldkeep between them. By the time they caught up, two chairs, an umbrella and the keep were awaiting them. They laughed, pulled off their shirts and ran for the sea. The next day, Master Pon submitted his lists for the competition. They were stamped approved. They weren't even read. He'd never had male students. No one realized they were there. He hurried to the concert hall where his three students and his three assistants awaited in Melissa. They had a large number of beatings and druggings to prevent. Lane slid Melissa a few hours into the future and they went to work. Groups of men expecting to find one or two sleeping in a room met several awake outside the door. They broke into three teams after they had taken care of the large groups. Clete and Jerona had developed a smooth working relationship. Dutch, Keli and Kera had tremendous fun. Pon and Lane disposed of men who would have abused young people. They got a full day's rest in Melissa. Lane and Pon spent a good deal of time in the cold water of the swimming pool. They returned to the time they'd left. Dutch, Clete and Lane went to work preparing for the \"Our Special Girl\" pageant and Pon and the ladies went back to the dojo to organize students and equipment. Pon commed the masters of other schools in the competition and arranged a meeting. They would eject referees and judges who were unfair. Merith met Pon's brother-in-law and gave him funds and a list of wagers to make. Pon did not wish to know the outcome of the competition. His brother-in-law placed the bets with a very large grin on his face. He'd made a few small wagers of his own the day before. Lane recorded the tips to five honest men; three detective captains, a prosecutor and a news editor. He set the timer to send out the calls. He took Melissa to a restaurant and placed a tiny tracking device in the hem of the gray man's coat. It would lead Dutch, Clete and him to the board meeting and seal the gray man's fate. The murderer of Sabbi's father would die at the hands of his employers. She'd seen that changing that would change who she and her mother had become, without needing to be guided to it. The men on the board would be betrayed by some very unhappy, unpaid, employees, when the honest authorities found them in possession of large quantities of drugs. They'd be sure they'd been set up. They would be, but not by their bosses. Sabbi and he had agreed that would be satisfying too. He smiled as he replicated 'colors' for Pon and the ladies. They would enjoy the leathers and the wild ride. He also installed a set of pegs and built a new seat for Dutch's bike. It was a surprise. It was designed for three. Dutch would be a bit closer to the bars, but he wouldn't mind. He'd still be able to lift the front wheel off the ground. He rested in the past, then returned to the time of his departure. He had a team kata rehearsal. Pon put them to work as soon as he arrived. \"Yes, the appearance is aesthetically pleasing. Now, begin. No. Dutch, you must move a bit more slowly. You complete the moves a fraction too soon, then must pause before beginning the next. Again. Clete, control your power. The punches of all must be equal. Again.\" Pon smiled at the three big, blond men and the three big, red-haired women. They'd take the advanced mixed competition. He still felt the splitting of the competitors by sex was wrong, but Lane had explained it was part of the \"fix\" and very profitable to a pair of unpleasant men who provided bullies for the business. It was why none of his girls were targets. The presence of Clete, Dutch and Lane had placed his school in the overall points event. They had added possible points in a total of seven events. Pon expected his girls to complete a near sweep of their schedule. If the three men did as well as he knew they should, it would be the first overall his school had taken. He'd never had entries in the heavy and super-heavy classes. He longed for the 'old days' when all competitors were grouped only by levels of skill and not broken into age and weight classes. It was a technique of the sponsors and promoters, more events and more wagers. He smiled. He had entered himself in three events. It had been a long time. He expected to add the points for masters' level men to their total. The two men he hadn't been sure he wouldn't break in pieces wouldn't be competing. He'd never doubted his instincts about them, just thought testing his control for a few points that made no difference was foolish. The show people, contestants, escorts and all the students of Pon's school went to dinner together. Frake made the arrangements. A large restaurant became very busy. Lane smiled as Dutch tensed and shook his head. The gray man stood across the street and gazed at them taking seats by the window. He would be on his way to see his bosses. Dutch knew he would be going nowhere else. Ever. Dinner was a great success. Frake had a bill prepared and signed for it. It too would be covered out of Merith's wagers. It delighted him to know the money would come from the coffers of the people who had used him to smuggle drugs. He had noticed the two Lane had released from the hold and the third he had fired were on the planet. Lane had told him one of them would become a fount of information for the prosecutor. He wished he could stay to see it, but the show would move on. He knew Lane, Clete and Dutch would not be going with them. Their work would be done and they would find another who needed guardian angels. Frake and Pon became friends over dinner. The friendship would last until their deaths many years in the future. \"We have to leave. We have something to do tonight. We'll see you all tomorrow. Come on, let's set this thing in motion.\" \"With you in a minute, Lane. I just want to say goodnight to the ladies. OW! All right! I'm going. I'm going.\" Clete grinned, let go of Dutch's ear and followed him out the door, around the corner and into the alley where Lane had 'parked' Melissa. They moved her to an office and walked into the \"Boardroom\" across the hall from it. Dutch smiled at the nine very shocked people and sat on the end of the table. \"Hello, we're the Gallants. This is your notice we're shutting you down. Permanently.\" \"How did you get in here? How did you find this place?\" \"We put a tracker on your man in gray. It's in the hem of his coat. I believe I hear him coming now.\" \"YOU! You can't be here! I just saw you sitting down to dinner. You can't be... You're not natural. You're some kind of spooks.\" \"Oh, we're quite real. You're going to be sorry I didn't kill you. Goodby.\" Dutch laughed as he walked through the door and heard the gray man protesting he couldn't have been followed. He slept well that night. The news headlines the morning of the competition were about the beaten and mutilated body found floating in the bay. Lane would have liked to hear the 'board' trying to figure out how all those chains had come undone. He was rather fond of the little laser knife he carried in his pocket. It worked well on packing crates too. The tournament was interesting, especially when the senseis ejected four referees and three judges. They chose new ones from the expert aficionados in the audience. Pon's school swept through the competition. Two schools dominated most of the events for young males. They did not take any of the men's heavy or super-heavy events. They didn't take the master's either. The team kata competitions drew cheers from the crowd. When the winning men's team and the winning women's team combined and won the mixed event, they went wild. Pon accepted the overall point award for his school with a determinedly humble bow. He received a standing ovation from both the audience and fellow competitors. The day had already been wonderful and the fun was just beginning. Pon and his three assistants had box seats for the pageant. He smiled at the gasps of delight when the escorts in white produced a rose from the air for each contestant. He made a mental note to send flowers to his wife in celebration of their victory, then decided to add \"at first opportunity\" to it. Without her patience and support, it would not have been possible. Frake and Merith took the contestants out for supper. The Gallants would be busy. They started by hopping backward in time. They went from world to world and time to time. They thwarted every attempt made on shows that had come under their protection. It took them eight days. They landed outside Pon's school a few minutes after the pageant was over and Pon introduced the Gallants to his wife Ellith. She smiled in delight when Lane pulled a rose from the air and presented it to her. She mentioned Pon had sent a huge bouquet, which had been delivered moments before. Pon was very pleased he'd called and ordered them during the pageant. Jerona, Keli and Kera received roses as well. Clete pulled one, and Dutch two, from the air. They asked Ellith to put them in water. They would reclaim them in a short while. Pon told his wife he would be back in a few moments and returned with the others to Melissa to begin an evening of fun. He had smiled at his wife's tale of a crime ring's sudden fall during the evening hours. He didn't tell her he was on his way to help make it happen. She might worry. About his sanity. When they landed, Dutch found his present. \"Lane, you're terrific! It's great! Now I really can ride three.\" \"Happy whatever, Dutch. We're going to have to take them apart and put them together a lot. It clips in. Oh! I have other surprises as well. Ladies, these are your colors. Pon, this set is for you. Diamond clips for the ears and mirrored lenses for the eyes. Shall we change and terrorize a crime ring?\" They all smiled in delight as they stood before the mirrored wall Melissa made for them in the living room and looked at their reflections. They put the bikes together and roared into the day. Keli and Kera flipped to see who would sit behind Dutch first. They would take turns, changing places each time they hit another city. The seven of them roared into warehouse after warehouse and lab after lab. They left all the personnel napping outside and blew them up. They 'planted' a large quantity of drug for the police to find when they followed Lane's tips, then rode back to Melissa. They had spent seven hours in the city. They got a good night's rest and spent a pleasant day together. Lane and Pon spent some time swimming and Dutch complained about his teeth rattling at dinner. They landed, assembled the bikes, and spent the same seven hours in another city. In all, they spent sixteen days in the task, all in the same seven hours. They landed back at the school ten minutes after they'd left. They put together the evacuation plan for the innocents and began working on it. When they had everything ready, they went to the first house and Dutch slipped inside and smiled widely at the woman who was too pained to be shocked when he walked into the room. \"Hello, I'm Dutch. I'm here to get you and your children out of this mess. We've got a vehicle out back and a way for you to disappear. Bring your cat and anything you can't bear to part with, but not more than you can carry in one bag. Please, I know it's very hard to trust right now, but we will help.\" \"How did you get in? Can you really get us through all those reporters? And not for... a story?\" \"I got in because you need me. Yes, we can and no story is wanted. We've got transport offplanet and a new home and identities ready for you.\" \"I'll get my cat and coat. Merrie, get your teddy bear. Jord, bring your gliss game. We're leaving.\" No one paid much attention to one more news crew giving up on a locked house. The news vehicle stopped a few blocks away and two children and a woman carrying a cat climbed into a grav car with a lovely redhead driving it. The scene was repeated again and again, twice with dogs and once more with a cat and with various numbers of various-age children. One man struggled not to weep as he hustled four children into a van and left the home his wife's 'inheritance' had bought nine years before. Merith drove a closed vehicle onto the ship's cargo lift and drove it out again moments later. Ellith had a large number of houseguests overnight, then kissed Pon good luck and watched two chartered transports take his staff, chosen students and him to the spaceport for a chartered flight to a competition on a nearby world. Merith collected her winnings, then met Pon's brother-in-law and he gave her his. Lane had explained Harvelle had been the perfect place for the ring's base because there were no income taxes due to the vast mineral wealth. The incident that made it as accessible as it was on Earth wasn't the same, but the result was and the government collected money on every gram exported. It was also why gaming taxes were low. She cheerfully paid the two percent of the gross. She deposited the rest in numbered accounts and purchased real estate on another world by comm. The show was broken down and the ship loaded. Merith realized Frake would have to hire several people to replace the three who were leaving. She brushed tears from her eyes and went back to work. There were furnishings to order and clothes to provide. Kitchens must also be stocked. \"Merith, we're on our way. We'll have everything ready for them when they get there. We'll see you at your destination.\" \"All right, Lane. Lane... \" \"Yes? Come on, Merith, you know how it works. You have to ask before I can have the memory. You ask.\" \"If I tell Frake I'm in love with him, what would he... Would he... Oh, dear.\" \"Save me a dance at your reception. I love dancing with ladies in white.\" He smiled, pulled a white rose from the air and handed it to her. She stared at it in surprise. It was cool and moist with dew. She inhaled the fragrance of the first rose she'd ever held that hadn't been replicated. She laughed in delight as Lane waved and walked away. She took a deep breath and hunted for Frake. She had something to tell him. Lane was smiling when he walked into Melissa. \"All right, that's taken care of. Now, on to our next destination. We're about to become deliverymen. Dutch, here's the list of merchants and items. Set schedules for pickup. You met them all, figure out what should go where and to whom. We need to insert computer records for all the kids in schools so they can be transferred to their new ones. I'll pull their real ones and change the identities. We'll need to do marriage, divorce, etceteras, for every one of them. Clete, you take care of birth and medical records. Here's the list of people and their new identities. Let's get to work.\" \"Lane, why are you so happy? You're just bubbling.\" \"Well, Clete, when we get this chore finished, we're going to a wedding. The bride has just promised me a dance at the reception. You guys will get one too, but you'll enjoy dancing with the bridesmaids more.\" \"Frake and Merith!\" \"You got it. Jerona, Keli and Kera are going to be bridesmaids. Guess who the groomsmen are.\" \"All right! I like being in weddings.\" The sudden wistful look on Clete's face made Dutch wish he hadn't said it. \"It's all right, Dutch. I like being in weddings, too.\" \"Clete, it'll be a little rough in places. Tell Jerona why. She's a good friend. She'll be willing to help.\" \"She always does.\" Clete smiled a slow warm smile. It went with a very nice memory. \"Damn, Lane. He's doing it again!\" \"I noticed. Let's get to work, Dutch.\" \"I hate trying to think when my teeth are rattling!\" A woman was still very nervous when she walked into her new house. The pain of finding out what her husband was hadn't really eased. She stopped and stared around in amazement. It was beautiful. She wandered from room to beautifully furnished room, carrying her cat and dragging her coat unnoticed behind her. She heard her daughter squeal, dropped cat and coat and ran. \"Look, Mommy, toys and dolls and my closet's full. Jord's too. Is yours full too, Mommy?\" She went to check. It was. She found a large packet on her dresser. It contained complete documents for all of them, including school enrollment for Merrie and Jord. Their first names were the same, but the last had been changed. The message light was blinking on the comm unit. It was from the bank and it thanked her for choosing them for her accounts. She pulled up the records and started to laugh. There was an amazing amount all set up as interest-bearing trusts. She would have a comfortable regular income and the children's education was provided for. She began to put the documents away and found a short handwritten note. \"The name on the decree is fictitious, but the divorce is real. Forget the past. Enjoy your new life. P.S. I set the coffeepot to turn on when you answered the comm unit.\" She went to the kitchen and poured herself a cup of coffee. The house didn't have a food synthesizer, but she'd never really liked them. She opened cabinets and found them stocked. She sat down at the table and giggled. Frake had told her not to worry, she had the best guardian angels in the business. He'd been absolutely right. She wondered if one of them was called Dutch. The scene was repeated in eight homes that day. Most homes had synthesizers. Those that didn't were for ladies and the man who preferred to cook. Reporters searched passenger lists for days. The families of the eight men and one woman had just disappeared, including dogs and cats. Frake and Merith didn't wait long. It was a good time for all their real friends to attend, but it was less wait for the Gallants. None of them wanted to wait thirty-two days to go to the wedding. \"Congratulations, Frake, you're a very lucky man.\" \"I know it. Lane, I don't think I'd have ever gotten up the nerve, but she just walked up and said she loved me and what was I going to do about it. I asked her to marry me. Surprised myself. Didn't surprise her though. She handed me a guest list.\" \"Thanks for asking me to be best man. It meant a lot. Barnard and Jeannie looked pleased too.\" \"Well, Merith doesn't have any family. She likes Barnard and decided to ask him to give her away. Jeannie was natural for flower girl. Old Earth traditional all the way. It was those costumes you guys wore. I'm glad Pon and Ellith could come. I've got a lot of old friends here, but Merith... Well, she needed some on her side of the aisle.\" \"Frake, I'm going to dance with your wife. I'm going to give her a kiss too. It's the one time I know my fiancé wouldn't mind.\" \"That's true. I wish Sabbi and Rose could've come. Merith asked them.\" \"Work and school. They just couldn't get away.\" \"Lane, you could've... you know, got them.\" \"No. My life with Sabbi is going to be wonderful. I don't need to make any changes in it. I am looking forward to the next time I see her though. I dream about it.\" \"Special reason?\" \"Yes. Her mother won't be around.\" Frake laughed and Lane went to dance with his wife and give her a kiss. Pon joined him at the punch bowl a short time later. \"It will be a warm night.\" \"Yeah, Clete and Dutch are going to bring Jerona, Keli and Kera home for a late supper. And breakfast.\" \"I'm sorry, my friend, Ellith has decided it will be a warm night too. You'll have to swim alone.\" Lane laughed and clapped him on the back. Clete watched Lane sit down for dinner in Melissa. Dutch grinned widely. They all felt good, but Lane was flying. \"All right, tell us.\" \"Tell you what, Clete?\" \"You know. What's up. Why you're three feet off the ground and humming under your breath. Come on, Lane, tell us.\" \"I'm going to see Sabbi. There's a dance at her university and we're going to it. We're going to make it official. I've just been thinking about it.\" \"There's more.\" \"Yes! Yes, there is. Her mother won't be there! I'm going to whisk her away and spend some time with her. I've been enjoying thinking about you two taking your turn.\" \"Our turn at what?\" \"Doing countless laps in the pool!\" Clete and Dutch burst into laughter. It really was their turn. Lane got more excited as the time drew near. One night Clete hauled him out of bed, carried him, protesting, from his room and dumped him in the pool. Lane sputtered and laughed. Clete shook his head, grinned and went back to bed. Maybe his room wouldn't be quite so warm. Three days later, Lane's memory finally agreed it was time. Clete and Dutch both walked in to his room grinning widely. They'd both felt his sudden surge of excitement and knew exactly what it meant. \"So, how do we dress? Is this formal, informal, a beach party, what?\" \"Homecoming. Called The Queen's Ball.\" \"White tuxes?\" \"Not this time, Dutch. You and Clete wear black tuxes. I'm the only one who wears white.\" \"Oh, ho, you want to outshine us.\" \"I most certainly do.\" \"Going to tell us why?\" \"No, you'll see. You won't be bored or go unnoticed. You'll get all the attention you need. I just want more.\" \"All right, Lane. Clete, black tuxes.\" \"Done.\" Lane smiled, told Melissa to execute the flight plan and began getting ready. Dutch and Clete would wear black tuxes with red satin cummerbunds, ties and roses. He would wear all white including an opera cape. He planned on putting on quite a show. Sabbi would love it. She was a true romantic and so was he. He made his preparations and smiled. Clete hadn't caught on to the purpose of all the equations he'd given him to work on while he lifted weights. He'd just been happy to have some new ones to \"play with,\" while the barbell went up and down. The girl checking tickets at the door didn't ask them if they had them. Dutch handed her a rose and asked her for a dance later. The plain little girl became a beautiful woman in an instant. He was sure she was and she really couldn't doubt it. Lane smiled at Clete's wide grin when love for them both rose in a warm wave in him, then suddenly became a thought of Sabbi and a great deal warmer. They stepped through the doors and Dutch grinned, too. They followed two paces behind Lane as he walked across the dance floor. People stopped to watch and an aisle cleared. Sabbi looked up and saw him. Her face lit with delight. She waited. The gleam in his eye and his smile told her he was up to something. He made a full formal bow and produced a bouquet of white roses from the air. He dropped on one knee before her. His deep rich voice carried through the room. \"I, Sir Apollo Avelaine Gallant, ask for your hand in marriage.\" \"Yes.\" He pulled a ring set with a huge diamond from the air and placed it on her finger. She began to sing her song and he lifted her to her feet. He joined her in duet and they danced. When they finished the song, he kissed her and flower petals drifted down around them. The room erupted in applause. Clete and Dutch grinned. Lane had figured out the flower petal trick and used it to good effect. He'd been spectacular. The prince had crashed the homecoming and walked off with the queen. Clete and Dutch bowed to them and moved toward the refreshment table. Dutch filled two cups and carried them to the girl at the table in the hall. Clete felt the slightly awkward determination of a group of young women who had no special companion for the most romantic event of the year, but weren't about to miss it. He walked into the midst of them. \"Hi. I'm Clete. Can I be your date? I hate being at things like this alone.\" He pulled rose after rose from the air and handed one to each. A chubby young woman with a delightful smile suddenly laughed. \"Absolutely, and I think you're big enough to actually go around.\" \"Oh, I do my best. Would you like to dance?\" Dutch found the shy girls in the hall, the ones who had built the floats and decorated the room. The ones who had worked long and hard, then dressed up and peeked through the door at other people enjoying the fruits of their labors. He sat on the ticket table, gave out roses and gently teased. Before long, he shooed them through the doors ahead of him, found a table and seated each and every one. He bowed and led the little ticket girl onto the floor. Boys next. They'd be harder, but a bit less shy to start. There would also be fewer. For some reason, a pair of very shy girls were likely to talk each other into things and a pair of very shy boys were likely to talk each other out of them. The three women and two men faculty members and the group of alumnus smiled. They had no idea who the big men who had 'crashed the gate' were, but they were very welcome. They had made the night magical and brought the outsiders in. And in the center of the floor, the queen danced with her prince. The last song was announced and couples moved onto the floor to hold each other and move to the slow song. On the last chord, the man in white flipped several things into the air in quick succession. There were sudden flashes of light all over the room and something began to drift down. A botany professor picked one up and gasped in amazement. \"It's real! The rose petals are real! They're not replicated! They're real!\" All over the room, young university students caught drifting petals and tucked them away, memories of a magical, romantic, night. \"Time for supper. Tell me, ladies, where would you like to continue this evening?\" \"Clete, you can't be serious.\" \"Teri, I think you ladies have enjoyed my company. I know I've enjoyed yours. Whyever would you be surprised I want to take you to supper? Choose some place nice. I want to show you off. The boys and I feel quite smug having you all to ourselves. Don't we, Cliff?\" \"Yes. How about Tres Jacque?\" \"Ah, a suggestion. Sounds like a good one. Now, transport?\" \"We can walk. It's about six blocks and I'd love to be seen with a whole bunch of pretty girls.\" \"Ladies, would you walk six blocks on a warm autumn evening so Cliff, Darrell and I can show off?\" \"We'll get our coats.\" \"Teri, please allow us to use it as a way to say we're pleased to be with you. A bunch more people in line getting coats one at a time is silly and it's a nice opportunity.\" They collected the checks and walked to the coat room. \"Clete, you're an absolute master. I'm having a great time learning from you.\" \"No, Cliff. See that man over there? That's my brother Dutch. I always thought he was a master. Tonight, I learned the true master is my brother Lane.\" \"The one who asked Sabbi to marry him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"I see what you mean.\" \"Ah, you really are learning.\" \"Clete?\" \"Yes, Darrell?\" \"Um, well, Tres Jacque is... well... \" \"Don't worry. We'll cover it. It seems someone recently decided he owed me some back pay.\" \"Who? Oops, sorry. I didn't mean to pry.\" \"Then you won't mind if I don't tell you. It's rather embarrassing to be paid to escort the most beautiful women on a planet across a stage.\" \"Hi, Clete. Where are we taking the ladies?\" \"Cliff suggests Tres Jacque, Dutch.\" \"Excellent. Thanks, Cliff. I couldn't get a name from anyone. Just 'anyplace' and 'you choose.' I take it we're within strolling distance.\" \"Yes. Dutch, make sure you reassure student budgets.\" \"True. We were pretty spoiled at the academy, in the Federation in general. I may never get used to the idea of needing to carry money. I'll comm ahead. Get us the center of the room. Lane and Sabbi?\" \"Yes, definitely. Check. He may have already made the reservations.\" \"You're right. I'll bet he did. Weeks ago. Hang on, Kip. I'll take some of those. Ah, Lane. Reservations Tres Jacque?\" \"Weeks ago. Hi, Clete, Cliff, Darrell. You lost a coat check. Teri's. Middle of the dance floor.\" \"Got it. Here, guys, be right back.\" \"How'd you know?\" \"What?\" \"About the coat check and our names.\" \"Easy, Cliff. Sabbi told me your names and Clete tells me about the coat check.\" \"Teri's coat check. In the middle of the dance floor.\" \"See?\" \"Lane, not fair. You're making them nervous.\" \"You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just showing off. Like the lights and flower petals. I asked the girl of my dreams to marry me and she said yes. I'm feeling pretty smug.\" \"There's a lot of that going around. I came all alone tonight and I'm leaving with at least a girl on each arm. I'm feeling pretty good.\" \"Cliff, I like you. Ah. No, this won't do. Too drab for tonight. She needs something special.\" \"Lane, what are you going to do?\" \"Just watch, Clete.\" \"Hand her the tickets, guys. This we want to see. Dutch!\" Dutch turned from aiding young ladies with coats and Clete nodded toward Lane. They watched as he reached her, looked at her, looked at the coat, back at her and shook his head. He tossed the coat in the air. There was a flash of light and a full-length, snowy-white satin cape dropped onto his arm. When he lifted it to drape around her shoulders, the way the light glinted from it identified it as Carenna Satin. She laughed and kissed him. Clete laughed when Cliff said he thought he'd keep learning from him because he was too awed to ask Lane questions. When he turned, the two girls from the coat room were standing behind him, still holding the tickets. \"Lane! Two more for supper!\" \"Done!\" \"Do you mean... us?\" \"I most certainly do. You're almost done here. You've worked hard all evening to help make this night special and raise funds for your organization. You definitely deserve supper.\" \"Yes! I mean thanks. Come on, Jen. Let's get these coats.\" They were nearly the last to leave. Lane and Sabbi led the way. They were followed by a large group of happy girls carrying roses. Amidst the girls were five near ecstatic boys, Dutch and Clete. Tres Jacque was awaiting them. The maitre d' bowed to them. \"The queen's party has arrived!\" Suddenly every waiter and busperson was aiding with coats. The maitre d' led them to the center of the restaurant and bowed deeply. Lane removed Sabbi's cape and handed it to him. He pulled a chair out for her and every other girl found herself with a chair held for her. They were all seated and handed menus. Everyone but the maitre d' vanished. \"May I suggest?\" \"That would be most kind.\" Sabbi was having a wonderful time. She knew Lane had set everything up. The kitchen would even know what to prepare. She listened in near rapture to the delights Lane had chosen as the maitre d' named them. Mouths dropped open around the table when she nodded. \"Yes, I think that would be suitable, but do see if anyone prefers something lighter.\" \"Ladies, gentlemen, do you prefer something other?\" Dutch grinned at Clete and folded his menu. Lane was flying and neither of them was firmly on the ground. \"No, I believe the queen has spoken for us all. Thank you, Milady.\" \"Very well. It will be but a few moments.\" As soon as he'd left, Sabbi burst into giggles. \"Oh, Lane, what a meal. They don't even serve half the things he named.\" \"They do tonight. Well, at least at this table.\" \"That's another thing. A table for twenty-seven?\" \"I had them build it. The U shape was the most efficient use of space. Kept us all close enough to chat.\" The feast started arriving in minutes. It was wonderful. The chef came out and thanked them for allowing her to prepare such a wonderful menu. Sabbi said they thanked her for preparing it superbly. When the evening ended, each coat was held for the right person. No bill was presented. Cliff worried privately to Clete about it. He reassured him everything, including very generous tips, had been arranged. Cliff nodded. \"A master.\" \"Lane, we're going to see the ladies home. We'll see you shortly.\" \"I doubt that, Clete. Have a nice swim.\" Dutch and Clete both burst into laughter. When asked what they were laughing about, they just shook their heads and grinned. They escorted the girls to dorms and co-op houses and said goodnight to the boys. Clete and Dutch looked at each other and laughed. They ran back to Melissa. They were going for a swim. It was a very long one, but Clete was very happily fixing breakfast when Sabbi walked into the kitchen rather early the next morning. \"Hi. Mmm, smells good.\" \"Good morning, Sabbi. Breakfast in about five. Coffee's ready.\" \"Why do you cook?\" \"What?\" \"I mean, you have a food synthesizer, but you don't use it much. You prepare most of your own meals. Why?\" \"Well, I suppose because we enjoy doing it. We use the synth if we're in a hurry. Or if Dutch cooks. Most of the things we cook come from it. Maybe it just seems too easy.\" \"I think part of it is you're olfactory oriented.\" \"What?\" \"The smell of cooking food makes you hungrier, more appreciative. Makes a home more homey. Do you remember the smells of your boyhood?\" \"Oh, yes. Prairie grasses on a hot summer day, spring rain, a wood fire, my mother's skin when she gave me a hug.\" \"Lane's the same way. Real roses, because replicated ones don't smell fresh. Tells me every ocean smells different. Recognizes places by smell. Dutch too?\" \"Dutch too what?\" \"Oh, hi, Dutch. Recognize places by their smell.\" \"Maybe not smell so much as a... gestalt of things. Light, sound, the feel of the air, the smell and taste. I guess smell plays a very big part in it. Why?\" \"It all started when she asked me why we cooked instead of using the synth.\" \"Sabbi, I think you've hit something. I grew up in space. Starships and space stations. Clete and Lane didn't. I suppose I notice all the things I mentioned because my environment was so controlled. I collect clothes made of real materials when we go into the past because I like the way they feel on my skin. And, as for the cooking, a synthesizer doesn't make my mouth water the way Clete and Lane's cooking does. That looks great, Clete.\" \"Simple and fast, but sometimes bacon and eggs are just perfect. Enjoy. Where's Lane, Sabbi?\" \"I'm not quite sure. He handed me this dressing gown, gave me a kiss, and said to tell you he'd be here before his eggs got cold.\" \"I am. Ah, breakfast. I was looking for where we're going. Comparing star charts with my memories.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"Tenepeth, Dutch. It's a beautiful place. Rich and green. Warm seas and beautiful beaches. Yellow sun and three moons. Earth-like without all the people.\" \"Just how many people is it without?\" \"Don't worry. I'm not taking us anywhere totally uninhabited. You'll find playmates. Clete, this world will be very interesting for you. The people are empathic. Makes it a very peaceful place.\" \"I hate to mention this, Lane, but I have to get back to the university. I have classes tomorrow.\" \"Sabbi, this is a timeship. You could be gone years and make your next class. We're only going for three days. You won't forget your subjects. We're going to Tenepeth for a reason. About ten years before we'll arrive, a disease devastated the planet. Children under the age of about five weren't hit very hard. A mild fever and a quick recovery. Older kids had it quite a bit worse. About sixty percent of them died. The adults were decimated. I want you to see how they cared for all those children. Hundreds of them to four or five adults and thirty or so older kids.\" \"Oh, Lane, it's perfect! Yes, take me there.\" \"We're on our way. We'll be very welcome, especially Clete.\" \"Why me?\" \"They're trying to rebuild their population. Ten months after we leave, the birth rate doubles.\" \"Wait a minute! I'm not responsible for that!\" \"Not directly. Your presence just warms things up a bit. Look at it this way, at least you won't look like a prune from spending three days in the swimming pool.\" Sabbi suddenly realized what he meant and blushed. \"I didn't think about... I forgot... I just--\" \"Sabbi, we don't think about it either. Lane's spent a lot of time in that pool. Lots more than three days. Dutch and I are very happy for you two. Love is a wonderful thing to be near. You're family. You've become a piece of what makes us what we are. A part of the love.\" \"Clete's right. You belong with Lane. We both feel it. I'd be absolutely ecstatic about it if it weren't for one thing. Clete's so damn happy about it my teeth are rattling!\" \"Rattling? Oh, that's right. You've said that before.\" \"Happens every time things get really nice. We're not even sure exactly what it is he's doing. He doesn't seem to be able to control it. It bothers Dutch more than it does me. I find it a mild distraction, but it drives Dutch crazy.\" \"It's like... Have you ever rested your head against a cat when it's purring?\" \"Hmm, yes, but it didn't rattle my teeth, Dutch.\" \"Imagine what it would have been like if the cat was Clete's size.\" \"Oh, my.\" \"Yes, oh my. You're extremely welcome here, Sabbi. The proof is in my head. I'd be walking on air if Clete would just stop purring!\" \"Dutch, I'd stop if I could. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens.\" Sabbi looked at the three of them. Dutch looked disgusted. Clete looked chagrined. Lane was wearing a wide grin. She burst into laughter. They were family and she was part of it. She wondered if she was purring too. Lane suggested they give her a martial arts lesson. She had been working quite hard and it showed. Clete was delighted with the progress she'd made. One day she'd be very good. Lane told them they'd be landing shortly after lunch and he and Sabbi would prepare it. Sabbi decided she liked to cook, but wasn't fond of doing dishes. \"We've landed. Come on, Sabbi. Let's go look around. This is one of the havens the people built for the children. It's still in use, but most of the kids are in their teens. Don't be surprised by young-looking pregnant girls. They're watched over carefully. There's a real gap between generations. A lot of young teenagers, but very few kids between two and nine. Remember, there are a hundred empty cities out there and every child is needed.\" \"All right, Lane. I'll remember. Oh! It's beautiful!\" The sun seemed to shine softly on low, tree-shaded, buildings of a soft tan color. Bright-colored playground equipment dotted large grassy lawns. There were clusters of buildings scattered across a huge area. Each cluster enclosed a play area for very small children. Lane led her to a cluster where happy toddlers played. They introduced themselves to two girls, who looked about fifteen, who were watching the children and one of them called for someone to show them their home. Each building was designed to house about a dozen young children and one or two young adults. Rooms were large and comfortable. Bedrooms were shared by two or three children of the same sex, but not quite the same age. Oldest being furthest from the adults, youngest closest. There were playrooms and study rooms, dining rooms and kitchens. Three small rooms puzzled Sabbi until she learned they were included so there were places children could go to be alone. One room was called the \"thinking room.\" It was furnished simply and had nice windows, but no toys or other forms of entertainment. She learned it was where children were taken when they had badly misbehaved. It was a place to think things over. One young boy was sitting by a window and looking out. The girl guiding their tour asked him if he'd thought about why he was there. When he told her he had, she gave him a hug and sent him out to play. Sabbi was impressed with the affection that was obvious. Each building was a real home, warm and nurturing. \"Lane, I want to do this. Even on my very-civilized world, there are people who have children and really don't want them. They think they do, but find out later they didn't. I want to make a place they're wanted.\" \"You will, Sabbi. We'll help. I'll help. Clete will be a wonder with the kids and Dutch will be everyone's favorite uncle. You'll find others who have enough love to give it to lots of children. You're going to be Mom to dozens of wonderful people and I'm going to love being called 'Daddy.' Come on, let's find a place by ourselves. I want to tell you a story about a very special child and how he came to be. We need to get a ways away from Clete. This is the best place to tell you. The people here will help him deal with your sadness.\" \"Lane, he is sad, isn't he? Somewhere inside he's been terribly hurt. He has too much depth not to have known great pain.\" \"Sabbi, you will always amaze me. You care so deeply about others. Clete's caring is easy for me to understand. He feels other's feelings. Yours is a wonder to me and always will be. You work to know how others feel. Your love is boundless. I'm going to bask in it and wonder at it all our lives together.\" \"Hi, you headed for the beach?\" \"No, Dutch, a walk through the forest. Find Clete. Find some people for him to be around. I'm going to tell Sabbi about Helen.\" \"Give me a few minutes to find him and meet some people. I saw a group of young women sitting on the beach. I'll take him there, then make myself scarce.\" \"Find yourself some company too, Dutch. Clete's pretty attuned to Sabbi right now. It'll hit you hard too.\" \"Yeah. Later.\" \"Why is Clete attuned to me?\" \"Catnip \" \"What!?\" \"Having you around makes us all happy. Your presence makes him purr.\" \"Because of you.\" \"Some, but a lot of it's you. You radiate warmth and caring. It delights him. I'm going to tell you how much.\" Dutch 'tracked' Clete and moved fast. He wanted to find him before he started hunting for them to find out what was wrong. \"Come on, Clete.\" \"Where to, Dutch?\" \"Down the beach a ways. You're about to make some friends. Lane sent me.\" \"Oh. All right.\" \"I'm going to take you where you're going and take off. I have some friends of my own to make.\" \"This is all rather mysterious.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"Dutch, you're hurting.\" \"Yeah. A bit. I'm going to find somebody to help make it go away. You've stopped purring. First time I was ever sorry my teeth weren't rattling. There are your friends. Later.\" \"Hello, I'm Talla. What has you puzzled and worried?\" \"My brother. He just led me here and said make friends. He's hurting and didn't tell me why. My other brother is sad too. NO! Not... Oh, Lane, I'm not ready.\" \"Peli! Tiva! Help me! Oh, such pain! Such sadness. His loss is too great. Help me comfort him.\" They cradled him and cried with him. They shared the story that had pained Sabbi so deeply. They held Clete as Lane held Sabbi, helping ease the pain by sharing it. Dutch hadn't been so lucky. Two girls found him curled on the ground crying. \"Please, let us help you.\" \"It'll pass. I'll be all right. I'm sorry. I know I'm hurting you.\" \"Yes, you are hurting us. Stop being foolish and let us help us all feel better. Lethe, what shall we do with him?\" \"Make him forget about it, Dida. We know how.\" \"Yes. Oh! I've shocked him. That wasn't what I had in mind at all.\" \"You're children!\" \"No. Not on this world. We know the way it was. It must be different now. Come on, Lethe. He'll get over the silliness. Tell us your name.\" \"Dutch. Stop! You don't know what you're doing!\" \"Oh, Dutch! We know exactly what we're doing. Lethe, he's beautiful.\" \"All right, I believe you! You know what you're doing. Now, stop it!\" \"Dida, kiss him, then he'll stop shouting. Oh! That's better. His mind is still protesting, but his body is most definitely not.\" Dutch surrendered. He didn't really have a choice in the matter. The two empaths felt his response to every touch, each caress. He moaned as Lane's passion suddenly burned through the link he had with his brothers. When Clete caught fire, he was lost. Suddenly, there were more of them. Dozens of them. Touching him. Loving him. He knew when Clete loosed the tight hold he kept on his passion. The world caught fire. The moons were rising when he began to think coherently. He was surrounded by children. \"Stop that! You're embarrassed. Just stop it! No one of us is a child. Children don't respond. You're on our world. We'll show you again we're not children.\" Dutch started to laugh. He was used to the intimacy of sharing his brothers' passion. Lane had landed him on a world where all shared that intimacy. He was trying to impose his values in a place they just didn't work. The age of adulthood was different. There was no struggling with misunderstood feelings. No fears of being different or unliked. No loneliness. No frightening adolescence. It was still a struggle not think of those around him as children, but his reason told him they were adults. There didn't seem to be any nudity taboos either. \"Ooh, your skin is so white in the moonslight. And so soft. Especially, here... and here. You're shocked again. You're just going to have to get over that. I'm Teli and I just won't stand for it. I'm going to stop it right now.\" \"Teli! Leave him alone. There are lots of silly taboos where he comes from and you're breaking dozens of them. You're being mean! This is more than cultural. He just doesn't want you. He's totally hetero. You aren't going to change it.\" \"You're right, Dida. I'm sorry, Dutch. I wasn't paying attention to what you were really feeling. You're just so beautiful, I got carried away. I hope we can be friends. All right! I'm forgiven. Too bad though, I'd really--\" \"Teli!\" \"Yeah, yeah. Behave myself. I'm going for a swim. Anybody else?\" \"We'll all go. Come on, Dutch. Teli will be good. I promise. If not, I'll get mad.\" \"Oh, I'll be good. The last time Dida got mad at me, my head rang for a fiveday. I felt singed for twenty. Half my friends wouldn't talk to me. When Dida gets mad, everbody gets singed.\" \"I've got a brother like that.\" \"We noticed your brother. Everyone on the planet noticed your brother. We're still noticing him. What is he doing? My teeth feel... \" \"Like they're rattling. Yeah, I know. Do you know what a cat is, Dida? Do you have an animal... How do I explain it? It's just Clete. He's content. He's purring. It drives me crazy!\" They laughed and pulled him toward the sea. He looked around for things, but couldn't find them. He gave it up as hopeless. When on Tenepeth... He hadn't been skinny-dipping in a warm sea in a long time. \"Hello, Dutch. Nice night.\" \"It would be if you'd stop rattling my teeth!\" \"I can't help it. You know I can't.\" \"This is obviously your brother, Clete.\" \"Yes. Clete, this is Dida. You're making her teeth rattle too.\" \"Oh, sorry. I really wish I knew how to stop it. It... just happens.\" \"Don't worry about it. Oh, my. You're huge. Everywhere.\" \"Uh, Dutch, they're kids.\" \"No, Clete, they're not. Believe me. They're just small adults. I've gotten a very long lecture about it. And a rather effective demonstra-- CLETE!\" \"Dutch, she's making me warm. Very warm.\" \"Hi. I'm Lethe. That's just Dida. She makes everybody warm, but not as warm as you do. You are the most magnificent male I have ever seen. Go away Teli. This one's the same.\" \"Not fair!\" \"Dutch, I'm going to have real problems in this place. How long did... Lane say we're... staying?\" \"About two more days.\" Clete groaned and Dutch laughed. They had a too-good time for the two days, but they learned a great deal too. Dutch 'won' his battle with himself to accept what he knew was the truth of the culture, but Clete knew he was still working on it a bit when Lane was saying farewell to Sabbi. \"I suppose I didn't really get over it til I found out Dida was a mother, Dutch. It helped when I met Carva.\" \"Nothing like having a seventy-year-old patriarch treat them as adults to make it easier to accept them as such. Clete, we've got to ask Lane some things.\" \"Like what, Dutch?\" \"Tiva didn't seem to have any doubts about you and I fathering children on her world. The gestation period is about right and the physiology is similar.\" \"Well, two hearts is a start. Helen got help. Decided before I married her. Just made up her mind and got medical assistance.\" \"Like my mom. 'I want a baby. You're going to be the father.' Clete, I want to know. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I've never even thought about it before. And they're so young.\" \"Do you know how old Dida was?\" \"Not old enough.\" \"You're wrong. They're a small people. You got a lecture because she thought you needed it. She made me promise not to tell you til we left.\" \"Tell me what?\" \"Dutch, Dida has three children. The oldest is four. She's twenty-three. Not one of those kids was under eighteen. They mature fairly slowly. Puberty hits between seventeen and eighteen. Tiva's in her thirties.\" Dutch started to laugh. She'd told him children didn't respond. He hadn't asked her at what age they stopped being children. She'd told him her world was different and he'd forced himself to accept it, but he hadn't really understood it. He'd still thought of them as being the same. No wonder she'd been surprised at his shock. He hadn't explained he came from a place where puberty began at twelve or thirteen, in many people. Some even younger. He realized communication was more than just being able to speak and understand the language. \"Hi. That was really hard to do. I don't suppose saying... I can't even say the word. I couldn't even say farewell. I ended up with, 'See you soon.' It'll never get easier, but I will see her again fairly soon. Now ask me.\" \"Lane, will any of those women on Tenepeth bear our children?\" \"I don't know.\" \"TERRIFIC!\" \"Easy, Dutch. I don't. They don't really know either. Paternity isn't really important to them. Every child is loved and needed. If a male and female pairbond, they take her children and seven or eight more and set up a household. Your friend Teli was pairbonded. He just saw you as a very attractive, non-threatening, diversion. He wasn't interested in the women. He has a heterosexual mate. They'll probably find another male to bond with eventually, since he seems to be so inclined.\" \"But he was on the beach with us.\" \"So was she. I doubt you were exactly aware of what was going on around you. Why do you think Sabbi and I were left alone?\" \"Because you were pairbonded.\" \"Exactly. You and Clete weren't. Teli is nearly as old as we are. Pairbonding doesn't usually take place until the mid twenties. Sometimes never.\" \"That explains what Dida said about you, Dutch.\" \"What did she say?\" \"You stirred her too much. She stayed away from you because you would not be ready when she was. You might never be. I was safer. I had been mated.\" \"Tenepethans bond for life, Dutch. If one of them dies, they never bond again. That's why Carva didn't have a mate. Once in a while a bond forms one way. It's a sad thing. One loving the other and knowing that one does not love in return. Only responsive to one person and that person wanting more. It's less common than a three-way bond. Dida was falling in love with you, so she turned to Clete to stop the process. I hope it worked.\" \"Lane, don't you ever get me into something like that again! There's a woman I may have injured and children who may be mine. And I won't ever know. Don't let it happen again!\" \"Dutch, it had to be. You had to grow up sometime. You're a heartbreaker. Women have fallen in love with you before. You never even noticed. Just kissed them goodby and went on your merry way. Now maybe you'll think about it before you turn on the charm and fill some poor girl with dreams she learns, the hard way, won't come true. Humans don't usually bond for life. If a heart breaks, it mends and loves again. Usually. And you're too different biologically to father children unless a woman seeks help. You don't catch or carry diseases. Tenepeth was for you. Clete was something that helped them, but you were the reason we were there. I could have taken Sabbi to other places that were good examples. I won't do it again. I won't have to. You'll accept responsibility for your actions. Oh, sometimes women will fall in love with you and you'll hurt them. It happens to Dad. But you'll never just blithely ignore their feelings again.\" \"I do, don't I? Assume they're into having a good time just like I am and never look deeper.\" \"Dutch, most of them are. You just have to notice when it gets beyond that point. Ask Clete why Riss just suddenly disappeared. He knows. Even in the midst of his falling in love, he felt her pain when she said, 'Well, Dutch, it's been fun,' and walked off. I saw it too.\" \"And I didn't. Damn. I feel like a complete heel.\" \"You aren't or you wouldn't feel like one. You'll always love women, and they'll always love you. Don't stop charming them and loving them. Just be aware if you're hurting them and be gentle.\" \"Thanks, Lane. I learned a lot of lessons on Tenepeth. I want to go back there someday. But not until Dida's bonded.\" \"Did you have to do that? Oh!\" \"Do what? What did I do?\" \"Decide to go back. Lord, what a mess. Well, it's not that bad. The answer is you think so. Some of the kids are pretty big, but you don't ask Clete to check. In their culture, it's just not important and it's a very healthy one for kids.\" \"Yes, Lane, I got that part of the lesson too.\" \"I was sure you had. Let's go fishing. I'm in the mood for Rocky Mountain trout and the smell of pines.\" \"Good idea. Let's go. Clete, get your hip boots on. Fresh fish tonight.\" The last evening of the fishing trip, Clete suddenly looked up from cleaning up after dinner. \"Dutch, you're tense. What's wrong?\" \"I don't know. I feel watched. Icy breath on the back of my neck. A feeling of... being plotted against. Evil intent. Directed at us, Clete. Lane, do you see anything? Any changes?\" \"No. Fishing trip is over. We're headed for the future to explore. We find interesting people and places. We head back and I take Sabbi to the winter formal. Nothing new. Including this conversation. It... isn't there.\" \"Let's finish cleaning our cooking area and get going. This forest just doesn't feel as friendly as it did.\" \"Done. I'll load the fishing gear. You put the fire out. Lane, lay in the coordinates. I'm ready to get out of here too. Dutch? Dutch?\" \"Like laughter. Cold and mocking.\" \"Lane, get the fire. I'm going to get him in.\" \"Got it. Out. Place looks good. Damn. Here, give me the gear. Clete?\" \"Yeah. I've got him. Push. He's not moving.\" \"What? Oh. We're ready. Good. Let's get out of here. Why are you two pushing me?\" \"Because you stopped moving. Inside fast. Lane and I want away. Whatever you're picking up, we don't like it either. Door closed. Better?\" \"Yeah. Still feel... wary. Lane, get us on our way.\" \"Coordinates in. We're gone.\" They sat and talked for awhile and Dutch relaxed. The fire and the feel of home lulled them. They went to bed settled and comfortable. Clete jerked awake with Lane's raging loss burning through him. Suddenly, Dutch was enraged, then shocked cold. He ran for Dutch' s room and pulled Lane off him and held him as he screamed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?! SHE'S GONE!! YOU CHANGED IT!! SHE'S GONE!!\" \"CLETE, I ALMOST KILLED HIM! HE WAS AT MY THROAT! I ALMOST KILLED HIM!\" \"SHUT UP!! Damn!\" Clete slugged Lane. He couldn't hold him. He was incoherent and wild. He dropped him and grabbed Dutch. He was collapsing in near hysteria. \"Easy. Easy. You were under attack and you weren't awake. Dutch, you weren't even fighting him.\" \"I couldn't. I almost killed him in the first instant. I was afraid to. I was afraid I'd kill him. He couldn't have known what he was doing or I'd be dead. What happened, Clete? What did he mean?\" \"Come on. Let's get to neutral ground. I'm going to drop him in the pool. If he doesn't wake up, we'll have to pull him out. I'm going to hang onto him until he's coherent. I want you to help.\" \"I can't. Clete, I nearly killed him.\" \"YOU SAID THAT BEFORE!! NOW MOVE!!\" Clete shook him. It was a very dangerous thing to do. Dutch was nearly as wild as Lane had been. He sighed in relief when the crazed look went out of his eyes and he nodded. \"Good. 'She' can only be Sabbi. Let's find out what happened.\" \"He thought I'd made a change, Clete. Made a decision that took her from him. He's still going to think that when he wakes up.\" \"Did you?\" \"No. Nothing. I've been searching my mind for something I might have done subconsciously. There's nothing there. Except... \" \"Except what?\" \"The memory of mocking laughter.\" \"Dutch, we've been attacked. Personally. And very badly injured. A healing trance won't cure this. Get in the pool. I'll drop him in and be right behind you.\" \"I don't... All right. Do it.\" Dutch grabbed Lane and shoved him against the wall. The shock of the cold water brought him to. Clete jumped in and they held him as he started to fight. \"Lane! He didn't do it! Dutch didn't do it! Dutch didn't change things! Easy. Easy. Now tell us. Tell us, Lane. Dutch didn't make a change. You said there was one. Tell us.\" \"I... I woke up with my head spinning with change. Real deep change. I couldn't do anything but lay there and wait for it to clear. When it did, she was gone. My life with Sabbi was gone. No home. No love. Gone. I guess I went a little crazy.\" \"No, you went a lot crazy. Do you remember trying to kill Dutch?\" \"I... No. Yes. I guess. I wanted him to change it back. To make him... bring her back.\" \"Lane, I didn't make any changes. None. Not even subconsciously. You've been attacked. We've been attacked. What I felt in the forest. It has to be.\" \"We've been hurt. Bad. Not just you. All of us. And it was set up well. Your long future memory came back just in time for your meeting with her. Just in time for you to see a future and have it ripped away. You nearly killed Dutch. He nearly killed you. The attack came close to completely destroying us. It nearly defeated us with one stroke. We were totally defenseless against it. We love her too. If she's gone from your life, she's gone from ours, Dutch's, mine and my son's. If one of you had killed the other, could that one have lived with it? Could I? It knocked us down, but we can get up.\" \"You're right. Oh, Clete. Your son. I only saw my pain, my emptiness. I'm sorry. Dutch--\" \"You don't even need to say it. Let's get out of here. I'm shivering and I'm not even sure I'm cold.\" \"Reaction. I'll get towels. Sorry about the punch, Lane. I couldn't think of anything else to do.\" \"It's probably the only thing you could do. A week in a healing trance should make my jaw feel normal again.\" \"Weak humor, but better. Here. Hand up. Towel. Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. I'm weak in the knees. They feel like jelly.\" \"Let's go to the kitchen. I'm ordering cocoa with something in it for us all. I'm wobbly too. Adrenaline reaction. Things went crazy in a hurry. Come on, Lane.\" Clete and Dutch each put an arm around Lane and guided him to the kitchen. Clete got them both down at the table and fixed them a hot drink. Both were shivering. He put a bit of liqueur in the cocoa and sat down with them. \"Drink. Let's talk. Something out there is out to get us. It made a change. I don't know if we can unmake it, but we can try.\" \"No, Clete. I don't think we can. It changed something and I think we're stuck with it.\" \"Why not, Lane? Why can't we change it?\" \"Because Sabbi's going to marry someone else. Elope. She's very sorry, but I was so romantic she thought she was in love with me. As soon as she met him, she realized she was wrong. Maybe that's true. Maybe she was always supposed to marry him and the real attack came when I fell in love with her. He's a nice guy. He'll make her a wonderful husband. A builder. Widower with two kids. Wants to build her dream for her. We'll see them again. Won't be long for us, but about twenty years for them. He'll build it. Clete, they offer to give your son a home.\" \"No. We'll find another way. Tell them thanks for offering.\" \"I will. Let's get this over with. I want it done. This round to the enemy. Score one zip.\" \"Wrong, Lane. We're ahead on points. This just feels worse. It was a knockdown. Almost a knockout. It's the first round we've lost and it was a hit below the belt. We fight fair. We always will. It doesn't. Doesn't know how. Wouldn't want to. That's why it's the enemy.\" \"You're right, Dutch. Definitely below the belt. At least we don't have to take turns in the swimming pool.\" Dutch and Clete laughed. Soon Lane joined in. It was weak and edged with hysteria, but it was laughter. \"Now what? What did you mean you wanted to get it over with?\" \"I'm setting the coordinates to go back to see Sabbi, Dutch. Let her tell me goodby.\" \"Lane, we could go back and get her right after we left her. Stop her from meeting him. Make a change.\" \"No, Dutch, that would be using its methods. We don't do that. You don't do that. But thanks for offering. I'll survive. Like Clete, I'll have some wonderful memories. They aren't enough, but they're what I have. I'm going to set the coordinates. Clete, would you make us another drink and bring it to the living room? I don't feel much like sleeping.\" \"Done. Go on, Dutch. Keep him company. He'll want to be alone later, but right now he needs us.\" Clete fixed more cocoa with the mint liqueur and carried it to the living room. They sat and watched the fire in silence until Lane went to dress. Clete decided he didn't want him going alone and Dutch agreed. They dressed and were waiting for him when he returned. \"I want to go to the door alone, but I'd like you with me as far as the lift to her apartment. She's moving out. You'll meet him. He'll know who you are. Clete, he hurts for me, but he loves her. You'll feel it. Let's go.\" They walked with him as far as the building lobby and waited. A fellow carrying a chair came out of the lift Lane had taken up. \"Hi, I'm Mike Renfield. Damn, this is awkward. Look, I... \" \"It's all right, Mike. We love her too. Take good care of her.\" \"She's an impossible dream come true. I really do love her. You're Clete, right? I don't know how I could have gotten so lucky. She's right. I'd have known you guys anywhere. Rose called you the three most beautiful men there are. Hair like that. She said the big strawberry blond was Clete. Lane was the one with hair like moonlight and Dutch's was of spun gold. Supposed to tell you Snow White will see you in her dreams, Dutch. I don't think she quite knows what Sabbi sees in a chubby fellow like me without enough hair to cover. Neither do I. I'm babbling. Sorry.\" \"That's all right, Mike. We understand. Let me help you with that chair.\" \"Nah, I'll get it. You wait for your brother. The chair doesn't need you.\" Dutch watched Mike struggle through the door with the chair, then turned back to the lift. They both knew Lane was coming down. \"Lane was right, Clete, a nice guy.\" \"And he does love her. Feels real... almost ashamed about hurting Lane.\" \"Yes, and he'll be with her more than I would have been. Let's go.\" \"You all right, Lane?\" \"No, Dutch, but I'll limp along. One more hurdle.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"Yeah, Mike. I know. We'll stop by in about twenty years to look at how you make her dreams come true.\" \"I'll do it, Lane. I really will. Oh, oh, here come the kids. Ice cream everywhere.\" \"Here, take my handkerchief. We'll see you when you've built her dream. Good-by.\" \"Good-by, Lane. I hope... Well, you know.\" \"Yeah. I know.\" Lane shook his hand and they walked away from where he was laughing and wiping ice cream off the faces of two pretty little girls. \"Take me to a bar. A loud, obnoxious, beer and whiskey bar. Several of them. Get me drunk and in a half dozen brawls. I promise I won't break anyone. No one will break me either. Unfortunately, that's already been done. I want a lady who's not one on each arm and one in my lap. I want to pass out sometime tomorrow and not dream. I want to wake up with such a bad hangover I can't think. Then I want to laugh at the thing that laughed at us. Dutch, I know where we're going. Adith. Pirates. Bad ones. Insane. The enemy is there. Got a strong hold on them.\" \"Sounds like it needs to be changed. Let's do it.\" \"I found a bar. A whole bunch of them. I can feel the wildness.\" \"Lead on, Clete. The three Gallant boys are going to cut loose.\" \"Done.\"",

I am not going to spend days wondering. What?\" \"Lane. He aches for her. Needs her. Wants her. Wants her so much he's like a caged animal.\" \"No. Not this time. The future is too good. I won't risk it. It's not worth chancing. I think a lot of it is this trip. Two days on this ship with nothing to do but think about her.\" \"He's going to be useless by the time we get to Harvelle, worn ragged. We're supposed to compete. We're going to be out of it.\" \"You just came up with the answer. I'll bet if we spent two full days training, we'd be ready. And it's not really a change. We're still on the ship. Still traveling with the show. We'll give Frake Melissa's call signal. Lane didn't see anything, but it will keep Frake from getting nervous.\" \"Done. Ten minutes. In the gym.\" Lane was waiting for them when they got there. Dutch almost changed his mind. He looked fevered. He was pale and shaky-looking. \"I know. You don't have to tell me. I'm in rough shape. Put me to work. I'm full of tomorrow's memories and I need them to be now.\" Clete put them to work. He worked them every waking hour of the two days. Lane dropped into bed exhausted and slept. It was what he needed. They were ready when they landed. \"Dutch, we are about to turn this world on its ear. This is the base. Where it's all coming from. A pleasant, homey, little ball of vice, crime, corruption, and upright citizen crooks. It starts with the competition we're going to enter and the gray man. He's a mad dog they set loose. We're sending him back to them. This is the one world where they don't want him. He followed us. Now, the competition's fixed. We're about to unfix it.\" \"How do they fix a martial arts competition, Lane? A fight I could see, but this is huge, competitors from everywhere.\" \"They start with referees and judges and supplement with beatings and drugs. We're going to have a lot of very good help. Wait'll you meet Master Pon and Jerona, Clete. Dutch, you'll really like the Perisks. This is team and individual. A large amount of money is wagered. The betting is legal and our bad boys use it to pay off the help.\" \"Tell them who to bet on to collect their pay.\" \"Right, Clete. The first thing we do is find Master Pon. His school is registered. We're about to be students. He's even going to teach us some things. You'll love it. Let's help get the show set up. We're going to be conspicuously present several places at once.\" They helped unload and get things to the concert hall, then slipped quietly back to the ship. It was time to travel. They found Master Pon two days before, settled into lotus position near him on the beach and waited. They greeted the rising sun and moved smoothly into the tai chi ch'uan with him. He began a series of complex katas. They followed. It was quite some time before he found one they didn't know. They knelt and watched. When he had completed it, Clete spoke for them. \"Master, we ask you teach us.\" \"Who are you that I should spend my most valuable time?\" \"We are ones who have learned the value of knowledge.\" \"Do you then think you are wise?\" \"Only in knowing wisdom must be sought.\" \"It is a beginning. I will teach you.\" \"Thank you, Master. We will seek to learn well.\" \"Good. Now, who are you guys and where did you come from? I thought I knew most of the really advanced people in the sector.\" \"We're the Gallants. I'm Clete. My brothers Lane and Dutch. We're from outside the sector. We've got wind of something real smelly in the competition coming up. We want to clear the air and we need your help.\" \"Sounds interesting. Let's go find late lunch. I'm starved.\" Master Pon was a delightful little man in his seventies. He had a quick wit and an easy laugh. They took him to Melissa for lunch. He looked around and grinned. When they told him what they planned to do, he smiled widely and officially 'enrolled' them in his school. He was the first person they'd shown Melissa who didn't say she was impossible. They went with him to meet their fellow students and Dutch just shook his head. Lane hadn't told them all Master Pon's other students were female. \"Jerona, Keli, Kera, I want you to meet someone. These are the newest students in our school; Dutch, Clete and Lane.\" \"Pon, I seldom question any decision you make, but aren't they just a bit unusual?\" \"More than you realize, Jerona. They're the best I've ever seen. Except myself, of course. They plan on taking apart a gambling fix on the competition. They also want to put a drug smuggling ring, with a sideline in forced prostitution, out of business in the process. Interested?\" \"This sounds like our kind of fun. Keli, Kera?\" \"You bet. The company's not bad to look at either. Hi, I'm Keli Perisk. The quiet one drooling over there is my sister Kera.\" \"Dutch. The drooling's mutual. I'm crazy about twins. Especially beautiful, red-haired twins. How'd you like to help me blow up a few warehouses and labs?\" \"Oh, I just love fireworks. Tell us all about it.\" \"Hmm, I'll bet I can fit three on my bike.\" Clete and Lane laughed as they watched Dutch walk off with a lady on each arm. He was in absolute heaven. He was telling them all about \"bikes.\" \"Clete, Jerona is my assistant. More than a student. A perfectionist to the core. You want to learn that kata, she can show you.\" \"All right! Lead on, Jerona. I'd follow you anywhere.\" \"You got it, big man. My, you are big. I'm taller than half the men I meet. You make me feel petite. I think I like it.\" \"Well, Lane, looks like we're left out in the cold. Of course, my wife frowns on it if I stay warm.\" \"I think your wife and my fiancé would get along. They seem to have some things in common.\" \"Shall we find a quiet place to talk and make some immediate plans?\" \"A good idea. Uh, oh. Sensei, that little girl in back needs a word.\" \"Damn. She's at it again. She just wants to learn so badly, she tries things more advanced students are doing. I'll... Well, I guess that's taken care of. He's really giving her a lecture.\" \"Don't worry. Clete gives very gentle lectures. I figured he'd see her. Probably felt her hurting herself. He's an empath.\" \"I wondered how he knew. He had his back to her. Are you all empaths?\" \"No, just Clete.\" \"And do you and Dutch have talents?\" \"I suppose you could call them that. I see the future. Dutch changes it.\" \"That must be most intriguing.\" \"It has its moments.\" Lane and Pon worked out logistics and made a list of things they'd need. Pon was delighted with the idea of it all happening during the competition and pageant. He shook his head in sadness when Lane told him the names of the people they were after. They were known and respected. They worked out the arrangements to save spouses and children from suffering shame and humiliation. Pon would add nineteen to his list of staff and students. They would travel to another world and another competition with him. Once there, they would become new people. Wagers on the competition would provide the funds for homes and upkeep. Merith had a list of eight new employees and would make the wagers. Dutch, Keli and Kera were sitting in Lissa happily constructing bombs. They would need a great many. Clete and Jerona were setting up the competition schedule. They were getting along famously. Things were running very smoothly when Clete suddenly groaned. \"Damn, Dutch! Sorry, Jerona, I can't think. I'm going to find a cold shower.\" \"What's the problem? What's happening?\" \"Dutch, Keli, and Kera are what's happening. They're also the problem.\" \"Oh, I see. Come with me.\" Jerona led Clete back to the shower room, but the water she turned on wasn't cold. Lane took a deep breath. \"Pon, I need a drink, a cold shower, and probably an anesthetic.\" \"I feel a bit warm myself. Your brothers?\" \"They have help.\" \"Yes, the ladies are helpful. Come on. Let's grab a few beers and go for a swim. We'll take the kids with us. Nothing like a cold ocean and a batch of little girls to keep things in perspective.\" \"Pon, you're a genius.\" \"Yes, but I've also been married forty-five years and been teaching women for twenty-seven. This genius is based on experience.\" \"I think we should hurry.\" \"Watch this. Salute your sensei! Time to play! Hit the beach!\" Lane watched and grinned. Every student gave formal thanks, then a mad scramble began. In two minutes, he and Pon were strolling behind forty, running, chattering, squealing girls toward the sea. Some were carrying beach chairs and sports equipment. One pair carried a coldkeep between them. By the time they caught up, two chairs, an umbrella and the keep were awaiting them. They laughed, pulled off their shirts and ran for the sea. The next day, Master Pon submitted his lists for the competition. They were stamped approved. They weren't even read. He'd never had male students. No one realized they were there. He hurried to the concert hall where his three students and his three assistants awaited in Melissa. They had a large number of beatings and druggings to prevent. Lane slid Melissa a few hours into the future and they went to work. Groups of men expecting to find one or two sleeping in a room met several awake outside the door. They broke into three teams after they had taken care of the large groups. Clete and Jerona had developed a smooth working relationship. Dutch, Keli and Kera had tremendous fun. Pon and Lane disposed of men who would have abused young people. They got a full day's rest in Melissa. Lane and Pon spent a good deal of time in the cold water of the swimming pool. They returned to the time they'd left. Dutch, Clete and Lane went to work preparing for the \"Our Special Girl\" pageant and Pon and the ladies went back to the dojo to organize students and equipment. Pon commed the masters of other schools in the competition and arranged a meeting. They would eject referees and judges who were unfair. Merith met Pon's brother-in-law and gave him funds and a list of wagers to make. Pon did not wish to know the outcome of the competition. His brother-in-law placed the bets with a very large grin on his face. He'd made a few small wagers of his own the day before. Lane recorded the tips to five honest men; three detective captains, a prosecutor and a news editor. He set the timer to send out the calls. He took Melissa to a restaurant and placed a tiny tracking device in the hem of the gray man's coat. It would lead Dutch, Clete and him to the board meeting and seal the gray man's fate. The murderer of Sabbi's father would die at the hands of his employers. She'd seen that changing that would change who she and her mother had become, without needing to be guided to it. The men on the board would be betrayed by some very unhappy, unpaid, employees, when the honest authorities found them in possession of large quantities of drugs. They'd be sure they'd been set up. They would be, but not by their bosses. Sabbi and he had agreed that would be satisfying too. He smiled as he replicated 'colors' for Pon and the ladies. They would enjoy the leathers and the wild ride. He also installed a set of pegs and built a new seat for Dutch's bike. It was a surprise. It was designed for three. Dutch would be a bit closer to the bars, but he wouldn't mind. He'd still be able to lift the front wheel off the ground. He rested in the past, then returned to the time of his departure. He had a team kata rehearsal. Pon put them to work as soon as he arrived. \"Yes, the appearance is aesthetically pleasing. Now, begin. No. Dutch, you must move a bit more slowly. You complete the moves a fraction too soon, then must pause before beginning the next. Again. Clete, control your power. The punches of all must be equal. Again.\" Pon smiled at the three big, blond men and the three big, red-haired women. They'd take the advanced mixed competition. He still felt the splitting of the competitors by sex was wrong, but Lane had explained it was part of the \"fix\" and very profitable to a pair of unpleasant men who provided bullies for the business. It was why none of his girls were targets. The presence of Clete, Dutch and Lane had placed his school in the overall points event. They had added possible points in a total of seven events. Pon expected his girls to complete a near sweep of their schedule. If the three men did as well as he knew they should, it would be the first overall his school had taken. He'd never had entries in the heavy and super-heavy classes. He longed for the 'old days' when all competitors were grouped only by levels of skill and not broken into age and weight classes. It was a technique of the sponsors and promoters, more events and more wagers. He smiled. He had entered himself in three events. It had been a long time. He expected to add the points for masters' level men to their total. The two men he hadn't been sure he wouldn't break in pieces wouldn't be competing. He'd never doubted his instincts about them, just thought testing his control for a few points that made no difference was foolish. The show people, contestants, escorts and all the students of Pon's school went to dinner together. Frake made the arrangements. A large restaurant became very busy. Lane smiled as Dutch tensed and shook his head. The gray man stood across the street and gazed at them taking seats by the window. He would be on his way to see his bosses. Dutch knew he would be going nowhere else. Ever. Dinner was a great success. Frake had a bill prepared and signed for it. It too would be covered out of Merith's wagers. It delighted him to know the money would come from the coffers of the people who had used him to smuggle drugs. He had noticed the two Lane had released from the hold and the third he had fired were on the planet. Lane had told him one of them would become a fount of information for the prosecutor. He wished he could stay to see it, but the show would move on. He knew Lane, Clete and Dutch would not be going with them. Their work would be done and they would find another who needed guardian angels. Frake and Pon became friends over dinner. The friendship would last until their deaths many years in the future. \"We have to leave. We have something to do tonight. We'll see you all tomorrow. Come on, let's set this thing in motion.\" \"With you in a minute, Lane. I just want to say goodnight to the ladies. OW! All right! I'm going. I'm going.\" Clete grinned, let go of Dutch's ear and followed him out the door, around the corner and into the alley where Lane had 'parked' Melissa. They moved her to an office and walked into the \"Boardroom\" across the hall from it. Dutch smiled at the nine very shocked people and sat on the end of the table. \"Hello, we're the Gallants. This is your notice we're shutting you down. Permanently.\" \"How did you get in here? How did you find this place?\" \"We put a tracker on your man in gray. It's in the hem of his coat. I believe I hear him coming now.\" \"YOU! You can't be here! I just saw you sitting down to dinner. You can't be... You're not natural. You're some kind of spooks.\" \"Oh, we're quite real. You're going to be sorry I didn't kill you. Goodby.\" Dutch laughed as he walked through the door and heard the gray man protesting he couldn't have been followed. He slept well that night. The news headlines the morning of the competition were about the beaten and mutilated body found floating in the bay. Lane would have liked to hear the 'board' trying to figure out how all those chains had come undone. He was rather fond of the little laser knife he carried in his pocket. It worked well on packing crates too. The tournament was interesting, especially when the senseis ejected four referees and three judges. They chose new ones from the expert aficionados in the audience. Pon's school swept through the competition. Two schools dominated most of the events for young males. They did not take any of the men's heavy or super-heavy events. They didn't take the master's either. The team kata competitions drew cheers from the crowd. When the winning men's team and the winning women's team combined and won the mixed event, they went wild. Pon accepted the overall point award for his school with a determinedly humble bow. He received a standing ovation from both the audience and fellow competitors. The day had already been wonderful and the fun was just beginning. Pon and his three assistants had box seats for the pageant. He smiled at the gasps of delight when the escorts in white produced a rose from the air for each contestant. He made a mental note to send flowers to his wife in celebration of their victory, then decided to add \"at first opportunity\" to it. Without her patience and support, it would not have been possible. Frake and Merith took the contestants out for supper. The Gallants would be busy. They started by hopping backward in time. They went from world to world and time to time. They thwarted every attempt made on shows that had come under their protection. It took them eight days. They landed outside Pon's school a few minutes after the pageant was over and Pon introduced the Gallants to his wife Ellith. She smiled in delight when Lane pulled a rose from the air and presented it to her. She mentioned Pon had sent a huge bouquet, which had been delivered moments before. Pon was very pleased he'd called and ordered them during the pageant. Jerona, Keli and Kera received roses as well. Clete pulled one, and Dutch two, from the air. They asked Ellith to put them in water. They would reclaim them in a short while. Pon told his wife he would be back in a few moments and returned with the others to Melissa to begin an evening of fun. He had smiled at his wife's tale of a crime ring's sudden fall during the evening hours. He didn't tell her he was on his way to help make it happen. She might worry. About his sanity. When they landed, Dutch found his present. \"Lane, you're terrific! It's great! Now I really can ride three.\" \"Happy whatever, Dutch. We're going to have to take them apart and put them together a lot. It clips in. Oh! I have other surprises as well. Ladies, these are your colors. Pon, this set is for you. Diamond clips for the ears and mirrored lenses for the eyes. Shall we change and terrorize a crime ring?\" They all smiled in delight as they stood before the mirrored wall Melissa made for them in the living room and looked at their reflections. They put the bikes together and roared into the day. Keli and Kera flipped to see who would sit behind Dutch first. They would take turns, changing places each time they hit another city. The seven of them roared into warehouse after warehouse and lab after lab. They left all the personnel napping outside and blew them up. They 'planted' a large quantity of drug for the police to find when they followed Lane's tips, then rode back to Melissa. They had spent seven hours in the city. They got a good night's rest and spent a pleasant day together. Lane and Pon spent some time swimming and Dutch complained about his teeth rattling at dinner. They landed, assembled the bikes, and spent the same seven hours in another city. In all, they spent sixteen days in the task, all in the same seven hours. They landed back at the school ten minutes after they'd left. They put together the evacuation plan for the innocents and began working on it. When they had everything ready, they went to the first house and Dutch slipped inside and smiled widely at the woman who was too pained to be shocked when he walked into the room. \"Hello, I'm Dutch. I'm here to get you and your children out of this mess. We've got a vehicle out back and a way for you to disappear. Bring your cat and anything you can't bear to part with, but not more than you can carry in one bag. Please, I know it's very hard to trust right now, but we will help.\" \"How did you get in? Can you really get us through all those reporters? And not for... a story?\" \"I got in because you need me. Yes, we can and no story is wanted. We've got transport offplanet and a new home and identities ready for you.\" \"I'll get my cat and coat. Merrie, get your teddy bear. Jord, bring your gliss game. We're leaving.\" No one paid much attention to one more news crew giving up on a locked house. The news vehicle stopped a few blocks away and two children and a woman carrying a cat climbed into a grav car with a lovely redhead driving it. The scene was repeated again and again, twice with dogs and once more with a cat and with various numbers of various-age children. One man struggled not to weep as he hustled four children into a van and left the home his wife's 'inheritance' had bought nine years before. Merith drove a closed vehicle onto the ship's cargo lift and drove it out again moments later. Ellith had a large number of houseguests overnight, then kissed Pon good luck and watched two chartered transports take his staff, chosen students and him to the spaceport for a chartered flight to a competition on a nearby world. Merith collected her winnings, then met Pon's brother-in-law and he gave her his. Lane had explained Harvelle had been the perfect place for the ring's base because there were no income taxes due to the vast mineral wealth. The incident that made it as accessible as it was on Earth wasn't the same, but the result was and the government collected money on every gram exported. It was also why gaming taxes were low. She cheerfully paid the two percent of the gross. She deposited the rest in numbered accounts and purchased real estate on another world by comm. The show was broken down and the ship loaded. Merith realized Frake would have to hire several people to replace the three who were leaving. She brushed tears from her eyes and went back to work. There were furnishings to order and clothes to provide. Kitchens must also be stocked. \"Merith, we're on our way. We'll have everything ready for them when they get there. We'll see you at your destination.\" \"All right, Lane. Lane... \" \"Yes? Come on, Merith, you know how it works. You have to ask before I can have the memory. You ask.\" \"If I tell Frake I'm in love with him, what would he... Would he... Oh, dear.\" \"Save me a dance at your reception. I love dancing with ladies in white.\" He smiled, pulled a white rose from the air and handed it to her. She stared at it in surprise. It was cool and moist with dew. She inhaled the fragrance of the first rose she'd ever held that hadn't been replicated. She laughed in delight as Lane waved and walked away. She took a deep breath and hunted for Frake. She had something to tell him. Lane was smiling when he walked into Melissa. \"All right, that's taken care of. Now, on to our next destination. We're about to become deliverymen. Dutch, here's the list of merchants and items. Set schedules for pickup. You met them all, figure out what should go where and to whom. We need to insert computer records for all the kids in schools so they can be transferred to their new ones. I'll pull their real ones and change the identities. We'll need to do marriage, divorce, etceteras, for every one of them. Clete, you take care of birth and medical records. Here's the list of people and their new identities. Let's get to work.\" \"Lane, why are you so happy? You're just bubbling.\" \"Well, Clete, when we get this chore finished, we're going to a wedding. The bride has just promised me a dance at the reception. You guys will get one too, but you'll enjoy dancing with the bridesmaids more.\" \"Frake and Merith!\" \"You got it. Jerona, Keli and Kera are going to be bridesmaids. Guess who the groomsmen are.\" \"All right! I like being in weddings.\" The sudden wistful look on Clete's face made Dutch wish he hadn't said it. \"It's all right, Dutch. I like being in weddings, too.\" \"Clete, it'll be a little rough in places. Tell Jerona why. She's a good friend. She'll be willing to help.\" \"She always does.\" Clete smiled a slow warm smile. It went with a very nice memory. \"Damn, Lane. He's doing it again!\" \"I noticed. Let's get to work, Dutch.\" \"I hate trying to think when my teeth are rattling!\" A woman was still very nervous when she walked into her new house. The pain of finding out what her husband was hadn't really eased. She stopped and stared around in amazement. It was beautiful. She wandered from room to beautifully furnished room, carrying her cat and dragging her coat unnoticed behind her. She heard her daughter squeal, dropped cat and coat and ran. \"Look, Mommy, toys and dolls and my closet's full. Jord's too. Is yours full too, Mommy?\" She went to check. It was. She found a large packet on her dresser. It contained complete documents for all of them, including school enrollment for Merrie and Jord. Their first names were the same, but the last had been changed. The message light was blinking on the comm unit. It was from the bank and it thanked her for choosing them for her accounts. She pulled up the records and started to laugh. There was an amazing amount all set up as interest-bearing trusts. She would have a comfortable regular income and the children's education was provided for. She began to put the documents away and found a short handwritten note. \"The name on the decree is fictitious, but the divorce is real. Forget the past. Enjoy your new life. P.S. I set the coffeepot to turn on when you answered the comm unit.\" She went to the kitchen and poured herself a cup of coffee. The house didn't have a food synthesizer, but she'd never really liked them. She opened cabinets and found them stocked. She sat down at the table and giggled. Frake had told her not to worry, she had the best guardian angels in the business. He'd been absolutely right. She wondered if one of them was called Dutch. The scene was repeated in eight homes that day. Most homes had synthesizers. Those that didn't were for ladies and the man who preferred to cook. Reporters searched passenger lists for days. The families of the eight men and one woman had just disappeared, including dogs and cats. Frake and Merith didn't wait long. It was a good time for all their real friends to attend, but it was less wait for the Gallants. None of them wanted to wait thirty-two days to go to the wedding. \"Congratulations, Frake, you're a very lucky man.\" \"I know it. Lane, I don't think I'd have ever gotten up the nerve, but she just walked up and said she loved me and what was I going to do about it. I asked her to marry me. Surprised myself. Didn't surprise her though. She handed me a guest list.\" \"Thanks for asking me to be best man. It meant a lot. Barnard and Jeannie looked pleased too.\" \"Well, Merith doesn't have any family. She likes Barnard and decided to ask him to give her away. Jeannie was natural for flower girl. Old Earth traditional all the way. It was those costumes you guys wore. I'm glad Pon and Ellith could come. I've got a lot of old friends here, but Merith... Well, she needed some on her side of the aisle.\" \"Frake, I'm going to dance with your wife. I'm going to give her a kiss too. It's the one time I know my fiancé wouldn't mind.\" \"That's true. I wish Sabbi and Rose could've come. Merith asked them.\" \"Work and school. They just couldn't get away.\" \"Lane, you could've... you know, got them.\" \"No. My life with Sabbi is going to be wonderful. I don't need to make any changes in it. I am looking forward to the next time I see her though. I dream about it.\" \"Special reason?\" \"Yes. Her mother won't be around.\" Frake laughed and Lane went to dance with his wife and give her a kiss. Pon joined him at the punch bowl a short time later. \"It will be a warm night.\" \"Yeah, Clete and Dutch are going to bring Jerona, Keli and Kera home for a late supper. And breakfast.\" \"I'm sorry, my friend, Ellith has decided it will be a warm night too. You'll have to swim alone.\" Lane laughed and clapped him on the back. Clete watched Lane sit down for dinner in Melissa. Dutch grinned widely. They all felt good, but Lane was flying. \"All right, tell us.\" \"Tell you what, Clete?\" \"You know. What's up. Why you're three feet off the ground and humming under your breath. Come on, Lane, tell us.\" \"I'm going to see Sabbi. There's a dance at her university and we're going to it. We're going to make it official. I've just been thinking about it.\" \"There's more.\" \"Yes! Yes, there is. Her mother won't be there! I'm going to whisk her away and spend some time with her. I've been enjoying thinking about you two taking your turn.\" \"Our turn at what?\" \"Doing countless laps in the pool!\" Clete and Dutch burst into laughter. It really was their turn. Lane got more excited as the time drew near. One night Clete hauled him out of bed, carried him, protesting, from his room and dumped him in the pool. Lane sputtered and laughed. Clete shook his head, grinned and went back to bed. Maybe his room wouldn't be quite so warm. Three days later, Lane's memory finally agreed it was time. Clete and Dutch both walked in to his room grinning widely. They'd both felt his sudden surge of excitement and knew exactly what it meant. \"So, how do we dress? Is this formal, informal, a beach party, what?\" \"Homecoming. Called The Queen's Ball.\" \"White tuxes?\" \"Not this time, Dutch. You and Clete wear black tuxes. I'm the only one who wears white.\" \"Oh, ho, you want to outshine us.\" \"I most certainly do.\" \"Going to tell us why?\" \"No, you'll see. You won't be bored or go unnoticed. You'll get all the attention you need. I just want more.\" \"All right, Lane. Clete, black tuxes.\" \"Done.\" Lane smiled, told Melissa to execute the flight plan and began getting ready. Dutch and Clete would wear black tuxes with red satin cummerbunds, ties and roses. He would wear all white including an opera cape. He planned on putting on quite a show. Sabbi would love it. She was a true romantic and so was he. He made his preparations and smiled. Clete hadn't caught on to the purpose of all the equations he'd given him to work on while he lifted weights. He'd just been happy to have some new ones to \"play with,\" while the barbell went up and down. The girl checking tickets at the door didn't ask them if they had them. Dutch handed her a rose and asked her for a dance later. The plain little girl became a beautiful woman in an instant. He was sure she was and she really couldn't doubt it. Lane smiled at Clete's wide grin when love for them both rose in a warm wave in him, then suddenly became a thought of Sabbi and a great deal warmer. They stepped through the doors and Dutch grinned, too. They followed two paces behind Lane as he walked across the dance floor. People stopped to watch and an aisle cleared. Sabbi looked up and saw him. Her face lit with delight. She waited. The gleam in his eye and his smile told her he was up to something. He made a full formal bow and produced a bouquet of white roses from the air. He dropped on one knee before her. His deep rich voice carried through the room. \"I, Sir Apollo Avelaine Gallant, ask for your hand in marriage.\" \"Yes.\" He pulled a ring set with a huge diamond from the air and placed it on her finger. She began to sing her song and he lifted her to her feet. He joined her in duet and they danced. When they finished the song, he kissed her and flower petals drifted down around them. The room erupted in applause. Clete and Dutch grinned. Lane had figured out the flower petal trick and used it to good effect. He'd been spectacular. The prince had crashed the homecoming and walked off with the queen. Clete and Dutch bowed to them and moved toward the refreshment table. Dutch filled two cups and carried them to the girl at the table in the hall. Clete felt the slightly awkward determination of a group of young women who had no special companion for the most romantic event of the year, but weren't about to miss it. He walked into the midst of them. \"Hi. I'm Clete. Can I be your date? I hate being at things like this alone.\" He pulled rose after rose from the air and handed one to each. A chubby young woman with a delightful smile suddenly laughed. \"Absolutely, and I think you're big enough to actually go around.\" \"Oh, I do my best. Would you like to dance?\" Dutch found the shy girls in the hall, the ones who had built the floats and decorated the room. The ones who had worked long and hard, then dressed up and peeked through the door at other people enjoying the fruits of their labors. He sat on the ticket table, gave out roses and gently teased. Before long, he shooed them through the doors ahead of him, found a table and seated each and every one. He bowed and led the little ticket girl onto the floor. Boys next. They'd be harder, but a bit less shy to start. There would also be fewer. For some reason, a pair of very shy girls were likely to talk each other into things and a pair of very shy boys were likely to talk each other out of them. The three women and two men faculty members and the group of alumnus smiled. They had no idea who the big men who had 'crashed the gate' were, but they were very welcome. They had made the night magical and brought the outsiders in. And in the center of the floor, the queen danced with her prince. The last song was announced and couples moved onto the floor to hold each other and move to the slow song. On the last chord, the man in white flipped several things into the air in quick succession. There were sudden flashes of light all over the room and something began to drift down. A botany professor picked one up and gasped in amazement. \"It's real! The rose petals are real! They're not replicated! They're real!\" All over the room, young university students caught drifting petals and tucked them away, memories of a magical, romantic, night. \"Time for supper. Tell me, ladies, where would you like to continue this evening?\" \"Clete, you can't be serious.\" \"Teri, I think you ladies have enjoyed my company. I know I've enjoyed yours. Whyever would you be surprised I want to take you to supper? Choose some place nice. I want to show you off. The boys and I feel quite smug having you all to ourselves. Don't we, Cliff?\" \"Yes. How about Tres Jacque?\" \"Ah, a suggestion. Sounds like a good one. Now, transport?\" \"We can walk. It's about six blocks and I'd love to be seen with a whole bunch of pretty girls.\" \"Ladies, would you walk six blocks on a warm autumn evening so Cliff, Darrell and I can show off?\" \"We'll get our coats.\" \"Teri, please allow us to use it as a way to say we're pleased to be with you. A bunch more people in line getting coats one at a time is silly and it's a nice opportunity.\" They collected the checks and walked to the coat room. \"Clete, you're an absolute master. I'm having a great time learning from you.\" \"No, Cliff. See that man over there? That's my brother Dutch. I always thought he was a master. Tonight, I learned the true master is my brother Lane.\" \"The one who asked Sabbi to marry him.\" \"That's the one.\" \"I see what you mean.\" \"Ah, you really are learning.\" \"Clete?\" \"Yes, Darrell?\" \"Um, well, Tres Jacque is... well... \" \"Don't worry. We'll cover it. It seems someone recently decided he owed me some back pay.\" \"Who? Oops, sorry. I didn't mean to pry.\" \"Then you won't mind if I don't tell you. It's rather embarrassing to be paid to escort the most beautiful women on a planet across a stage.\" \"Hi, Clete. Where are we taking the ladies?\" \"Cliff suggests Tres Jacque, Dutch.\" \"Excellent. Thanks, Cliff. I couldn't get a name from anyone. Just 'anyplace' and 'you choose.' I take it we're within strolling distance.\" \"Yes. Dutch, make sure you reassure student budgets.\" \"True. We were pretty spoiled at the academy, in the Federation in general. I may never get used to the idea of needing to carry money. I'll comm ahead. Get us the center of the room. Lane and Sabbi?\" \"Yes, definitely. Check. He may have already made the reservations.\" \"You're right. I'll bet he did. Weeks ago. Hang on, Kip. I'll take some of those. Ah, Lane. Reservations Tres Jacque?\" \"Weeks ago. Hi, Clete, Cliff, Darrell. You lost a coat check. Teri's. Middle of the dance floor.\" \"Got it. Here, guys, be right back.\" \"How'd you know?\" \"What?\" \"About the coat check and our names.\" \"Easy, Cliff. Sabbi told me your names and Clete tells me about the coat check.\" \"Teri's coat check. In the middle of the dance floor.\" \"See?\" \"Lane, not fair. You're making them nervous.\" \"You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just showing off. Like the lights and flower petals. I asked the girl of my dreams to marry me and she said yes. I'm feeling pretty smug.\" \"There's a lot of that going around. I came all alone tonight and I'm leaving with at least a girl on each arm. I'm feeling pretty good.\" \"Cliff, I like you. Ah. No, this won't do. Too drab for tonight. She needs something special.\" \"Lane, what are you going to do?\" \"Just watch, Clete.\" \"Hand her the tickets, guys. This we want to see. Dutch!\" Dutch turned from aiding young ladies with coats and Clete nodded toward Lane. They watched as he reached her, looked at her, looked at the coat, back at her and shook his head. He tossed the coat in the air. There was a flash of light and a full-length, snowy-white satin cape dropped onto his arm. When he lifted it to drape around her shoulders, the way the light glinted from it identified it as Carenna Satin. She laughed and kissed him. Clete laughed when Cliff said he thought he'd keep learning from him because he was too awed to ask Lane questions. When he turned, the two girls from the coat room were standing behind him, still holding the tickets. \"Lane! Two more for supper!\" \"Done!\" \"Do you mean... us?\" \"I most certainly do. You're almost done here. You've worked hard all evening to help make this night special and raise funds for your organization. You definitely deserve supper.\" \"Yes! I mean thanks. Come on, Jen. Let's get these coats.\" They were nearly the last to leave. Lane and Sabbi led the way. They were followed by a large group of happy girls carrying roses. Amidst the girls were five near ecstatic boys, Dutch and Clete. Tres Jacque was awaiting them. The maitre d' bowed to them. \"The queen's party has arrived!\" Suddenly every waiter and busperson was aiding with coats. The maitre d' led them to the center of the restaurant and bowed deeply. Lane removed Sabbi's cape and handed it to him. He pulled a chair out for her and every other girl found herself with a chair held for her. They were all seated and handed menus. Everyone but the maitre d' vanished. \"May I suggest?\" \"That would be most kind.\" Sabbi was having a wonderful time. She knew Lane had set everything up. The kitchen would even know what to prepare. She listened in near rapture to the delights Lane had chosen as the maitre d' named them. Mouths dropped open around the table when she nodded. \"Yes, I think that would be suitable, but do see if anyone prefers something lighter.\" \"Ladies, gentlemen, do you prefer something other?\" Dutch grinned at Clete and folded his menu. Lane was flying and neither of them was firmly on the ground. \"No, I believe the queen has spoken for us all. Thank you, Milady.\" \"Very well. It will be but a few moments.\" As soon as he'd left, Sabbi burst into giggles. \"Oh, Lane, what a meal. They don't even serve half the things he named.\" \"They do tonight. Well, at least at this table.\" \"That's another thing. A table for twenty-seven?\" \"I had them build it. The U shape was the most efficient use of space. Kept us all close enough to chat.\" The feast started arriving in minutes. It was wonderful. The chef came out and thanked them for allowing her to prepare such a wonderful menu. Sabbi said they thanked her for preparing it superbly. When the evening ended, each coat was held for the right person. No bill was presented. Cliff worried privately to Clete about it. He reassured him everything, including very generous tips, had been arranged. Cliff nodded. \"A master.\" \"Lane, we're going to see the ladies home. We'll see you shortly.\" \"I doubt that, Clete. Have a nice swim.\" Dutch and Clete both burst into laughter. When asked what they were laughing about, they just shook their heads and grinned. They escorted the girls to dorms and co-op houses and said goodnight to the boys. Clete and Dutch looked at each other and laughed. They ran back to Melissa. They were going for a swim. It was a very long one, but Clete was very happily fixing breakfast when Sabbi walked into the kitchen rather early the next morning. \"Hi. Mmm, smells good.\" \"Good morning, Sabbi. Breakfast in about five. Coffee's ready.\" \"Why do you cook?\" \"What?\" \"I mean, you have a food synthesizer, but you don't use it much. You prepare most of your own meals. Why?\" \"Well, I suppose because we enjoy doing it. We use the synth if we're in a hurry. Or if Dutch cooks. Most of the things we cook come from it. Maybe it just seems too easy.\" \"I think part of it is you're olfactory oriented.\" \"What?\" \"The smell of cooking food makes you hungrier, more appreciative. Makes a home more homey. Do you remember the smells of your boyhood?\" \"Oh, yes. Prairie grasses on a hot summer day, spring rain, a wood fire, my mother's skin when she gave me a hug.\" \"Lane's the same way. Real roses, because replicated ones don't smell fresh. Tells me every ocean smells different. Recognizes places by smell. Dutch too?\" \"Dutch too what?\" \"Oh, hi, Dutch. Recognize places by their smell.\" \"Maybe not smell so much as a... gestalt of things. Light, sound, the feel of the air, the smell and taste. I guess smell plays a very big part in it. Why?\" \"It all started when she asked me why we cooked instead of using the synth.\" \"Sabbi, I think you've hit something. I grew up in space. Starships and space stations. Clete and Lane didn't. I suppose I notice all the things I mentioned because my environment was so controlled. I collect clothes made of real materials when we go into the past because I like the way they feel on my skin. And, as for the cooking, a synthesizer doesn't make my mouth water the way Clete and Lane's cooking does. That looks great, Clete.\" \"Simple and fast, but sometimes bacon and eggs are just perfect. Enjoy. Where's Lane, Sabbi?\" \"I'm not quite sure. He handed me this dressing gown, gave me a kiss, and said to tell you he'd be here before his eggs got cold.\" \"I am. Ah, breakfast. I was looking for where we're going. Comparing star charts with my memories.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"Tenepeth, Dutch. It's a beautiful place. Rich and green. Warm seas and beautiful beaches. Yellow sun and three moons. Earth-like without all the people.\" \"Just how many people is it without?\" \"Don't worry. I'm not taking us anywhere totally uninhabited. You'll find playmates. Clete, this world will be very interesting for you. The people are empathic. Makes it a very peaceful place.\" \"I hate to mention this, Lane, but I have to get back to the university. I have classes tomorrow.\" \"Sabbi, this is a timeship. You could be gone years and make your next class. We're only going for three days. You won't forget your subjects. We're going to Tenepeth for a reason. About ten years before we'll arrive, a disease devastated the planet. Children under the age of about five weren't hit very hard. A mild fever and a quick recovery. Older kids had it quite a bit worse. About sixty percent of them died. The adults were decimated. I want you to see how they cared for all those children. Hundreds of them to four or five adults and thirty or so older kids.\" \"Oh, Lane, it's perfect! Yes, take me there.\" \"We're on our way. We'll be very welcome, especially Clete.\" \"Why me?\" \"They're trying to rebuild their population. Ten months after we leave, the birth rate doubles.\" \"Wait a minute! I'm not responsible for that!\" \"Not directly. Your presence just warms things up a bit. Look at it this way, at least you won't look like a prune from spending three days in the swimming pool.\" Sabbi suddenly realized what he meant and blushed. \"I didn't think about... I forgot... I just--\" \"Sabbi, we don't think about it either. Lane's spent a lot of time in that pool. Lots more than three days. Dutch and I are very happy for you two. Love is a wonderful thing to be near. You're family. You've become a piece of what makes us what we are. A part of the love.\" \"Clete's right. You belong with Lane. We both feel it. I'd be absolutely ecstatic about it if it weren't for one thing. Clete's so damn happy about it my teeth are rattling!\" \"Rattling? Oh, that's right. You've said that before.\" \"Happens every time things get really nice. We're not even sure exactly what it is he's doing. He doesn't seem to be able to control it. It bothers Dutch more than it does me. I find it a mild distraction, but it drives Dutch crazy.\" \"It's like... Have you ever rested your head against a cat when it's purring?\" \"Hmm, yes, but it didn't rattle my teeth, Dutch.\" \"Imagine what it would have been like if the cat was Clete's size.\" \"Oh, my.\" \"Yes, oh my. You're extremely welcome here, Sabbi. The proof is in my head. I'd be walking on air if Clete would just stop purring!\" \"Dutch, I'd stop if I could. You know I don't know I'm doing it. It just happens.\" Sabbi looked at the three of them. Dutch looked disgusted. Clete looked chagrined. Lane was wearing a wide grin. She burst into laughter. They were family and she was part of it. She wondered if she was purring too. Lane suggested they give her a martial arts lesson. She had been working quite hard and it showed. Clete was delighted with the progress she'd made. One day she'd be very good. Lane told them they'd be landing shortly after lunch and he and Sabbi would prepare it. Sabbi decided she liked to cook, but wasn't fond of doing dishes. \"We've landed. Come on, Sabbi. Let's go look around. This is one of the havens the people built for the children. It's still in use, but most of the kids are in their teens. Don't be surprised by young-looking pregnant girls. They're watched over carefully. There's a real gap between generations. A lot of young teenagers, but very few kids between two and nine. Remember, there are a hundred empty cities out there and every child is needed.\" \"All right, Lane. I'll remember. Oh! It's beautiful!\" The sun seemed to shine softly on low, tree-shaded, buildings of a soft tan color. Bright-colored playground equipment dotted large grassy lawns. There were clusters of buildings scattered across a huge area. Each cluster enclosed a play area for very small children. Lane led her to a cluster where happy toddlers played. They introduced themselves to two girls, who looked about fifteen, who were watching the children and one of them called for someone to show them their home. Each building was designed to house about a dozen young children and one or two young adults. Rooms were large and comfortable. Bedrooms were shared by two or three children of the same sex, but not quite the same age. Oldest being furthest from the adults, youngest closest. There were playrooms and study rooms, dining rooms and kitchens. Three small rooms puzzled Sabbi until she learned they were included so there were places children could go to be alone. One room was called the \"thinking room.\" It was furnished simply and had nice windows, but no toys or other forms of entertainment. She learned it was where children were taken when they had badly misbehaved. It was a place to think things over. One young boy was sitting by a window and looking out. The girl guiding their tour asked him if he'd thought about why he was there. When he told her he had, she gave him a hug and sent him out to play. Sabbi was impressed with the affection that was obvious. Each building was a real home, warm and nurturing. \"Lane, I want to do this. Even on my very-civilized world, there are people who have children and really don't want them. They think they do, but find out later they didn't. I want to make a place they're wanted.\" \"You will, Sabbi. We'll help. I'll help. Clete will be a wonder with the kids and Dutch will be everyone's favorite uncle. You'll find others who have enough love to give it to lots of children. You're going to be Mom to dozens of wonderful people and I'm going to love being called 'Daddy.' Come on, let's find a place by ourselves. I want to tell you a story about a very special child and how he came to be. We need to get a ways away from Clete. This is the best place to tell you. The people here will help him deal with your sadness.\" \"Lane, he is sad, isn't he? Somewhere inside he's been terribly hurt. He has too much depth not to have known great pain.\" \"Sabbi, you will always amaze me. You care so deeply about others. Clete's caring is easy for me to understand. He feels other's feelings. Yours is a wonder to me and always will be. You work to know how others feel. Your love is boundless. I'm going to bask in it and wonder at it all our lives together.\" \"Hi, you headed for the beach?\" \"No, Dutch, a walk through the forest. Find Clete. Find some people for him to be around. I'm going to tell Sabbi about Helen.\" \"Give me a few minutes to find him and meet some people. I saw a group of young women sitting on the beach. I'll take him there, then make myself scarce.\" \"Find yourself some company too, Dutch. Clete's pretty attuned to Sabbi right now. It'll hit you hard too.\" \"Yeah. Later.\" \"Why is Clete attuned to me?\" \"Catnip \" \"What!?\" \"Having you around makes us all happy. Your presence makes him purr.\" \"Because of you.\" \"Some, but a lot of it's you. You radiate warmth and caring. It delights him. I'm going to tell you how much.\" Dutch 'tracked' Clete and moved fast. He wanted to find him before he started hunting for them to find out what was wrong. \"Come on, Clete.\" \"Where to, Dutch?\" \"Down the beach a ways. You're about to make some friends. Lane sent me.\" \"Oh. All right.\" \"I'm going to take you where you're going and take off. I have some friends of my own to make.\" \"This is all rather mysterious.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" \"Dutch, you're hurting.\" \"Yeah. A bit. I'm going to find somebody to help make it go away. You've stopped purring. First time I was ever sorry my teeth weren't rattling. There are your friends. Later.\" \"Hello, I'm Talla. What has you puzzled and worried?\" \"My brother. He just led me here and said make friends. He's hurting and didn't tell me why. My other brother is sad too. NO! Not... Oh, Lane, I'm not ready.\" \"Peli! Tiva! Help me! Oh, such pain! Such sadness. His loss is too great. Help me comfort him.\" They cradled him and cried with him. They shared the story that had pained Sabbi so deeply. They held Clete as Lane held Sabbi, helping ease the pain by sharing it. Dutch hadn't been so lucky. Two girls found him curled on the ground crying. \"Please, let us help you.\" \"It'll pass. I'll be all right. I'm sorry. I know I'm hurting you.\" \"Yes, you are hurting us. Stop being foolish and let us help us all feel better. Lethe, what shall we do with him?\" \"Make him forget about it, Dida. We know how.\" \"Yes. Oh! I've shocked him. That wasn't what I had in mind at all.\" \"You're children!\" \"No. Not on this world. We know the way it was. It must be different now. Come on, Lethe. He'll get over the silliness. Tell us your name.\" \"Dutch. Stop! You don't know what you're doing!\" \"Oh, Dutch! We know exactly what we're doing. Lethe, he's beautiful.\" \"All right, I believe you! You know what you're doing. Now, stop it!\" \"Dida, kiss him, then he'll stop shouting. Oh! That's better. His mind is still protesting, but his body is most definitely not.\" Dutch surrendered. He didn't really have a choice in the matter. The two empaths felt his response to every touch, each caress. He moaned as Lane's passion suddenly burned through the link he had with his brothers. When Clete caught fire, he was lost. Suddenly, there were more of them. Dozens of them. Touching him. Loving him. He knew when Clete loosed the tight hold he kept on his passion. The world caught fire. The moons were rising when he began to think coherently. He was surrounded by children. \"Stop that! You're embarrassed. Just stop it! No one of us is a child. Children don't respond. You're on our world. We'll show you again we're not children.\" Dutch started to laugh. He was used to the intimacy of sharing his brothers' passion. Lane had landed him on a world where all shared that intimacy. He was trying to impose his values in a place they just didn't work. The age of adulthood was different. There was no struggling with misunderstood feelings. No fears of being different or unliked. No loneliness. No frightening adolescence. It was still a struggle not think of those around him as children, but his reason told him they were adults. There didn't seem to be any nudity taboos either. \"Ooh, your skin is so white in the moonslight. And so soft. Especially, here... and here. You're shocked again. You're just going to have to get over that. I'm Teli and I just won't stand for it. I'm going to stop it right now.\" \"Teli! Leave him alone. There are lots of silly taboos where he comes from and you're breaking dozens of them. You're being mean! This is more than cultural. He just doesn't want you. He's totally hetero. You aren't going to change it.\" \"You're right, Dida. I'm sorry, Dutch. I wasn't paying attention to what you were really feeling. You're just so beautiful, I got carried away. I hope we can be friends. All right! I'm forgiven. Too bad though, I'd really--\" \"Teli!\" \"Yeah, yeah. Behave myself. I'm going for a swim. Anybody else?\" \"We'll all go. Come on, Dutch. Teli will be good. I promise. If not, I'll get mad.\" \"Oh, I'll be good. The last time Dida got mad at me, my head rang for a fiveday. I felt singed for twenty. Half my friends wouldn't talk to me. When Dida gets mad, everbody gets singed.\" \"I've got a brother like that.\" \"We noticed your brother. Everyone on the planet noticed your brother. We're still noticing him. What is he doing? My teeth feel... \" \"Like they're rattling. Yeah, I know. Do you know what a cat is, Dida? Do you have an animal... How do I explain it? It's just Clete. He's content. He's purring. It drives me crazy!\" They laughed and pulled him toward the sea. He looked around for things, but couldn't find them. He gave it up as hopeless. When on Tenepeth... He hadn't been skinny-dipping in a warm sea in a long time. \"Hello, Dutch. Nice night.\" \"It would be if you'd stop rattling my teeth!\" \"I can't help it. You know I can't.\" \"This is obviously your brother, Clete.\" \"Yes. Clete, this is Dida. You're making her teeth rattle too.\" \"Oh, sorry. I really wish I knew how to stop it. It... just happens.\" \"Don't worry about it. Oh, my. You're huge. Everywhere.\" \"Uh, Dutch, they're kids.\" \"No, Clete, they're not. Believe me. They're just small adults. I've gotten a very long lecture about it. And a rather effective demonstra-- CLETE!\" \"Dutch, she's making me warm. Very warm.\" \"Hi. I'm Lethe. That's just Dida. She makes everybody warm, but not as warm as you do. You are the most magnificent male I have ever seen. Go away Teli. This one's the same.\" \"Not fair!\" \"Dutch, I'm going to have real problems in this place. How long did... Lane say we're... staying?\" \"About two more days.\" Clete groaned and Dutch laughed. They had a too-good time for the two days, but they learned a great deal too. Dutch 'won' his battle with himself to accept what he knew was the truth of the culture, but Clete knew he was still working on it a bit when Lane was saying farewell to Sabbi. \"I suppose I didn't really get over it til I found out Dida was a mother, Dutch. It helped when I met Carva.\" \"Nothing like having a seventy-year-old patriarch treat them as adults to make it easier to accept them as such. Clete, we've got to ask Lane some things.\" \"Like what, Dutch?\" \"Tiva didn't seem to have any doubts about you and I fathering children on her world. The gestation period is about right and the physiology is similar.\" \"Well, two hearts is a start. Helen got help. Decided before I married her. Just made up her mind and got medical assistance.\" \"Like my mom. 'I want a baby. You're going to be the father.' Clete, I want to know. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I've never even thought about it before. And they're so young.\" \"Do you know how old Dida was?\" \"Not old enough.\" \"You're wrong. They're a small people. You got a lecture because she thought you needed it. She made me promise not to tell you til we left.\" \"Tell me what?\" \"Dutch, Dida has three children. The oldest is four. She's twenty-three. Not one of those kids was under eighteen. They mature fairly slowly. Puberty hits between seventeen and eighteen. Tiva's in her thirties.\" Dutch started to laugh. She'd told him children didn't respond. He hadn't asked her at what age they stopped being children. She'd told him her world was different and he'd forced himself to accept it, but he hadn't really understood it. He'd still thought of them as being the same. No wonder she'd been surprised at his shock. He hadn't explained he came from a place where puberty began at twelve or thirteen, in many people. Some even younger. He realized communication was more than just being able to speak and understand the language. \"Hi. That was really hard to do. I don't suppose saying... I can't even say the word. I couldn't even say farewell. I ended up with, 'See you soon.' It'll never get easier, but I will see her again fairly soon. Now ask me.\" \"Lane, will any of those women on Tenepeth bear our children?\" \"I don't know.\" \"TERRIFIC!\" \"Easy, Dutch. I don't. They don't really know either. Paternity isn't really important to them. Every child is loved and needed. If a male and female pairbond, they take her children and seven or eight more and set up a household. Your friend Teli was pairbonded. He just saw you as a very attractive, non-threatening, diversion. He wasn't interested in the women. He has a heterosexual mate. They'll probably find another male to bond with eventually, since he seems to be so inclined.\" \"But he was on the beach with us.\" \"So was she. I doubt you were exactly aware of what was going on around you. Why do you think Sabbi and I were left alone?\" \"Because you were pairbonded.\" \"Exactly. You and Clete weren't. Teli is nearly as old as we are. Pairbonding doesn't usually take place until the mid twenties. Sometimes never.\" \"That explains what Dida said about you, Dutch.\" \"What did she say?\" \"You stirred her too much. She stayed away from you because you would not be ready when she was. You might never be. I was safer. I had been mated.\" \"Tenepethans bond for life, Dutch. If one of them dies, they never bond again. That's why Carva didn't have a mate. Once in a while a bond forms one way. It's a sad thing. One loving the other and knowing that one does not love in return. Only responsive to one person and that person wanting more. It's less common than a three-way bond. Dida was falling in love with you, so she turned to Clete to stop the process. I hope it worked.\" \"Lane, don't you ever get me into something like that again! There's a woman I may have injured and children who may be mine. And I won't ever know. Don't let it happen again!\" \"Dutch, it had to be. You had to grow up sometime. You're a heartbreaker. Women have fallen in love with you before. You never even noticed. Just kissed them goodby and went on your merry way. Now maybe you'll think about it before you turn on the charm and fill some poor girl with dreams she learns, the hard way, won't come true. Humans don't usually bond for life. If a heart breaks, it mends and loves again. Usually. And you're too different biologically to father children unless a woman seeks help. You don't catch or carry diseases. Tenepeth was for you. Clete was something that helped them, but you were the reason we were there. I could have taken Sabbi to other places that were good examples. I won't do it again. I won't have to. You'll accept responsibility for your actions. Oh, sometimes women will fall in love with you and you'll hurt them. It happens to Dad. But you'll never just blithely ignore their feelings again.\" \"I do, don't I? Assume they're into having a good time just like I am and never look deeper.\" \"Dutch, most of them are. You just have to notice when it gets beyond that point. Ask Clete why Riss just suddenly disappeared. He knows. Even in the midst of his falling in love, he felt her pain when she said, 'Well, Dutch, it's been fun,' and walked off. I saw it too.\" \"And I didn't. Damn. I feel like a complete heel.\" \"You aren't or you wouldn't feel like one. You'll always love women, and they'll always love you. Don't stop charming them and loving them. Just be aware if you're hurting them and be gentle.\" \"Thanks, Lane. I learned a lot of lessons on Tenepeth. I want to go back there someday. But not until Dida's bonded.\" \"Did you have to do that? Oh!\" \"Do what? What did I do?\" \"Decide to go back. Lord, what a mess. Well, it's not that bad. The answer is you think so. Some of the kids are pretty big, but you don't ask Clete to check. In their culture, it's just not important and it's a very healthy one for kids.\" \"Yes, Lane, I got that part of the lesson too.\" \"I was sure you had. Let's go fishing. I'm in the mood for Rocky Mountain trout and the smell of pines.\" \"Good idea. Let's go. Clete, get your hip boots on. Fresh fish tonight.\" The last evening of the fishing trip, Clete suddenly looked up from cleaning up after dinner. \"Dutch, you're tense. What's wrong?\" \"I don't know. I feel watched. Icy breath on the back of my neck. A feeling of... being plotted against. Evil intent. Directed at us, Clete. Lane, do you see anything? Any changes?\" \"No. Fishing trip is over. We're headed for the future to explore. We find interesting people and places. We head back and I take Sabbi to the winter formal. Nothing new. Including this conversation. It... isn't there.\" \"Let's finish cleaning our cooking area and get going. This forest just doesn't feel as friendly as it did.\" \"Done. I'll load the fishing gear. You put the fire out. Lane, lay in the coordinates. I'm ready to get out of here too. Dutch? Dutch?\" \"Like laughter. Cold and mocking.\" \"Lane, get the fire. I'm going to get him in.\" \"Got it. Out. Place looks good. Damn. Here, give me the gear. Clete?\" \"Yeah. I've got him. Push. He's not moving.\" \"What? Oh. We're ready. Good. Let's get out of here. Why are you two pushing me?\" \"Because you stopped moving. Inside fast. Lane and I want away. Whatever you're picking up, we don't like it either. Door closed. Better?\" \"Yeah. Still feel... wary. Lane, get us on our way.\" \"Coordinates in. We're gone.\" They sat and talked for awhile and Dutch relaxed. The fire and the feel of home lulled them. They went to bed settled and comfortable. Clete jerked awake with Lane's raging loss burning through him. Suddenly, Dutch was enraged, then shocked cold. He ran for Dutch' s room and pulled Lane off him and held him as he screamed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?! SHE'S GONE!! YOU CHANGED IT!! SHE'S GONE!!\" \"CLETE, I ALMOST KILLED HIM! HE WAS AT MY THROAT! I ALMOST KILLED HIM!\" \"SHUT UP!! Damn!\" Clete slugged Lane. He couldn't hold him. He was incoherent and wild. He dropped him and grabbed Dutch. He was collapsing in near hysteria. \"Easy. Easy. You were under attack and you weren't awake. Dutch, you weren't even fighting him.\" \"I couldn't. I almost killed him in the first instant. I was afraid to. I was afraid I'd kill him. He couldn't have known what he was doing or I'd be dead. What happened, Clete? What did he mean?\" \"Come on. Let's get to neutral ground. I'm going to drop him in the pool. If he doesn't wake up, we'll have to pull him out. I'm going to hang onto him until he's coherent. I want you to help.\" \"I can't. Clete, I nearly killed him.\" \"YOU SAID THAT BEFORE!! NOW MOVE!!\" Clete shook him. It was a very dangerous thing to do. Dutch was nearly as wild as Lane had been. He sighed in relief when the crazed look went out of his eyes and he nodded. \"Good. 'She' can only be Sabbi. Let's find out what happened.\" \"He thought I'd made a change, Clete. Made a decision that took her from him. He's still going to think that when he wakes up.\" \"Did you?\" \"No. Nothing. I've been searching my mind for something I might have done subconsciously. There's nothing there. Except... \" \"Except what?\" \"The memory of mocking laughter.\" \"Dutch, we've been attacked. Personally. And very badly injured. A healing trance won't cure this. Get in the pool. I'll drop him in and be right behind you.\" \"I don't... All right. Do it.\" Dutch grabbed Lane and shoved him against the wall. The shock of the cold water brought him to. Clete jumped in and they held him as he started to fight. \"Lane! He didn't do it! Dutch didn't do it! Dutch didn't change things! Easy. Easy. Now tell us. Tell us, Lane. Dutch didn't make a change. You said there was one. Tell us.\" \"I... I woke up with my head spinning with change. Real deep change. I couldn't do anything but lay there and wait for it to clear. When it did, she was gone. My life with Sabbi was gone. No home. No love. Gone. I guess I went a little crazy.\" \"No, you went a lot crazy. Do you remember trying to kill Dutch?\" \"I... No. Yes. I guess. I wanted him to change it back. To make him... bring her back.\" \"Lane, I didn't make any changes. None. Not even subconsciously. You've been attacked. We've been attacked. What I felt in the forest. It has to be.\" \"We've been hurt. Bad. Not just you. All of us. And it was set up well. Your long future memory came back just in time for your meeting with her. Just in time for you to see a future and have it ripped away. You nearly killed Dutch. He nearly killed you. The attack came close to completely destroying us. It nearly defeated us with one stroke. We were totally defenseless against it. We love her too. If she's gone from your life, she's gone from ours, Dutch's, mine and my son's. If one of you had killed the other, could that one have lived with it? Could I? It knocked us down, but we can get up.\" \"You're right. Oh, Clete. Your son. I only saw my pain, my emptiness. I'm sorry. Dutch--\" \"You don't even need to say it. Let's get out of here. I'm shivering and I'm not even sure I'm cold.\" \"Reaction. I'll get towels. Sorry about the punch, Lane. I couldn't think of anything else to do.\" \"It's probably the only thing you could do. A week in a healing trance should make my jaw feel normal again.\" \"Weak humor, but better. Here. Hand up. Towel. Dutch.\" \"Thanks, Clete. I'm weak in the knees. They feel like jelly.\" \"Let's go to the kitchen. I'm ordering cocoa with something in it for us all. I'm wobbly too. Adrenaline reaction. Things went crazy in a hurry. Come on, Lane.\" Clete and Dutch each put an arm around Lane and guided him to the kitchen. Clete got them both down at the table and fixed them a hot drink. Both were shivering. He put a bit of liqueur in the cocoa and sat down with them. \"Drink. Let's talk. Something out there is out to get us. It made a change. I don't know if we can unmake it, but we can try.\" \"No, Clete. I don't think we can. It changed something and I think we're stuck with it.\" \"Why not, Lane? Why can't we change it?\" \"Because Sabbi's going to marry someone else. Elope. She's very sorry, but I was so romantic she thought she was in love with me. As soon as she met him, she realized she was wrong. Maybe that's true. Maybe she was always supposed to marry him and the real attack came when I fell in love with her. He's a nice guy. He'll make her a wonderful husband. A builder. Widower with two kids. Wants to build her dream for her. We'll see them again. Won't be long for us, but about twenty years for them. He'll build it. Clete, they offer to give your son a home.\" \"No. We'll find another way. Tell them thanks for offering.\" \"I will. Let's get this over with. I want it done. This round to the enemy. Score one zip.\" \"Wrong, Lane. We're ahead on points. This just feels worse. It was a knockdown. Almost a knockout. It's the first round we've lost and it was a hit below the belt. We fight fair. We always will. It doesn't. Doesn't know how. Wouldn't want to. That's why it's the enemy.\" \"You're right, Dutch. Definitely below the belt. At least we don't have to take turns in the swimming pool.\" Dutch and Clete laughed. Soon Lane joined in. It was weak and edged with hysteria, but it was laughter. \"Now what? What did you mean you wanted to get it over with?\" \"I'm setting the coordinates to go back to see Sabbi, Dutch. Let her tell me goodby.\" \"Lane, we could go back and get her right after we left her. Stop her from meeting him. Make a change.\" \"No, Dutch, that would be using its methods. We don't do that. You don't do that. But thanks for offering. I'll survive. Like Clete, I'll have some wonderful memories. They aren't enough, but they're what I have. I'm going to set the coordinates. Clete, would you make us another drink and bring it to the living room? I don't feel much like sleeping.\" \"Done. Go on, Dutch. Keep him company. He'll want to be alone later, but right now he needs us.\" Clete fixed more cocoa with the mint liqueur and carried it to the living room. They sat and watched the fire in silence until Lane went to dress. Clete decided he didn't want him going alone and Dutch agreed. They dressed and were waiting for him when he returned. \"I want to go to the door alone, but I'd like you with me as far as the lift to her apartment. She's moving out. You'll meet him. He'll know who you are. Clete, he hurts for me, but he loves her. You'll feel it. Let's go.\" They walked with him as far as the building lobby and waited. A fellow carrying a chair came out of the lift Lane had taken up. \"Hi, I'm Mike Renfield. Damn, this is awkward. Look, I... \" \"It's all right, Mike. We love her too. Take good care of her.\" \"She's an impossible dream come true. I really do love her. You're Clete, right? I don't know how I could have gotten so lucky. She's right. I'd have known you guys anywhere. Rose called you the three most beautiful men there are. Hair like that. She said the big strawberry blond was Clete. Lane was the one with hair like moonlight and Dutch's was of spun gold. Supposed to tell you Snow White will see you in her dreams, Dutch. I don't think she quite knows what Sabbi sees in a chubby fellow like me without enough hair to cover. Neither do I. I'm babbling. Sorry.\" \"That's all right, Mike. We understand. Let me help you with that chair.\" \"Nah, I'll get it. You wait for your brother. The chair doesn't need you.\" Dutch watched Mike struggle through the door with the chair, then turned back to the lift. They both knew Lane was coming down. \"Lane was right, Clete, a nice guy.\" \"And he does love her. Feels real... almost ashamed about hurting Lane.\" \"Yes, and he'll be with her more than I would have been. Let's go.\" \"You all right, Lane?\" \"No, Dutch, but I'll limp along. One more hurdle.\" \"Lane, I'm sorry.\" \"Yeah, Mike. I know. We'll stop by in about twenty years to look at how you make her dreams come true.\" \"I'll do it, Lane. I really will. Oh, oh, here come the kids. Ice cream everywhere.\" \"Here, take my handkerchief. We'll see you when you've built her dream. Good-by.\" \"Good-by, Lane. I hope... Well, you know.\" \"Yeah. I know.\" Lane shook his hand and they walked away from where he was laughing and wiping ice cream off the faces of two pretty little girls. \"Take me to a bar. A loud, obnoxious, beer and whiskey bar. Several of them. Get me drunk and in a half dozen brawls. I promise I won't break anyone. No one will break me either. Unfortunately, that's already been done. I want a lady who's not one on each arm and one in my lap. I want to pass out sometime tomorrow and not dream. I want to wake up with such a bad hangover I can't think. Then I want to laugh at the thing that laughed at us. Dutch, I know where we're going. Adith. Pirates. Bad ones. Insane. The enemy is there. Got a strong hold on them.\" \"Sounds like it needs to be changed. Let's do it.\" \"I found a bar. A whole bunch of them. I can feel the wildness.\" \"Lead on, Clete. The three Gallant boys are going to cut loose.\" \"Done.\"",
