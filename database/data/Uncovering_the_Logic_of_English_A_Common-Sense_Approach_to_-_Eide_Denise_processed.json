Discover the method that Dr. Temple Grandin called \"really helpful for teaching reading to children who are mathematical pattern thinkers...\" \n\nFor the past 70 years students have needed to break the complex code of English without help. This has resulted in low literacy rates and highly educated professionals who cannot spell. The principles taught in Uncovering the Logic of English describe 98% of English words and eliminate the need to guess. \n\nSimple answers are given for questions such as: \n\n  * Why is there a silent final E in have? \n\n  * Why don't we drop the E in noticeable? \n\n  * Why is discussion spelled with -sion rather than -tion? \n\nAs the rules unfold it becomes apparent how this knowledge is vital to reversing the educational crisis that is plaguing America. This slim volume is easy to read and accessible to parents and classroom teachers.",

This book is a must read for anyone who cares about the future of our children and the welfare of our nation.” —Dr. Robert W. Sweet, Jr, President The National Right to Read Foundation “A gem of a book that brings light to the way in which words are read and spelled. This is a very useful book for teachers, parents and anyone interested in bringing the joy of reading to our nation’s children.” —Dr. Reid Lyon, Distinguished Professor of Education Policy, Southern Methodist University “Uncovering the Logic of English is a thoughtful guide for anyone who wants to understand language better or is looking for advice to help them teach it.” —Midwest Book Review “It looks fabulous—like a resource I’ve been looking for for about 15 years!” —Speech Therapist “The ‘thrust’ of this book might be better described if the title was changed to The Heartbreak of English: a Logical Means of Recovery.” —Jack Blackburn, Retired 3M Engineer “The best spelling and reading book ever!” —Teacher “A must-read for anyone involved in teaching literacy.” —Cathie Baier, Homeschool Speaker and Parent “This book is changing my life. If you struggle with reading, or know anyone that does, Uncovering the Logic of English is totally worth it!” —Allie Gower, Designer “I teach language arts to middle school students with autism. My literal, logical thinking students are frustrated daily by the seemingly endless exceptions to the rules of the English language. Until today, the only answer I ever had for them was, ‘The English language is full of exceptions to the rules. Be glad you are learning it as your native language and have had the benefit of years of immersion.’ This is of little comfort to them. I finally have a comprehensive list of the real rules of the English language! The best thing of all is that experts talk a lot about using the obsessions of students with autism to teach them. Most of my students are obsessed with rules (memorizing them, following them to the very literal letter, and making sure others follow them as well), so I am confident that they will enthusiastically devour and retain this information! For the first time since learning to diagram sentences in college, when parts of speech rules really clicked for me, I am excited to teach English!” —Jenny Lundgren, Middle School Teacher “Denise Eide’s book is outstanding! I could not put it down when I started reading it. Wish all schools could use it as a text.” —Sharon Campbell, Parent and Grandmother “Once it is understandably explained to you, the perceived illogical spelling system of the English language actually starts to make a lot of sense—and FUN! My first language is German—completely different spelling system—and I learned to read and write in English ‘the old way’. It did work alright, but I know, had I been taught the way described in Uncovering the Logic of English, it would have been SO much easier!” —Valerie Adomakoh, Parent, Non-Native English Speaker “I am a certified reading specialist and have been studying reading instruction for years, but most of the information in Eide’s book was completely new to me... If you are a parent or educator, this passage from Eide’s is a MUST-READ! She provides critical information and insights for all of us…” —Susan Kruger, M.Ed., Author of the best-selling book SOAR Study Skills and Founder of www.StudySkills.com",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Introduction A s I have spoken with people around the country, I have discovered a pervasive belief: English spelling is inconsistent, illogical, and, for some, impossible. This apparent “flaw” with English has caused deep frustration not only within our schools—public, private, and home—but through all levels of society. We have professionals who cannot spell, parents who cannot answer their children’s questions, and employers who are despairing at the low literacy rates of the workforce. Language, both spoken and written, is the foundation of all academics and the medium by which we conduct business, science, politics, and relationships. Without a firm grasp of our language, we sever the Achilles tendon of our society and of the individuals within it. The United States currently has one of the lowest literacy rates in the developed world. According to the Nation’s Report Card, 34% of fourth graders cannot read, and 68% are below proficient. 1 An astounding 68% of eighth graders test below grade level in reading. 2 These statistics continue on through the adult population; fully 48% of adults are not proficient in reading. 3 This is at a time in history when the economy demands more highly skilled workers each year, and competition in highly trained fields such as science and engineering is exploding worldwide. Not only do we need to increase literacy rates to stay competitive in a world economy, but illiteracy and remedial education cost our nation $536 billion each year 4 and are primary factors in both crime and poverty. 5 Teaching reading so that everyone succeeds is vital to the health of our society and our economy. The information contained in Uncovering the Logic of English is not new. You may be surprised to learn that, with some variations, the spelling rules and phonograms already are used with great success by dyslexia institutes and reading centers around our nation. For unknown reasons, this “intensive phonics” is saved almost exclusively for students who struggle. I simply cannot understand why material that effectively teaches almost all students 6 has been reserved for remedial reading centers. As a nation, we need to rethink how reading is taught in our schools and thereby prevent many children from needing outside help in the first place. As you read, I hope it becomes apparent that knowing the logic of English benefits everyone who uses this language. You, too, might shake your head at points in this book and say, “Why didn’t someone tell me this before?” In these pages, you will discover the answers to your long-held questions about English, and you will learn answers for your children as they are learning to read and spell. I have taught numerous reading and spelling classes ranging from 45 minutes to three days in length. The participants have included teachers from public and private schools, special education teachers, and homeschool parents. The response has been unanimous: “Why wasn’t I taught this in elementary school? It all makes so much sense!” Many professional teachers have told me after a one-hour presentation, “I learned more in one hour than in all my methods classes in graduate school.” With this information I am resoundingly confident that we can teach reading at a fraction of the cost, and with much higher success rates, than we currently do. To do so, it is essential that all students, all teachers, and all parents know the logic of English. The knowledge in this book is as basic to academic success as 1 + 1 = 2. Learning these basic concepts does not require expensive materials or a lot of resources. It simply requires teachers who know how English works and how students learn. When we combine the logic of English with strong methods, our whole society will reap the rewards economically, scientifically, educationally, and politically. Imagine a nation where 99% of third graders read at or above grade level and where our high schools are dominated not by students who are discouraged and frustrated but by confident young adults who are preparing to fulfill their life mission. Although I understand that, to some, reading a book of English rules might sound dull, I encourage you to let this book unfold the mystery of what may have seemed hopelessly chaotic. It will provide you with information you will be able to apply as soon as you sit down to write your next e-mail. You may also experience, as I do, that the coherence in the midst of complexity is more alluring than if it had been in plain sight all along. I hope you find this information as engaging and enlightening as I have and that you pass this book on to many others so that everyone can begin to understand the logic of English. Footnotes 1.

      "title": "The Problem of EngLish",
      "content": "The Problem of EngLish At the level of the written word, English is one of the most complex languages in the world. Due to this complexity, most English speakers do not know the basic building blocks of the language: the sounds, their corresponding written expressions, and the spelling rules that go with them. On the contrary, most English speakers are cynical about the language and readily dismiss it as a language of exceptions. But what if the problem is not the language itself but the rules we were taught? What if we could see the complexity of English as a powerful tool rather than a hindrance? Certainly, it is not as easy to learn to read and spell English as it is most other phonetic languages. Yet a finite number of tools unlock the mystery of 98% of the words in the English language. When these 104 tools are presented, nearly all students can succeed. Learning these tools also develops logic and higher-order thinking skills. When students learn to think systematically about English, a complex language, not only do they enhance their English language skills, but they also gain strategies by which to master foreign languages. To begin, we must understand the definition of word. Spoken words in all languages are formed by combining one or more sounds. This series of sounds carries meaning. Each sound is called a phoneme. English is comprised of 44 unique phonemes which combine together to form words. This presents the first problem: the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet are inadequate to describe the 44 spoken phonemes or sounds. To solve this discrepancy, English adds 48 multi-letter phonograms. A phonogram is a letter or combination of letters which represents one or more sounds. When we only teach children the alphabet, even if we include long and short vowel sounds, we give the false impression that English has only 31 sounds. This is the beginning of the prevailing confusion. To provide students with a more complete understanding of English they must master not only 26 letters but the 74 basic phonograms. The second problem with English is that the language contains immense variety and choice. The 44 sounds can be spelled in 74 basic ways, 25 of which make more than one sound. The fact that phonograms frequently say more than one sound results from the fact English words often shift in pronunciation when suffixes and prefixes are added. Consider the sounds of the A in vacate, evacuate, and vacation. In order to preserve the relationship in meaning between each of these words, the A represents three different sounds. Due to the unique challenges with spoken English, spellings are chosen to represent sound while preserving meaning. In other words, English is a morpho-phonemic language where the morphology or meaning of words is balanced with the phonemic representation of words, resulting in some phonograms representing multiple sounds. This means a student of English must learn all the sounds represented by each phonogram. The third problem is that phonograms alone do not unlock the mystery of English spelling. There are 30 spelling rules which interplay with the phonograms and affect the pronunciation and spelling of words. These rules apply to a vast majority of words and explain why they are spelled and pronounced in a particular manner. Without an understanding of these simple rules, some scholars have estimated English to have over 1,700 phonograms!1 The 30 rules that explain how the sounds interplay with one another bring order to the chaos. The fourth problem is that English is an amalgamation of languages. England’s location and history of occupation play a significant role in the development of modern-day English. It is beyond the scope of this book to describe the history of this development, but a few of the highlights are pertinent to our topic. From AD 43 to 410 the British Isles were occupied by Rome. This brought about a heavy influence of Latin. In fact, 90% of multisyllable words in English have Latin roots.2 After the Norman Invasion in 1066, the following 300 years of politics and trade were conducted in French. Many words in the English lexicon reflect this period. English is also influenced by Celtic, Norse, Anglo-Saxon, German, and increasingly other modern languages. Having grown with such rich influence, English has synonyms for most of its words, which allows for a tremendous range of meaning, precision, creativity, and expression. English is also a multi-cultural language. Words which represent objects, places, and peoples from other cultures are frequently brought into English while preserving spelling conventions from the language of origin. This history has misled many people to believe that English no longer follows patterns, which leads to the fifth problem plaguing English—the widespread assumption that English is illogical. In reality, the logic of English has been lost in the past 80 years to educators and the general public. The keepers of this knowledge remain a few reading centers, literacy specialists, dyslexia institutes, and researchers. Experts in these fields know that a majority of children who are presented with the whole picture of English, combined with solid methods, can succeed. Nevertheless, “intensive, systematic phonics” is often taught only as a last resort to those who have the resources to hire special tutors. It makes much more sense to provide all students with the knowledge needed to master English. After all, it is a complex code which many linguists do not understand. Why would we abandon our young students to solve a master puzzle like English on their own? Despite its complex phonetic system, many aspects of English are much simpler than other modern languages. English has a comparatively simple grammatical system. We do not need to memorize genders or conjugate adjectives. It has very little inflection and a comparatively short list of irregular verbs and plurals. It is helpful to remember that every language presents unique challenges to students; English is not alone. Learning to think logically about English develops minds which are more adept at meeting the challenges of other language systems. Learning 74 phonograms and 30 spelling rules is the most efficient route to mastering English. Put into perspective, English has the largest vocabulary in the history of the world. According to one count, there are more than 2 million words in the English lexicon.3 The average adult speaker knows between 40,000 and 60,000 words, with a well-educated adult mastering 200,000. Surely, the most efficient way to master such a large lexicon is to learn the 104 tools which together describe each of the words. Prior to the 1920s, reading was taught in a systematic manner, with students spelling their way into reading. A dramatic shift occurred during the educational reform movements of the 1920s and 1930s. Rather than beginning to teach reading with sounds and then using the sounds to build words, educators began with whole words. This became known as the Look-Say method. Students were required to memorize each word as an individual word picture. Today we refer to these as sight words. During this period, literacy rates plummeted, leading to the second reform movement: Whole Language. Educators blamed illiteracy on a lack of interest due to the repetitive nature of basal readers, such as Dick and Jane. Whole Language educators replaced boring readers with real books. They believed learning to read was much like learning to speak. Children who were surrounded with good books would naturally develop a love for reading and, with minimal guidance, be able to read. This inspirational hands-off approach was a disaster. In California, where whole language was mandated in 1987, the functional illiteracy rate soared to 60 percent.4 Nevertheless, both reforms have continued to influence how we teach English reading around the world. In the 1990s, a “new eclecticism” began as educators recognized the need for phonics in the classrooms. Eclectics teach reading “progressively.” They begin by teaching sight words and then progress to syllables and word families, followed by a smattering of phonics. In addition to the inconsistent and confusing nature of the eclectic approach, it does not teach English in a complete, systematic, and logical manner. The phonics that are presented are too little, too late, and disjointed. This method dangerously gives the impression that the logic of English is being taught while leaving glaring holes in content and continuing to employ many of the failed methods of the past, including a heavy reliance on sight words. When we teach sight words, we are effectively stripping the power of the code and asking students to memorize visual symbols for each word. Worse yet, the visual symbols have very little variation between words. How are children to memorize bag, beg, big, bog, and bug as different word pictures without knowledge of the code? They appear virtually the same. This is why so many children read the first letter and guess at the remaining word. Frequently, students taught with these methods make simple errors in reading because they are not able to handle the level of detail needed to decode the word correctly. Diane McGuinness, PhD, has shown that human memory is limited to approximately 2,000 individual symbols.5 Yet adult speakers of English need to master 40,000 to 200,000 words—an impossible task without the understanding of how to decipher the code. This is demonstrated by the fact that many of the adults who are functionally illiterate know between 1,000 and 2,000 sight words. Though these students were successful at the task presented to them—memorizing individual words—they are unable to use this knowledge to meaningfully decode new words and are thereby crippled from being able to read anything beyond the elementary level. This reality is reflected by what is commonly known as The Literacy Crisis. Footnotes 1. Nyikos, Julius. 1988. “A Linguistic Perspective of Functional Illiteracy.” The Fourteenth LACUS Forum 1987.

      "title": "The Literacy Crisis",
      "content": "The Literacy Crisis Our nation is facing a literacy crisis at all levels of the U.S. educational system. It is well-documented by the popular press, the United States government, and academia, and is felt by every teacher with whom I speak: public, private, and homeschool. The literacy crisis resonates deeply within our hearts. For even if we were among those who learned to read proficiently, we all have unanswered questions and frustrations with English. The difference between the literate and the illiterate is that the literate blame the problems on English, but the illiterate blame themselves. Both demonstrate misplaced blame. The problem is neither English nor individuals. The problem is that we cannot know what we were never taught. The statistics are both numbing and consistent. Thirty-two percent of fourth graders read well, 34% test below proficiency, and 34% cannot read.1 Every time I meet an elementary school teacher, I ask if this reflects their experience. They all say it does. One third grade teacher who attended my class said, “This is my last resort. My principal will not allow me to teach intensive phonics in the classroom, but I am paying for my own training and using my own money to buy the kids materials. I plan to close the door and teach the children the logic of English. It makes so much sense. If it works, I will tell my administration. If it does not, I am quitting. I cannot continue failing these kids year after year.” The devastating reality is that the situation does not improve as students age. An astounding 69% of our eighth grade students are reading below grade level.2 Twenty-six percent of eighth graders are functionally illiterate, meaning they do not possess reading and writing skills adequate to function in daily life.3 Forty-eight percent of adults are not proficient readers, while 22% are functionally illiterate.4 Only 3% of adults test at the highest level of reading proficiency.5 Even when the population is limited to college graduates, the news is not encouraging. Only 10% of college graduates read at a high level of proficiency, 15% are below proficient, while 4% are functionally illiterate.6 The greatest complaint by employers and educators is that workers are not adequately prepared in basic reading and writing skills.7 Their complaint reflects the reality that only 17% of working adults are both well educated and proficient in literacy skills.8 Devastatingly, the literacy crisis is occurring during a time in history when jobs are becoming increasingly technical and the need for highly skilled workers is continually rising. Certainly something is deeply wrong with how we are teaching reading. It is simply not conceivable that 22%–70% of our population has a reading disability. What is clear is that students who do not thrive in first, second, and third grade continue to struggle through adulthood. It has been shown that success in reading is not linked to IQ, nor is it a problem of poverty alone. Forty-five percent of children in middle and high income families are struggling. Adult illiteracy is, however, connected to almost every socioeconomic issue in the United States.9 Fifty percent of the chronically unemployed and 60% of inmates are illiterate.10 Eighty-five percent of all juveniles in the court system are illiterate.11 Low literacy levels cost between $106 and $238 billion per year in health care spending, $225 billion in nonproductivity in the workforce,12 $1.4 billion13 to provide remedial education for students who have recently completed high school, and $2.314 billion in lost earning potential. This is a tragedy of enormous proportions to our society and to the hearts and minds of those who struggle. Yet we have known all along how to prevent the ruinous effects of illiteracy. Rudolf Flesch wrote about it in 1955 in his classic book titled Why Johnny Can’t Read.15 Dr. Samuel Orton performed vital research in the 1920s and '30s on reading, and scholars such as Romalda Spalding and Anna Gillingham committed their lives to preserving and developing this work. Yet on the whole, little to no improvement has been made in the past 40 years.16 We should all be asking, “Why?!” Writers state that the problem stems from a variety of issues: student motivation, poverty, distractions, television, illiterate parents . . . even the recent financial crisis is blamed. The award-winning book, Let’s End Our Literacy Crisis, claims there is one problem affecting every student: the inconsistent, illogical spelling of English words.17 The author, Bob Cleckler, suggests that the only solution to our literacy crisis is to radically reform our spelling system. Although it is true that children in many non–English speaking countries learn to read easily because of the one-to-one correspondence between the sounds and letters, it is not necessary to develop a new writing system for English. English already is phonetic. There is a solution for those who struggle with reading, and it encompasses our current spelling system. Students and their teachers and parents need to learn how English really works. We do not need to live in crisis any longer. Researchers have demonstrated that virtually all children are able to learn to read English when taught correctly.18 Using brain imaging technology, scientists are now able to study how our minds work while reading. People who are skilled readers rely heavily on an area of the brain which is used for speech and auditory processing and is located in the back left side of the brain. When struggling readers attempt to read, their brains show inactivity in this critical auditory region. With as little as eight weeks of intensive phonics training, the brains of struggling students begin to develop, and previously inactive areas begin to function like those of good readers.19 Our brains are wired to learn. It is through solid phonics instruction that the brain develops pathways for reading. When reading is not taught correctly, many students do not make solid connections between phonograms (the pictures of the sounds) and phonemes (the sounds themselves). Instead, they appear to rely heavily on the visual center of their brain and areas which may be related to higher order thinking or guessing. Given the combination of the opaque nature of the English code and teaching methods that emphasize the visual, this is not surprising. For students who are auditory or kinesthetic learners instead of visual learners, the result can be debilitating. When the phonograms and rules of English are taught in a systematic manner through solid, multimodality teaching methods which develop visual muscle memory, prevent reversals, and address the needs of all types of learners, we will be on our way to solving the literacy crisis for all its current victims and preventing it in future generations. The logic of English needs to be taught from the very beginning of every child’s education so that everyone can succeed. Footnotes 1. The Annie E.

      "title": "Phonograms\nThe Building Blocks of Words",
      "content": "Phonograms The Building Blocks of Words As a society, we lack a basic grasp of English spelling. Countless highly educated professionals rely heavily on spell-checker. Yet even navigating this powerful tool can be cumbersome. Many adults need to guess multiple times before spell-checker even recognizes the word they desire to correct. Many also confess to sometimes abandoning the perfect word choice due to their inability to look it up. Knowledge of the building blocks of words, however, enables spell-checker to be used much more easily and reduces the need for it in the first place. English is a phonetic language, albeit very complex. To teach English well, we need to move away from teaching only the names of the 26 letters and some of their sounds to teaching the true phonograms of English. Phono means “sound” and gram means “picture.” A phonogram, therefore, is a picture that represents a sound. Phonograms may consist of one, two, three, or four letters and may represent from one to six sounds. Although most phonograms represent only one sound, a few represent a combination of two or three sounds. Lack of knowledge about English phonograms reduces the ability to decode unfamiliar words encountered in reading. To “help” students, many schools teach “reading strategies” rather than solid phonics. Reading strategies are a series of steps students are taught to use when they encounter an unknown word. One commonly taught strategy is to look at the first and last letters of the word and then guess. Another strategy is to reread the sentence and guess from the context. A third is to look at the pictures for clues. With solid, systematic phonics education, none of these “strategies” are needed. Instead, students are provided the necessary tools to decode words internally based upon the phonograms which construct the word. When we think of phonics, most of us think of simple examples such as “C-A-T” spells the sounds /k-ă-t/ in cat. The limited phonics we are usually taught only describes a small percentage of the language. It applies most consistently to easy, one syllable words. Most English words, however, have two or more syllables. Knowing all the phonograms and rules enables students to read a word such as homogeneous and understand each sound within the context of the word. (This word is explained on page 143.) When solid phonics education is combined with a foundation in the roots of words, often even the definition becomes apparent. Phonograms are the most basic building blocks of all words in a phonetic language. Many adults in the U.S. know how to spell tens of thousands of words, but they have no idea why they are spelled in a particular manner, especially large words. Most readers rely heavily on the first and last letters of a word, with the middle of the word left as a mystery. Knowing the most basic building blocks, and being able to recognize them within words, will enable students to decode any word. This is not an innate ability but rather a skill that easily can be taught to all English speakers. The first step is to learn the 74 basic phonograms. Phonograms can be divided into two broad categories: single-letter phonograms and multi-letter phonograms.",

      "title": "Single-Letter Phonograms",
      "content": "Single-Letter Phonograms The single-letter phonograms are represented by the letters A–Z. These are the phonograms everyone recognizes as forming English words. Nevertheless, students are rarely taught all their sounds. For example, consider the phonogram s. Most programs teach that s has one sound, /s/. However, this does not account for very simple words such as is, his, has, was, rise, and does. When incomplete phonics is taught, students who think more logically and literally decode is and his as /ĭs/ and /hĭs/ rather than /ĭz/ and /hĭz/. It is important to understand that these students are not wrong; they are doing exactly what they were told to do. Compounding the problem is the fact that s is added to English nouns to form the plural. Most plurals are pronounced /z/ such as chairs, cars, houses, tables, pencils, pens, papers, etc. When the plurals are considered, s says /z/ 70% of the time. Certainly a sound that occurs 70% of the time is not an exception. Both sounds should be taught clearly from the beginning. Logical/literal students are our future engineers, mathematicians, and scientists. When we tell them that s says /s/, they apply it to every s they see and quickly discover that most of the S’s do not say /s/. In fact, most of the letters do not sound anything like what they were told. This short-circuits their logical minds. Many of these students become discouraged by English. I am convinced this is one of the reasons that boys tend to struggle with reading more than girls. Many boys think logically and literally. Girls generally tend to be more intuitive. Logical students do not tolerate inconsistent rules. The smattering of phonics usually given to them is not only unhelpful; it is damaging. At a time in history when our economy relies on advancements in science and engineering, we cannot afford to impair these gifted citizens by not teaching them English in a manner that respects how their minds work. But why don’t all students struggle? The sounds /s/ and /z/ are an unvoiced and voiced pair, formed in the same way in the mouth. Many intuitive students do not notice the difference between the two sounds. Their lack of concern for detail enables them to decode the words properly without complete information. These students are rewarded by today’s methods. Though intuition is a great strength, their logical/literal counterparts who are attuned to detail should not be marginalized. Teaching both sounds right from the beginning allows all students to succeed and prevents student and teacher frustration by eliminating unnecessary “exceptions.” I have spoken to countless professionals who hated learning to read and write and now rely on others to proofread their written work. Yet all they needed to be successful in reading and writing was complete information. If they can learn advanced mathematics, physics, chemistry, business structures, and even other languages, they can easily learn the 104 pieces that explain English. One final word about learning phonograms. It is important for reading and spelling to learn the phonogram sounds before the letter names. If a student learns “SEE AYE TEE,” this does not tell the student how to read the word cat. Letter names are useful and necessary for looking up words in a dictionary, reading eye charts, reading initials in a person’s name, etc. However, the letter names do not tell the student anything about how a word is read or spelled. The names are best learned after the phonogram sounds have been internalized.

      "title": "Multi-Letter Phonograms",
      "content": "Multi-Letter Phonograms In addition to the 26 single-letter phonograms, English has 48 basic multi-letter phonograms for a total of 74. Multi-letter phonograms are fixed combinations of letters that symbolize one or more speech sounds. They may have two, three, or four letters and are called digraphs, trigraphs, and quadgraphs. It is these phonograms that are most commonly left out of incomplete phonics programs. Many schools do teach what they believe to be phonics. They teach most of the sounds for A–Z and sometimes even a few multi-letter phonograms such as sh, ch, and th. This level of teaching often misleads students into believing that they have been given the complete picture and there is nothing left to figure out. Many students also wrongly assume that phonics must have made more sense to others. Incomplete phonics leaves a lot of holes, discouraged hearts, confused minds, and a seemingly unlimited number of exceptions. For example, children who are not taught that igh is “three-letter /ī/” will often carefully sound out each letter in light (/l-ĭ-g-h-t/) and feel utterly mystified when you suddenly announce, “That says /l-ī-t/.” Simply teaching igh says /ī/ will give students the tool to correctly decode the word. I was taught that ch says /ch/. Until a few years ago, I had never realized that it actually says three sounds, /ch-k-sh/. The word school was always a complete mystery to me, not to mention Christmas. French words such as chef, machine, and crochet were at first difficult to read and later difficult to spell. Simply knowing all three sounds provided clarity where confusion had reigned. Many educators mistakenly believe that good readers read whole words rather than reading phonetically. The prevailing thought is that readers who sound out words are slow, and that fast readers have actually developed instant recognition of the whole word. This is some of the theory behind the Dolch List, a commonly used list of 250 sight words. However, recent research using functional MRI has shown that good readers are actually processing the sounds one at time, even though they perceive it as a whole word.1 It is just that the brain is so fast, it appears they are reading whole words. In reality, though, they are converting the letters on the page to sounds. These studies have shown that the brain learns to read the same way it learns to talk—one sound at a time. Once students get the hang of reading the sounds, they speed up until it appears to be instantaneous. As one researcher concluded, “The use of intensive phonics is the only way to teach dyslexics and learning disabled individuals how to read and is the best way for everyone to learn to read.”2 This type of research further demonstrates the importance of teaching the 74 basic phonograms to all English speakers. The 74 basic phonograms are the most essential because they are the ones needed to spell the most frequently used words in English. They explain 98% of English words and are vital building blocks. The 74 basic phonograms should be taught thoroughly and systematically to all students from the beginning. They should not be reserved only for struggling students who make it to specialized reading centers. Learning the 74 basic phonograms is the true foundation for literacy and spelling. Mastering the phonograms only occurs with regular practice over time. Just as students need to memorize math facts like 1+1=2, these phonograms need to be memorized as well. There are plenty of games and methods to contextualize this kind of drill and make it interesting, fun, and effective. For more ideas on how to teach the phonograms, see The Phonogram and Spelling Game Book.

      "title": "Advanced Phonograms",
      "content": "Advanced Phonograms When learning a complex language such as English, it is vital to study the most essential components first. English has an extensive vocabulary. Although no English speaker masters every word, everyone uses the most frequently used words. The 100 most frequently used words make up 50% of all written material, while the 300 most frequently used words make up 65%. This is because the most frequent words are basic grammatical words like the, is, has, have, was, could, etc. These words appear in every level of writing, from a simple children’s book to a doctoral thesis. The 74 basic phonograms are derived from the high frequency words. There are an additional 42 advanced phonograms listed in Appendix E. A phonogram may be classified as advanced if it does not occur early in high frequency word lists and if it represents a very limited number of words. Students who understand the 74 basic phonograms easily recognize advanced ones within words. Many of the advanced phonograms are related to the 74 basic phonograms. For example aigh says /ā/. This is advanced because the only word that uses this phonogram is straight. Students who know the phonogram ai, /ā/, easily decode aigh, because ai and aigh are clearly related. Footnotes 1.

      "title": "Consonants, Vowels, and Syllables\nWhat They Are and Why They Matter",
      "content": "Consonants, Vowels, and Syllables What They Are and Why They Matter Consonants and Vowels Most English speakers have memorized the vowels: A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. However, I have seldom met anyone who knows the definitions of vowel and consonant. It is also rare for people to know how this knowledge contributes to the formation of syllables. Fewer yet can explain how knowing these basics will help them spell and read. Nevertheless, understanding consonants, vowels, and syllables is essential to reading and spelling. First, what is a vowel? A vowel is a sound that is produced when the mouth is open and the sound is not blocked by the lips, teeth, or tongue. Vowels are sounds that can be sustained, as in singing, and controlled for volume. To say a vowel sound, we must open our mouths. It is this opening that forms syllables. Consonants on the other hand are sounds which are blocked by the tongue, teeth, or lips in some way. Most of them are difficult to sing or control for volume. It is very simple to identify consonants and vowels. Simply try to sing or shout the sounds. If a sound can easily be sung or shouted and your mouth is open, it is a vowel. For example, /ă/. This sound can be sung and shouted, and the mouth is open. If it cannot be sung or shouted, such as /b/, it is a consonant. Be careful to isolate the /b/ sound; it is not pronounced /bŭ/, which would be spelled with the two phonograms, b and u. Some students want to classify /m/ as a vowel, because it can be sung. The mouth, however, is closed. The definition of a vowel is that the mouth is open and the sound can be sustained, as if it were being sung. If you perform this simple test on all 74 phonograms, you will discover English has 15 vowel sounds. They are /ă, ā, ä, ĕ, ē, ĭ, ī, ŏ, ō, oo, ŭ, ū, ü, oi, ow/.1 Vowels are essential to language. To demonstrate this, try to yell for help without the vowel sound (/hlp/!). It is impossible. Vowels create the most difficulty for reading and spelling in English. This is partially due to the fact that English is a vowel-rich language. Moreover, English has 28 ways to write the 15 vowel sounds, and most of the vowel phonograms can make more than one of the 15 sounds. To make matters even worse, the vowels are what vary the most among dialects and are typically not pronounced clearly the way they are spelled. For more information on vowels, see Chapter 16.",

      "title": "Syllables",
      "content": "Syllables English is a rhythmic language. The rhythm is formed by syllables. A syllable is an uninterrupted segment of sound which is formed by the opening and closing of the mouth to form vowels. When we count the number of syllables, we are also counting the number of vowel sounds. Knowing how many syllables are in a word and where the syllable breaks occur greatly aids spelling. One of the easiest ways to learn to count syllables is to place your hand under your chin and count the number of times your mouth opens. If this fails, hum the word. For example: table would be hm-hm, whereas museum is hm-hm-hm. Because syllables are formed by vowels, every syllable has only one vowel sound you can hear. This does not mean that every syllable has only one single-letter vowel. Many of the vowels are multi-letter phonograms, which represent one vowel sound. For example, taunt has one vowel sound /ä/ written with the two letters A and U. Finally, every syllable must have a written vowel. In most words, L and R behave as typical consonants. However, the sounds /l/ and /r/ are similar to vowels in that they can be sustained. Though the sound is blocked by the tongue, there is less obstruction than with the other consonants. This means that /l/ and /r/ sometimes form a new syllable without a vowel sound. This occurs at the end of a word. Consider words such as ta-ble, waf-fle, a-cre, etc. Since every syllable must have a written vowel, a silent final E is added. See Chapter 7. Understanding the difference between a consonant and a vowel and knowing how to identify syllables is foundational to spelling. These concepts are built upon by the spelling rules and are essential to understanding the logic of English. Footnotes 1. Technically the long vowels /ā, ē, ī, ō, and ū/ as well as /oo/, /oi/, and /ow/ are diphthongs. A diphthong is two vowel sounds that are heard in one syllable. Since the average student of English associates long /ā/ as one vowel sound, for simplicity Uncovering the Logic of English also classifies diphthongs as one vowel, though in reality they represent two sounds.",

      "title": "Foundational Consonant Rules",
      "content": "Foundational Consonant Rules Most English speakers do not believe English has reliable spelling rules. Too often they were taught oversimplifications that only explained a small percentage of English words. For example, a commonly taught rule is “When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking.” Students are left wondering which sound of the first vowel should be used. Long /ē/ as in heat or short /ĕ/ as in head? This “rule” also does not account for words such as great, where the second vowel does the talking. These sorts of oversimplifications often generate more exceptions than words which follow the rule. Nevertheless, there are better rules which help to explain 98% of English words. These rules are carefully worded to provide clarity to the established patterns in English. There are three types of spelling rules:1) Rules that limit the usage of one or more given phonogram(s), 2) Rules that control how suffixes are added to words, and 3) Rules that explain which sound of a phonogram is heard based upon other patterns within the word. Letters may represent a sound, change the sound of another phonogram, or both at the same time. A diacritic is a phonogram that affects the sound of another phonogram by its proximity. For example, the silent final E in ripe informs the reader to read long /ī/ rather than short /ĭ/ as in rip. It is much more efficient to summarize diacritics as rules rather than to categorize each possibility as a new phonogram. English is not the only language in which the proximity of phonograms causes them to affect one another. In fact, some English rules, such as “C always softens to /s/ when followed by an E, I, or Y” (Rule 1), are found in most of the Latin-based languages. Knowing that these sorts of patterns are present in English teaches students to recognize them in other languages as well. The study of Latin has long been used as a tool to aid students’ understanding of how languages are structured at a sentence level. Likewise, the English language is an excellent vehicle for learning the word structure of languages. Think of English as a complex language puzzle. Once students discover the patterns and realize they are consistent, they will have the tools not only to read and spell in English, but to tackle other languages as well. This chapter covers the three foundational consonant rules. These simple rules clearly explain some of the most commonly misspelled words and resolve what are usually thought of as impossible exceptions. These rules continue to reappear in subsequent chapters as the reasons underlying other rules.",

      "content": "Rule 1 Do you know why picnic is spelled with a C at the end, but a K is added to picnicking? Or how about mimic and mimicking? I have asked the same questions to hundreds of teachers in the past few years. In my experience, less than 1% have answered it correctly, and fewer than 5% even knew we needed to add a K. We can clearly see how deeply broken our education system has become when the answer to this question is a rule which explains more than 9,000 words.1 Strong spellers typically rely on a word “looking right” to know if it is spelled correctly. These people are visual learners and frequently need to write down the word so they can see it. Picnicking and mimicking are examples where even strong visual learners struggle when they do not understand the rules of English. This first rule should be common knowledge to English speakers: Rule 1C always softens to /s/ when followed by E, I, or Y. Otherwise, C says /k/. Without the added K, picnicing would be pronounced /pĭc nĭ sĭng/, because the C says /s/ before an I. The K is inserted to protect the hard /k/ sound. The same is true of mimicking. Before we expand on what is occurring in picnicking and mimicking, we will explore the rule in more depth. First, C always softens to /s/ before E, I, and Y: center circus icy accent accident agency nitroglycerin ancillary cynicism Next, let’s consider when C says its hard sound. C says /k/: - before the other vowels: A, O, U: cat cot cut California balcony speculate abdicate abscond culinary - before a consonant: clap cranberry enacting - at the end of the word: arc pathetic acoustic This rule explains simple words and complex words. Once you know it, you will begin to see it everywhere. It greatly clarifies how to read words that contain a C, for it clearly explains when C will say /k/ and when it will say /s/. It also clearly explains why, in words such as circus, cycle, and accent, C can say both /k/ and /s/. This knowledge is also useful for spelling. Last week a seven-year-old I tutor used this rule to correct her own spelling. She was writing the word make. She initially wrote mace. She paused, then unprompted, erased the C and replaced it with a K. She saw that the C said /s/ before the E and knew that she needed to use K instead. The same process this young student used can be applied to words at all levels of English vocabulary. Let’s return to the word picnicking. Knowing C says /s/ only before E, I, and Y also aids us when adding the common endings -ing, -ed, and -y to words which end with C. We must add K to protect the C from softening to /s/.

Arcing, soccer—In these two words, the C is before an I or E and would normally soften to /s/. However, the hard /k/ sound is retained. Celtics—Although we commonly pronounce this word /kĕl-tĭks/ when referring to something from the Celtic culture, our pronunciation conforms to the spelling rule when we refer to the sports team the Boston Celtics. Caesar—This word is derived from Latin and is spelled using the advanced phonogram ae which says /ē/. Though the C is before a written A, it is followed by the sound /ē/ and likewise softens to /s/. Cello, ciao—These are both Italian words. Italian words also soften the C before an E and I; however, the soft form in Italian is /ch/. This pronunciation was retained.

      "title": "Foundational Vowel Rules",
      "content": "Foundational Vowel Rules English is a challenging language to spell and read, primarily due to the vowels. There are three difficulties with vowels. First, we have been misled to believe English has only 10 vowel sounds: short and long sounds for A, E, I, O, and U. In reality, English has 15 vowel sounds and 28 written phonograms which represent these sounds. Second, 16 of the vowel phonograms say more than one sound. Third, it is the vowel sounds that are most distorted in speech, vary the most between dialects, and often shift in pronunciation with the addition of prefixes and suffixes. Thankfully, there are rules which govern some of the vowels. These rules are foundational and help to explain a majority of English words. Vowel rules play two primary roles: first, they determine which vowel sound will be heard within a given word. Second, they limit the usage of particular vowel spellings. Before we continue, let’s review the definition of a vowel. A vowel is a sound that is produced with an open mouth. Vowels can be sustained, as in singing, and controlled for volume. Each of the single-letter vowels A, E, I, O, and U represents a long and short vowel sound. A, O, and U also make a third sound which is called the broad sound (see Table 4). Together the single vowels represent 13 vowel sounds. English also has a mysterious single letter vowel commonly learned as “sometimes Y.” Y is both a consonant and a vowel. It has four sounds /y-ĭ-ī-ē/ which we can categorize as consonants or vowels through the singing test. Because /y/ cannot be sung, it is a consonant sound. Since we are able to sing /ĭ/, /ī/, and /ē/, these are vowel sounds. In addition, though it is not commonly known, I also acts as both a vowel and a consonant. In words where I is saying the sound /ĭ/, /ī/, and /ē/, it is a vowel. In words such as onion and behavior where it says the /y/ sound, I is actually acting as a consonant. Table 4: Single-Letter Vowels Phonogram Sound Examples a /ă-ā-ä/ mat table father e /ĕ-ē/ tent be i /ĭ-ī-ē/ it ivy stadium o /ŏ-ō-oo/ on go do u /ŭ-ū-oo-ü/ up pupil flute1 put y /ĭ-ī-ē/ gym by baby English also has 22 multi-letter vowel phonograms. These are isolated in Table 5. Twelve of these make only one sound, five make two sounds, and the other five make three or more sounds.

Rule 3English words do not end in I, U, V, or J. At first glance, this rule may not appear particularly significant. Yet it is a thread woven throughout the phonograms, the silent final E rules, and rules for adding suffixes. Knowing this simple rule brings clarity to spelling and decoding. First we will consider the ramifications of the fact that English words do not end in I, and then we will explore the impact of words not ending in U. At the end of the chapter, we will consider some exceptions and how the rule provides insight into these words. The rule that English words do not end in I governs one of the most intricate relationships in English: the relationship between I and Y.

Before you throw the rule out as another example of inconsistent phonics, however, it is important to listen to the rule closely. English words do not end in I or U. This is vitally important because most of the words which are “exceptions” are actually foreign words which have been brought into the language. Even young students become very adept at noticing these words. One six-year-old girl cried out to her mom as they were driving, “Look, Mom, Jujitsu! That’s not an English word!” She was right. Knowing this rule greatly aids spelling of native English words and heightens our awareness that English is a multicultural language. Knowing that English words do not end in I or U cues us to ask, “What is the origin of the word?” In addition it helps us realize the word may not behave like native English words when adding suffixes. Here are a few examples of words that are exceptions and their origins. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Most of the words refer directly to other cultures and therefore retain foreign spellings.

Unfortunately, most English speakers can identify only one reason for a single vowel to say its long sound: before a silent final E. Nevertheless, silent E’s are not the most common reason. When incomplete phonics is taught, students are left believing they have all the possible tools, only to find that the tools do not work. This next rule explains the most common reason for a single vowel to say its long sound. It applies to hundreds of thousands of words. Rule 4A E O U usually say their names at the end of a syllable. fa mous de sire o pen u nit ba sin be fore ro bot hu man Conversely, this means vowels usually say their first or short sound when they are found in the middle of the syllable. Syllables always divide between double consonants. Since the vowel is no longer at the end of the syllable, the vowel says its short sound. Knowing this rule helps to clarify many commonly mispronounced and misspelled words. ta per tap per be low bel low to paz top ple cu bic cub by Did you notice that the last rule covered all the single letter vowels except I and Y?

Many people are surprised to discover that the letter I may also say the long /ē/ sound. This occurs in only two places. First, at the end of a syllable that is followed by a vowel such as: sta di um ra di us o lym pi an ra di ator he li um pi an o Second, I may say the long /ē/ sound at the end of foreign words.

      "content": "The Mystery of the Silent Final E's Solved! Silent final E’s are one of the most frustrating aspects of English. They seem to appear out of nowhere. Everyone knows that they are used to make the vowel sound long, but there are at least as many silent final E’s that do not affect the vowel. For new readers this is terribly confusing. We teach the rule “The vowel says its name because of the E,” and the first real book the child reads is riddled with apparent exceptions: have, dance, give, love, move, loose, and on and on. We seem to be constantly telling new readers, “That is an exception.” When I taught my intuitive daughter to read, she seemed to blow past all these “exceptions” without concern. She used the inconsistent rules as an approximation and proceeded to memorize each individual word. Since she does not have a photographic memory, this caused her a great deal of trouble with spelling. On the other hand, my logically and literally minded students consistently applied the only silent final E rule I taught them—“The vowel says its name because of the E”—until they proved to themselves and to me that I was wrong. Then they lost interest in reading. In addition to causing headaches for decoding, silent E’s represent two of the most common spelling mistakes. Many students think E’s are randomly tacked to the end of words, so they add extras ad hoc. Other students forget to add E’s where they are needed. What is the solution? Fortunately, knowing the reasons for adding silent final E’s simplifies both decoding and spelling. These rules are powerful tools which most students, educators, and even linguists do not know. Yet knowing the purpose for silent final E’s revolutionizes spelling and reading! In the following pages I will introduce nine types of silent final E’s. They are listed in the order of frequency. The first four types explain a majority of silent final E’s and are the most important for young students. To highlight what is occurring within each word, the reason for the E is in bold, the silent final E is underlined twice, and a small number corresponding to the type of E is written next to the word.",

      "content": "Type 2: V and U Before learning these rules, my engineering-minded students applied the rule The vowel says its name . . . to every silent E they encountered. This caused them to consistently misread words such as give: /gīv/. Though I corrected them, each time they encountered a non–Type 1 silent E word, they misread it. I became concerned when they were not able to recognize words after seeing them hundreds of times. I had been taught that phonics is a crutch that supports the brain as it moves to reading sight words. However, these students did not master reading when I tried to force them to memorize each word. Rather, they became increasingly frustrated with themselves, with me, and with English as they tried to apply inconsistent rules. However, once they were provided with phonograms and rules which worked, it was only a matter of time (for some only a few weeks) before they were able to decode fluently. It appeared as if they were reading sight words, but now they had the tools to sound out the words efficiently. I experienced exactly what the latest brain research has told us about how the brain reads. The best readers decode every word, almost instantly.2,3 The brain is simply not able to memorize thousands of “sight words.”4 Learning all the reasons for silent final E’s is one of the simplest and most helpful boosts for students struggling with reading and spelling.

Do you see a pattern? have2 live2 valve2 mauve2 additive2 adjective2 true2 blue2 argue2 value2 rescue2 venue2 Which consonant spelling rule dictates the need for a silent final E within these words? These words are not exceptions. The need for the E is related to the consonant spelling rule: English words do not end in I, U, V, or J. This is summarized by the Type 2 reason for a silent final E: Rule 12.2English words do not end in V or U. Notice that without the E, words such as hav and giv can be sounded out just fine. The E is not present to change the pronunciation but to prevent the words from ending in V. Without the E, words such as tru and blu also sound just fine. Since A, E, O, U usually say their name at the end of the syllable, each will end in the long /ū/ sound. The E is not needed to clue pronunciation; rather, it prevents the words from ending in U. Knowing that English words do not end in V or U greatly reduces the amount of rote memory work for spelling. From now on, whenever you hear /v/ or /ū/ at the end of the word, add a silent E. This rule also provides answers about how to decode words that end in V silent E and U silent E.",

      "title": "Adding Suffixes to Silent Final E Words",
      "content": "Adding Suffixes to Silent Final E Words Now the fun begins. The next rule helps even the best visual spellers by de-mystifying some of the most commonly misspelled words such as courageous and chargeable. When you know the reason for the silent final E within a given word, you will be able to use this knowledge to decide if the E needs to be kept or dropped when adding a suffix, thereby eliminating some of the most problematic exceptions to the language. In my elementary days, I learned the rule: “Drop the E and add -ing.” This helped me to correctly spell living, but it didn’t help me spell forcible correctly. Some people learned a better version: “Drop the E when adding a vowel suffix.” This rule explains words such as styling but leaves chargeable as an exception. Here is a concise rule which provides the best explanation: Rule 13Drop the silent final E when adding a vowel suffix only if it is allowed by other spelling rules. This rule leads us to two questions that must be asked when adding a suffix to silent final E words: Are we adding a vowel suffix? Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules?, e.g. C says /s/ before E, I, and Y. G may say /j/ before E, I, and Y. The E may be dropped only if the answer to both questions is “yes.” If the answer is “no” to either question, the E must be retained. Are we adding a vowel suffix? First, silent final E words only lose the need for the E when adding a vowel suffix. A vowel suffix is an ending that begins with a vowel. For example: -able, -ing, -ed, -ish, and -y. In contrast, a consonant suffix begins with a consonant. For example: -ly, -ness, -ful, -hood, and -ment. In the following examples, notice why the E is needed and that it is always retained when adding a consonant suffix. like1 + ly = likely achieve2 + ment = achievement force3 + ful = forceful puz zle4 + ment = puzzlement amuse5 + ment = amusement awe6 + some = awesome Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? Second, we must know if the E is needed to make the word conform to other spelling rules. The rules we need to be concerned about are: C says /s/ before E, I, and Y. G may say /j/ before E, I, and Y. Consider each of the following examples, and ask the questions for each word. like1 + ing = liking have2 + ing = having puz zle4 + ing = puzzling owe6 + ing = owing hope1 + ing = hoping achieve2 + ed = achieved tease5 + ing = teasing teethe5 + ing = teething In each of these words, both of the key questions may be answered with “yes.” The added suffix begins with a vowel, and the E is not needed for a C or G. So the E may be dropped. Carefully consider the following examples. notice3 + ing = noticing service3 + ed = serviced Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “Yes.” In this group of words the E may be dropped because the C will still say /s/ before the I and E. When a word has a silent final E to make a C say /s/, it is vital when adding a vowel suffix to determine if the E needs to be retained to keep the C soft. Remember, C says /s/ only before E, I, or Y. This interplay of rules explains many commonly misspelled words. Carefully consider the following examples using the questions for adding a suffix to silent final E words. notice3 + able = noticeable service3 + able = serviceable Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “No, without the E the C would say /k/.” Therefore, the E is retained. This same principle applies to words that have a silent final E to soften the G. Remember, G may say /j/ only before E, I, or Y. Consider the following examples: encourage3 + ing = encouraging charge3 + ing = charging advantage3 + ed = advantaged Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “Yes, the G will still says its soft sound.” Then drop the E and add the suffix. Now, consider the following words using the questions for adding a suffix to silent final E words. charge3 + able = chargeable advantage3 + ous = advantageous courage3 + ous = courageous Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “No.” Without the E the G would say /g/. Then do not drop the E.",

      "content": "True Exceptions Although these rules are extremely consistent and help to explain tens of thousands of words, there are a few exceptions. They are, though, truly exceptional! These are the only known exceptions. Type 1 Ninth and wholly—In nine and whole the E is needed to make the vowel say its name. In these words, the E is dropped even though we are adding a consonantsuffix. It is retained according to the rule when adding the consonant suffixes -ty and -some in the derivatives ninety and wholesome. Mileage—In the root word mile the E is needed to make the I say its name. In this word the E is not dropped even though we are adding the vowel suffix -age. Closeable, rideable, sizeable, microwaveable—In the root words close, ride, size, and microwave the E is needed to make the vowel say its name. In these words the E is not dropped even though we are adding the vowel suffix -able. Type 2 Truly, duly, and argument—In base words true, due, and argue the silent final E is needed to prevent U from being at the end. In these words the E is dropped even though we are adding consonant suffixes to form truly, duly, and argument. The E is retained, however, according to the rule in the derivative trueness. Type 4 Acreage—The root word acre has a silent final E because every syllable must have a vowel. In this case, the silent final E is retained because the suffix -age forms a new syllable and would leave the second syllable of a cre age without a vowel. This is the only known word where the E is retained for the syllable. Type 6 Awful—The root word awe has a silent E to add length to the word. The silent final E is dropped when adding the consonant suffix -ful to form awful. It is retained, however, in the derivative awesome. Type 8 Sometimes the E is retained when adding a vowel suffix in order to clarify homophones. Silent E Retained Homophone dye + ing = dyeing die + ing = dying singe + ing = singeing sing + ing = singing Other Judgment, acknowledgment—The root words judge and knowledge both end with the multi-letter phonogram dge. Nevertheless, in standard American spelling the E is dropped when adding the consonant suffix -ment. The E is retained in the standard British spellings judgement and acknowledgement.",

      "content": "Words Ending in One Vowel and One Consonant Adding suffixes is a common area of confusion for many people. As we saw in chapter 7, silent final E words change when adding a vowel suffix. Likewise, words ending in one vowel followed by one consonant change when adding a vowel suffix. Most English writers recognize that consonants are doubled when adding suffixes to certain words. Some learned the rule “double the last consonant after a short vowel sound.” This rule works for words like hopping, tapping, forgetting, and referring, but what about words such as controlling and wainscotting where the vowel sound is long? It also does not explain words such as opening, medalist, and preference which do not double the consonant after a short vowel sound. In addition, many people confuse word pairs such as hopping and hoping, and twined and twinned. Many adult speakers not only struggle to spell these words but are also unable to accurately read them out of context. Much to their embarrassment, many writers choose the wrong one when using spell-checker. Before exploring how to add suffixes to words ending in one vowel + one consonant, we must first learn about accent. When I was in school, I did not understand why we learned about accented syllables. Nevertheless, accent is foundational to both pronunciation and, as I will demonstrate shortly, spelling.",

      "content": "Accent Within Words Many people struggle to hear accent correctly. Is it TA ble or ta BLE? They think they cannot hear a difference. Consider, however, the following sentences. In these words, the difference in accent is clear, for it is the difference in accent that distinguishes meaning. Put the ob' ject on the table. I ob ject' to that statement. The accented syllable is the one that is said a bit louder or more strongly than the others. Before analyzing words for accent, try the following experiment. Place your hand under your chin. Then whisper “help.” Now say “help” a bit more loudly. Then say it louder and louder until you are shouting. What happens to your mouth as you get louder? It opens wider, and the chin drops down farther. This same principle can be used to locate the accented syllable within a word. Because the accented syllable is the loudest, the mouth opens the farthest to say the accent. Therefore, the easiest way to find the accented syllable is to put your hand under your chin and say the word naturally. Use it in a sentence if needed. Feel on which syllable your chin drops down the farthest. That is the accented syllable. Find the accented syllable in the following words. Place your hand under your chin and say each word naturally. Notice on which syllable the jaw drops open the farthest. equip cancel offer accent The mouth drops open on the bold syllables: equip, cancel, offer, accent. A second tip is that prefixes and suffixes are rarely accented. Consider the following words. Feel the chin movement. The accent is on the base word. return resell needed singing The accents are as follows: return, resell, needed, singing. One distinctive of English speech is that any vowel in an unaccented syllable may be pronounced as the schwa or /ә/ sound, whereas the vowel sound is clearly pronounced in the accented syllable. a bout' ә bout les' son les sәn The schwa /ә/ is an unaccented vowel which sounds very similar to short U /ŭ/. Hold your hand under you chin and say /ә/. Then compare it to the other vowel sounds by saying: /ә ă ә ā ә ä ә ĕ ә ē ә ĭ ә ī ә ŏ ә ō ә oo ә ū/. You will notice your mouth drops open farther when pronouncing the other vowel sounds. Knowing about schwa sounds is an aid to identifying the accented syllable. To find the accented syllable, locate the syllable with the clearly pronounced vowel. Feel your chin and listen for the clearly pronounced vowel sounds in the following words. away extra pencil button The accents are on the clearly pronounced vowels: away, extra, pencil, button.",

Before introducing the questions which help us apply this rule, we need to understand the definition of one vowel + one consonant words. Rule 14 only applies to words with one vowel that is seen and heard. This means only words using the single vowels a, e, i, o, u, y. mad +en = madden let + ing = letting big + est = biggest stop + ing = stopping pup + y = puppy Rule 14 does not apply to base words ending with multi-letter vowel phonograms such as: ee, ea, ai, etc., followed by one consonant. sleep +ing = sleeping treat + ed = treated restrain + ing = restraining appear + ance = appearance Double the last consonant only after one consonant that is seen and heard. fad + ish = faddish pet + ing = petting sup + er = supper Do not double the last consonant if the word ends in more than one consonant. pick + ing = picking sing + ing = singing arrest + ing = arresting comb +ed = combed Do not double the last consonant if the word ends in x. The phonogram x represents two heard consonant sounds: /k/ and /s/. tax + ing = taxing fix + ed = fixed relax + ing = relaxing The multi-letter phonogram qu represents the sound /kw/. Q always needs a U; U is not a vowel here. Since the U is not a vowel but part of a multi-letter phonogram, double the last consonant before adding a vowel suffix if the word conforms to Rule 14. quit +ing = quitting quiz + ed = quizzed Likewise the phonograms ow, aw, and ew are multi-letter vowel phonograms. W is not a consonant in these phonograms, just as U is not a vowel in the phonogram qu.

Is the syllable before the suffix accented?* *One-syllable words are always accented. If the answer to both questions is “yes,” double the last consonant and add the suffix. If the answer to either question is “no,” just add the suffix. Are we adding a vowel suffix? First, double the last consonant only when adding a vowel suffix. A vowel suffix is an ending that begins with a vowel. For example: -able, -ing, -ed, -ish, and -y. In contrast, a consonant suffix begins with a consonant. For example: -ly, -ness, -ful, -hood, and -ment. In the following examples, notice that the last consonant is not doubled when adding a consonant suffix. mad + ly = madly ship + ment = shipment com mit + ment = commitment for get + ful = forgetful e quip + ment = equipment Is the syllable before the suffix accented? Second, in order to apply this rule correctly to all words, we must know which syllable is accented. Double the last consonant only if the accent in the new derivative word is on the syllable before the suffix. Carefully consider the following words using the questions for adding a suffix. hop + ing = hop' ping rob + er = rob' ber swim + er = swim' mer cut + ing = cut' ting pin + ing = pin' ning ship + ing = ship' ping Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is the accent on the syllable before the suffix? “Yes.” Therefore, double the last consonant before adding the vowel suffix. The syllable before the suffix is always accented in one-syllable words. Therefore, the consonant is always doubled when adding a vowel suffix to one-syllable words ending in one vowel + one consonant. One way to simplify this rule for young students is to begin with one-syllable words and leave out the question of accent. In multisyllable words, on the other hand, it is vital to listen for (or feel)1 the accent. Compare each of the pairs carefully. In the first word, the syllable before the suffix is accented. Therefore, the consonant is doubled. In the second word, the syllable before the suffix is not accented. Therefore, the consonant is not doubled. medal + ion = me dal' lion medal + ist = med' al ist omit + ing = o mit' ting limit + ing = lim' it ing prefer + ing = pre fer' ring prefer + ence = pref' er ence confer + ing = con fer' ring confer + ence = con' fer ence Consider the following examples. As you ask yourself the questions, I encourage you to take time to perform the chin test for each word and observe how the accent affects the spelling. forget + ing = for get' ting commit + ee = com mit' tee rebel + ion = re bel' lion begin + er = be gin' ner equip + ing = e quip' ping occur + ed = oc curred' control + ing = con trol' ling Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is the accent on the syllable before the suffix? “Yes.” Then double the last consonant before adding the suffix.

Take a moment to notice how many of the previous examples would be misspelled if the accent were not considered. These are just a few of the thousands of words that are affected by accent.

      "title": "Adding Suffixes to Single Vowel Y Words",
      "content": "Adding Suffixes to Single Vowel Y Words Words ending in single vowel Y are the final type of words that change when adding a suffix. The rule that governs words ending in Y is straightforward and easy to learn. It also explains some of the most frequently misspelled words such as business.1 As we have begun to show in chapter 6, there is a deep relationship between I’s and Y’s in English. There are four ways in which I’s and Y’s are related. First, they share three vowel sounds /ĭ-ī-ē/ and one consonant sound /y/. Second, since English words do not end in I, Y stands in its place at the end of words. Third, there are multi-phonogram pairs ending in I or Y which may or may not be used at the end of words. Fourth, as most of us know, Y’s change back to I’s when adding suffixes. Many English speakers feel confused about when the Y will change back to I. Others wonder why the Y remains in the words applying and employs but changes in application and theories. Here is a clear rule which explains when the Y changes to I. Rule 15Single vowel Y changes to I when adding any ending, unless the ending begins with I. This rule leads us to two questions that must be asked when adding a suffix to words ending in Y: Does it end with a single vowel Y? Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? If the answer to both questions is “yes,” change the Y to I and add the suffix. If the answer to either question is “no,” just add the ending. Does it end with a single vowel Y? First, it is vital to understand that this rule only applies to a single vowel Y. The multi-letter phonograms oy, ay, andey are two-letter vowels. The Y does not change to I when adding a suffix to words ending with a multi-letter phonogram. Consider each of the following words. boy + s = boys stray + ed = strayed survey + ed = surveyed annoy + ed = annoyed play + er = player attorney + s = attorneys Does it end with a single vowel Y? “No.” Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? Using the questions for adding a suffix to words ending with Y, consider each of the following words. busy + ness = business try + es = tries cry + er = crier worry + some = worrisome ornery + est = orneriest happy + ness = happiness puppy + es = puppies baby + es = babies salary + es = salaries cuddly + er = cuddlier Does “busy” end with a single vowel Y? “Yes.” Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? “Yes.” Therefore, change the Y to I before adding the suffix. Since English words do not end in I, Y acts as a stand-in for I at the end of the word. When a suffix is added, the I is no longer at the end. Therefore, the Y changes back to I. This occurs with any ending, unless the ending begins with I, because: Rule 16Two I’s cannot be next to one another in English words. With this in mind, consider the following examples: study + ing = studying cry + ing = crying worry + ing = worrying clarify +ing = clarifying baby + ish = babyish simplify + ing = simplifying Does it end with a single vowel Y? “Yes.” Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? “No.” Therefore, keep the Y before adding the suffix.",

This tool will direct you as to which rules to apply to various words when adding an ending. To add a suffix to any word, first ask the three questions in the first box.

      "content": "The Power of the Latin Spellings of /SH/ The three Latin spellings of /sh/, ti, ci, and si, are some of the most powerful phonograms for reading and spelling. Many students begin to plateau in their reading levels after learning to read simple one- and two-syllable words. Yet knowing these three phonograms helps to unlock the mystery of thousands of multisyllable words. The Latin spellings of /sh/ also expose an area where most English students are taught a gross oversimplification: most students learn only the ending -tion. Many programs teach the ending -tion by showing a pattern of words such as exception, addiction, promotion, repetition, prohibition, etc. These programs conveniently leave out words such as: dietitian physician partial facial confession division recession transfusion These words sound the same but are spelled differently. This sort of teaching gives an oversimplistic impression of the language and breeds confusion, whereas knowing that the phonograms ti, ci, and si each say /sh/ greatly simplifies decoding. The Latin spellings of /sh/, ti, ci, and si, are frequently found in advanced words in the English lexicon. They commonly appear with the seven suffixes shown in the chart below. Table 9: Suffixes Used with the Latin Spellings ti ci si -al torrential commercial controversial -an Egyptian clinician Russian -ary penitentiary judiciary -ate negotiate appreciate prussiate -ent quotient sufficient -on exception coercion recession -ous cautious delicious It is also important to know that si represents a voiced/unvoiced pair: the unvoiced /sh/ as in recession and the voiced /ZH/ as in division. The Latin spellings of /sh/ are one of the most valuable spelling tools. We can often determine which Latin spelling of /sh/ will be used in a particular word by considering the root word. Study the words in the following charts. The patterns are amazing. Notice that when a root word ends in t, the phonogram ti is formed in the derivatives. The parallel occurs in words ending in c where the phonogram ci is formed and words ending in s, which form the si phonogram in the derivatives. Table 10: Latin Roots Using TI elect + ion = election confident + ial = confidential Egypt + ian = Egyptian penitent+ iary= penitentiary different + iate = differentiate quote + ient = quotient infect + ious = infectious Table 11: Latin Roots Using CI race + ial = racial physic + ian = physician office + iary = officiary suffice + ient = sufficient face + ial = facial Table 12: Latin Roots Using SI discuss + ion = discussion controversy + al = controversial progress + ion = progression manse + ion = mansion Once English speakers give up on the fallacy that English is illogical and begin to notice the patterns in English, they will begin to develop strategies that aid in understanding the language instead of simply memorizing individual words. Analyze the following words and see if you can determine why the voiced form /ZH/ is heard in each. Hint: the reason is consistent in all the words.",

      "title": "Decoding Past Tense Verbs",
      "content": "Decoding Past Tense Verbs English has a wonderfully simple way to form the past tense. Simply add the past tense ending ed. This is summarized by the rule: Rule 19To make a verb past tense, add the ending ED unless it is an irregular verb. The past tense ending ed says three sounds: /ĕd-d-t/. Recently, I was listening to an emerging reader sound out the word cooked. She read, “Cook Ed?” She looked very confused. Fortunately, knowing the three sounds of ed and why the variations exist provides a clear understanding of what is occurring and how to read past tense words. The same is true with spelling. To spell the word matched accurately, the writer must understand that this is the past tense form and that though /t/ is heard, it is spelled with the past tense ending ed. The sounds of ed, /ĕd-d-t/, vary depending upon the final sound heard in the base word. Due to its high frequency, as well as the fact that it has three sounds, ed is best learned and memorized as a phonogram. It is possible to discover which sound will be heard in a word by analyzing the patterns. Examine the words below. What is similar between each of the roots that causes the ed to be pronounced /ĕd/? ed e2d e3d hand hand ed demand de mand ed land land ed herd herd ed Each of the words ends with /d/. Since it is impossible to clearly say /hănd-d/, the vowel sound /ĕ/ is inserted. This prevents the tongue from tripping and ensures the past tense ending is clearly heard in speech. As a result of the added /ĕ/ sound, a second syllable is formed. Look at the next group of words. What is the pattern? ed e2d e3d count count ed support sup port ed plant plant ed digest di gest ed Each of the words ends in /t/. Once again our tongues would trip over the sounds /t-d/ next to one another. Therefore the vowel /ĕ/ is inserted and another syllable is heard. This next group is a bit trickier. See if you can find the pattern. All the roots have something in common so that ed, past tense ending, says /d/. ed e2d e3d play playe2d storm storme2d excuse excuse2d owe owe2d perceive perceive2d Each of these words ends in a voiced sound, and therefore, /d/, the voiced sound, is used when pronouncing the past tense ending. Since /d/ is easily and clearly articulated after each of these endings, the vowel sound /ĕ/ is not needed. Find the common factor between each of the base words causing ed to say its third sound /t/. ed e2d e3d stamp stampe3d match matche3d finance finance3d thank thanke3d Each of these words ends with an unvoiced sound, therefore the unvoiced pronunciation /t/ is used. If you try to pronounce the voiced /d/ at the end of each word, you will notice it is difficult to switch from an unvoiced sound to the voiced /d/. This is summarized by the following rule: Rule 20ED, past tense ending, forms another syllable when the base word ends in /d/ or /t/. Otherwise, ED says /d/ or /t/.",

      "content": "Exceptions There are no known exceptions to the pronunciation of the past tense ending ed described in Rule 20. Many people, however, claim irregular verbs are exceptions to forming the past tense. They often use irregular verbs as an example to prove how crazy the English language is. We have all heard jokes such as “If today I dive and yesterday I dove, why is it not, today I live and yesterday I love?” English is not alone in its plethora of irregular verbs. According to one source, English has 178 irregular verbs, whereas Modern Greek has over 500, Italian over 400, Icelandic 350.1 Memorizing irregular verb forms is a part of learning languages, particularly European languages. Nevertheless, most of the irregular verbs in English follow patterns. Knowing how to analyze language by looking for patterns and understanding the phonograms and rules greatly simplifies memorizing irregular verbs. We will consider six variations of irregular verbs below. (1) Many irregular verbs do not change in the past or participle form. Present Simple Past Past Participle bet bet bet burst burst burst cast cast cast cost cost cost put put put quit quit quit (2) Others change the spelling of a two-letter vowel to an O with a silent final E in the simple past tense, and add an -N to that for the participle. Present Simple Past Past Participle break broke broken choose chose chosen cleave clove cloven freeze froze frozen steal stole stolen (3) Verbs containing the phonogram ee often change to the phonogram e in the past and participle forms. Present Simple Past Past Participle bleed bled bled breed bred bred feed fed fed flee fled fled meet met met (4) A limited number of verbs ending in p are spelled with the added phonogram t in the past and participle forms Present Simple Past Past Participle creep crept crept sweep swept swept sleep slept slept leap leapt leapt keep kept kept weep wept wept (5) Verbs ending with the multi-letter phonogram ay, that may be used at the end of English words, change into two-letter ai, that may not be used at the end of English words. To put it another way, when ay is no longer at the end of the word, the Y changes back to an I to form ai. Present Simple Past Past Participle pay paid paid lay laid laid say said2 said2 slay slain slain lie lay lain (6) A limited number of verbs change from the phonogram i in the present tense to a in the past tense and u in the participle. Present Simple Past Past Participle begin began begun cling clang clung sing sang sung drink drank drunk shrink shrank shrunk A list of irregular verbs is found in Appendix G. Footnotes 1. World Lingo. “Multilingual Archive: irregular verbs.” www.worldlingo.com/ma/enwiki/en/rregular_verb. 2. The word pair say and said is an example of the morpho-phonemic nature of English. In order to preserve the relationship in meaning, the common irregular verb pattern AY/AI is followed. Exaggerating the pronunciation as /sād/ will aid auditory learners in remembering the correct spelling. See chapter 16.",

      "title": "Forming Plural Nouns and Singular Verbs",
      "content": "Forming Plural Nouns and Singular Verbs Forming Plural Nouns Just as there is logic to the past tense and its variations in pronunciation, there is logic to forming plurals and adding -s versus -es. The following rule is lyrical, teaches the spelling variation of the plural ending, and accounts for irregular English plurals. It is important when phrasing rules to alert students if there are irregularities to the language so as to not set up false expectations. Rules are to provide clarity, not to enhance confusion. Rule 21To make a noun plural, add the ending -S unless the word hisses or changes, then add -ES. Occasional nouns have no change or an irregular spelling. Let’s step through each part of this rule. Just add -S The most common way to make a noun plural is by adding the ending -S. sons banks chairs emotions Remember the phonogram s makes two sounds: /s/ and /z/. Hisses Say the sounds: /ch/, /s/, /sh/, /x/, and /z/. Notice that each of these sounds hisses as it ends. When a word ends in a sound that hisses, add -ES to form the plural. Try to pronounce each of the words below by adding the /s/ or /z/ sound for the plural without the additional vowel /ĕ/. watches glasses taxes quizzes pushes It is impossible to clearly articulate another /s/ or /z/ sound at the end of a word that hisses. Therefore, the vowel sound /ĕ/ is inserted to ease articulation and ensure that the plural ending is clearly heard in speech. Changes When the root word changes to form the plural, add -ES. This is true for silent final E words that drop the E, and for Y’s that change to I. gate + es = gates page + es = pages baby + es = babies story + es = stories In addition, some singular words that end with F change to V in the plural. When F changes to V, add -ES to form the plural. thief + es = thieves wolf + es = wolves knife + es = knives shelf + es = shelves No Change Before we talk about nouns which do not change in the plural form, we need to distinguish the two categories of English nouns: count and non-count nouns. The difference is determined by asking a simple question: can this noun be counted? If it is a person, place, thing, or idea that can be counted or tallied, it is a count noun and has a plural form. For example, it is possible to count the number of teachers, parks, tables, and holidays. Each of these nouns, therefore, has a plural form. A non-count noun cannot be counted. Many non-count nouns are ideas such as friendship, mathematics, and poetry. Other non-count nouns are too numerous to be counted individually and therefore are measured in standard units such as inches, degrees, and pounds. Examples include cloth, heat, sugar, and gold. Others are typically not counted or measured such as hair and dust. Non-count nouns do not have a plural form and take a singular verb in sentences. The sugar is in the cupboard. Mathematics is my favorite subject. My hair flies into my face in the wind. When Rule 21 states: Occasional nouns have no change . . . it is referring to count nouns which do not change between the singular and plural form. cod perch trout walleye tuna shrimp moose sheep bison swine aircraft cannon series species kiwi These nouns can be either singular or plural in a sentence. The number is determined by any associated adjective or by the verb form. I saw one deer in my backyard. The deer is eating my garden. I saw many deer in my backyard. The deer are eating my garden. Irregular Spelling Many nouns have irregular spellings which reflect the original language. English, however, is not a static language. Over time many of the spellings have adapted to the English convention of adding -S to form the plurals. Many words now have both an irregular and a normalized English plural form. Both are accepted spellings.

The boys play. The dogs jump. The third person singular is the only form that changes in English. (Third person refers to the pronouns he, she, and it.) This rule parallels the forming of plural nouns. Rule 22To make a verb 3rd person singular, add the ending -S, unless the word hisses or changes, then add -ES. Only four verbs are irregular. Just add -S The most common way to form a third person singular verb is by adding the ending -S. He reads poetry. She walks to school. It falls off the tree. The boy plays. The dog jumps.

Compound words combine two or more complete base words to form a new word. hand + bag = handbag hand + stand = handstand hand + ball = handball hand + writing = handwriting When forming compound words, the two base words do not change. They are simply written as one word without a space between them.

Another limits the usage and pronunciation of phonograms ending in GH. The final rule clarifies the spelling of many common words. Rule 25DGE is used only after a single vowel which says its short (first) sound. badge ledge bridge lodge judge The phonogram dge may not be used after a consonant, a long vowel sound, a third vowel sound, or a multi-letter phonogram. Since English words do not end in I, U, V, or J, dge is a common spelling of the sound /j/ at the end of words. The other commonly used spelling is G followed by a silent final E. When the sound /j/ is heard at the end of the word and is preceded by a consonant or a long vowel sound, it is spelled G followed by a silent final E. See chapter 7. large gorge charge rage huge age Rule 26CK is used only after a single vowel which says its short (first) sound. back neck truck lock et The phonogram ck is limited in the same way as dge. It may not be used after a consonant, long vowel sound, third vowel sound, or multi-letter phonogram. Rule 27TCH is used only after a single vowel which does not say its name. match etch glitch splotch hutch This rule varies from the previous two because in watch, the phonogram a is saying its third sound /ä/ and in butcher the phonogram u is saying its third sound /ü/.

Phonograms spelled with a GH are found only at the end of the word, laugh weigh sigh tough and before the letter T. caught weight night bought Words containing the letters GH originate in Old English.

Rather, they aid us in identifying which parts of words need careful attention. Words that contain the phonogram z in the middle or at the end are less common and will need additional thought and maybe practice.

Occasionally other letters also are doubled. off ball loss ebb odd egg inn watt jazz This rule is carefully worded to say we often double the letters. It is vital to not overstate rules and create unnecessary exceptions. Though the rule does not tell us when to double letters, it does cue the learner that F, L, and S are the most commonly doubled letters and to be aware that this occurs with other consonants as well. In addition, Rule 30 restricts doubling to after a single vowel at the end of the word.

      "content": "Overcoming Challenges Creating an Auditory Picture Most English-speaking students learn to read through a combination of memorizing sight words and a smattering of incomplete phonics. Spelling is then taught as a separate subject, rarely linked to reading. Yet reading and spelling are the same process in reverse. Reading is the process of decoding the “sound pictures” and reforming them into auditory words. This is true even when we are reading “silently” in our heads. Spelling is the process of hearing a word, breaking it into its individual sounds, and writing them on paper. It is vital to understand that English is a code. Codes by nature are reversible. It is learning the keys to the code that enables all students to learn how to read and spell fluently. The key to reading and writing a phonetic language is the ability to break a word into its individual sound parts and to glue it back together. In many languages there is a one-to-one correspondence between the phonograms (written symbols) and the phonemes (sounds). In such languages students at the end of first grade test at nearly the same level as college students in their ability to read and spell.1 English, though, is a more opaque system where phonograms may represent more than one sound, and sounds may be spelled more than one way. The primary solution to the difficulties presented by a complex code is to teach the code in its entirety and not to leave students guessing. Learning all the phonograms and spelling rules brings coherence in the midst of complexity. Spoken English presents three additional problems: dialects, the schwa, and distortion of sounds. These are not insurmountable. In this chapter I will demonstrate how pronouncing each word literally, as it is spelled, is a way to create an auditory picture of each word. All students of phonetic languages must learn how to exaggerate their pronunciation, though to varying degrees depending upon the language. This is because sounds are rarely found in their pure forms within words. Sounds in close proximity distort one another within the flow of natural speech.2 Let’s first consider this process in regard to the problem of dialects.",

      "title": "Dialects",
      "content": "Dialects English is a global language with as many as 168 accents and dialects. Although speakers of each dialect usually can understand one another, there are distinctions which influence the pronunciation of various words. These variations in pronunciation are most distinct with the sound /r/ and vowels. Many speakers either add or drop /r/ sounds and morph vowel sounds based upon their dialect of English. In the United States people in the Midwest pronounce the word ten /tĕn/. In the South the same word is commonly pronounced /tĭn/. If Southerners were to write ten exactly as they pronounce it, they would misspell it, tin. In addition, when reading, a young Southern student may not recognize /tĕn/ as the same word they commonly pronounce /tĭn/. To solve this problem we must teach all students to think /tĕn/ for purposes of reading and spelling. This process is no different from the methods we use to auditorily recognize the speech of a person from another region. Just as we learn to hear words pronounced in other ways, we can learn to recognize that though the standard spelling may not represent our speech pattern, it does represent the speech pattern in some other region. Students should be explicitly taught these connections rather than left to discover them on their own. Learning to pronounce words literally for spelling and reading purposes does not mean that students need to alter their daily pronunciation. Saying a word to spell and read is simply a tool to understand and memorize why a word is spelled in a particular manner. Learning to pronounce the word for spelling purposes also heightens awareness of variations in pronunciation. After learning the phonograms, I became aware that my Canadian friend clearly pronounces the word been /bēn/, whereas I say /bĕn/. She does not need any additional tools to spell this word, for she says it exactly how it is written. I, however, teach my students to say /bēn/ for spelling purposes, thereby creating a clear auditory picture of the sounds. Notice in the following chart how the standard British pronunciation clearly reflects the spelling of the vowels within each word. Recall that A, E, O, and U usually say their long sounds at the end of the syllable. For spelling purposes, Americans would benefit by learning to say each word as it is written. Standard American Pronunciation Standard British Pronunciation process /prŏ sĕs/ /prō sĕs/ again /ә gĕn/3 /ә gān/ been /bĕn/ /bēn/ In contrast, many British speakers drop R’s at the ends of words. They would benefit from exaggerating the /r/ sound for spelling purposes. Standard American Pronunciation Standard British Pronunciation father /fäTH er/ /fäTH ә/ butter /bŭt er/ /bŭt ә/ car /car/ /cä/ In summary, spelling is best memorized by creating an auditory picture of how each word is spelled rather than relying on regional dialects and turning all variants from the dialect into sight words.",

      "title": "The Schwa",
      "content": "The Schwa The schwa sound /ә/ is one of the distinctions of modern English speech. It is the most common spoken sound in both British and American English. The /ә/ is an essential part of the rhythmic patterns of English and is formed by unaccented syllables. If you recall, we open our mouths most widely on the accented syllable. This opening results in clearly articulated vowel sounds. The schwa is an unaccented vowel sound where the mouth is less open, and therefore, the vowel sound is less clear. The pronunciation of any English vowel may degrade to /ә/ in an unstressed syllable. Multisyllable words have stressed and unstressed syllable(s). In both American and British English most vowels in an unaccented syllable are pronounced /ә/. Consider the following examples: We write We say con' stant /kŏn' stәnt/ trav' el /trăv' әl/ cous' in /kŭ' zәn/ li' on /lī' әn/ doc' tor /dŏk' tәr/ free' dom /frē' dәm/ ig' no rance /ĭg' nә rәns/ It is best to teach students to pronounce each syllable for spelling as if it were accented. Exaggerating the pronunciation of words to create an auditory picture is a powerful tool to internalize correct spellings. It provides a system that is clear and rules that are consistent. Consider the following examples: We write We say We say to spell con' stant /kŏn' stәnt/ /kŏn' stănt/ trav' el /trăv' әl/ /trăv' ĕl/ cous' in /kŭ' zәn/ /kŭ' zĭn/ li' on /lī' әn/ /lī' ŏn/ doc' tor /dŏk' tәr/ /dŏk' tōr/ free' dom /frē' dәm/ /frē' dŏm/ ig' no rance /ĭg' nә rәns/ /ĭg' nō răns/ Another tool to determine the correct spelling of a vowel that is pronounced with a schwa is to find derivatives which have the accent placed on the desired syllable. Because English is a morpho-phonemic language where spellings are chosen to represent both sound and meaning, it is often possible to find a derivative where the vowel sound is clearly pronounced because the syllable is now accented. Though this does not work for all words, it can be a simple way to clarify the spelling of a syllable with a schwa sound. Unaccented Accented vә ca' tion vā' cate pә lit' i cal pŏl' it ics vi' tәl vi tăl' i ty spә ci' fic spē' cies def' ә nite de fīne' Since words within a sentence also have varying amounts of stress, the schwa sound also occurs within short grammatical words. The important words, such as nouns, main verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, are stressed in speech. Therefore, their vowels are clearly articulated. The small grammar words such as articles, helping verbs, pronouns, and conjunctions are not stressed. As a result, the vowels within these words usually degrade into the schwa sound. Consider: We write We say The man' sat'. /THә măn săt./ a cup' of tea' /ә kŭp ә tē/ what time' /whәt tīm/ She' was late'. /shē wәs lāt./ It is beneficial to teach students to exaggerate the pronunciation of these words for spelling purposes. Just as with the issues related to dialects, it is important to make clear connections between what we say to spell and what we say in normal speech. We write We say We say to spell the /THә/ /THē/ a /ә/ /ā/ what /whәt/ /whät/ was /wәz/ /wäz/ The lack of clear articulation of vowel sounds in unstressed syllables and words is a challenge for consistent spelling. Some people suggest that the schwa sound should be added to every vowel phonogram. This would provide no additional clarity for spelling. It would necessitate adding the schwa to every vowel phonogram, thus relegating virtually every multisyllable word to rote visual memory. Students who are visual learners already learn to spell by memorizing how each word looks. If questioned on the spelling of a particular word, these learners will often write the word down to see if it looks right. They are relying on sight alone. However, reading and spelling are best taught using all of our learning modes: hearing, speaking, doing, and seeing. When we use all the learning modes, the learning is deeper and faster. This is because each mode utilizes a different area of the brain. When all the areas are used simultaneously, we build synapses between the regions. Teaching by hearing, speaking, doing, and seeing also allows all students to utilize their strongest learning style while strengthening their areas of weakness. Exaggerating the pronunciation of words for spelling adds the hearing and speaking modes. When this is combined with writing the words and logically analyzing the phonograms and spelling rules that are used, all students become more engaged and internalize spellings more quickly and deeply.",

      "content": "Distortion Some sounds are distorted in the flow of natural speech by the proximity of other phonograms. This frequently occurs with sounds that are next to the vowel U. In order to clarify spelling, it is best to exaggerate the pronunciation. Consider the word sugar. It has two syllables with the syllable break as follows: su gar. One would expect this word to be read /sū gär/. (U says /ū/ at the end of the syllable.) However, we say /shә ger/. To discover what is occurring within this word, pronounce the clearly articulated /sū gär/ faster and faster. You will notice the /sū/ naturally softens to /shә/. Distortions occur because of the manner in which each sound is produced in the mouth and how we naturally change the sounds for ease of pronunciation. For spelling purposes, it is best to create a clear auditory picture of these words by exaggerating the pronunciation for spelling.",

      "content": "Conclusion Most visual learners rely on memorizing the shape of individual words. This strategy, however, only works for students with strong visual memories. Therefore, it is best to teach students to create an auditory picture of each word as well. Students should be guided to clearly pronounce each vowel sound, enunciate /r/ sounds that are otherwise dropped, and articulate sounds that are distorted by close proximity to one another. When this is combined with writing, a kinesthetic experience of the word, all students’ learning styles are covered, leading to faster and deeper learning. Footnotes 1. McGuinness. Early Reading Instruction, 40. In 1973 researchers tested 240 Finnish children in grades 1–3. They were given a nonsense word reading test which included all of the possible spelling combinations in Finnish. At the end of first grade, children averaged a score of 80% accuracy. College students scored 90% on the same test. 2. To solve this problem many written languages have characters that represent all the possible syllables. These writing systems are syllabic rather than phonetic. For English this would be impossible, since there are too many possible syllables. The number of possible syllables is very high in English due to the large number of vowels and consonant blends. Therefore a phonemic system, representing each sound, is the most effcient way to represent English words. 3. We will discuss the schwa sound in the next section.",

The 300 most frequently used words make up 65% percent of all that we read and write. This is because a limited number of basic words are grammatically necessary to form all English sentences.

Developing a large vocabulary is the second most vital step to becoming a proficient reader and speller in English. It has been shown that many students who learn to read successfully in the lower grades plateau in fourth grade.1 It is thought this is due to the rapid increase in volume and complexity of vocabulary. Fortunately, although the English lexicon is massive, a majority of words are formed either by combining words to form compound words or by adding suffixes or prefixes to roots.",

      "content": "Definitions Before we continue, let’s review and define a few terms: A prefix is a group of letters added to the beginning of a root that alters the meaning. A suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a root which alters the meaning or part of speech. An affix is a group of letters added to either the beginning or ending of a word. There are two types of affixes in English: suffixes and prefixes. A base word is a word that can stand alone when all the affixes have been removed. Let’s consider the word renew. If we remove the prefix re- the base word new is left. New is a recognizable English word that stands alone, therefore it is a base word. A root carries the primary meaning of the word but is not necessarily an English word when all the affixes have been removed. In the previous example, new is the root of the word renew. New stands alone, so it is also a base word. The word revive also has the prefix re-. Though vive is the root, vive is not a base word because it is not a recognizable English word. Roots which are not English words are sometimes call bound bases. A derivative is a word formed by adding suffixes and prefixes to a root or by combining two base words to form a compound word. Morphemes are the smallest word parts that carry meaning. Morphemes include roots, base words, suffixes, and prefixes. For example, the word dogs consists of two morphemes: the base word dog and the suffix -s.",

      "title": "Teaching Spelling and Vocabulary",
      "content": "Teaching Spelling and Vocabulary Spelling and vocabulary development are ideally taught concurrently. Too often they are taught as independent subjects, cluttering the mind. When they are taught together, students build links between the roots and affixes and their spellings and meanings. Students also develop an increased awareness that English is a morpho-phonemic language where spellings represent both sound and meaning and begin to draw necessary connections between related words. In addition, teaching spelling and vocabulary at the same time aids students in developing reading fluency by teaching them to recognize not only the phonemes (parts of words that denote sound) but the morphemes (parts of words that carry meaning). Too often we rely only on the context to provide clues to the meaning of an unknown word. Yet individual words contain vital information about their meaning.2 When students are taught how to analyze a word based upon its roots and affixes, they are able to soar. Consider the simple words: love, forest, and view. love forest view lovely deforest preview loved reforest review lovable forestation viewing loveless deforestation reviewing loving reforestation previewing unlovely forested previewed beloved afforest reviewed unlovable viewed unloving viewable Each base word is a root which generates numerous related vocabulary entries. Adding suffixes and prefixes changes the meaning, tense, and part of speech. Simply learning the meanings of the affixes greatly simplifies the study of English. For example, it is much simpler to learn multi- means “many” than to memorize each of the individual words: multicultural, multidisciplinary, multi-faceted, multilingual, multilateral, multimillionaire, and so forth. It helps even more to connect the prefix multi- to the commonly known words, multiply and multiple. Some students make these connections unaided. Since English is such a massive subject, however, many students never make the necessary connections when words are taught in isolation. Students should begin to broaden their vocabulary as soon as they have mastered thirty to forty basic words. Vocabulary development follows in five basic steps.",

      "title": "Roots",
      "content": "Roots Once students have mastered this process using base words, they are ready to apply their knowledge to roots. Remember, roots do not always stand alone as English words. Roots, especially Latin and Greek roots, are replete throughout English. Learning to recognize these roots and their meanings greatly reduces the amount of rote memory work for both spelling and vocabulary development. A powerful example of an Old English root is found in the following words. twin twelve twice twelfth twenty two Each of these words contains the root tw, meaning “two.” Likewise, they all refer in some way to the number 2. Once students understand the root tw, they are not likely to mix up the homophone two with to and too and they will begin to understand how English spelling conventions reflect both sound and meaning. Learning Latin and Greek roots is even more powerful than studying the English roots. Sixty percent of English vocabulary and 90% of scientific terminology is derived from Latin and Greek.4 Ninety percent of all multi-syllable words are Latin based, and most of the remaining 10% are Greek based.5 Each of these roots generates up to a dozen or more related words. It is extremely beneficial, therefore, for students to study vocabulary and spelling within the context of Latin and Greek roots. Ideally, all teachers in the K-12 system would understand the logic of English and its value for teaching vocabulary. They would help students connect the vocabulary taught in their classes to other English words and to their roots. This should begin in the very earliest grades. For example, in an elementary math class, teachers should connect the base word quart with its meaning fourth. A quarter (25 cents) is a fourth of a dollar; a quart is a fourth of a gallon; a quarter (1/4) is a fourth; a quartet is four musicians. A one- or two-minute vocabulary connection point would not only aid students in mastering a particular word but also reinforce how words are constructed in English and teach students to look for patterns. Latin and Greek roots are the cornerstone of scientific vocabulary. Close to 100% of scientific terms have Latin or Greek roots. Understanding basic roots provides a context for learning the technical language of science outside of rote memorization. For example, the Latin term ignus means “fire.” This should be connected to commonly used terms such as ignition, ignite, and igniter. With these connections it becomes clear that igneous rock was formed by fire or produced in molten lava. A high school science teacher who is introducing the terms exothermic and endothermic should draw connections to other known words. Therm-, the Latin root for heat, is clearly related to words such as thermal, thermometer, and thermostat. Exo- is a prefix which means out. The teacher could point out that when a student exits the classroom they go out, an exoskeleton is one located outside the body, and something that explodes moves outward. Therefore an exothermic reaction is one that releases heat outward. The Latin prefix, endo-, means in. It is also found in the term endoskeleton, which is a skeleton located inside the body, and endosperm, food found inside a seed. An endothermic reaction thus absorbs heat or draws heat in. A history teacher could aid students in understanding the Acropolis by showing students that acro- means heights as in an acrobat and acrophobia, and that polis means city as in Minneapolis, Annapolis, Indianapolis, and metropolis. Consider the word malicious, commonly found on middle and high school vocabulary exercises. Usually it is embedded in a list of ten to fifteen unconnected words which students are asked to memorize for a vocabulary test later in the week. It only takes a few minutes to create mental hooks on which to hang the new term and thereby increase long-term retention for all learners. Students who are asked to find other words they know with the root mal- will usually state words such as malfunction, maltreated, malformed and malnourished. Since malfunction means to function badly, maltreated is treated badly, malformed is badly formed, etc., students will be able to deduce that mal- means “bad.” These can also be connected to maladjusted, dismal, malignant, malice, malefactor, and malady. By comparing delicious, ambitious, gracious, spacious and suspicious to malicious, students will notice that the suffix -cious means “full of something.” They are then are able to deduce that malicious means “full of bad/evil.” Knowing roots also increases our understanding and appreciation for literature. This is true not only of the classics. Even contemporary writers often play with roots. The Harry Potter series is one example. Consider the character Malfoy. Knowing the meaning of the root mal provides insight into the character that may otherwise not be known. Understanding roots enriches good writing and enables us to more fully appreciate plays on words. Examine the following examples. Consider how each word is related in meaning and spelling and how these relate to the root. specto - to look at mot - to move laboro - to work inspect motion laboratory spectacles motor labor spectacle promote collaborate spectator demote elaborate spectacular locomotive laborious circumspect motivation laborer respect motive lab Each of the derivatives reflects the meaning of the root. Consider how knowing that specto means “to look at” unlocks the meaning to each of the derivatives. To inspect is to look at carefully. Spectacles are used to improve the eye’s ability to look at things. When people make a spectacle of themselves, they become something to look at. A spectator is someone looking at an event. Something spectacular is something amazing to look at. Circumspect means looking carefully all around. To respect is to look on someone with regard. This same reasoning can also be applied to mot and laboro. The twenty most common prefixes and suffixes can also be added to Latin roots. Segmenting the word into its parts, it is possible to discover how words are constructed to convey meaning. demote = de + mote The root mote means “to move.” The prefix de- means “down” as in depress and devalue. Demote therefore means “to move down.” This is consistent with its usage: to move down in position or rank. extract = ex + tract The root tract means “to pull.” The prefix ex- means “out.” To extract means “to pull out.” destructive = de + struct + ive The root struct means “to build.” The prefix de- means “down.” The suffix -ive connotes an adjective. Destructive describes something that builds down. In addition to learning Greek and Latin roots, learning the meaning of common Latin and Greek prefixes can be a simple way to unlock the meaning to dozens of related words. It is more efficient to study the parts of words and how they work than to memorize each individual word. For example, ambi- is a Latin prefix meaning both. ambidexterous able to use both hands with ease. ambiguous having two or more possible meanings ambitendency having two conflicting tendencies ambivalent unable to decide between two choices of equal importance. Roots are not limited to terms coined in the last century, either. Having an excellent command of roots, suffixes, and prefixes allows for great creativity in creating new words to describe inventions and discoveries. Xerox® is short for xerography, a word created to describe the new invention of “dry copying.” Xer- is the Greek root for “dry” and graphy for “picture.”",

Though many intuitive students appear to absorb vocabulary by reading, other students need to be taught explicitly how to look for roots and compare them to other words they know. This basic vocabulary skill combined with learning the meanings of common roots and affixes will lead to a large and flexible vocabulary and the ability to use words with greater ease in comprehension, writing, and speaking. Teaching words in isolation is the equivalent of teaching students to memorize number sentences such as “three plus two is five” without ever teaching them how to add. Students who learn how to analyze words will excel in their ability to master the technical vocabularies of science, medicine, and law. They are well prepared to comprehend and skillfully use the English language. Footnotes 1. Kieffer, Michael J. and Lesaux, Nonie K. 2007. “Breaking Down Words to Build Meaning.” In William F.

Some people have tried to blame the problems on English. Admittedly, English is a complex code, though in this complexity lie powerful tools of expression, nuance, creativity, and meaning. It is essential when teaching English to lay out the system of the language explicitly so that all students can succeed. English words are comprised of both phonograms (sound pictures) and morphemes (cues to the meaning). By learning the phonograms and rules that control their sounds, students acquire a strategy to sound out unknown words. By learning the morphemes, roots, suffixes, and prefixes, students grow better able to construe the meaning of unknown words. With these tools students no longer need to guess but have reliable strategies for reading and comprehending. The phonograms, rules, roots, suffixes, and prefixes also contribute to success in spelling. With the advent of computerized spell-checkers, we have too often dismissed the importance of spelling, leaving countless people struggling. Simply knowing the essential elements underlying each word informs writers. Though there remain some options for spelling, knowing the phonograms, rules, and roots greatly reduces the options and helps students identify which parts of words need more careful attention. Currently, 69% of our nation’s students are struggling with basic literacy skills. The material found in this book is vital to the next generation. Literacy is the foundation of our society—academically, civically, medically, environmentally, scientifically, and socially. Basic reading and writing skills should be taught in a manner that helps all students succeed. The logic underlying English should be known by everyone. When this information is combined with solid, multisensory teaching methods, we will experience a dramatic reversal in the literacy crisis. If the material in Uncovering the Logic of English has changed your understanding of the English language, I encourage you to pass the book on to others. Together we can begin a grassroots movement that changes the lives of those who have suffered from illiteracy, and we can prevent it in future generations.",

      "content": "Sample Words to Tie It All Together The purpose of learning the logic of English is to be able to analyze and understand any word within the English lexicon. In this final chapter we will examine a few words using the phonograms, rules, and roots. Each word will be analyzed step by step. This process may be used by teachers to guide students in understanding words. In these examples, spelling is considered first and roots second. This order may be reversed depending upon the teaching context. Though teaching in this manner initially means committing one to three minutes per word, the retention rate for meaning, pronunciation, and spelling will be much higher than if students are left to guess the spelling and meaning on their own. As students grow in their understanding of the logic of English, this time will shorten. Eventually, they will be able to analyze words almost instantaneously without assistance while reading. homogeneous Divide it into syllables. ho mo ge ne ous Analyze the word in the direction of reading and writing. ho O said /ō/ at the end of the syllable.

Rule 3 English words do not end in I, U, V, or J. Rule 4 A E O U usually say their names at the end of a syllable. Rule 5 I and Y may say /ĭ/ or /ī/ at the end of a syllable. Rule 6 When a one-syllable word ends in a single vowel Y, it says /ī/. Rule 7 Y says /ē/ only at the end of a multisyllable base word. I says /ē/ at the end of a syllable that is followed by a vowel and at the end of foreign words. Rule 8 I and O may say /ī/ and /ō/ when followed by two consonants. Rule 9 AY usually spells the sound /ā/ at the end of a base word. Rule 10 When a word ends with the phonogram A, it says /ä/. Rule 11 Q always needs a U; therefore, U is not a vowel here. Rule 12 Silent Final E Rules 12.1 The vowel says its name because of the E. 12.2 English words do not end in V or U. 12.3 The C says /s/ and the G says /j/ because of the E. 12.4 Every syllable must have a written vowel. 12.5 Add an E to keep singular words that end in the letter S from looking plural. 12.6 Add an E to make the word look bigger. 12.7 TH says its voiced sound /TH/ because of the E. 12.8 Add an E to clarify meaning. 12.9 Unseen reason. Rule 13 Drop the silent final E when adding a vowel suffix only if it is allowed by other spelling rules. Rule 14 Double the last consonant when adding a vowel suffix to words ending in one vowel followed by one consonant, only if the syllable before the suffix is accented.* *This is always true for one-syllable words. Rule 15 Single vowel Y changes to I when adding any ending, unless the ending begins with I. Rule 16 Two I’s cannot be next to one another in English words. Rule 17 TI, CI, and SI are used only at the beginning of any syllable after the first one. Rule 18 SH spells /sh/ at the beginning of a base word and at the end of the syllable. SH never spells /sh/ at the beginning of any syllable after the first one, except for the ending -ship. Rule 19 To make a verb past tense, add the ending -ED unless it is an irregular verb. Rule 20 -ED, past tense ending, forms another syllable when the base word ends in /d/ or /t/. Otherwise, -ED says /d/ or /t/. Rule 21 To make a noun plural, add the ending -S unless the word hisses or changes, then add -ES. Occasional nouns have no change or an irregular spelling. Rule 22 To make a verb 3rd person singular, add the ending -S, unless the word hisses or changes, then add -ES. Only four verbs are irregular. Rule 23 Al- is a prefix written with one L when preceding another syllable. Rule 24 -Ful is a suffix written with one L when added to another syllable. Rule 25 DGE is used only after a single vowel which says its short (first) sound. Rule 26 CK is used only after a single vowel which says its short (first) sound. Rule 27 TCH is used only after a single vowel which does not say its name. Rule 28 AUGH, EIGH, IGH, OUGH. Phonograms ending in GH are used only at the end of a base word or before the letter T. The GH is either silent or pronounced /f/. Rule 29 Z, never S, spells /z/ at the beginning of a base word. Rule 30 We often double F, L, and S after a single vowel at the end of a base word. Occasionally other letters also are doubled.",

These words may be learned as a group. ä ăf aught (more commonly spelled ought) draught caught laugh daughter distraught fraught haughty slaughter naughty taught CEI – Rather than learning the rule: “Use I before E, except after C...,” which has numerous exceptions, it is simpler to learn CEI as a phonogram. This phonogram is found in only eight common base words. These words may be taught as a group. ceiling conceive receipt deceive perceive receive conceit deceit DGE – The sound /j/ heard in words such as hedge and ledge is harsher with more voice than the sound formed by G followed by a silent E as in large and marriage. E – The single letter E spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of only six one-syllable words. Since Y says its long /ī/ sound at the end of a one-syllable word, as in by, try, and fly, the single vowel E is used instead. he she we the me be Typically, Y spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of multisyllable words. There are ten words, however, which are spelled with the single vowel E. These may be learned as a group. acne adobe apostrophe catastrophe coyote epitome kamikaze karate recipe simile EA – says /ā/ in only nine common words. These words may be taught as a group. steak break tear great wear pear bear swear yea EA spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of only six commonly used words. These may be taught as a group.

Words such as deity and nuclei are not included because the E and I are acting as two separate phonograms as is seen by the syllable breaks: de it y, nu cle i. The basic sounds were chosen because they are represented in common words such as their, either and neither. Since either and neither are also commonly pronounced with a long /ī/, and the relationship with EIGH is made more clear, I have chosen to include the long /ī/ as a basic phonogram sound.

It is found in only seven common base words. These words may be taught as a group. ā ī eight height freight sleight sleigh weigh neighbor By adding suffixes and prefixes and using these to form compound words, these six words can be expanded into a total of 103 words. EY – There are only ten commonly known words in which EY says long A. The long /ā/ sound is the least common sound. However, it is placed first because (1) memorizing the long /ā/ sound first helps to distinguish this phonogram from others and (2) it helps link this phonogram to EIGH and EI. abeyance convey grey (British spelling for gray) hey obey prey purvey survey whey they EY spells long /ē/ at the end of a single one-syllable word, key. EY usually says its long /ē/ sound at the end of two- and three-syllable words. abbey attorney chutney baloney hockey EY is a common suffix added to words to turn nouns into adjectives. chocolate chocolatey glue gluey EW – says the long /ū/ sound where the /y/ is distinctly heard in only two base words: few and new (in some dialects). The rest drop the /y/ sound. I – says the consonant sound /y/ in words such as onion, opinion, union, etc. Learning that I also has a consonant sound further emphasizes the I and Y relationship in English. IE – Many programs (based upon 70 phonograms) have three sounds for this phonogram: /ē-ī-ĭ/. This program uses only one sound /ē/ for the following reasons: Five common base words end in IE. die lie pie tie vie These words are better classified as silent final E words because each of them drops the E when adding a vowel suffix. When adding the vowel suffix -ed, these words drop the E to form lied, tied, died. When adding the vowel suffix -ing, in addition to dropping the E, the I changes to Y to prevent two I’s from being together. For example: lying and dying. Some teachers argue that the phonogram IE is formed when a single vowel Y changes to I when adding a suffix that begins with E. For example: implied, tried, and cried. From a pedagogical standpoint it is better to teach students to look at the root word and emphasize that the Y changed to I, rather than teaching these words as the phonogram IE. IE says /ĭ/ in only two common words. Since these both in an unaccented syllable, we will “say to spell” long /ē/. This is also consistent with their root word, chief, and aids in emphasizing the morpho-phonemic aspects of English. kerchief mischief IE spells long /ē/ at the end of a single one-syllable word: brie. IE says /ĕ/ in only one commonly known word: friend. IGH – is used in only eighteen common base words. blight bright fight flight fright high knight light might nigh night plight right sigh sight slight tight thigh By adding suffixes and prefixes and using these to form compound words, these sixteen words can be expanded into a total of 967 words. OA – is used in 62 commonly used base words. It is used in the middle of one-syllable base words with the exception of approach, reproach, cocoa, quinoa, and whoa. Words containing the phonogram OA commonly form compound words such as motorboat, toadstool, etc. They also commonly add prefixes and suffixes. OE – is the least common spelling of the long /Ō/ sound. There are only 9 common base words that use this spelling. These may be learned as a group. doe foe hoe oboe toe woe aloe roe throe OE represents a phonogram, not an O plus a silent final E. This is demonstrated by the E being retained when adding a vowel suffix in words such as hoeing and toeing. If it were a silent final E, the E would be dropped. OE says its second sound /oo/ in only two common words. shoe canoe OE is not acting as a silent final E in these words, as can be demonstrated by the fact that the E is retained when adding a vowel suffix such as shoeing and canoeing. OO – By far the most common sound is /oo/. It is heard in more than 150 common base words. It says its second sound, /ü/, in twenty-one common base words and one suffix. It says its third sound, long /ō/, in only three base words. It says the short /ŭ/ sound in two words. ü ō ŭ the suffix -hood brooch blood book door flood brook floor cook crook foot forsook good hood hoof hook look nook rook roof shook soot stood took wood woof wool OUGH – is an unusual phonogram. Many people use examples of this spelling to prove that English is not regular. However, it is possible to think systematically about it. Short /ŏ/ is the most frequent sound. It is found in six common base words. Long /ō/ is the second most common sound, found in five base words; /oo/ is found in one word (for ease of memorization this has been moved to the third position); /ow/ is found in three; /ŭff/ is found in two; /ŏff/ is found in two. Some people also include the sound /ŭp/ as in the old spelling of hiccup: hiccough. ŏ ō oo bought although through thought dough nought borough ought fought wrought furlough thorough ow ŭff ŏff bough enough cough drought rough trough plough By adding suffixes and prefixes and using these to form compound words, these words can be expanded into a total of 239 words. U – While it is true that long vowels say their names, the /y/ sound of long /ū/ is often lost after consonants to ease pronunciation. Consider the difference between cute and tune. UI – is used in only seven common base words. These may be taught as a group. bruise cruise fruit juice nuisance sluice suit Y – At the end of one-syllable words Y says /ī/. There are 17 words that fit this category: by buy cry dry fly fry my ply pry shy sky sly spry sty try why wry Y also says /ī/ at the end of multisyllable words, such as supply, ally, and deny, and with the suffix -fy. At the end of most multisyllable words Y says /ē/. Y is the most common spelling of long /ē/ at the end of multisyllable words. busy ugly berry candy mystery envy",

      "content": "American, British, Canadian & Australian Spellings Though there is an amazing conformity among spellings in different regions of the English speaking world, there are a few differences. Many of these differences can be credited to Noah Webster. In 1828, following the American Revolution, Webster set himself to writing the first American Dictionary. In order to distinguish the newly founded country from the country from which they had just won independence, Webster modified some of the spellings to create an “American” version of English. As you will observe in the lists below, some of Webster’s changes generated exceptions and inconsistencies that do not exist in the British spellings and some of his changes resolved exceptions. Commonwealth countries typically follow British spelling conventions. Canadian English, however, reflects its history as a Commonwealth as well as a close neighbor of the United States. Sometimes both spellings are acceptable. In this case the most common spelling will be referenced first. The following dictionaries were referenced for creating these tables: Delbridge, Arthur. 1981. The Macquarie Dictionary. Concise Digital Edition. St. Leonards, N.S.W.: Macquarie Library. Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary. 1993. Springfield, Mass.: Merriam-Webster. Web.

In the United States it is common not to double the L in an unaccented syllable; however, both spellings are listed as acceptable in Merriam Webster’s Dictionary. Unfortunately, Canadians will need to memorize the exceptions word by word since their spelling has been influenced by both the British and American spellings.

They were given a nonsense word reading test which included all of the possible spelling combinations in Finnish. At the end of first grade, children averaged a score of 80% accuracy. College students scored 90% on the same test. 2. To solve this problem many written languages have characters that represent all the possible syllables. These writing systems are syllabic rather than phonetic. For English this would be impossible, since there are too many possible syllables. The number of possible syllables is very high in English due to the large number of vowels and consonant blends. Therefore a phonemic system, representing each sound, is the most effcient way to represent English words. 3. We will discuss the schwa sound in the next section.",

For a list of advanced phonograms, see Appendix E. affix a group of letters added to either the beginning or ending of a word. There are two types of affixes in English: suffixes and prefixes. base word a word that can stand alone when all the affixes have been removed. Let's consider the word renew. If we remove the prefix re-, the base word new is left. New is a recognizable English word that stands alone, therefore it is a base word. consonant a sound which is blocked by the tongue, teeth, or lips in some way. Most consonants are difficult to sing or control for volume. The single consonants are: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, qu, r, s, t, v, w, x, (y), z. consonant suffix begins with a consonant such as -ly, -ness, -ful, -hood, and -ment. derivative a word formed by adding suffixes and prefixes to a root or by combining two base words to form a compound word. morpheme the smallest word part that carries meaning. Morphemes include roots, base words, suffixes, and prefixes. For example the word dogs consists of two morphemes: the base word, dog, and the suffix, -s. multi-letter phonogram a phonogram which is written with two or more letters. phonogram a letter or combination of letters which represents one or more sounds. prefix a group of letters added to the beginning of a root that alters the meaning. root carries the primary meaning of the word but is not necessarily an English word when all the affixes have been removed. For example, move is the root of the word remove. Move stands alone so it is also a base word. The word revive also has the prefix re-. However, the root vive is not a base word because it is not a recognizable English word. Vive is a root, but not a base word. schwa /ә/ an unaccented vowel which sounds very similar to short /ŭ/. silent final E an E at the end of a base word that is not sounded. There are nine types of silent final E's. single-letter phonogram a phonogram written with only one letter. They are represented by the letters A-Z. single vowel Y a Y that is acting alone at the end of the word; it is not part of one of the multi-letter phonograms ay, ey, or oy. suffix a group of letters added to the end of a root which alters the meaning or part of speech. syllable a rhythmic part of a word produced when the mouth opens to form a vowel sound. vowel a sound that is produced when the mouth is open and the sound is not blocked by the lips, teeth, or tongue. Vowels are sounds that can be sustained such as in singing and controlled for volume. vowel suffix an ending that begins with a vowel. For example: -able, -ing, -ed, -ish, and -y.",

My literal, logical thinking students are frustrated daily by the seemingly endless exceptions to the rules of the English language. Until today, the only answer I ever had for them was, ‘The English language is full of exceptions to the rules. Be glad you are learning it as your native language and have had the benefit of years of immersion.’ This is of little comfort to them. I finally have a comprehensive list of the real rules of the English language! The best thing of all is that experts talk a lot about using the obsessions of students with autism to teach them. Most of my students are obsessed with rules (memorizing them, following them to the very literal letter, and making sure others follow them as well), so I am confident that they will enthusiastically devour and retain this information! For the first time since learning to diagram sentences in college, when parts of speech rules really clicked for me, I am excited to teach English!” —Jenny Lundgren, Middle School Teacher “Denise Eide’s book is outstanding! I could not put it down when I started reading it. Wish all schools could use it as a text.” —Sharon Campbell, Parent and Grandmother “Once it is understandably explained to you, the perceived illogical spelling system of the English language actually starts to make a lot of sense—and FUN! My first language is German—completely different spelling system—and I learned to read and write in English ‘the old way’. It did work alright, but I know, had I been taught the way described in Uncovering the Logic of English, it would have been SO much easier!” —Valerie Adomakoh, Parent, Non-Native English Speaker “I am a certified reading specialist and have been studying reading instruction for years, but most of the information in Eide’s book was completely new to me...

If you struggle with reading, or know anyone that does, Uncovering the Logic of English is totally worth it!” —Allie Gower, Designer “I teach language arts to middle school students with autism. My literal, logical thinking students are frustrated daily by the seemingly endless exceptions to the rules of the English language. Until today, the only answer I ever had for them was, ‘The English language is full of exceptions to the rules. Be glad you are learning it as your native language and have had the benefit of years of immersion.’ This is of little comfort to them. I finally have a comprehensive list of the real rules of the English language! The best thing of all is that experts talk a lot about using the obsessions of students with autism to teach them. Most of my students are obsessed with rules (memorizing them, following them to the very literal letter, and making sure others follow them as well), so I am confident that they will enthusiastically devour and retain this information! For the first time since learning to diagram sentences in college, when parts of speech rules really clicked for me, I am excited to teach English!” —Jenny Lundgren, Middle School Teacher “Denise Eide’s book is outstanding! I could not put it down when I started reading it. Wish all schools could use it as a text.” —Sharon Campbell, Parent and Grandmother “Once it is understandably explained to you, the perceived illogical spelling system of the English language actually starts to make a lot of sense—and FUN! My first language is German—completely different spelling system—and I learned to read and write in English ‘the old way’. It did work alright, but I know, had I been taught the way described in Uncovering the Logic of English, it would have been SO much easier!” —Valerie Adomakoh, Parent, Non-Native English Speaker “I am a certified reading specialist and have been studying reading instruction for years, but most of the information in Eide’s book was completely new to me... If you are a parent or educator, this passage from Eide’s is a MUST-READ! She provides critical information and insights for all of us…” —Susan Kruger, M.Ed., Author of the best-selling book SOAR Study Skills and Founder of www.StudySkills.com",

      "content": "Introduction A s I have spoken with people around the country, I have discovered a pervasive belief: English spelling is inconsistent, illogical, and, for some, impossible. This apparent “flaw” with English has caused deep frustration not only within our schools—public, private, and home—but through all levels of society. We have professionals who cannot spell, parents who cannot answer their children’s questions, and employers who are despairing at the low literacy rates of the workforce. Language, both spoken and written, is the foundation of all academics and the medium by which we conduct business, science, politics, and relationships. Without a firm grasp of our language, we sever the Achilles tendon of our society and of the individuals within it. The United States currently has one of the lowest literacy rates in the developed world. According to the Nation’s Report Card, 34% of fourth graders cannot read, and 68% are below proficient. 1 An astounding 68% of eighth graders test below grade level in reading. 2 These statistics continue on through the adult population; fully 48% of adults are not proficient in reading. 3 This is at a time in history when the economy demands more highly skilled workers each year, and competition in highly trained fields such as science and engineering is exploding worldwide. Not only do we need to increase literacy rates to stay competitive in a world economy, but illiteracy and remedial education cost our nation $536 billion each year 4 and are primary factors in both crime and poverty. 5 Teaching reading so that everyone succeeds is vital to the health of our society and our economy. The information contained in Uncovering the Logic of English is not new. You may be surprised to learn that, with some variations, the spelling rules and phonograms already are used with great success by dyslexia institutes and reading centers around our nation. For unknown reasons, this “intensive phonics” is saved almost exclusively for students who struggle. I simply cannot understand why material that effectively teaches almost all students 6 has been reserved for remedial reading centers. As a nation, we need to rethink how reading is taught in our schools and thereby prevent many children from needing outside help in the first place. As you read, I hope it becomes apparent that knowing the logic of English benefits everyone who uses this language. You, too, might shake your head at points in this book and say, “Why didn’t someone tell me this before?” In these pages, you will discover the answers to your long-held questions about English, and you will learn answers for your children as they are learning to read and spell. I have taught numerous reading and spelling classes ranging from 45 minutes to three days in length. The participants have included teachers from public and private schools, special education teachers, and homeschool parents. The response has been unanimous: “Why wasn’t I taught this in elementary school? It all makes so much sense!” Many professional teachers have told me after a one-hour presentation, “I learned more in one hour than in all my methods classes in graduate school.” With this information I am resoundingly confident that we can teach reading at a fraction of the cost, and with much higher success rates, than we currently do. To do so, it is essential that all students, all teachers, and all parents know the logic of English. The knowledge in this book is as basic to academic success as 1 + 1 = 2. Learning these basic concepts does not require expensive materials or a lot of resources. It simply requires teachers who know how English works and how students learn. When we combine the logic of English with strong methods, our whole society will reap the rewards economically, scientifically, educationally, and politically. Imagine a nation where 99% of third graders read at or above grade level and where our high schools are dominated not by students who are discouraged and frustrated but by confident young adults who are preparing to fulfill their life mission. Although I understand that, to some, reading a book of English rules might sound dull, I encourage you to let this book unfold the mystery of what may have seemed hopelessly chaotic. It will provide you with information you will be able to apply as soon as you sit down to write your next e-mail. You may also experience, as I do, that the coherence in the midst of complexity is more alluring than if it had been in plain sight all along. I hope you find this information as engaging and enlightening as I have and that you pass this book on to many others so that everyone can begin to understand the logic of English. Footnotes 1.

      "title": "The Problem of EngLish",
      "content": "The Problem of EngLish At the level of the written word, English is one of the most complex languages in the world. Due to this complexity, most English speakers do not know the basic building blocks of the language: the sounds, their corresponding written expressions, and the spelling rules that go with them. On the contrary, most English speakers are cynical about the language and readily dismiss it as a language of exceptions. But what if the problem is not the language itself but the rules we were taught? What if we could see the complexity of English as a powerful tool rather than a hindrance? Certainly, it is not as easy to learn to read and spell English as it is most other phonetic languages. Yet a finite number of tools unlock the mystery of 98% of the words in the English language. When these 104 tools are presented, nearly all students can succeed. Learning these tools also develops logic and higher-order thinking skills. When students learn to think systematically about English, a complex language, not only do they enhance their English language skills, but they also gain strategies by which to master foreign languages. To begin, we must understand the definition of word. Spoken words in all languages are formed by combining one or more sounds. This series of sounds carries meaning. Each sound is called a phoneme. English is comprised of 44 unique phonemes which combine together to form words. This presents the first problem: the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet are inadequate to describe the 44 spoken phonemes or sounds. To solve this discrepancy, English adds 48 multi-letter phonograms. A phonogram is a letter or combination of letters which represents one or more sounds. When we only teach children the alphabet, even if we include long and short vowel sounds, we give the false impression that English has only 31 sounds. This is the beginning of the prevailing confusion. To provide students with a more complete understanding of English they must master not only 26 letters but the 74 basic phonograms. The second problem with English is that the language contains immense variety and choice. The 44 sounds can be spelled in 74 basic ways, 25 of which make more than one sound. The fact that phonograms frequently say more than one sound results from the fact English words often shift in pronunciation when suffixes and prefixes are added. Consider the sounds of the A in vacate, evacuate, and vacation. In order to preserve the relationship in meaning between each of these words, the A represents three different sounds. Due to the unique challenges with spoken English, spellings are chosen to represent sound while preserving meaning. In other words, English is a morpho-phonemic language where the morphology or meaning of words is balanced with the phonemic representation of words, resulting in some phonograms representing multiple sounds. This means a student of English must learn all the sounds represented by each phonogram. The third problem is that phonograms alone do not unlock the mystery of English spelling. There are 30 spelling rules which interplay with the phonograms and affect the pronunciation and spelling of words. These rules apply to a vast majority of words and explain why they are spelled and pronounced in a particular manner. Without an understanding of these simple rules, some scholars have estimated English to have over 1,700 phonograms!1 The 30 rules that explain how the sounds interplay with one another bring order to the chaos. The fourth problem is that English is an amalgamation of languages. England’s location and history of occupation play a significant role in the development of modern-day English. It is beyond the scope of this book to describe the history of this development, but a few of the highlights are pertinent to our topic. From AD 43 to 410 the British Isles were occupied by Rome. This brought about a heavy influence of Latin. In fact, 90% of multisyllable words in English have Latin roots.2 After the Norman Invasion in 1066, the following 300 years of politics and trade were conducted in French. Many words in the English lexicon reflect this period. English is also influenced by Celtic, Norse, Anglo-Saxon, German, and increasingly other modern languages. Having grown with such rich influence, English has synonyms for most of its words, which allows for a tremendous range of meaning, precision, creativity, and expression. English is also a multi-cultural language. Words which represent objects, places, and peoples from other cultures are frequently brought into English while preserving spelling conventions from the language of origin. This history has misled many people to believe that English no longer follows patterns, which leads to the fifth problem plaguing English—the widespread assumption that English is illogical. In reality, the logic of English has been lost in the past 80 years to educators and the general public. The keepers of this knowledge remain a few reading centers, literacy specialists, dyslexia institutes, and researchers. Experts in these fields know that a majority of children who are presented with the whole picture of English, combined with solid methods, can succeed. Nevertheless, “intensive, systematic phonics” is often taught only as a last resort to those who have the resources to hire special tutors. It makes much more sense to provide all students with the knowledge needed to master English. After all, it is a complex code which many linguists do not understand. Why would we abandon our young students to solve a master puzzle like English on their own? Despite its complex phonetic system, many aspects of English are much simpler than other modern languages. English has a comparatively simple grammatical system. We do not need to memorize genders or conjugate adjectives. It has very little inflection and a comparatively short list of irregular verbs and plurals. It is helpful to remember that every language presents unique challenges to students; English is not alone. Learning to think logically about English develops minds which are more adept at meeting the challenges of other language systems. Learning 74 phonograms and 30 spelling rules is the most efficient route to mastering English. Put into perspective, English has the largest vocabulary in the history of the world. According to one count, there are more than 2 million words in the English lexicon.3 The average adult speaker knows between 40,000 and 60,000 words, with a well-educated adult mastering 200,000. Surely, the most efficient way to master such a large lexicon is to learn the 104 tools which together describe each of the words. Prior to the 1920s, reading was taught in a systematic manner, with students spelling their way into reading. A dramatic shift occurred during the educational reform movements of the 1920s and 1930s. Rather than beginning to teach reading with sounds and then using the sounds to build words, educators began with whole words. This became known as the Look-Say method. Students were required to memorize each word as an individual word picture. Today we refer to these as sight words. During this period, literacy rates plummeted, leading to the second reform movement: Whole Language. Educators blamed illiteracy on a lack of interest due to the repetitive nature of basal readers, such as Dick and Jane. Whole Language educators replaced boring readers with real books. They believed learning to read was much like learning to speak. Children who were surrounded with good books would naturally develop a love for reading and, with minimal guidance, be able to read. This inspirational hands-off approach was a disaster. In California, where whole language was mandated in 1987, the functional illiteracy rate soared to 60 percent.4 Nevertheless, both reforms have continued to influence how we teach English reading around the world. In the 1990s, a “new eclecticism” began as educators recognized the need for phonics in the classrooms. Eclectics teach reading “progressively.” They begin by teaching sight words and then progress to syllables and word families, followed by a smattering of phonics. In addition to the inconsistent and confusing nature of the eclectic approach, it does not teach English in a complete, systematic, and logical manner. The phonics that are presented are too little, too late, and disjointed. This method dangerously gives the impression that the logic of English is being taught while leaving glaring holes in content and continuing to employ many of the failed methods of the past, including a heavy reliance on sight words. When we teach sight words, we are effectively stripping the power of the code and asking students to memorize visual symbols for each word. Worse yet, the visual symbols have very little variation between words. How are children to memorize bag, beg, big, bog, and bug as different word pictures without knowledge of the code? They appear virtually the same. This is why so many children read the first letter and guess at the remaining word. Frequently, students taught with these methods make simple errors in reading because they are not able to handle the level of detail needed to decode the word correctly. Diane McGuinness, PhD, has shown that human memory is limited to approximately 2,000 individual symbols.5 Yet adult speakers of English need to master 40,000 to 200,000 words—an impossible task without the understanding of how to decipher the code. This is demonstrated by the fact that many of the adults who are functionally illiterate know between 1,000 and 2,000 sight words. Though these students were successful at the task presented to them—memorizing individual words—they are unable to use this knowledge to meaningfully decode new words and are thereby crippled from being able to read anything beyond the elementary level. This reality is reflected by what is commonly known as The Literacy Crisis. Footnotes 1. Nyikos, Julius. 1988. “A Linguistic Perspective of Functional Illiteracy.” The Fourteenth LACUS Forum 1987.

      "content": "The Problem of EngLish At the level of the written word, English is one of the most complex languages in the world. Due to this complexity, most English speakers do not know the basic building blocks of the language: the sounds, their corresponding written expressions, and the spelling rules that go with them. On the contrary, most English speakers are cynical about the language and readily dismiss it as a language of exceptions. But what if the problem is not the language itself but the rules we were taught? What if we could see the complexity of English as a powerful tool rather than a hindrance? Certainly, it is not as easy to learn to read and spell English as it is most other phonetic languages. Yet a finite number of tools unlock the mystery of 98% of the words in the English language. When these 104 tools are presented, nearly all students can succeed. Learning these tools also develops logic and higher-order thinking skills. When students learn to think systematically about English, a complex language, not only do they enhance their English language skills, but they also gain strategies by which to master foreign languages. To begin, we must understand the definition of word. Spoken words in all languages are formed by combining one or more sounds. This series of sounds carries meaning. Each sound is called a phoneme. English is comprised of 44 unique phonemes which combine together to form words. This presents the first problem: the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet are inadequate to describe the 44 spoken phonemes or sounds. To solve this discrepancy, English adds 48 multi-letter phonograms. A phonogram is a letter or combination of letters which represents one or more sounds. When we only teach children the alphabet, even if we include long and short vowel sounds, we give the false impression that English has only 31 sounds. This is the beginning of the prevailing confusion. To provide students with a more complete understanding of English they must master not only 26 letters but the 74 basic phonograms. The second problem with English is that the language contains immense variety and choice. The 44 sounds can be spelled in 74 basic ways, 25 of which make more than one sound. The fact that phonograms frequently say more than one sound results from the fact English words often shift in pronunciation when suffixes and prefixes are added. Consider the sounds of the A in vacate, evacuate, and vacation. In order to preserve the relationship in meaning between each of these words, the A represents three different sounds. Due to the unique challenges with spoken English, spellings are chosen to represent sound while preserving meaning. In other words, English is a morpho-phonemic language where the morphology or meaning of words is balanced with the phonemic representation of words, resulting in some phonograms representing multiple sounds. This means a student of English must learn all the sounds represented by each phonogram. The third problem is that phonograms alone do not unlock the mystery of English spelling. There are 30 spelling rules which interplay with the phonograms and affect the pronunciation and spelling of words. These rules apply to a vast majority of words and explain why they are spelled and pronounced in a particular manner. Without an understanding of these simple rules, some scholars have estimated English to have over 1,700 phonograms!1 The 30 rules that explain how the sounds interplay with one another bring order to the chaos. The fourth problem is that English is an amalgamation of languages. England’s location and history of occupation play a significant role in the development of modern-day English. It is beyond the scope of this book to describe the history of this development, but a few of the highlights are pertinent to our topic. From AD 43 to 410 the British Isles were occupied by Rome. This brought about a heavy influence of Latin. In fact, 90% of multisyllable words in English have Latin roots.2 After the Norman Invasion in 1066, the following 300 years of politics and trade were conducted in French. Many words in the English lexicon reflect this period. English is also influenced by Celtic, Norse, Anglo-Saxon, German, and increasingly other modern languages. Having grown with such rich influence, English has synonyms for most of its words, which allows for a tremendous range of meaning, precision, creativity, and expression. English is also a multi-cultural language. Words which represent objects, places, and peoples from other cultures are frequently brought into English while preserving spelling conventions from the language of origin. This history has misled many people to believe that English no longer follows patterns, which leads to the fifth problem plaguing English—the widespread assumption that English is illogical. In reality, the logic of English has been lost in the past 80 years to educators and the general public. The keepers of this knowledge remain a few reading centers, literacy specialists, dyslexia institutes, and researchers. Experts in these fields know that a majority of children who are presented with the whole picture of English, combined with solid methods, can succeed. Nevertheless, “intensive, systematic phonics” is often taught only as a last resort to those who have the resources to hire special tutors. It makes much more sense to provide all students with the knowledge needed to master English. After all, it is a complex code which many linguists do not understand. Why would we abandon our young students to solve a master puzzle like English on their own? Despite its complex phonetic system, many aspects of English are much simpler than other modern languages. English has a comparatively simple grammatical system. We do not need to memorize genders or conjugate adjectives. It has very little inflection and a comparatively short list of irregular verbs and plurals. It is helpful to remember that every language presents unique challenges to students; English is not alone. Learning to think logically about English develops minds which are more adept at meeting the challenges of other language systems. Learning 74 phonograms and 30 spelling rules is the most efficient route to mastering English. Put into perspective, English has the largest vocabulary in the history of the world. According to one count, there are more than 2 million words in the English lexicon.3 The average adult speaker knows between 40,000 and 60,000 words, with a well-educated adult mastering 200,000. Surely, the most efficient way to master such a large lexicon is to learn the 104 tools which together describe each of the words.

It is well-documented by the popular press, the United States government, and academia, and is felt by every teacher with whom I speak: public, private, and homeschool. The literacy crisis resonates deeply within our hearts. For even if we were among those who learned to read proficiently, we all have unanswered questions and frustrations with English. The difference between the literate and the illiterate is that the literate blame the problems on English, but the illiterate blame themselves. Both demonstrate misplaced blame. The problem is neither English nor individuals. The problem is that we cannot know what we were never taught. The statistics are both numbing and consistent. Thirty-two percent of fourth graders read well, 34% test below proficiency, and 34% cannot read.1 Every time I meet an elementary school teacher, I ask if this reflects their experience. They all say it does. One third grade teacher who attended my class said, “This is my last resort. My principal will not allow me to teach intensive phonics in the classroom, but I am paying for my own training and using my own money to buy the kids materials. I plan to close the door and teach the children the logic of English. It makes so much sense. If it works, I will tell my administration. If it does not, I am quitting. I cannot continue failing these kids year after year.” The devastating reality is that the situation does not improve as students age. An astounding 69% of our eighth grade students are reading below grade level.2 Twenty-six percent of eighth graders are functionally illiterate, meaning they do not possess reading and writing skills adequate to function in daily life.3 Forty-eight percent of adults are not proficient readers, while 22% are functionally illiterate.4 Only 3% of adults test at the highest level of reading proficiency.5 Even when the population is limited to college graduates, the news is not encouraging. Only 10% of college graduates read at a high level of proficiency, 15% are below proficient, while 4% are functionally illiterate.6 The greatest complaint by employers and educators is that workers are not adequately prepared in basic reading and writing skills.7 Their complaint reflects the reality that only 17% of working adults are both well educated and proficient in literacy skills.8 Devastatingly, the literacy crisis is occurring during a time in history when jobs are becoming increasingly technical and the need for highly skilled workers is continually rising. Certainly something is deeply wrong with how we are teaching reading. It is simply not conceivable that 22%–70% of our population has a reading disability. What is clear is that students who do not thrive in first, second, and third grade continue to struggle through adulthood. It has been shown that success in reading is not linked to IQ, nor is it a problem of poverty alone. Forty-five percent of children in middle and high income families are struggling. Adult illiteracy is, however, connected to almost every socioeconomic issue in the United States.9 Fifty percent of the chronically unemployed and 60% of inmates are illiterate.10 Eighty-five percent of all juveniles in the court system are illiterate.11 Low literacy levels cost between $106 and $238 billion per year in health care spending, $225 billion in nonproductivity in the workforce,12 $1.4 billion13 to provide remedial education for students who have recently completed high school, and $2.314 billion in lost earning potential. This is a tragedy of enormous proportions to our society and to the hearts and minds of those who struggle. Yet we have known all along how to prevent the ruinous effects of illiteracy. Rudolf Flesch wrote about it in 1955 in his classic book titled Why Johnny Can’t Read.15 Dr. Samuel Orton performed vital research in the 1920s and '30s on reading, and scholars such as Romalda Spalding and Anna Gillingham committed their lives to preserving and developing this work. Yet on the whole, little to no improvement has been made in the past 40 years.16 We should all be asking, “Why?!” Writers state that the problem stems from a variety of issues: student motivation, poverty, distractions, television, illiterate parents . . . even the recent financial crisis is blamed. The award-winning book, Let’s End Our Literacy Crisis, claims there is one problem affecting every student: the inconsistent, illogical spelling of English words.17 The author, Bob Cleckler, suggests that the only solution to our literacy crisis is to radically reform our spelling system. Although it is true that children in many non–English speaking countries learn to read easily because of the one-to-one correspondence between the sounds and letters, it is not necessary to develop a new writing system for English. English already is phonetic. There is a solution for those who struggle with reading, and it encompasses our current spelling system. Students and their teachers and parents need to learn how English really works. We do not need to live in crisis any longer. Researchers have demonstrated that virtually all children are able to learn to read English when taught correctly.18 Using brain imaging technology, scientists are now able to study how our minds work while reading. People who are skilled readers rely heavily on an area of the brain which is used for speech and auditory processing and is located in the back left side of the brain. When struggling readers attempt to read, their brains show inactivity in this critical auditory region. With as little as eight weeks of intensive phonics training, the brains of struggling students begin to develop, and previously inactive areas begin to function like those of good readers.19 Our brains are wired to learn. It is through solid phonics instruction that the brain develops pathways for reading. When reading is not taught correctly, many students do not make solid connections between phonograms (the pictures of the sounds) and phonemes (the sounds themselves). Instead, they appear to rely heavily on the visual center of their brain and areas which may be related to higher order thinking or guessing. Given the combination of the opaque nature of the English code and teaching methods that emphasize the visual, this is not surprising. For students who are auditory or kinesthetic learners instead of visual learners, the result can be debilitating. When the phonograms and rules of English are taught in a systematic manner through solid, multimodality teaching methods which develop visual muscle memory, prevent reversals, and address the needs of all types of learners, we will be on our way to solving the literacy crisis for all its current victims and preventing it in future generations. The logic of English needs to be taught from the very beginning of every child’s education so that everyone can succeed. Footnotes 1. The Annie E.

Yet even navigating this powerful tool can be cumbersome. Many adults need to guess multiple times before spell-checker even recognizes the word they desire to correct. Many also confess to sometimes abandoning the perfect word choice due to their inability to look it up. Knowledge of the building blocks of words, however, enables spell-checker to be used much more easily and reduces the need for it in the first place. English is a phonetic language, albeit very complex. To teach English well, we need to move away from teaching only the names of the 26 letters and some of their sounds to teaching the true phonograms of English. Phono means “sound” and gram means “picture.” A phonogram, therefore, is a picture that represents a sound. Phonograms may consist of one, two, three, or four letters and may represent from one to six sounds. Although most phonograms represent only one sound, a few represent a combination of two or three sounds. Lack of knowledge about English phonograms reduces the ability to decode unfamiliar words encountered in reading. To “help” students, many schools teach “reading strategies” rather than solid phonics. Reading strategies are a series of steps students are taught to use when they encounter an unknown word. One commonly taught strategy is to look at the first and last letters of the word and then guess. Another strategy is to reread the sentence and guess from the context. A third is to look at the pictures for clues. With solid, systematic phonics education, none of these “strategies” are needed. Instead, students are provided the necessary tools to decode words internally based upon the phonograms which construct the word. When we think of phonics, most of us think of simple examples such as “C-A-T” spells the sounds /k-ă-t/ in cat. The limited phonics we are usually taught only describes a small percentage of the language. It applies most consistently to easy, one syllable words. Most English words, however, have two or more syllables. Knowing all the phonograms and rules enables students to read a word such as homogeneous and understand each sound within the context of the word. (This word is explained on page 143.) When solid phonics education is combined with a foundation in the roots of words, often even the definition becomes apparent. Phonograms are the most basic building blocks of all words in a phonetic language. Many adults in the U.S. know how to spell tens of thousands of words, but they have no idea why they are spelled in a particular manner, especially large words. Most readers rely heavily on the first and last letters of a word, with the middle of the word left as a mystery. Knowing the most basic building blocks, and being able to recognize them within words, will enable students to decode any word. This is not an innate ability but rather a skill that easily can be taught to all English speakers. The first step is to learn the 74 basic phonograms. Phonograms can be divided into two broad categories: single-letter phonograms and multi-letter phonograms.",

      "title": "Single-Letter Phonograms",
      "content": "Single-Letter Phonograms The single-letter phonograms are represented by the letters A–Z. These are the phonograms everyone recognizes as forming English words. Nevertheless, students are rarely taught all their sounds. For example, consider the phonogram s. Most programs teach that s has one sound, /s/. However, this does not account for very simple words such as is, his, has, was, rise, and does. When incomplete phonics is taught, students who think more logically and literally decode is and his as /ĭs/ and /hĭs/ rather than /ĭz/ and /hĭz/. It is important to understand that these students are not wrong; they are doing exactly what they were told to do. Compounding the problem is the fact that s is added to English nouns to form the plural. Most plurals are pronounced /z/ such as chairs, cars, houses, tables, pencils, pens, papers, etc. When the plurals are considered, s says /z/ 70% of the time. Certainly a sound that occurs 70% of the time is not an exception. Both sounds should be taught clearly from the beginning. Logical/literal students are our future engineers, mathematicians, and scientists. When we tell them that s says /s/, they apply it to every s they see and quickly discover that most of the S’s do not say /s/. In fact, most of the letters do not sound anything like what they were told. This short-circuits their logical minds. Many of these students become discouraged by English. I am convinced this is one of the reasons that boys tend to struggle with reading more than girls. Many boys think logically and literally. Girls generally tend to be more intuitive. Logical students do not tolerate inconsistent rules. The smattering of phonics usually given to them is not only unhelpful; it is damaging. At a time in history when our economy relies on advancements in science and engineering, we cannot afford to impair these gifted citizens by not teaching them English in a manner that respects how their minds work. But why don’t all students struggle? The sounds /s/ and /z/ are an unvoiced and voiced pair, formed in the same way in the mouth. Many intuitive students do not notice the difference between the two sounds. Their lack of concern for detail enables them to decode the words properly without complete information. These students are rewarded by today’s methods. Though intuition is a great strength, their logical/literal counterparts who are attuned to detail should not be marginalized. Teaching both sounds right from the beginning allows all students to succeed and prevents student and teacher frustration by eliminating unnecessary “exceptions.” I have spoken to countless professionals who hated learning to read and write and now rely on others to proofread their written work. Yet all they needed to be successful in reading and writing was complete information. If they can learn advanced mathematics, physics, chemistry, business structures, and even other languages, they can easily learn the 104 pieces that explain English. One final word about learning phonograms. It is important for reading and spelling to learn the phonogram sounds before the letter names. If a student learns “SEE AYE TEE,” this does not tell the student how to read the word cat. Letter names are useful and necessary for looking up words in a dictionary, reading eye charts, reading initials in a person’s name, etc. However, the letter names do not tell the student anything about how a word is read or spelled. The names are best learned after the phonogram sounds have been internalized.

      "title": "Multi-Letter Phonograms",
      "content": "Multi-Letter Phonograms In addition to the 26 single-letter phonograms, English has 48 basic multi-letter phonograms for a total of 74. Multi-letter phonograms are fixed combinations of letters that symbolize one or more speech sounds. They may have two, three, or four letters and are called digraphs, trigraphs, and quadgraphs. It is these phonograms that are most commonly left out of incomplete phonics programs. Many schools do teach what they believe to be phonics. They teach most of the sounds for A–Z and sometimes even a few multi-letter phonograms such as sh, ch, and th. This level of teaching often misleads students into believing that they have been given the complete picture and there is nothing left to figure out. Many students also wrongly assume that phonics must have made more sense to others. Incomplete phonics leaves a lot of holes, discouraged hearts, confused minds, and a seemingly unlimited number of exceptions. For example, children who are not taught that igh is “three-letter /ī/” will often carefully sound out each letter in light (/l-ĭ-g-h-t/) and feel utterly mystified when you suddenly announce, “That says /l-ī-t/.” Simply teaching igh says /ī/ will give students the tool to correctly decode the word. I was taught that ch says /ch/. Until a few years ago, I had never realized that it actually says three sounds, /ch-k-sh/. The word school was always a complete mystery to me, not to mention Christmas. French words such as chef, machine, and crochet were at first difficult to read and later difficult to spell. Simply knowing all three sounds provided clarity where confusion had reigned. Many educators mistakenly believe that good readers read whole words rather than reading phonetically. The prevailing thought is that readers who sound out words are slow, and that fast readers have actually developed instant recognition of the whole word. This is some of the theory behind the Dolch List, a commonly used list of 250 sight words. However, recent research using functional MRI has shown that good readers are actually processing the sounds one at time, even though they perceive it as a whole word.1 It is just that the brain is so fast, it appears they are reading whole words. In reality, though, they are converting the letters on the page to sounds. These studies have shown that the brain learns to read the same way it learns to talk—one sound at a time. Once students get the hang of reading the sounds, they speed up until it appears to be instantaneous. As one researcher concluded, “The use of intensive phonics is the only way to teach dyslexics and learning disabled individuals how to read and is the best way for everyone to learn to read.”2 This type of research further demonstrates the importance of teaching the 74 basic phonograms to all English speakers. The 74 basic phonograms are the most essential because they are the ones needed to spell the most frequently used words in English. They explain 98% of English words and are vital building blocks. The 74 basic phonograms should be taught thoroughly and systematically to all students from the beginning. They should not be reserved only for struggling students who make it to specialized reading centers. Learning the 74 basic phonograms is the true foundation for literacy and spelling. Mastering the phonograms only occurs with regular practice over time. Just as students need to memorize math facts like 1+1=2, these phonograms need to be memorized as well. There are plenty of games and methods to contextualize this kind of drill and make it interesting, fun, and effective. For more ideas on how to teach the phonograms, see The Phonogram and Spelling Game Book.

Once the sounds are familiar, the additional spelling aids introduced in Table 3 are helpful to learn as well. Most of the aids for spelling are derived from the rules which are covered in later chapters. The phonograms in Table 3 are grouped to highlight their relationships with one another. Many of the phonograms form pairs. Understanding their relationships and how the pairs are defined by spelling rules greatly reduces the difficulty of memorizing them.

The 100 most frequently used words make up 50% of all written material, while the 300 most frequently used words make up 65%.

The 74 basic phonograms are derived from the high frequency words. There are an additional 42 advanced phonograms listed in Appendix E. A phonogram may be classified as advanced if it does not occur early in high frequency word lists and if it represents a very limited number of words. Students who understand the 74 basic phonograms easily recognize advanced ones within words. Many of the advanced phonograms are related to the 74 basic phonograms. For example aigh says /ā/.

      "content": "Consonants, Vowels, and Syllables What They Are and Why They Matter Consonants and Vowels Most English speakers have memorized the vowels: A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y. However, I have seldom met anyone who knows the definitions of vowel and consonant. It is also rare for people to know how this knowledge contributes to the formation of syllables. Fewer yet can explain how knowing these basics will help them spell and read. Nevertheless, understanding consonants, vowels, and syllables is essential to reading and spelling. First, what is a vowel? A vowel is a sound that is produced when the mouth is open and the sound is not blocked by the lips, teeth, or tongue. Vowels are sounds that can be sustained, as in singing, and controlled for volume. To say a vowel sound, we must open our mouths. It is this opening that forms syllables. Consonants on the other hand are sounds which are blocked by the tongue, teeth, or lips in some way. Most of them are difficult to sing or control for volume. It is very simple to identify consonants and vowels. Simply try to sing or shout the sounds. If a sound can easily be sung or shouted and your mouth is open, it is a vowel. For example, /ă/. This sound can be sung and shouted, and the mouth is open. If it cannot be sung or shouted, such as /b/, it is a consonant. Be careful to isolate the /b/ sound; it is not pronounced /bŭ/, which would be spelled with the two phonograms, b and u. Some students want to classify /m/ as a vowel, because it can be sung. The mouth, however, is closed. The definition of a vowel is that the mouth is open and the sound can be sustained, as if it were being sung. If you perform this simple test on all 74 phonograms, you will discover English has 15 vowel sounds. They are /ă, ā, ä, ĕ, ē, ĭ, ī, ŏ, ō, oo, ŭ, ū, ü, oi, ow/.1 Vowels are essential to language. To demonstrate this, try to yell for help without the vowel sound (/hlp/!). It is impossible. Vowels create the most difficulty for reading and spelling in English. This is partially due to the fact that English is a vowel-rich language. Moreover, English has 28 ways to write the 15 vowel sounds, and most of the vowel phonograms can make more than one of the 15 sounds. To make matters even worse, the vowels are what vary the most among dialects and are typically not pronounced clearly the way they are spelled. For more information on vowels, see Chapter 16.",

      "content": "Syllables English is a rhythmic language. The rhythm is formed by syllables. A syllable is an uninterrupted segment of sound which is formed by the opening and closing of the mouth to form vowels. When we count the number of syllables, we are also counting the number of vowel sounds. Knowing how many syllables are in a word and where the syllable breaks occur greatly aids spelling. One of the easiest ways to learn to count syllables is to place your hand under your chin and count the number of times your mouth opens. If this fails, hum the word. For example: table would be hm-hm, whereas museum is hm-hm-hm. Because syllables are formed by vowels, every syllable has only one vowel sound you can hear. This does not mean that every syllable has only one single-letter vowel. Many of the vowels are multi-letter phonograms, which represent one vowel sound. For example, taunt has one vowel sound /ä/ written with the two letters A and U. Finally, every syllable must have a written vowel. In most words, L and R behave as typical consonants. However, the sounds /l/ and /r/ are similar to vowels in that they can be sustained. Though the sound is blocked by the tongue, there is less obstruction than with the other consonants. This means that /l/ and /r/ sometimes form a new syllable without a vowel sound. This occurs at the end of a word. Consider words such as ta-ble, waf-fle, a-cre, etc. Since every syllable must have a written vowel, a silent final E is added. See Chapter 7. Understanding the difference between a consonant and a vowel and knowing how to identify syllables is foundational to spelling. These concepts are built upon by the spelling rules and are essential to understanding the logic of English. Footnotes 1. Technically the long vowels /ā, ē, ī, ō, and ū/ as well as /oo/, /oi/, and /ow/ are diphthongs. A diphthong is two vowel sounds that are heard in one syllable. Since the average student of English associates long /ā/ as one vowel sound, for simplicity Uncovering the Logic of English also classifies diphthongs as one vowel, though in reality they represent two sounds.",

      "content": "Foundational Consonant Rules Most English speakers do not believe English has reliable spelling rules. Too often they were taught oversimplifications that only explained a small percentage of English words. For example, a commonly taught rule is “When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking.” Students are left wondering which sound of the first vowel should be used. Long /ē/ as in heat or short /ĕ/ as in head? This “rule” also does not account for words such as great, where the second vowel does the talking. These sorts of oversimplifications often generate more exceptions than words which follow the rule. Nevertheless, there are better rules which help to explain 98% of English words. These rules are carefully worded to provide clarity to the established patterns in English. There are three types of spelling rules:1) Rules that limit the usage of one or more given phonogram(s), 2) Rules that control how suffixes are added to words, and 3) Rules that explain which sound of a phonogram is heard based upon other patterns within the word. Letters may represent a sound, change the sound of another phonogram, or both at the same time. A diacritic is a phonogram that affects the sound of another phonogram by its proximity. For example, the silent final E in ripe informs the reader to read long /ī/ rather than short /ĭ/ as in rip. It is much more efficient to summarize diacritics as rules rather than to categorize each possibility as a new phonogram. English is not the only language in which the proximity of phonograms causes them to affect one another. In fact, some English rules, such as “C always softens to /s/ when followed by an E, I, or Y” (Rule 1), are found in most of the Latin-based languages. Knowing that these sorts of patterns are present in English teaches students to recognize them in other languages as well. The study of Latin has long been used as a tool to aid students’ understanding of how languages are structured at a sentence level. Likewise, the English language is an excellent vehicle for learning the word structure of languages. Think of English as a complex language puzzle. Once students discover the patterns and realize they are consistent, they will have the tools not only to read and spell in English, but to tackle other languages as well. This chapter covers the three foundational consonant rules. These simple rules clearly explain some of the most commonly misspelled words and resolve what are usually thought of as impossible exceptions.

I have asked the same questions to hundreds of teachers in the past few years. In my experience, less than 1% have answered it correctly, and fewer than 5% even knew we needed to add a K. We can clearly see how deeply broken our education system has become when the answer to this question is a rule which explains more than 9,000 words.1 Strong spellers typically rely on a word “looking right” to know if it is spelled correctly. These people are visual learners and frequently need to write down the word so they can see it. Picnicking and mimicking are examples where even strong visual learners struggle when they do not understand the rules of English. This first rule should be common knowledge to English speakers: Rule 1C always softens to /s/ when followed by E, I, or Y. Otherwise, C says /k/. Without the added K, picnicing would be pronounced /pĭc nĭ sĭng/, because the C says /s/ before an I. The K is inserted to protect the hard /k/ sound. The same is true of mimicking. Before we expand on what is occurring in picnicking and mimicking, we will explore the rule in more depth. First, C always softens to /s/ before E, I, and Y: center circus icy accent accident agency nitroglycerin ancillary cynicism Next, let’s consider when C says its hard sound. C says /k/: - before the other vowels: A, O, U: cat cot cut California balcony speculate abdicate abscond culinary - before a consonant: clap cranberry enacting - at the end of the word: arc pathetic acoustic This rule explains simple words and complex words. Once you know it, you will begin to see it everywhere. It greatly clarifies how to read words that contain a C, for it clearly explains when C will say /k/ and when it will say /s/. It also clearly explains why, in words such as circus, cycle, and accent, C can say both /k/ and /s/. This knowledge is also useful for spelling. Last week a seven-year-old I tutor used this rule to correct her own spelling. She was writing the word make. She initially wrote mace. She paused, then unprompted, erased the C and replaced it with a K. She saw that the C said /s/ before the E and knew that she needed to use K instead. The same process this young student used can be applied to words at all levels of English vocabulary. Let’s return to the word picnicking. Knowing C says /s/ only before E, I, and Y also aids us when adding the common endings -ing, -ed, and -y to words which end with C. We must add K to protect the C from softening to /s/.

      "title": "Foundational Vowel Rules",
      "content": "Foundational Vowel Rules English is a challenging language to spell and read, primarily due to the vowels. There are three difficulties with vowels. First, we have been misled to believe English has only 10 vowel sounds: short and long sounds for A, E, I, O, and U. In reality, English has 15 vowel sounds and 28 written phonograms which represent these sounds. Second, 16 of the vowel phonograms say more than one sound. Third, it is the vowel sounds that are most distorted in speech, vary the most between dialects, and often shift in pronunciation with the addition of prefixes and suffixes. Thankfully, there are rules which govern some of the vowels. These rules are foundational and help to explain a majority of English words. Vowel rules play two primary roles: first, they determine which vowel sound will be heard within a given word. Second, they limit the usage of particular vowel spellings. Before we continue, let’s review the definition of a vowel. A vowel is a sound that is produced with an open mouth. Vowels can be sustained, as in singing, and controlled for volume. Each of the single-letter vowels A, E, I, O, and U represents a long and short vowel sound. A, O, and U also make a third sound which is called the broad sound (see Table 4). Together the single vowels represent 13 vowel sounds. English also has a mysterious single letter vowel commonly learned as “sometimes Y.” Y is both a consonant and a vowel. It has four sounds /y-ĭ-ī-ē/ which we can categorize as consonants or vowels through the singing test. Because /y/ cannot be sung, it is a consonant sound. Since we are able to sing /ĭ/, /ī/, and /ē/, these are vowel sounds. In addition, though it is not commonly known, I also acts as both a vowel and a consonant. In words where I is saying the sound /ĭ/, /ī/, and /ē/, it is a vowel. In words such as onion and behavior where it says the /y/ sound, I is actually acting as a consonant.

      "content": "English Words Do Not End in I We will now turn to the vowel portion of Rule 3. This is a powerful rule which is used repeatedly throughout English spelling. Rule 3English words do not end in I, U, V, or J. At first glance, this rule may not appear particularly significant. Yet it is a thread woven throughout the phonograms, the silent final E rules, and rules for adding suffixes. Knowing this simple rule brings clarity to spelling and decoding. First we will consider the ramifications of the fact that English words do not end in I, and then we will explore the impact of words not ending in U. At the end of the chapter, we will consider some exceptions and how the rule provides insight into these words. The rule that English words do not end in I governs one of the most intricate relationships in English: the relationship between I and Y. The I/Y relationship is first seen in their shared vowel sounds. i y /ĭ/ mitt myth Jim gym /ī/ kind rhyme line type /ē/ piano lady radius ability I and Y also share the consonant sound: /y/. i y /y/ union yarn onion yesterday opinion lawyer brilliant canyon Based solely upon their sounds, /ĭ-ī-ē/ and /y/, I and Y are clearly related phonograms. Because English words do not end in I, Y covers for I at the end of English words. Whenever the vowel sound /ī/ is heard at the end of the word, Y must be written instead. cry try my Three phonogram pairs end in I and Y: ay and ai, ey and ei, and oy and oi. The rule that “English words do not end in I” governs these phonogram pairs. The phonograms which end in Y may be used at the end of English words. The phonograms that end in I may not be used at the end of English words. Once again, this is because English words do not end in I.

      "content": "English Words Do Not End in I We will now turn to the vowel portion of Rule 3. This is a powerful rule which is used repeatedly throughout English spelling. Rule 3English words do not end in I, U, V, or J. At first glance, this rule may not appear particularly significant. Yet it is a thread woven throughout the phonograms, the silent final E rules, and rules for adding suffixes. Knowing this simple rule brings clarity to spelling and decoding. First we will consider the ramifications of the fact that English words do not end in I, and then we will explore the impact of words not ending in U. At the end of the chapter, we will consider some exceptions and how the rule provides insight into these words. The rule that English words do not end in I governs one of the most intricate relationships in English: the relationship between I and Y. The I/Y relationship is first seen in their shared vowel sounds. i y /ĭ/ mitt myth Jim gym /ī/ kind rhyme line type /ē/ piano lady radius ability I and Y also share the consonant sound: /y/. i y /y/ union yarn onion yesterday opinion lawyer brilliant canyon Based solely upon their sounds, /ĭ-ī-ē/ and /y/, I and Y are clearly related phonograms. Because English words do not end in I, Y covers for I at the end of English words. Whenever the vowel sound /ī/ is heard at the end of the word, Y must be written instead. cry try my Three phonogram pairs end in I and Y: ay and ai, ey and ei, and oy and oi. The rule that “English words do not end in I” governs these phonogram pairs. The phonograms which end in Y may be used at the end of English words. The phonograms that end in I may not be used at the end of English words. Once again, this is because English words do not end in I. May use at the end of English words May not use at the end of English words ay/ai tray disdain ey/ei they vein oy/oi toy toil Only the may not forms of these phonogram pairs are restricted from being used at the end of words.

Everyone knows that they are used to make the vowel sound long, but there are at least as many silent final E’s that do not affect the vowel. For new readers this is terribly confusing. We teach the rule “The vowel says its name because of the E,” and the first real book the child reads is riddled with apparent exceptions: have, dance, give, love, move, loose, and on and on. We seem to be constantly telling new readers, “That is an exception.” When I taught my intuitive daughter to read, she seemed to blow past all these “exceptions” without concern.

      "content": "The Mystery of the Silent Final E's Solved! Silent final E’s are one of the most frustrating aspects of English. They seem to appear out of nowhere. Everyone knows that they are used to make the vowel sound long, but there are at least as many silent final E’s that do not affect the vowel. For new readers this is terribly confusing. We teach the rule “The vowel says its name because of the E,” and the first real book the child reads is riddled with apparent exceptions: have, dance, give, love, move, loose, and on and on. We seem to be constantly telling new readers, “That is an exception.” When I taught my intuitive daughter to read, she seemed to blow past all these “exceptions” without concern. She used the inconsistent rules as an approximation and proceeded to memorize each individual word. Since she does not have a photographic memory, this caused her a great deal of trouble with spelling.

      "content": "Adding Suffixes to Silent Final E Words Now the fun begins. The next rule helps even the best visual spellers by de-mystifying some of the most commonly misspelled words such as courageous and chargeable. When you know the reason for the silent final E within a given word, you will be able to use this knowledge to decide if the E needs to be kept or dropped when adding a suffix, thereby eliminating some of the most problematic exceptions to the language. In my elementary days, I learned the rule: “Drop the E and add -ing.” This helped me to correctly spell living, but it didn’t help me spell forcible correctly. Some people learned a better version: “Drop the E when adding a vowel suffix.” This rule explains words such as styling but leaves chargeable as an exception. Here is a concise rule which provides the best explanation: Rule 13Drop the silent final E when adding a vowel suffix only if it is allowed by other spelling rules. This rule leads us to two questions that must be asked when adding a suffix to silent final E words: Are we adding a vowel suffix? Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules?, e.g. C says /s/ before E, I, and Y. G may say /j/ before E, I, and Y. The E may be dropped only if the answer to both questions is “yes.” If the answer is “no” to either question, the E must be retained. Are we adding a vowel suffix? First, silent final E words only lose the need for the E when adding a vowel suffix. A vowel suffix is an ending that begins with a vowel. For example: -able, -ing, -ed, -ish, and -y. In contrast, a consonant suffix begins with a consonant. For example: -ly, -ness, -ful, -hood, and -ment. In the following examples, notice why the E is needed and that it is always retained when adding a consonant suffix. like1 + ly = likely achieve2 + ment = achievement force3 + ful = forceful puz zle4 + ment = puzzlement amuse5 + ment = amusement awe6 + some = awesome Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? Second, we must know if the E is needed to make the word conform to other spelling rules. The rules we need to be concerned about are: C says /s/ before E, I, and Y. G may say /j/ before E, I, and Y. Consider each of the following examples, and ask the questions for each word. like1 + ing = liking have2 + ing = having puz zle4 + ing = puzzling owe6 + ing = owing hope1 + ing = hoping achieve2 + ed = achieved tease5 + ing = teasing teethe5 + ing = teething In each of these words, both of the key questions may be answered with “yes.” The added suffix begins with a vowel, and the E is not needed for a C or G. So the E may be dropped. Carefully consider the following examples. notice3 + ing = noticing service3 + ed = serviced Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “Yes.” In this group of words the E may be dropped because the C will still say /s/ before the I and E. When a word has a silent final E to make a C say /s/, it is vital when adding a vowel suffix to determine if the E needs to be retained to keep the C soft. Remember, C says /s/ only before E, I, or Y. This interplay of rules explains many commonly misspelled words. Carefully consider the following examples using the questions for adding a suffix to silent final E words. notice3 + able = noticeable service3 + able = serviceable Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “No, without the E the C would say /k/.” Therefore, the E is retained. This same principle applies to words that have a silent final E to soften the G. Remember, G may say /j/ only before E, I, or Y. Consider the following examples: encourage3 + ing = encouraging charge3 + ing = charging advantage3 + ed = advantaged Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “Yes, the G will still says its soft sound.” Then drop the E and add the suffix. Now, consider the following words using the questions for adding a suffix to silent final E words. charge3 + able = chargeable advantage3 + ous = advantageous courage3 + ous = courageous Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “No.” Without the E the G would say /g/. Then do not drop the E.",

Carefully consider the following examples using the questions for adding a suffix to silent final E words. notice3 + able = noticeable service3 + able = serviceable Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “No, without the E the C would say /k/.” Therefore, the E is retained. This same principle applies to words that have a silent final E to soften the G. Remember, G may say /j/ only before E, I, or Y. Consider the following examples: encourage3 + ing = encouraging charge3 + ing = charging advantage3 + ed = advantaged Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “Yes, the G will still says its soft sound.” Then drop the E and add the suffix. Now, consider the following words using the questions for adding a suffix to silent final E words. charge3 + able = chargeable advantage3 + ous = advantageous courage3 + ous = courageous Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is dropping the E allowed by other spelling rules? “No.” Without the E the G would say /g/. Then do not drop the E.",

In these words the E is dropped even though we are adding consonant suffixes to form truly, duly, and argument. The E is retained, however, according to the rule in the derivative trueness. Type 4 Acreage—The root word acre has a silent final E because every syllable must have a vowel. In this case, the silent final E is retained because the suffix -age forms a new syllable and would leave the second syllable of a cre age without a vowel. This is the only known word where the E is retained for the syllable. Type 6 Awful—The root word awe has a silent E to add length to the word. The silent final E is dropped when adding the consonant suffix -ful to form awful. It is retained, however, in the derivative awesome. Type 8 Sometimes the E is retained when adding a vowel suffix in order to clarify homophones. Silent E Retained Homophone dye + ing = dyeing die + ing = dying singe + ing = singeing sing + ing = singing Other Judgment, acknowledgment—The root words judge and knowledge both end with the multi-letter phonogram dge.

In these words, the difference in accent is clear, for it is the difference in accent that distinguishes meaning. Put the ob' ject on the table. I ob ject' to that statement. The accented syllable is the one that is said a bit louder or more strongly than the others. Before analyzing words for accent, try the following experiment. Place your hand under your chin. Then whisper “help.” Now say “help” a bit more loudly. Then say it louder and louder until you are shouting. What happens to your mouth as you get louder? It opens wider, and the chin drops down farther. This same principle can be used to locate the accented syllable within a word. Because the accented syllable is the loudest, the mouth opens the farthest to say the accent. Therefore, the easiest way to find the accented syllable is to put your hand under your chin and say the word naturally. Use it in a sentence if needed. Feel on which syllable your chin drops down the farthest. That is the accented syllable. Find the accented syllable in the following words. Place your hand under your chin and say each word naturally.

      "content": "Questions This rule leads us to two questions that must be asked when adding a suffix to one vowel + one consonant words: Are we adding a vowel suffix? Is the syllable before the suffix accented?* *One-syllable words are always accented. If the answer to both questions is “yes,” double the last consonant and add the suffix. If the answer to either question is “no,” just add the suffix. Are we adding a vowel suffix? First, double the last consonant only when adding a vowel suffix. A vowel suffix is an ending that begins with a vowel. For example: -able, -ing, -ed, -ish, and -y. In contrast, a consonant suffix begins with a consonant. For example: -ly, -ness, -ful, -hood, and -ment. In the following examples, notice that the last consonant is not doubled when adding a consonant suffix. mad + ly = madly ship + ment = shipment com mit + ment = commitment for get + ful = forgetful e quip + ment = equipment Is the syllable before the suffix accented? Second, in order to apply this rule correctly to all words, we must know which syllable is accented. Double the last consonant only if the accent in the new derivative word is on the syllable before the suffix. Carefully consider the following words using the questions for adding a suffix. hop + ing = hop' ping rob + er = rob' ber swim + er = swim' mer cut + ing = cut' ting pin + ing = pin' ning ship + ing = ship' ping Are we adding a vowel suffix? “Yes.” Is the accent on the syllable before the suffix? “Yes.” Therefore, double the last consonant before adding the vowel suffix. The syllable before the suffix is always accented in one-syllable words. Therefore, the consonant is always doubled when adding a vowel suffix to one-syllable words ending in one vowel + one consonant. One way to simplify this rule for young students is to begin with one-syllable words and leave out the question of accent. In multisyllable words, on the other hand, it is vital to listen for (or feel)1 the accent. Compare each of the pairs carefully. In the first word, the syllable before the suffix is accented. Therefore, the consonant is doubled. In the second word, the syllable before the suffix is not accented. Therefore, the consonant is not doubled. medal + ion = me dal' lion medal + ist = med' al ist omit + ing = o mit' ting limit + ing = lim' it ing prefer + ing = pre fer' ring prefer + ence = pref' er ence confer + ing = con fer' ring confer + ence = con' fer ence Consider the following examples.

      "content": "Adding Suffixes to Single Vowel Y Words Words ending in single vowel Y are the final type of words that change when adding a suffix. The rule that governs words ending in Y is straightforward and easy to learn. It also explains some of the most frequently misspelled words such as business.1 As we have begun to show in chapter 6, there is a deep relationship between I’s and Y’s in English. There are four ways in which I’s and Y’s are related. First, they share three vowel sounds /ĭ-ī-ē/ and one consonant sound /y/. Second, since English words do not end in I, Y stands in its place at the end of words. Third, there are multi-phonogram pairs ending in I or Y which may or may not be used at the end of words. Fourth, as most of us know, Y’s change back to I’s when adding suffixes. Many English speakers feel confused about when the Y will change back to I. Others wonder why the Y remains in the words applying and employs but changes in application and theories. Here is a clear rule which explains when the Y changes to I. Rule 15Single vowel Y changes to I when adding any ending, unless the ending begins with I. This rule leads us to two questions that must be asked when adding a suffix to words ending in Y: Does it end with a single vowel Y? Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? If the answer to both questions is “yes,” change the Y to I and add the suffix. If the answer to either question is “no,” just add the ending. Does it end with a single vowel Y? First, it is vital to understand that this rule only applies to a single vowel Y. The multi-letter phonograms oy, ay, andey are two-letter vowels. The Y does not change to I when adding a suffix to words ending with a multi-letter phonogram. Consider each of the following words. boy + s = boys stray + ed = strayed survey + ed = surveyed annoy + ed = annoyed play + er = player attorney + s = attorneys Does it end with a single vowel Y? “No.” Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? Using the questions for adding a suffix to words ending with Y, consider each of the following words. busy + ness = business try + es = tries cry + er = crier worry + some = worrisome ornery + est = orneriest happy + ness = happiness puppy + es = puppies baby + es = babies salary + es = salaries cuddly + er = cuddlier Does “busy” end with a single vowel Y? “Yes.” Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? “Yes.” Therefore, change the Y to I before adding the suffix. Since English words do not end in I, Y acts as a stand-in for I at the end of the word. When a suffix is added, the I is no longer at the end. Therefore, the Y changes back to I. This occurs with any ending, unless the ending begins with I, because: Rule 16Two I’s cannot be next to one another in English words. With this in mind, consider the following examples: study + ing = studying cry + ing = crying worry + ing = worrying clarify +ing = clarifying baby + ish = babyish simplify + ing = simplifying Does it end with a single vowel Y? “Yes.” Does the suffix begin with any letter except I? “No.” Therefore, keep the Y before adding the suffix.",

      "content": "Adding Suffixes to Any Word Surely one of the most confusing aspects of English spelling is adding suffixes. However, in Uncovering the Logic of English, you have discovered there is a system which explains 98% of English words. The trick is to categorize the base words and to know which questions to ask for each type. The flow chart on the next page is an excellent reference guide for adding suffixes. This tool will direct you as to which rules to apply to various words when adding an ending. To add a suffix to any word, first ask the three questions in the first box. If the answers are all \"no,\" just add the suffix. If the answer to any of the questions is \"yes,\" continue by asking the questions for that type of word.

      "content": "Adding Suffixes to Any Word Surely one of the most confusing aspects of English spelling is adding suffixes. However, in Uncovering the Logic of English, you have discovered there is a system which explains 98% of English words. The trick is to categorize the base words and to know which questions to ask for each type. The flow chart on the next page is an excellent reference guide for adding suffixes. This tool will direct you as to which rules to apply to various words when adding an ending. To add a suffix to any word, first ask the three questions in the first box. If the answers are all \"no,\" just add the suffix. If the answer to any of the questions is \"yes,\" continue by asking the questions for that type of word.

Yet knowing these three phonograms helps to unlock the mystery of thousands of multisyllable words. The Latin spellings of /sh/ also expose an area where most English students are taught a gross oversimplification: most students learn only the ending -tion.

This sort of teaching gives an oversimplistic impression of the language and breeds confusion, whereas knowing that the phonograms ti, ci, and si each say /sh/ greatly simplifies decoding.

Recently, I was listening to an emerging reader sound out the word cooked. She read, “Cook Ed?” She looked very confused. Fortunately, knowing the three sounds of ed and why the variations exist provides a clear understanding of what is occurring and how to read past tense words. The same is true with spelling. To spell the word matched accurately, the writer must understand that this is the past tense form and that though /t/ is heard, it is spelled with the past tense ending ed. The sounds of ed, /ĕd-d-t/, vary depending upon the final sound heard in the base word.

      "content": "Exceptions There are no known exceptions to the pronunciation of the past tense ending ed described in Rule 20. Many people, however, claim irregular verbs are exceptions to forming the past tense. They often use irregular verbs as an example to prove how crazy the English language is. We have all heard jokes such as “If today I dive and yesterday I dove, why is it not, today I live and yesterday I love?” English is not alone in its plethora of irregular verbs. According to one source, English has 178 irregular verbs, whereas Modern Greek has over 500, Italian over 400, Icelandic 350.1 Memorizing irregular verb forms is a part of learning languages, particularly European languages. Nevertheless, most of the irregular verbs in English follow patterns. Knowing how to analyze language by looking for patterns and understanding the phonograms and rules greatly simplifies memorizing irregular verbs. We will consider six variations of irregular verbs below. (1) Many irregular verbs do not change in the past or participle form.

      "content": "Exceptions There are no known exceptions to the pronunciation of the past tense ending ed described in Rule 20. Many people, however, claim irregular verbs are exceptions to forming the past tense. They often use irregular verbs as an example to prove how crazy the English language is. We have all heard jokes such as “If today I dive and yesterday I dove, why is it not, today I live and yesterday I love?” English is not alone in its plethora of irregular verbs. According to one source, English has 178 irregular verbs, whereas Modern Greek has over 500, Italian over 400, Icelandic 350.1 Memorizing irregular verb forms is a part of learning languages, particularly European languages. Nevertheless, most of the irregular verbs in English follow patterns. Knowing how to analyze language by looking for patterns and understanding the phonograms and rules greatly simplifies memorizing irregular verbs. We will consider six variations of irregular verbs below. (1) Many irregular verbs do not change in the past or participle form.

      "content": "Forming Plural Nouns and Singular Verbs Forming Plural Nouns Just as there is logic to the past tense and its variations in pronunciation, there is logic to forming plurals and adding -s versus -es. The following rule is lyrical, teaches the spelling variation of the plural ending, and accounts for irregular English plurals. It is important when phrasing rules to alert students if there are irregularities to the language so as to not set up false expectations. Rules are to provide clarity, not to enhance confusion. Rule 21To make a noun plural, add the ending -S unless the word hisses or changes, then add -ES. Occasional nouns have no change or an irregular spelling. Let’s step through each part of this rule. Just add -S The most common way to make a noun plural is by adding the ending -S. sons banks chairs emotions Remember the phonogram s makes two sounds: /s/ and /z/. Hisses Say the sounds: /ch/, /s/, /sh/, /x/, and /z/. Notice that each of these sounds hisses as it ends. When a word ends in a sound that hisses, add -ES to form the plural. Try to pronounce each of the words below by adding the /s/ or /z/ sound for the plural without the additional vowel /ĕ/. watches glasses taxes quizzes pushes It is impossible to clearly articulate another /s/ or /z/ sound at the end of a word that hisses. Therefore, the vowel sound /ĕ/ is inserted to ease articulation and ensure that the plural ending is clearly heard in speech. Changes When the root word changes to form the plural, add -ES. This is true for silent final E words that drop the E, and for Y’s that change to I. gate + es = gates page + es = pages baby + es = babies story + es = stories In addition, some singular words that end with F change to V in the plural. When F changes to V, add -ES to form the plural. thief + es = thieves wolf + es = wolves knife + es = knives shelf + es = shelves No Change Before we talk about nouns which do not change in the plural form, we need to distinguish the two categories of English nouns: count and non-count nouns. The difference is determined by asking a simple question: can this noun be counted? If it is a person, place, thing, or idea that can be counted or tallied, it is a count noun and has a plural form. For example, it is possible to count the number of teachers, parks, tables, and holidays. Each of these nouns, therefore, has a plural form. A non-count noun cannot be counted. Many non-count nouns are ideas such as friendship, mathematics, and poetry. Other non-count nouns are too numerous to be counted individually and therefore are measured in standard units such as inches, degrees, and pounds. Examples include cloth, heat, sugar, and gold. Others are typically not counted or measured such as hair and dust. Non-count nouns do not have a plural form and take a singular verb in sentences. The sugar is in the cupboard. Mathematics is my favorite subject. My hair flies into my face in the wind. When Rule 21 states: Occasional nouns have no change . . . it is referring to count nouns which do not change between the singular and plural form. cod perch trout walleye tuna shrimp moose sheep bison swine aircraft cannon series species kiwi These nouns can be either singular or plural in a sentence. The number is determined by any associated adjective or by the verb form. I saw one deer in my backyard. The deer is eating my garden. I saw many deer in my backyard. The deer are eating my garden. Irregular Spelling Many nouns have irregular spellings which reflect the original language. English, however, is not a static language. Over time many of the spellings have adapted to the English convention of adding -S to form the plurals. Many words now have both an irregular and a normalized English plural form. Both are accepted spellings.

      "content": "The Final Spelling Rules In this chapter we will learn the final six spelling rules. Four of the rules limit the usage of the phonograms dge, ck, tch, and z. Another limits the usage and pronunciation of phonograms ending in GH. The final rule clarifies the spelling of many common words. Rule 25DGE is used only after a single vowel which says its short (first) sound. badge ledge bridge lodge judge The phonogram dge may not be used after a consonant, a long vowel sound, a third vowel sound, or a multi-letter phonogram. Since English words do not end in I, U, V, or J, dge is a common spelling of the sound /j/ at the end of words. The other commonly used spelling is G followed by a silent final E. When the sound /j/ is heard at the end of the word and is preceded by a consonant or a long vowel sound, it is spelled G followed by a silent final E. See chapter 7. large gorge charge rage huge age Rule 26CK is used only after a single vowel which says its short (first) sound. back neck truck lock et The phonogram ck is limited in the same way as dge. It may not be used after a consonant, long vowel sound, third vowel sound, or multi-letter phonogram. Rule 27TCH is used only after a single vowel which does not say its name. match etch glitch splotch hutch This rule varies from the previous two because in watch, the phonogram a is saying its third sound /ä/ and in butcher the phonogram u is saying its third sound /ü/. The rule, therefore, draws the restriction around vowels near tch differently than Rules 25 and 26. Rule 28AUGH, EIGH, IGH, OUGH. Phonograms ending in GH are used only at the end of a base word or before the letter T. The GH is either silent or pronounced /f/. Phonograms spelled with a GH are found only at the end of the word, laugh weigh sigh tough and before the letter T. caught weight night bought Words containing the letters GH originate in Old English. The GH was pronounced /kh/. In most modern English words the sound has been dropped; the GH is now silent. taught eight fight fought In seven words the GH is pronounced /f/: enough rough laugh draught cough trough tough Rule 29Z, never S, spells /z/ at the beginning of a base word. zipper zoo zebra It is helpful to realize s never spells /z/ at the beginning of a word. Written Z’s are rather uncommon in English, though they may occur anywhere within the word. There is no rule to indicate which spelling of the sound /z/ will be used in the middle or at the end of the word. is chairs resist wise buzz amaze prize enzyme Knowing the phonograms and rules does not eliminate all memorization. Rather, they aid us in identifying which parts of words need careful attention. Words that contain the phonogram z in the middle or at the end are less common and will need additional thought and maybe practice. Rule 30We often double F, L, and S after a single vowel at the end of a base word. Occasionally other letters also are doubled. off ball loss ebb odd egg inn watt jazz This rule is carefully worded to say we often double the letters. It is vital to not overstate rules and create unnecessary exceptions. Though the rule does not tell us when to double letters, it does cue the learner that F, L, and S are the most commonly doubled letters and to be aware that this occurs with other consonants as well. In addition, Rule 30 restricts doubling to after a single vowel at the end of the word. Final letters are not doubled after a multi-letter vowel or after a consonant. reef tool famous bulb Occasionally other consonants are doubled as well.

Rule 27TCH is used only after a single vowel which does not say its name. match etch glitch splotch hutch This rule varies from the previous two because in watch, the phonogram a is saying its third sound /ä/ and in butcher the phonogram u is saying its third sound /ü/. The rule, therefore, draws the restriction around vowels near tch differently than Rules 25 and 26. Rule 28AUGH, EIGH, IGH, OUGH. Phonograms ending in GH are used only at the end of a base word or before the letter T. The GH is either silent or pronounced /f/. Phonograms spelled with a GH are found only at the end of the word, laugh weigh sigh tough and before the letter T. caught weight night bought Words containing the letters GH originate in Old English. The GH was pronounced /kh/. In most modern English words the sound has been dropped; the GH is now silent. taught eight fight fought In seven words the GH is pronounced /f/: enough rough laugh draught cough trough tough Rule 29Z, never S, spells /z/ at the beginning of a base word. zipper zoo zebra It is helpful to realize s never spells /z/ at the beginning of a word. Written Z’s are rather uncommon in English, though they may occur anywhere within the word. There is no rule to indicate which spelling of the sound /z/ will be used in the middle or at the end of the word. is chairs resist wise buzz amaze prize enzyme Knowing the phonograms and rules does not eliminate all memorization. Rather, they aid us in identifying which parts of words need careful attention. Words that contain the phonogram z in the middle or at the end are less common and will need additional thought and maybe practice. Rule 30We often double F, L, and S after a single vowel at the end of a base word. Occasionally other letters also are doubled. off ball loss ebb odd egg inn watt jazz This rule is carefully worded to say we often double the letters. It is vital to not overstate rules and create unnecessary exceptions. Though the rule does not tell us when to double letters, it does cue the learner that F, L, and S are the most commonly doubled letters and to be aware that this occurs with other consonants as well. In addition, Rule 30 restricts doubling to after a single vowel at the end of the word. Final letters are not doubled after a multi-letter vowel or after a consonant. reef tool famous bulb Occasionally other consonants are doubled as well.

Although speakers of each dialect usually can understand one another, there are distinctions which influence the pronunciation of various words. These variations in pronunciation are most distinct with the sound /r/ and vowels. Many speakers either add or drop /r/ sounds and morph vowel sounds based upon their dialect of English. In the United States people in the Midwest pronounce the word ten /tĕn/. In the South the same word is commonly pronounced /tĭn/. If Southerners were to write ten exactly as they pronounce it, they would misspell it, tin. In addition, when reading, a young Southern student may not recognize /tĕn/ as the same word they commonly pronounce /tĭn/. To solve this problem we must teach all students to think /tĕn/ for purposes of reading and spelling. This process is no different from the methods we use to auditorily recognize the speech of a person from another region. Just as we learn to hear words pronounced in other ways, we can learn to recognize that though the standard spelling may not represent our speech pattern, it does represent the speech pattern in some other region. Students should be explicitly taught these connections rather than left to discover them on their own. Learning to pronounce words literally for spelling and reading purposes does not mean that students need to alter their daily pronunciation. Saying a word to spell and read is simply a tool to understand and memorize why a word is spelled in a particular manner. Learning to pronounce the word for spelling purposes also heightens awareness of variations in pronunciation.

      "content": "The Schwa The schwa sound /ә/ is one of the distinctions of modern English speech. It is the most common spoken sound in both British and American English. The /ә/ is an essential part of the rhythmic patterns of English and is formed by unaccented syllables. If you recall, we open our mouths most widely on the accented syllable. This opening results in clearly articulated vowel sounds. The schwa is an unaccented vowel sound where the mouth is less open, and therefore, the vowel sound is less clear. The pronunciation of any English vowel may degrade to /ә/ in an unstressed syllable. Multisyllable words have stressed and unstressed syllable(s). In both American and British English most vowels in an unaccented syllable are pronounced /ә/. Consider the following examples: We write We say con' stant /kŏn' stәnt/ trav' el /trăv' әl/ cous' in /kŭ' zәn/ li' on /lī' әn/ doc' tor /dŏk' tәr/ free' dom /frē' dәm/ ig' no rance /ĭg' nә rәns/ It is best to teach students to pronounce each syllable for spelling as if it were accented. Exaggerating the pronunciation of words to create an auditory picture is a powerful tool to internalize correct spellings. It provides a system that is clear and rules that are consistent. Consider the following examples: We write We say We say to spell con' stant /kŏn' stәnt/ /kŏn' stănt/ trav' el /trăv' әl/ /trăv' ĕl/ cous' in /kŭ' zәn/ /kŭ' zĭn/ li' on /lī' әn/ /lī' ŏn/ doc' tor /dŏk' tәr/ /dŏk' tōr/ free' dom /frē' dәm/ /frē' dŏm/ ig' no rance /ĭg' nә rәns/ /ĭg' nō răns/ Another tool to determine the correct spelling of a vowel that is pronounced with a schwa is to find derivatives which have the accent placed on the desired syllable. Because English is a morpho-phonemic language where spellings are chosen to represent both sound and meaning, it is often possible to find a derivative where the vowel sound is clearly pronounced because the syllable is now accented. Though this does not work for all words, it can be a simple way to clarify the spelling of a syllable with a schwa sound. Unaccented Accented vә ca' tion vā' cate pә lit' i cal pŏl' it ics vi' tәl vi tăl' i ty spә ci' fic spē' cies def' ә nite de fīne' Since words within a sentence also have varying amounts of stress, the schwa sound also occurs within short grammatical words. The important words, such as nouns, main verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, are stressed in speech. Therefore, their vowels are clearly articulated. The small grammar words such as articles, helping verbs, pronouns, and conjunctions are not stressed. As a result, the vowels within these words usually degrade into the schwa sound. Consider: We write We say The man' sat'. /THә măn săt./ a cup' of tea' /ә kŭp ә tē/ what time' /whәt tīm/ She' was late'. /shē wәs lāt./ It is beneficial to teach students to exaggerate the pronunciation of these words for spelling purposes. Just as with the issues related to dialects, it is important to make clear connections between what we say to spell and what we say in normal speech. We write We say We say to spell the /THә/ /THē/ a /ә/ /ā/ what /whәt/ /whät/ was /wәz/ /wäz/ The lack of clear articulation of vowel sounds in unstressed syllables and words is a challenge for consistent spelling. Some people suggest that the schwa sound should be added to every vowel phonogram. This would provide no additional clarity for spelling. It would necessitate adding the schwa to every vowel phonogram, thus relegating virtually every multisyllable word to rote visual memory. Students who are visual learners already learn to spell by memorizing how each word looks. If questioned on the spelling of a particular word, these learners will often write the word down to see if it looks right. They are relying on sight alone. However, reading and spelling are best taught using all of our learning modes: hearing, speaking, doing, and seeing. When we use all the learning modes, the learning is deeper and faster. This is because each mode utilizes a different area of the brain. When all the areas are used simultaneously, we build synapses between the regions. Teaching by hearing, speaking, doing, and seeing also allows all students to utilize their strongest learning style while strengthening their areas of weakness. Exaggerating the pronunciation of words for spelling adds the hearing and speaking modes. When this is combined with writing the words and logically analyzing the phonograms and spelling rules that are used, all students become more engaged and internalize spellings more quickly and deeply.",

Therefore, it is best to teach students to create an auditory picture of each word as well. Students should be guided to clearly pronounce each vowel sound, enunciate /r/ sounds that are otherwise dropped, and articulate sounds that are distorted by close proximity to one another. When this is combined with writing, a kinesthetic experience of the word, all students’ learning styles are covered, leading to faster and deeper learning. Footnotes 1. McGuinness.

      "content": "Conclusion Most visual learners rely on memorizing the shape of individual words. This strategy, however, only works for students with strong visual memories. Therefore, it is best to teach students to create an auditory picture of each word as well. Students should be guided to clearly pronounce each vowel sound, enunciate /r/ sounds that are otherwise dropped, and articulate sounds that are distorted by close proximity to one another. When this is combined with writing, a kinesthetic experience of the word, all students’ learning styles are covered, leading to faster and deeper learning. Footnotes 1. McGuinness.

A suffix is a group of letters added to the end of a root which alters the meaning or part of speech. An affix is a group of letters added to either the beginning or ending of a word. There are two types of affixes in English: suffixes and prefixes. A base word is a word that can stand alone when all the affixes have been removed. Let’s consider the word renew. If we remove the prefix re- the base word new is left. New is a recognizable English word that stands alone, therefore it is a base word. A root carries the primary meaning of the word but is not necessarily an English word when all the affixes have been removed. In the previous example, new is the root of the word renew. New stands alone, so it is also a base word. The word revive also has the prefix re-. Though vive is the root, vive is not a base word because it is not a recognizable English word. Roots which are not English words are sometimes call bound bases. A derivative is a word formed by adding suffixes and prefixes to a root or by combining two base words to form a compound word. Morphemes are the smallest word parts that carry meaning. Morphemes include roots, base words, suffixes, and prefixes.

      "title": "Roots",
      "content": "Roots Once students have mastered this process using base words, they are ready to apply their knowledge to roots. Remember, roots do not always stand alone as English words. Roots, especially Latin and Greek roots, are replete throughout English. Learning to recognize these roots and their meanings greatly reduces the amount of rote memory work for both spelling and vocabulary development. A powerful example of an Old English root is found in the following words. twin twelve twice twelfth twenty two Each of these words contains the root tw, meaning “two.” Likewise, they all refer in some way to the number 2. Once students understand the root tw, they are not likely to mix up the homophone two with to and too and they will begin to understand how English spelling conventions reflect both sound and meaning. Learning Latin and Greek roots is even more powerful than studying the English roots. Sixty percent of English vocabulary and 90% of scientific terminology is derived from Latin and Greek.4 Ninety percent of all multi-syllable words are Latin based, and most of the remaining 10% are Greek based.5 Each of these roots generates up to a dozen or more related words. It is extremely beneficial, therefore, for students to study vocabulary and spelling within the context of Latin and Greek roots. Ideally, all teachers in the K-12 system would understand the logic of English and its value for teaching vocabulary. They would help students connect the vocabulary taught in their classes to other English words and to their roots. This should begin in the very earliest grades. For example, in an elementary math class, teachers should connect the base word quart with its meaning fourth. A quarter (25 cents) is a fourth of a dollar; a quart is a fourth of a gallon; a quarter (1/4) is a fourth; a quartet is four musicians. A one- or two-minute vocabulary connection point would not only aid students in mastering a particular word but also reinforce how words are constructed in English and teach students to look for patterns. Latin and Greek roots are the cornerstone of scientific vocabulary. Close to 100% of scientific terms have Latin or Greek roots. Understanding basic roots provides a context for learning the technical language of science outside of rote memorization. For example, the Latin term ignus means “fire.” This should be connected to commonly used terms such as ignition, ignite, and igniter. With these connections it becomes clear that igneous rock was formed by fire or produced in molten lava. A high school science teacher who is introducing the terms exothermic and endothermic should draw connections to other known words. Therm-, the Latin root for heat, is clearly related to words such as thermal, thermometer, and thermostat. Exo- is a prefix which means out. The teacher could point out that when a student exits the classroom they go out, an exoskeleton is one located outside the body, and something that explodes moves outward. Therefore an exothermic reaction is one that releases heat outward. The Latin prefix, endo-, means in. It is also found in the term endoskeleton, which is a skeleton located inside the body, and endosperm, food found inside a seed. An endothermic reaction thus absorbs heat or draws heat in. A history teacher could aid students in understanding the Acropolis by showing students that acro- means heights as in an acrobat and acrophobia, and that polis means city as in Minneapolis, Annapolis, Indianapolis, and metropolis. Consider the word malicious, commonly found on middle and high school vocabulary exercises. Usually it is embedded in a list of ten to fifteen unconnected words which students are asked to memorize for a vocabulary test later in the week. It only takes a few minutes to create mental hooks on which to hang the new term and thereby increase long-term retention for all learners. Students who are asked to find other words they know with the root mal- will usually state words such as malfunction, maltreated, malformed and malnourished. Since malfunction means to function badly, maltreated is treated badly, malformed is badly formed, etc., students will be able to deduce that mal- means “bad.” These can also be connected to maladjusted, dismal, malignant, malice, malefactor, and malady. By comparing delicious, ambitious, gracious, spacious and suspicious to malicious, students will notice that the suffix -cious means “full of something.” They are then are able to deduce that malicious means “full of bad/evil.” Knowing roots also increases our understanding and appreciation for literature. This is true not only of the classics. Even contemporary writers often play with roots. The Harry Potter series is one example. Consider the character Malfoy. Knowing the meaning of the root mal provides insight into the character that may otherwise not be known. Understanding roots enriches good writing and enables us to more fully appreciate plays on words. Examine the following examples. Consider how each word is related in meaning and spelling and how these relate to the root. specto - to look at mot - to move laboro - to work inspect motion laboratory spectacles motor labor spectacle promote collaborate spectator demote elaborate spectacular locomotive laborious circumspect motivation laborer respect motive lab Each of the derivatives reflects the meaning of the root. Consider how knowing that specto means “to look at” unlocks the meaning to each of the derivatives. To inspect is to look at carefully. Spectacles are used to improve the eye’s ability to look at things. When people make a spectacle of themselves, they become something to look at. A spectator is someone looking at an event. Something spectacular is something amazing to look at. Circumspect means looking carefully all around. To respect is to look on someone with regard. This same reasoning can also be applied to mot and laboro. The twenty most common prefixes and suffixes can also be added to Latin roots. Segmenting the word into its parts, it is possible to discover how words are constructed to convey meaning. demote = de + mote The root mote means “to move.” The prefix de- means “down” as in depress and devalue. Demote therefore means “to move down.” This is consistent with its usage: to move down in position or rank. extract = ex + tract The root tract means “to pull.” The prefix ex- means “out.” To extract means “to pull out.” destructive = de + struct + ive The root struct means “to build.” The prefix de- means “down.” The suffix -ive connotes an adjective. Destructive describes something that builds down. In addition to learning Greek and Latin roots, learning the meaning of common Latin and Greek prefixes can be a simple way to unlock the meaning to dozens of related words. It is more efficient to study the parts of words and how they work than to memorize each individual word. For example, ambi- is a Latin prefix meaning both. ambidexterous able to use both hands with ease. ambiguous having two or more possible meanings ambitendency having two conflicting tendencies ambivalent unable to decide between two choices of equal importance. Roots are not limited to terms coined in the last century, either. Having an excellent command of roots, suffixes, and prefixes allows for great creativity in creating new words to describe inventions and discoveries. Xerox® is short for xerography, a word created to describe the new invention of “dry copying.” Xer- is the Greek root for “dry” and graphy for “picture.”",

      "content": "Roots Once students have mastered this process using base words, they are ready to apply their knowledge to roots. Remember, roots do not always stand alone as English words. Roots, especially Latin and Greek roots, are replete throughout English. Learning to recognize these roots and their meanings greatly reduces the amount of rote memory work for both spelling and vocabulary development. A powerful example of an Old English root is found in the following words. twin twelve twice twelfth twenty two Each of these words contains the root tw, meaning “two.” Likewise, they all refer in some way to the number 2. Once students understand the root tw, they are not likely to mix up the homophone two with to and too and they will begin to understand how English spelling conventions reflect both sound and meaning. Learning Latin and Greek roots is even more powerful than studying the English roots. Sixty percent of English vocabulary and 90% of scientific terminology is derived from Latin and Greek.4 Ninety percent of all multi-syllable words are Latin based, and most of the remaining 10% are Greek based.5 Each of these roots generates up to a dozen or more related words. It is extremely beneficial, therefore, for students to study vocabulary and spelling within the context of Latin and Greek roots. Ideally, all teachers in the K-12 system would understand the logic of English and its value for teaching vocabulary. They would help students connect the vocabulary taught in their classes to other English words and to their roots. This should begin in the very earliest grades. For example, in an elementary math class, teachers should connect the base word quart with its meaning fourth. A quarter (25 cents) is a fourth of a dollar; a quart is a fourth of a gallon; a quarter (1/4) is a fourth; a quartet is four musicians.

      "content": "Putting it All Together Learning the logic of English is important to solving our literacy crisis. The phonograms and rules presented in this book unlock the mystery of 98% of English words. As researchers have shown, systematically teaching the phonograms and rules ensures the success of all students. Unfortunately, the concepts in this book are not widely known among people who speak English. This has resulted in a literacy crisis which is affecting the entire fabric of our society. Some people have tried to blame the problems on English. Admittedly, English is a complex code, though in this complexity lie powerful tools of expression, nuance, creativity, and meaning. It is essential when teaching English to lay out the system of the language explicitly so that all students can succeed. English words are comprised of both phonograms (sound pictures) and morphemes (cues to the meaning). By learning the phonograms and rules that control their sounds, students acquire a strategy to sound out unknown words. By learning the morphemes, roots, suffixes, and prefixes, students grow better able to construe the meaning of unknown words. With these tools students no longer need to guess but have reliable strategies for reading and comprehending. The phonograms, rules, roots, suffixes, and prefixes also contribute to success in spelling. With the advent of computerized spell-checkers, we have too often dismissed the importance of spelling, leaving countless people struggling. Simply knowing the essential elements underlying each word informs writers. Though there remain some options for spelling, knowing the phonograms, rules, and roots greatly reduces the options and helps students identify which parts of words need more careful attention. Currently, 69% of our nation’s students are struggling with basic literacy skills. The material found in this book is vital to the next generation. Literacy is the foundation of our society—academically, civically, medically, environmentally, scientifically, and socially. Basic reading and writing skills should be taught in a manner that helps all students succeed. The logic underlying English should be known by everyone. When this information is combined with solid, multisensory teaching methods, we will experience a dramatic reversal in the literacy crisis. If the material in Uncovering the Logic of English has changed your understanding of the English language, I encourage you to pass the book on to others.

      "content": "Sample Words to Tie It All Together The purpose of learning the logic of English is to be able to analyze and understand any word within the English lexicon. In this final chapter we will examine a few words using the phonograms, rules, and roots. Each word will be analyzed step by step. This process may be used by teachers to guide students in understanding words. In these examples, spelling is considered first and roots second. This order may be reversed depending upon the teaching context. Though teaching in this manner initially means committing one to three minutes per word, the retention rate for meaning, pronunciation, and spelling will be much higher than if students are left to guess the spelling and meaning on their own. As students grow in their understanding of the logic of English, this time will shorten. Eventually, they will be able to analyze words almost instantaneously without assistance while reading. homogeneous Divide it into syllables. ho mo ge ne ous Analyze the word in the direction of reading and writing. ho O said /ō/ at the end of the syllable. Rule 4 A E O U usually say their names at the end of a syllable. ho mo Rule 4 as above. ho mo ge G says its soft sound /j/ because of the E. Rule 2 G may say /j/ before E, I, or Y. E said /ē/ at the end of the syllable. Rule 4 again. ho mo ge ne E said /ē/ at the end of the syllable. Rule 4 as previous syllable. ho mo ge ne o4us The multi-letter phonogram /ou-ō-oo-ŭ/ said its fourth sound /ŭ/. Analyze the roots for meaning. homo—same Other words with this root include: homophone – words that sound the same but have different meanings; homogenize – the process of shaking milk so it does not separate, to make it the same throughout. gene—family, kind, race Other words with this root include: genealogy – the study of families; general – applying to a whole class or kind; generic – an inclusive group or kind. homogeneous—of the same kind throughout. pedestrian Divide it into syllables. pe des tri an Analyze the word in the direction of reading and writing. pe Say to spell /ē/. E said /ē/ at the end of the syllable. Rule 4 A E O U usually say their names at the end of a syllable. pe des All first sounds.1 pe des tri I is saying its third sound /ē/. Rule 7 I says /ē/ at the end of a syllable that is followed by a vowel. pe des tri an Say to spell /ăn/. All first sounds. Analyze the roots for meaning. ped—foot Since the accent is on the second syllable, pe des' tri an, the first vowel is pronounced with a schwa sound /ә/. By listening to related roots, the vowel sound becomes clear as in ped' dler. Other words with this root include: pedal – something pushed with the foot; peddler – someone who goes from place to place selling, often by foot; pedometer – a device that measures the number of steps taken by foot; pedestal – the foot or bottom support of a column, pillar, or vase. pedestrian—a person traveling by foot. acceptable Divide it into syllables. ac cept a ble Analyze the word in the direction of reading and writing. ac c C says /k/ before another consonant. Rule 1 C softens to /s/ when followed by E, I, or Y. Otherwise, C says /k/. ac cept C says /s/ before an E. See Rule 1 above. ac cept a Say to spell /ā/. A said /ā/ at the end of the syllable.

      "content": "Sample Words to Tie It All Together The purpose of learning the logic of English is to be able to analyze and understand any word within the English lexicon. In this final chapter we will examine a few words using the phonograms, rules, and roots. Each word will be analyzed step by step. This process may be used by teachers to guide students in understanding words. In these examples, spelling is considered first and roots second. This order may be reversed depending upon the teaching context. Though teaching in this manner initially means committing one to three minutes per word, the retention rate for meaning, pronunciation, and spelling will be much higher than if students are left to guess the spelling and meaning on their own. As students grow in their understanding of the logic of English, this time will shorten. Eventually, they will be able to analyze words almost instantaneously without assistance while reading. homogeneous Divide it into syllables. ho mo ge ne ous Analyze the word in the direction of reading and writing. ho O said /ō/ at the end of the syllable.

This phonogram is found in only eight common base words. These words may be taught as a group. ceiling conceive receipt deceive perceive receive conceit deceit DGE – The sound /j/ heard in words such as hedge and ledge is harsher with more voice than the sound formed by G followed by a silent E as in large and marriage. E – The single letter E spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of only six one-syllable words. Since Y says its long /ī/ sound at the end of a one-syllable word, as in by, try, and fly, the single vowel E is used instead. he she we the me be Typically, Y spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of multisyllable words. There are ten words, however, which are spelled with the single vowel E. These may be learned as a group. acne adobe apostrophe catastrophe coyote epitome kamikaze karate recipe simile EA – says /ā/ in only nine common words. These words may be taught as a group. steak break tear great wear pear bear swear yea EA spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of only six commonly used words. These may be taught as a group.

Words such as deity and nuclei are not included because the E and I are acting as two separate phonograms as is seen by the syllable breaks: de it y, nu cle i. The basic sounds were chosen because they are represented in common words such as their, either and neither. Since either and neither are also commonly pronounced with a long /ī/, and the relationship with EIGH is made more clear, I have chosen to include the long /ī/ as a basic phonogram sound. Basic Phonogram Sounds ā ē ī beige caffeine apartheid deign casein eider(down) dreidel codeine Einstein feign either (either) feint holstein feisty geisha leisure fraulein heir neither heist lei plebeian kaleidoscope reign protein (neither) skein seize poltergeist surveillance sheik rottweiler their Sheila seismic veil weird stein vein Advanced Phonogram Sounds ĭ ĕ counterfeit heifer foreign forfeit sovereign surfeit EIGH – is an uncommon spelling.

These words may be taught as a group. ā ī eight height freight sleight sleigh weigh neighbor By adding suffixes and prefixes and using these to form compound words, these six words can be expanded into a total of 103 words. EY – There are only ten commonly known words in which EY says long A. The long /ā/ sound is the least common sound. However, it is placed first because (1) memorizing the long /ā/ sound first helps to distinguish this phonogram from others and (2) it helps link this phonogram to EIGH and EI. abeyance convey grey (British spelling for gray) hey obey prey purvey survey whey they EY spells long /ē/ at the end of a single one-syllable word, key. EY usually says its long /ē/ sound at the end of two- and three-syllable words. abbey attorney chutney baloney hockey EY is a common suffix added to words to turn nouns into adjectives. chocolate chocolatey glue gluey EW – says the long /ū/ sound where the /y/ is distinctly heard in only two base words: few and new (in some dialects). The rest drop the /y/ sound. I – says the consonant sound /y/ in words such as onion, opinion, union, etc. Learning that I also has a consonant sound further emphasizes the I and Y relationship in English. IE – Many programs (based upon 70 phonograms) have three sounds for this phonogram: /ē-ī-ĭ/. This program uses only one sound /ē/ for the following reasons: Five common base words end in IE. die lie pie tie vie These words are better classified as silent final E words because each of them drops the E when adding a vowel suffix. When adding the vowel suffix -ed, these words drop the E to form lied, tied, died. When adding the vowel suffix -ing, in addition to dropping the E, the I changes to Y to prevent two I’s from being together. For example: lying and dying. Some teachers argue that the phonogram IE is formed when a single vowel Y changes to I when adding a suffix that begins with E. For example: implied, tried, and cried. From a pedagogical standpoint it is better to teach students to look at the root word and emphasize that the Y changed to I, rather than teaching these words as the phonogram IE. IE says /ĭ/ in only two common words. Since these both in an unaccented syllable, we will “say to spell” long /ē/. This is also consistent with their root word, chief, and aids in emphasizing the morpho-phonemic aspects of English. kerchief mischief IE spells long /ē/ at the end of a single one-syllable word: brie. IE says /ĕ/ in only one commonly known word: friend. IGH – is used in only eighteen common base words. blight bright fight flight fright high knight light might nigh night plight right sigh sight slight tight thigh By adding suffixes and prefixes and using these to form compound words, these sixteen words can be expanded into a total of 967 words. OA – is used in 62 commonly used base words. It is used in the middle of one-syllable base words with the exception of approach, reproach, cocoa, quinoa, and whoa. Words containing the phonogram OA commonly form compound words such as motorboat, toadstool, etc. They also commonly add prefixes and suffixes. OE – is the least common spelling of the long /Ō/ sound. There are only 9 common base words that use this spelling. These may be learned as a group. doe foe hoe oboe toe woe aloe roe throe OE represents a phonogram, not an O plus a silent final E. This is demonstrated by the E being retained when adding a vowel suffix in words such as hoeing and toeing. If it were a silent final E, the E would be dropped. OE says its second sound /oo/ in only two common words. shoe canoe OE is not acting as a silent final E in these words, as can be demonstrated by the fact that the E is retained when adding a vowel suffix such as shoeing and canoeing. OO – By far the most common sound is /oo/. It is heard in more than 150 common base words. It says its second sound, /ü/, in twenty-one common base words and one suffix. It says its third sound, long /ō/, in only three base words. It says the short /ŭ/ sound in two words. ü ō ŭ the suffix -hood brooch blood book door flood brook floor cook crook foot forsook good hood hoof hook look nook rook roof shook soot stood took wood woof wool OUGH – is an unusual phonogram. Many people use examples of this spelling to prove that English is not regular. However, it is possible to think systematically about it. Short /ŏ/ is the most frequent sound. It is found in six common base words. Long /ō/ is the second most common sound, found in five base words; /oo/ is found in one word (for ease of memorization this has been moved to the third position); /ow/ is found in three; /ŭff/ is found in two; /ŏff/ is found in two.

These words may be learned as a group. ä ăf aught (more commonly spelled ought) draught caught laugh daughter distraught fraught haughty slaughter naughty taught CEI – Rather than learning the rule: “Use I before E, except after C...,” which has numerous exceptions, it is simpler to learn CEI as a phonogram. This phonogram is found in only eight common base words. These words may be taught as a group. ceiling conceive receipt deceive perceive receive conceit deceit DGE – The sound /j/ heard in words such as hedge and ledge is harsher with more voice than the sound formed by G followed by a silent E as in large and marriage. E – The single letter E spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of only six one-syllable words. Since Y says its long /ī/ sound at the end of a one-syllable word, as in by, try, and fly, the single vowel E is used instead. he she we the me be Typically, Y spells the long /ē/ sound at the end of multisyllable words. There are ten words, however, which are spelled with the single vowel E.

Words such as deity and nuclei are not included because the E and I are acting as two separate phonograms as is seen by the syllable breaks: de it y, nu cle i. The basic sounds were chosen because they are represented in common words such as their, either and neither. Since either and neither are also commonly pronounced with a long /ī/, and the relationship with EIGH is made more clear, I have chosen to include the long /ī/ as a basic phonogram sound.

EY – There are only ten commonly known words in which EY says long A. The long /ā/ sound is the least common sound. However, it is placed first because (1) memorizing the long /ā/ sound first helps to distinguish this phonogram from others and (2) it helps link this phonogram to EIGH and EI. abeyance convey grey (British spelling for gray) hey obey prey purvey survey whey they EY spells long /ē/ at the end of a single one-syllable word, key. EY usually says its long /ē/ sound at the end of two- and three-syllable words. abbey attorney chutney baloney hockey EY is a common suffix added to words to turn nouns into adjectives. chocolate chocolatey glue gluey EW – says the long /ū/ sound where the /y/ is distinctly heard in only two base words: few and new (in some dialects). The rest drop the /y/ sound. I – says the consonant sound /y/ in words such as onion, opinion, union, etc. Learning that I also has a consonant sound further emphasizes the I and Y relationship in English. IE – Many programs (based upon 70 phonograms) have three sounds for this phonogram: /ē-ī-ĭ/. This program uses only one sound /ē/ for the following reasons: Five common base words end in IE. die lie pie tie vie These words are better classified as silent final E words because each of them drops the E when adding a vowel suffix. When adding the vowel suffix -ed, these words drop the E to form lied, tied, died. When adding the vowel suffix -ing, in addition to dropping the E, the I changes to Y to prevent two I’s from being together. For example: lying and dying. Some teachers argue that the phonogram IE is formed when a single vowel Y changes to I when adding a suffix that begins with E. For example: implied, tried, and cried. From a pedagogical standpoint it is better to teach students to look at the root word and emphasize that the Y changed to I, rather than teaching these words as the phonogram IE.

Many of these differences can be credited to Noah Webster. In 1828, following the American Revolution, Webster set himself to writing the first American Dictionary. In order to distinguish the newly founded country from the country from which they had just won independence, Webster modified some of the spellings to create an “American” version of English. As you will observe in the lists below, some of Webster’s changes generated exceptions and inconsistencies that do not exist in the British spellings and some of his changes resolved exceptions. Commonwealth countries typically follow British spelling conventions. Canadian English, however, reflects its history as a Commonwealth as well as a close neighbor of the United States. Sometimes both spellings are acceptable. In this case the most common spelling will be referenced first. The following dictionaries were referenced for creating these tables: Delbridge, Arthur. 1981.

For a list of advanced phonograms, see Appendix E. affix a group of letters added to either the beginning or ending of a word. There are two types of affixes in English: suffixes and prefixes. base word a word that can stand alone when all the affixes have been removed. Let's consider the word renew. If we remove the prefix re-, the base word new is left. New is a recognizable English word that stands alone, therefore it is a base word. consonant a sound which is blocked by the tongue, teeth, or lips in some way. Most consonants are difficult to sing or control for volume. The single consonants are: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, qu, r, s, t, v, w, x, (y), z. consonant suffix begins with a consonant such as -ly, -ness, -ful, -hood, and -ment. derivative a word formed by adding suffixes and prefixes to a root or by combining two base words to form a compound word. morpheme the smallest word part that carries meaning. Morphemes include roots, base words, suffixes, and prefixes. For example the word dogs consists of two morphemes: the base word, dog, and the suffix, -s. multi-letter phonogram a phonogram which is written with two or more letters. phonogram a letter or combination of letters which represents one or more sounds. prefix a group of letters added to the beginning of a root that alters the meaning. root carries the primary meaning of the word but is not necessarily an English word when all the affixes have been removed. For example, move is the root of the word remove. Move stands alone so it is also a base word. The word revive also has the prefix re-. However, the root vive is not a base word because it is not a recognizable English word. Vive is a root, but not a base word. schwa /ә/ an unaccented vowel which sounds very similar to short /ŭ/. silent final E an E at the end of a base word that is not sounded. There are nine types of silent final E's. single-letter phonogram a phonogram written with only one letter. They are represented by the letters A-Z. single vowel Y a Y that is acting alone at the end of the word; it is not part of one of the multi-letter phonograms ay, ey, or oy. suffix a group of letters added to the end of a root which alters the meaning or part of speech. syllable a rhythmic part of a word produced when the mouth opens to form a vowel sound. vowel a sound that is produced when the mouth is open and the sound is not blocked by the lips, teeth, or tongue.
