      "content": "Prologue St. Louis, Missouri…a sultry night in August “You’re as beautiful as the day I met you.” Her husband lifted his wineglass, toasting her, as they were having dinner. His eyes were tender in the flickering candlelight; the restaurant elegant with its high-priced menu and attentive waiters. “All those many years ago?” Jenny teased, lifting her glass to touch his. The touching tinkled musically around the room, an intimate soundtrack to the snow-white tablecloths and sparkling table settings. Jeff had insisted on the most expensive eatery in St. Louis to celebrate their twelfth anniversary; though it wasn’t actually their twelfth, to be exact, because of the divorce after their first marriage. It was a sort of joke between them that if they’d remained married the first time they’d be celebrating twenty-two years instead of twelve. Jenny didn’t care. All that mattered was they’d found each other again, had two children they adored, Sarah and Teddy, and had moved to Illinois to begin a new life far from the old one in Florida. “Yes, as beautiful as when you were fifteen and I was sixteen.” “Ah,” she sighed, “we were such babies, weren’t we?” He took her hands and brought them to his lips. “Yes, we were. But I knew then what I know now…that you are the love of my life and we’ll be together for the rest of our days and beyond, if there is a beyond.” “The rest of our days,” she echoed. He leaned across the table and their lips met. There was a smile on hers as the waiter moved up and asked if there was anything else they needed. They’d had their salads, their generous plates of Tutta Mare, the crusty bread and a glass of red wine each. She was content. No more hard times or tears for them. They’d already had enough of both in their lives. The construction company Jeff had formed and nurtured when they’d moved to the small town of Millstadt a decade before had grown into a profitable enterprise. He employed fifteen men and women and the company made them a solid living. The carpentry skills he’d learned during their first separation had served him well. Jeff’s Construction had gained a reputation for being one of the best homebuilders of middle-income family dwellings in the area. It’d taken years, but now they were finally reaping the rewards. For the first time in their lives they had more money than they knew what to do with. Jenny was proud of him. She’d kept the business’s accounts and helped answer the phones from home during the early years. Three years ago they’d opened an office in downtown Millstadt and hired a secretary so Jenny could resume being a full-time mother and writer. Her life was full. She had her children and loved them dearly. Being a mother was more important than anything that had come before, but somehow, with Jeff’s encouragement, she’d also found the desire to return to her writing. She’d written three more books to go with the three she’d written during the years of their first marriage; one of them, a tale about a band of vicious vampires using a refurbished theater as a base to lure in their victims, had sold quite well. Few people ever knew it’d been based on a real experience. The last novel, a ghost story set on an isolated island, hadn’t done as well. The publisher had gone bankrupt right after the release, leaving her book in limbo. Her agent said not to worry. It was the deplorable economy. It’d even seeped into the publishing industry; publishers were slashing costs and employees like dying trees shed leaves. The next book, her agent said, would do better. Of course, that would be when she got around to writing another one. Lately she’d been too busy raising her family. Enjoying life. Writing was no longer as important as Jeff, Sarah and Teddy. They always came first. And she’d never been happier. “This was a great idea,” she whispered after kissing him, “getting away from our everyday lives and the kids for a night of fine dining and a hotel suite…just the two of us. It’s been a wonderful night. You’re a good husband.” “I know. Now, what do you say we order dessert? It’s getting late and that hotel room with the luxurious bed, big screen TV, room service and no kids is calling.” His hand beneath the table caressed her bare leg. She’d worn the sexiest dress she had and laughed softly when his hand moved upwards to brush her inner thigh. His touch still sent shivers through her. “Sure. You know what I want,” she replied coyly. “A big bed and room service.” She chuckled. She was looking forward to their night alone. Having an eight and a twelve year old was a blessing in many ways, but private time, just the two of them, was almost impossible to come by and they never wasted it when they had it. He ordered them dessert with a gentle eagerness in his eyes. Gazing through the window framed in velvet curtains, she thought how pretty the city looked in the fading summer light. Everything bathed in a rosy glow. The sidewalks and streets seemed speckled with gleaming diamond chips. The people hurrying home from work or to personal appointments were muted blurs. Everyone smiling. Talking. Laughing. Living their lives on a hot summer night. When the sun went down the shadows and breeze would cool things off. Then it’d be perfect. By the time they’d finished their dessert, paid the tab and strolled hand-in-hand from the restaurant, dark had claimed the city. Deep purple shadows pulsed and the air hummed with the sounds of the night. The gloom was a warm, heavy cloak around them. There wasn’t a breeze stirring anywhere. The crowds had thinned. In the shade of the building Jeff stole a moment to kiss her. A long slow kiss that made her remember why she’d never stopped loving him. When he pulled away she reached out and slid her fingers along the side of his face. “I love you, husband. Forever and always.” “And I love you more.” He kissed her one last time. “Let’s get our car and drive it to the hotel, instead of walking. I don’t like where we’re parked. Since it’s later there’s bound to be a better parking space somewhere else,” she told him and he agreed. Lost in their conversation and each other, they strolled along the street by the river to the parking lot. They’d left their car in an isolated spot, a pool of soot, beneath a concrete viaduct. Not the safest of parking spaces. Usually, they’d never put themselves in danger like that because they, of all people, knew any place that secluded and shadowy could hide something unexpected. Because, in the world, monsters did exist. But they weren’t thinking about that. They were only thinking about the moment. The years of their safe normal lives had lulled them into a false sense of security. Under the overpass it was as silent as a tomb. No one else around, or so they thought. Jeff unlocked the car at a distance with the click of his key control and had his hand on the passenger side door handle when she glanced up. A capricious breeze drifted across her face where there shouldn’t have been any moving air. Her skin shivered as she caught a faint whiff of something she hadn’t smelled in a very long time. The scent was fresh dirt, ash and something…long dead. “Jeff, get in the car now!” Across the vehicle’s roof a large shadow enveloped her husband and he screamed. It was the last thing she saw and heard before something invisible grabbed her, slammed her to the ground and plunged something sharp into her neck. The excruciating pain lasted a millisecond, an eternity, before the blackness took her.",

      "content": "Chapter 1 Two Weeks Later Jenny She awoke in the hospital. A weak kitten with a fuzzy wandering mind. A nurse informed her she’d been in a coma for two weeks. Two weeks. Her waking up was nothing short of a miracle, especially after the amount of blood she’d lost. It’d take time for her to regain her bearings, her strength. She had to be patient. Her memories would come back. In the beginning the nurses turned away and wouldn’t answer when she asked about Jeff. They pretended as if they hadn’t heard or would mumble under their breath. Oh, they’d speak about her children, being cared for by Jeff’s older sister, Lulu, back in Millstadt. They’d tell her the children were doing fine, they missed her and couldn’t wait until she was well enough to return home…but they didn’t say anything about Jeff. One morning, when her mind was clearer than the days before, she demanded, “What happened to my husband? Is he here in the hospital? Is he okay?” Why hasn’t he come to see me? She was afraid of the answers, but more afraid not to know. The nurse patted her hand. “Dr. Lester’s coming in this morning to talk to you about it, my dear. I’ll let him answer your questions.” And off she scurried. What weren’t they telling her? When the doctor came she found out. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Sanders, your husband is dead,” Dr. Lester told her with a compassionate expression and a gentle hand on her shoulder. “It happened the night you were attacked and they don’t know who did it.” “They don’t have any leads?” “Unfortunately, no. Not yet. The police officer said your purse and your husband’s wallet weren’t taken. There didn’t seem to be any apparent motives for the assault.” According to the police, her husband’s cause of death was as suspicious as Jenny’s injuries and as mysterious as her eventual recovery had been, even to the doctors and nurses who’d treated her. She’d fallen into a coma, most likely from a concussion, when she’d been knocked to the ground. Then there’d been her substantial loss of blood, the same thing her husband had died of. The doctor was vague about most of it and Jenny assumed her husband had bled out from his wounds, wounds she’d never seen because before she’d awakened he’d been put in the coffin and into the ground. Jeff’s family wasn’t sure when she’d come out of her coma, if ever, so they’d held his funeral and buried him in the plot beside his mother and father. His parents were actually the reason they’d moved to Millstadt in the first place. They’d been elderly and needed help, but, in the last two years, both had passed away. His father succumbed after a lengthy bout of cancer, and his mother soon afterwards of a heart attack. It was ironic that now their son was sleeping in the family plot with them. Way too soon. “St. Louis police Detective Benjamin Bradley, has been in to see you once or twice, and wanted to be advised when you came out of the coma. He has been,” the doctor stated. “Your brother, Joey, was also here the first week. He reluctantly returned home when you didn’t regain consciousness by the second week.” Ah, so Joey had come all the way from Summer Haven, Florida, leaving his restaurant and family to be with her. His concern touched her. “Your brother knows you’re awake now and said he’d fly up this weekend to see you.” Joey. Oh, she wanted to see him so badly. Have him hold her. Cry on his shoulder. Be with someone who knew and loved her. Someone she could talk to who would understand, as no one else could, what losing Jeff was doing to her. Her own injuries meant nothing. All that mattered was that Jeff was…gone. After her doctor left, she cried until she slipped into an exhausted sleep. When she was able, a nurse helped her telephone her children and again she wept as she spoke to them. It was sweet to hear their voices, as sad as the conversation was. They knew their father was dead. They’d attended the funeral service. They’d wanted to visit her, but their aunt asked them to wait until she was out of the coma and feeling well enough. They were coming the next day and she was desperate to see them. They were all she had left, and she couldn’t wait until she could cradle them in her arms again; plant kisses on their cheeks and brows. Cuddle them and never let them go. Jeff might be gone forever but she still had his children, their children. Thank God for that. She had something to live for. She kept her mind on them from then on because she couldn’t bear to think of what had happened that night beneath the viaduct. To dwell on it filled her with panic, not only because of Jeff’s murder but because she had absolutely no memory of any of it. It was a total blank. The questions there were no answers to gave her a cold sweat. Who’d mugged them? Why? Was she still in danger? Did they believe she’d seen them? Would they track her down and try to kill her to keep their identities hid? Yes. Her fears were rampant. No. The attack had been random. They’d only been a bunch of homicidal hooligans out on a rampage. They didn’t care if she’d lived. They weren’t looking for her. She was safe now. Her family was safe. Oh, please God, let it be so. *** Detective Benjamin Bradley, an even-tempered man of medium height with quick but sad eyes, questioned her before she was released. She told him, to the best of her ability, what had happened the night of the attack. What she could remember. Which wasn’t much. “So you saw nothing? Heard nothing?” He pressed for at least the third time. “I told you. No. My memory’s just one big black hole. That’s all. I was knocked out before I could see or hear anything. I’m sorry.” She wished she could remember. She really did. Ever since the assault she’d had this oppressive sense of dread, of danger close by; that what she didn’t know might hurt her. Inexplicable really. Not much else could hurt worse than the death of her husband and a couple weeks in a coma. As grief stricken, weak, as she was, she still asked the detective before he left, “Do you have any leads? Any suspects yet? Do you know who killed my husband and why?” “I’m sorry, Mrs. Sanders. No leads so far. No motives that we can see, either. It wasn’t robbery. Nothing was stolen. Your husband’s death, the way he died, is bizarre enough. The coroner doesn’t know what to make of it.” The detective paused and she had the feeling there was something he wasn’t telling her, wasn’t asking her. Yet. Perhaps it was her loss or because she could barely stay awake that kept him from a more intense interrogation–or telling her more of what he knew. “There was no evidence left behind. Nothing to point us in the right direction. Is there anything else, no matter how trivial, you’ve recalled that might help us?” She’d hardly been able to reply, a sudden dizziness and bone-weary fatigue had overwhelmed her. “No…so…tired. Sorry.” She’d closed her eyes and when she’d opened them again the detective was gone and another night had come. It seemed the longer she was in bed the worse she felt. Every bone and muscle in her body ached and her throat was sandpaper. But she threw up everything she drank or ate. Her doctor explained it was most likely stress or delayed trauma. Her sleep was haunted with nightmarish dreams. In cemeteries and mist-covered night fields she chased Jeff but could never catch him. She cried out but he’d hide behind a tombstone or in a mausoleum, and she’d wake with tears trickling down her cheeks. Other nights she’d spy him running through a town, it looked like the town they’d grown up in, and she’d pursue him through one empty house or building after another…but again would never catch up to him. He was always just ahead of her. Out of reach. His wretched face white and his body skeleton thin. He never spoke. Just ran from her. It wrenched at her heart. The police had no suspects to track down and question. No one had seen anything. No one heard anything. Before she’d slid into sleep and Detective Bradley had left, she recalled seeing an odd look on his face. He probably wondered why she was alive and her husband was dead. What she was holding back. She bit her bottom lip until it bled and gently touched the healing marks on her neck. Truth was, she was uneasy talking too much about that night or thinking on it too long. If she could even remember it. She’d tried so hard. She couldn’t. It was like reliving a nightmare and her mind railed against it. She had the strangest thought: Your nightmare has just begun. And the thought wouldn’t go away.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 A month later That last week in the hospital had been torture. Instead of feeling better each day, she felt weaker, more befuddled. Her broken heart so strong a pain she could barely breathe. She’d left the bed long before her doctor thought she should, but in the end, her insurance wouldn’t approve her staying any longer and she ached to return to her children. Knowing it was the only thing that would make her feel better. She’d gone home to Millstadt. Still feeling sick. Off kilter. At least, she was reunited with Sarah and Teddy. But things didn’t get better. Her health didn’t improve. The bills piled up and without her husband’s income she had a difficult time paying them. Without Jeff, the business was folding. She couldn’t design or build the houses, run or supervise the crews. All she’d been good for was the office work. There was no one else experienced enough to step into his shoes. The mortgage on the new house and everyday expenses were too much for her to handle alone. And her dwindling royalty checks (jokes really) were in no way sufficient to support the three of them. They couldn’t have supported a mouse. It didn’t take long to realize their lives would have to change drastically. Jeff had had an insurance policy, but the money wouldn’t last six months with their bills. She hadn’t worked on a new book in two years. Her agent had suggested she write another vampire novel but she’d wanted to try something different. Life and the demands it made with Jeff and the kids had gotten in the way and kept her from it. Tomorrow, she’d constantly told herself, she’d begin a new book. Tomorrow. Yet a tomorrow with free time had never seemed to come. Now her agent wasn’t sure, in the troubled publishing climate, if she could even sell another one of her books. Not when publishers were downsizing, laying people off, and buying works by more famous authors they knew were a sure thing. The other problem was, she could begin a new novel that very day yet it’d be six, seven months before she’d be ready to show it to an agent or an editor and months after that to tie up a contract. And royalties? That could take another year. They needed money sooner than that. She had to find a real job, but she was in the same boat as millions of out-of-work people because of the lousy economy. So many people she knew were laid off. Worst she’d ever seen. According to the news, and everything she was seeing and hearing around her, there weren’t any jobs to be had and it wasn’t going to get better any time soon. Something she could attest to now firsthand. She’d sent out dozens of resumes and hadn’t heard a word. Not even a reply email. That’s when Joey came to visit her and suggested she and the kids move back to Summer Haven to their parents’ vacant farmhouse. For some reason he’d kept the old place. Hadn’t sold it. Over the years, with her busy life, she’d all but forgotten about it. Joey hadn’t. He’d tended to it and paid the yearly taxes. Waiting. “Why did you keep it anyway?” she asked. “I gave it to you. You could have sold it anytime. It wasn’t as if you couldn’t use the money.” Joey seemed to need money all the time. His restaurant had gone through fat and lean times and he was always lending money to someone or other. That was her brother Joey, big heart and small pockets. “Because I always had hopes you and Jeff would return someday. Live in Summer Haven again with Laurie and me and I wanted to be sure you had a home to come back to. Family should be together, you know.” And, she thought, if she and her children moved hundreds of miles away to Florida…if someone were looking for her wanting to finish what they’d begun in the attack…if someone meant her or her children harm…hiding in another state might be safer for all of them. She’d smiled at him in the soft light of her kitchen. He was a good brother. She could count on him to be there for her. He always had been. “Huh. But it’s been awhile. I bet the weeds and fauna have taken the old place over, right?” He hesitated for just a moment. “No, they haven’t. In fact, the house is in fairly good shape. A little run down. Still full of mom and dad’s stuff, though. We’d have to clean it out. That’d be no problem. They didn’t have much to begin with. “Best thing is the rent would be free. We’d fix it up. I’d help. Sis, come on, you belong in Summer Haven with us now that Jeff and his parents are gone. You can write anywhere. Raise the kids anywhere. Be better if it was with family. There’s nothing to keep you in Millstadt anymore, is there?” “No, there isn’t.” The kitchen surrounding her that Jeff and she had decorated together was roomy and exquisite. The walls were a pearly pink color. A curio cabinet, filled with gifts he’d bought her through the years, was tucked in one corner. There were roses in pale muted colors wallpapered on two walls. Dried roses in the middle of the table in a brightly colored bowl. They’d worked so hard making it the home of their dreams. Now it was a reminder of what she no longer had. Tears caught in her throat. If she sold the house, in this depressed market, she’d be lucky to get what they owed for it. Oh, well. It was better than losing it to the bank. She went to the windows and lowered the blinds. Since she’d been freed from the hospital it seemed the sun was too bright. Too big. Her eyes, like her body, hurt all the time. Her mind refused to think of the things it needed to think about. She had no appetite. Even her kids had noticed how much weight she’d lost. She was skin and bones. What was wrong with her? It could be unwanted residuals from the attack, as her doctors believe, the physical trauma her body endured. But she knew better. It’s a broken heart, missing Jeff, that’s what it is. Missing her husband. Grief. Her brother was still talking. “Then sell this house. Better yet, let the real estate people sell it and you and the kids drive back with me. I can stay a few more days while you make arrangements and pack. We’ll take turns driving your car. Heck, if you’re still feeling poorly I’ll drive all the way. It’d save me an airplane ticket. It’ll be fun. Like a road trip vacation. The kind we used to have in the summers with mom and dad, remember? Oh, she remembered. Joey and her awkwardly quiet in the back seat as mom and dad fought up front about not having enough money. The cheap restaurants they’d eaten at and the cut-rate motels, dives really, they’d stayed in. Bugs in the beds. Grease in the food. Best thing about those trips were they hadn’t gone on many of them. She kept her negative feelings to herself. How could her brother recall those unpleasant vacations with fondness? She’d spent years forgetting them. “We can stop along the way and eat at truck stops and interesting roadside diners. Steal their specials of the day for my own place.” Joey chortled sneakily, rubbing his hands together, knowing he’d convince her. He knew her well. So they’d packed up the few belongings she and the kids couldn’t do without, left the remainder for the movers, and took the long trip home to Florida. She in a cap and sunglasses to shade her sensitive eyes and a purse full of aspirins she quickly depleted. The minute they’d hit the city limits of Summer Haven she was sure she’d made the right decision. She was–they were–home. “The town hasn’t changed much,” she remarked as they drove down Main Street. Small town quaintness emanated from every stone storefront and tree-shaded sidewalk. The good old Summer Haven Town Market was perched on the corner of Third Street, as it had been forever, with its canopied windows crowded with the weekly sales items: cans of coffee, loaves of bread, shaving cream and the last of the season’s plump, striped watermelons. “No, it hasn’t. I like that about it,” Joey admitted, his hands firm on the wheel. “No matter how crazy life gets everywhere else, Summer Haven remains a sleepy little hamlet full of nice friendly people. A sanctuary from the big bad world.” Jenny gazed around, overwhelmed with nostalgia for the days of her childhood when she and her brother had run the streets and fields wild and free. Her mother and father both alive. Before all the troubles. When they’d lived in the little yellow farmhouse by the creek. The memories made her shaky. So many regrets. So many lost moments she’d never reclaim again. Her hand moved to the window’s glass and fingers traced the outline of the trees going by on the other side. Things will be better now. They have to be. My heart and body will heal here. Sure, Jeff and I fled this place years ago after what happened; escaped the horrible memories of the vampire family that butchered my mother and father and almost killed us before we defeated them…but time has passed. The wounds have mended. Summer Haven is home; the town I was born in and once loved. The place I’d first met and loved Jeff. A place my children and I can now feel safe in. And what’s left of my family is here. “Mom,” Teddy, asked from the back seat, “is this where you grew up?” “Yep. Your Uncle Joey, too. See that gazebo there in the center of the park?” Her finger pointed to the left. “Yeah.” Teddy’s brown eyes looked where she directed. Smiling, he brushed the blondish hair from them so he could see better. It was the first smile to grace his face in a long time, and it encouraged her. “Your Uncle Joey and I used to play hide-and-go-seek around it and in the park when we were your age. We’d hide behind the trees and bushes.” “At night we ran through the yards and streets of the town like wild Indians, didn’t we, Sis?” Joey chuckled as he maneuvered the car past the Century 21 Real Estate office. Someone, a man in red shorts and white T-shirt, waved at Joey as they passed. Joey waved back. Many people noticed them and waved or shouted hellos. Joey was well known and liked. So different than when they’d been kids. “Yes, we loved the night,” she whispered. “Once.” When they were children. Long ago when they hadn’t know evil mystical creatures existed and hadn’t feared darkness. Joey threw her a strange look but didn’t comment on what she’d said. He’d gone on to reminiscence about his favorite subject. Food. “Remember that little confectionary we used to get penny candy and ice cream cones at in the summer? Wasn’t it called John’s?” “I think so.” “Remember how we used to roam the shoulders along the roads, sidewalks and streets looking for empty bottles and lost money so we could buy that penny candy?” Joey laughed. “What scroungers we were.” “I remember.” And she did. They’d been poor, deprived, and even penny candy or sharing a package of cupcakes was a treat. “You two,” Teddy groaned, “were pathetic.” “No, we were kids.” Joey’s face broke into a grin. “Hungry kids. We were always on the lookout for free food.” “Pitiful,” Teddy snickered. Jenny took in the familiar buildings and streets as they rambled through town. She should be happy. Home. She should be feeling better then she was. All she could feel was her growing lethargy, as if everything was too much to bother with. She told herself it was because of all that had happened and Jeff’s death; the unexpected but nagging financial problems. Now the move. That’s all. She was depressed. What did she expect? Time, Joey adamantly believed, and being home, would help her out of her funk. Yeah, a century maybe. Oh, Lord, she missed Jeff. He would have made this move easy. He would have made her life easy as he always had. But he was gone. Get used to it. She was on her own now. The kids and her. “Mom,” Sarah, her youngest at eight, piped up from the rear seat where she was reading one of those Twilight books. She had the same coloring, eyes and hair as her brother. They could have been twins, except she was four years younger. The more animated, friendlier of the two, she was the one most like Jeff in temperament. Loved to read and draw. Such a kind-hearted child she’d cry at any little thing. Loved animals. “I’m really hungry. My stomach’s talking to me. No, it’s squawking loudly. Can we get something to eat?” Joey replied before Jenny could. “Already thought of that, sweetie. I called Laurie on my cell as we came into town. She’s got fried chicken–your favorite Teddy–with all the fixings waiting for us at the diner. It’s the special for today.” He glanced at his sister. “That okay with you…a warm meal before we head to the apartment?” She and the kids were staying with Joey and Laurie until they could get the farmhouse cleaned out and their furniture arrived in a day or two. “I know we’ve been on the road since morning and you’re probably tired. But you gotta be hungry, too. I know I am.” “Ha, you’re always hungry. But food sounds good. We could use something to eat. I could use some coffee myself.” She didn’t know why she’d said what she said about the food. They’d been on the road for days and she was exhausted, but not hungry. She hadn’t been hungry for weeks. The pit of her stomach burned. Her throat was sore. Her blood was a fire running through her veins. Again, she thought it was because of the distress she’d been under, the grieving. A body reacts in strange ways to heartache. Hers was trying to starve itself. Her brother parked in front of Joey’s Diner. “Well,” Jenny said, “this place sure has changed. For the better.” Her eyes scanned the family restaurant Joey was so proud of. The front window had been widened and heightened into a beautiful rounded bay window filled with plants and flowers, either silk or real ones, so lifelike she couldn’t tell. The business next door was gone. It’d become part of the diner. “Wow, you added on just like you said you would years ago. It looks fantastic. I love the window treatment. So classy. I see Laurie’s artistic touch in it.” “You got it. Laurie did the decorating. They’re not real plants, but hey, pretty anyway, aren’t they? I took over that empty gift shop next door, what, six years ago now, and expanded. We remodeled and practically doubled our space. We can fit more than fifty people in if we cram.” Her brother grinned. “You like it?” “I do. I can’t wait to see the inside.” The kids were already out of the car and at the restaurant’s front door. Jenny got out, tipping her hat to further cover her face, and followed behind at a slower pace. Her eyes fell on the Dollar Store that now stood where the exquisite movie house, the Grand Theater, once had. The theater she and her father, when he’d been alive, had renovated. The theater she and Jeff later burnt to the ground. A shiver numbed her spine and she thrust the bad memories away. Now her father, mother and Jeff were all in their graves. She and Joey were the only ones left who knew what had happened that night at the theater when they’d destroyed the vampires. Best not to think of those times. Not now. Inside her brother’s café she was met with subtle lighting and welcoming smiles. Laurie rushed to embrace her after hugging Sarah and Teddy. “Gosh, it’s so good to see you, Jenny. And the kids.” Jenny caught the troubled expression as it flittered across the other woman’s face, one quickly veiled. Laurie was barely taller than Teddy and hadn’t changed much in the years since Jenny had last seen her. She’d gained more weight; her hair was short and a softer shade of blond, yet her eyes were still intriguingly green like a cat’s and full of life. That’s one thing Jenny admired about her sister-in-law, she had a zest for living and people–plus she unconditionally loved Joey. “I have your supper ready to bring out.” Laurie smiled. “You all must be tired, so find a place to sit and I’ll be back in a jiffy with everything.” She bustled toward the kitchen. “And I’ll just go help her.” Joey trailed off behind his wife. Probably wanted a few moments alone with her, Jenny mused. Be glad you have her, brother. Your wife. Alive. Your lives all around and ahead of you. Pain stabbed her heart as she watched the two shove through the swinging doors. Before they closed, framed in the space, Joey caught up to his wife and surprised her with a passionate hug. A kiss. Their laughter was tender, subdued. There weren’t many people in the diner. A young couple tucked away to the side munching on hamburgers and fries. One snowy-haired guy at the counter drinking a shake. It was three o’clock in the afternoon. Too early for supper and too late for lunch. Joey claimed they got busy with the supper crowd around five. Teddy slid into a booth in front of the bay window and Sarah and Jenny scooted in after him. Jenny leaned against the padded leather, weary to the bone, and took her surroundings in. The diner had changed a lot. Once it’d been dim and run-down, now it was bright and shiny like new coins. The color scheme was every hue of yellow that existed or close to it. Pale lemon walls, mustard stool tops and cantaloupe hued table tops. It seemed like an unlikely combination, but somehow it worked. The dazzling colors made the place look cheery. There were hanging plants cascading from the ceiling and stunning paintings, originals she noted, spiced up the walls. Joey was friends with some of the local artists and did everything he could to help them, including buying their work, apparently. The paintings made the diner seem richer, more elegant and added splashes of color. Everywhere she saw Laurie’s delicate hand, her sense of style. Like in the menu. These days instead of greasy hamburgers and fatty Salisbury Steaks, a customer could get a delicious garden salad, a thick juicy steak with locally grown vegetables and one of five varieties of pie or cobbler, the best in the county. There were so many loving touches: metal that gleamed, leather soft as marshmallow, shiny counter and tabletops and artfully arranged flowers. She was impressed. The restaurant was thriving, even in the bad economy, her brother had bragged on their trip out. Joey brought her a steaming mug of coffee and chocolate milkshakes for the kids and set them down on the table. “Your suppers are on their way. Won’t be long.” “Thanks.” She grinned weakly up at him. “But hold my supper. I don’t feel like eating right now.” And concern flashed across his face. “Sis, you’ve hardly eaten a thing since we left Illinois. You have to eat. Keep up your strength. No matter how distraught you are.” Slipping in beside her, he laid his hand over hers and held her gaze until she looked away. His hazel brown eyes, so similar to hers, were full of pity. Lately she’d had too much of that and shied away from more. They’d had this discussion before. He was worried about her lack of appetite. She felt bad about it but there was nothing she could do. She just wasn’t hungry. A soft sigh escaped her lips, looking at her children looking at her as they slurped down their shakes. “Okay, bring me out a smaller portion, a child’s meal, and I’ll try to eat some of it.” “Good.” He patted her hand and returned to the kitchen. The chicken must have been good because her kids gobbled it down along with the rest of the food but she was barely able to eat a third of it. Then when Joey and Laurie weren’t watching, she snuck to the women’s restroom and threw every bite up in the toilet, flushed it and rejoined her kids in the booth. She’d never done that before. She was worried too. What was wrong with her? Why couldn’t she keep food down? And why were her eyes hurting so much? Her head? Could grief truly do this to a person? She lowered her head into her hands, listening to Sarah and Teddy debating what to have for dessert. Bottomless pits, both of them. They were her world now. They were everything. All that mattered. If it weren’t for them she couldn’t have gone on. Wouldn’t want to go on. She raised her head and gently smiled as they huddled over the menu. God, she loved them so much. “Mom, what are you having for dessert?” Teddy wanted to know. Sarah was crowding him, taunting him with funny faces. He kept pushing her away. “Stop it! Stop bugging me,” he snapped at her, “or I’ll dump the rest of your shake on your silly head.” Jenny chuckled. “Now you two behave, hear me? There’ll be no shakes dumped on anyone’s head. Not today. Teddy, be nice to your sister. She’s the only one you have.” Both small faces swung toward her, and seeing, sensing, her melancholy, they instantly calmed down. Teddy put an arm around his sister and gave her a half-hearted hug and a swift peck on the cheek. Sarah giggled and pinched him on his arm. “Hey! That hurt. Mom!” A common frustration played across her son’s face. Jenny knew, as only a mother could, that deep down the two loved each other. But sometimes siblings had a funny way of showing it. The age gap, as well as the difference in gender, didn’t help. Teddy was on the verge of adulthood, and since his father’s death was trying to grow up as fast as he could. Sarah was a child in his eyes. But he’d do anything for her, and if anyone or anything tried to hurt her, Jenny knew, he’d be the first there to protect her. Just like Joey and her. Laurie was standing above them, trying hard not to laugh at the children’s antics. “You know what you want for dessert, kiddos?” “I’ll have chocolate pie with whipped cream on top,” Teddy ordered in his best adult voice. “The biggest piece you have.” He spread his hands apart almost two feet. Like her, her son was a chocoholic. He was tall already for a boy his age. Strong willed, but with a sensitive side that unfortunately reminded Jenny of herself when she was twelve. Her son was a dreamer who woke up one fateful morning and decided he had to take more responsibility onto his small shoulders. Grow up quick. Also like her. With her it’d been an alcoholic mother and a father who the world had beaten down until he’d been unrecognizable. She’d had no choice but to step up and take things into her own youthful hands. Someone had to. Sometimes childhood wasn’t all sugar and spice. She studied his fresh face and her heart melted. So young. In many other ways he was so like his father. Courageous. Smart. She’d never wanted an unhappy childhood for him, or her daughter, but now was apprehensive she couldn’t give them anything else. They loved her but they’d adored their father. Her fingers went to swipe the tears from her cheek, but there were none. She hadn’t been able to cry, not once, since she’d left the hospital. “Yeah, me, too. A big piece of chocolate pie,” her daughter seconded as she jumped up and skipped to the nearest empty stool, climbed up and started spinning. “Nothing for me, thank you,” Jenny muttered. She pretended to be busy sipping her coffee. For some reason coffee didn’t taste good to her lately. Again she wondered what was wrong, but at the moment she was too tired to question it. The look of anxiety in Laurie’s eyes was the same response she’d been getting all week from Joey, but the woman didn’t say a word. Instead she glanced at the kids. “Where do you two put all this food?” She clucked, and then walked away to get what they’d asked for. “In our stomachs, of course,” Sarah bantered back as she twirled around. Her thin little legs moved up and down like one of those carnival rides. Her yellow hair floated around her head. “Nah. No human has stomachs that big,” her sister-in-law tossed over her shoulder as she disappeared into the kitchen. “Must go right down into your legs.” Laurie. Soon after the incident at the Grand Theater all those years ago, the vicious attack where Joey almost died, he’d had a change of heart and had declared his undying love to his long time live-in and had married her. Half the town hadn’t given the new marriage an icicle’s chance in a hot oven. Laurie had always been flighty, a little off kilter in a creative artsy way. But they’d been wrong. The union had flourished like the restaurant. Twelve years now. Laurie was happy. Joey was happy. Until Laurie, Joey had been rudderless, a drifter side-stepping through life. One woman, one job after another. Laurie and the diner had anchored him. So Jenny was happy for both of them. The couple’s only regret was they had no children. Something they’d desperately wanted. Joey said they hadn’t given up. Not yet. Until then, the diner was their child and they nurtured and loved it as if it were the only one. And it showed. Laurie brought out the pie and sat down across from Jenny. “You sure you’re all right?” she inquired caringly, head bent. “You’re looking kind of pale, girl. Your eyes have this…funny glint.” The woman laid a hand on Jenny’s arm and Jenny slid backwards slightly, just enough so the contact broke. “I’m as good as can be what with my husband being murdered, losing my home, being nearly flat-busted broke and all.” She shrugged and did her best to look healthy. Sat up straighter. Opened her heavy eyes wider. “My eyes look funny?” “Yeah, they’re glittering like tiny stars. Weird. That is when you look up, which you haven’t done much since you came in. Something’s wrong, isn’t it, besides the chaos that’s come from Jeff’s death? I thought we were friends? Spill it.” “The eyes? It’s the bright lights in here. After the attack, my long hospital stay and all the crying. They’re irritated. That’s all,” Jenny snapped, then felt badly she’d lost her temper when Laurie was only trying to be kind. “Sorry. I’m just…exhausted.” Inside her guts were churning and her mind was spinning. Why couldn’t she tell Joey and Laurie the truth? That she felt like hell, truly strange, and had since the night Jeff had died. For some reason she couldn’t. Don’t tell anyone. Wait. See. She’d feel better tomorrow. No sense in worrying them. Not yet. She’d never been a complainer and she wasn’t about to start now. No one liked a whiner. It was bad enough she’d come home practically penniless, homeless. Husbandless. That was needy enough. She couldn’t be sick, too. “I can see that. Perhaps now you’re here, and after you get some sleep, you’ll feel better. I hope so. Just remember if you need to talk to someone anytime, you can talk to me. Joey and I are here for you.” “Thank you, but I’ll be fine.” She flashed a faint smile. “Like you said, now that we’re here I’ll be myself again.” No. Never again. Not with Jeff in his grave and her life shattered to hell. But how could Jenny tell her that when she couldn’t even believe it herself? Even now she expected to see Jeff walk through the door, saunter up and kiss her hello, especially here in Summer Haven, their old stomping grounds. No, he’ll never walk in anywhere ever again. He’s dead. Stifling a sob, she forced her attention to the present. Laurie was giving her that look again. Jenny was relieved when the meal and the visit were over. The sun was going down and it flooded the world outside with twilight in delicate shades of amethyst. The air had cooled. The breeze diminished. The children were yawning, their eyes welcoming sleep. It was time to get them settled for the night and in bed. The diner was filling up with the supper crowd. Way too many people. With Joey’s help, she packed up the kids, who, with the stressful day behind them and their bellies full, curled in the rear seat of the car and fell asleep. Joey drove to the apartment across from the town square where Laurie and he had been living the last nine years. “It isn’t a fancy or big place,” Joey made excuses as she followed him into the living room, “but it’s close to the diner, close enough to walk to and from if we need to, and suits us well enough. “We thought we’d put you three in the spare room for as long as you’re here.” He deposited a sleeping Teddy on one of the knee-high airbeds he’d bought the week before. “Sorry about the makeshift beds, but Laurie and I figured you wouldn’t be here long.” The room was cramped with the beds on the floor and two scuffed but ample-sized dressers flat against the wall. Her brother had made the accommodations as nice as he could, but their money was tight just as hers was. The dressers were used; the beds were clearance items from Wal-Mart. He was real proud of his thriftiness. In that way they both took after their father who’d always known how to pinch a penny until it became two. “You’re right, we won’t be here long, and the room’s great just the way it is. You and Laurie have been so kind already and now this. Thanks, Joey.” “Hey, you don’t have to thank me. I’m your brother. I’m supposed to be helpful and kind. You going to leave the kids dressed?” She laid Sarah on the bed in the far corner by the window, covered her up and turned to Joey. “They’ve been through so much and the trip here was long. No good reason to wake them. I usually don’t do this, but they can sleep in their clothes tonight. Won’t hurt.” And she was bone weary; it’d been all she could do to get Sarah into bed without falling over. Between the difficulties of the last month and the tedious journey to Summer Haven, Jenny could barely muster the energy to drag herself out of the bedroom. A bewildering and all-encompassing weariness had suddenly overtaken her mind and her body. Even her thoughts were incoherent. It was like her mind was minutes behind reality and couldn’t catch up. Again she wondered what was wrong with her. After Joey deposited the suitcases in their room he joined her on the living room couch before a giant screened television set. “They’re both still sleeping,” he reported Her eyes went to the television. “Gosh, brother, that’s the biggest damn T.V. I’ve ever seen. But couldn’t you have found a larger one?” She chuckled. Joey loved television, had since he’d been a kid. When he wasn’t at the diner, Laurie had spilled the beans, he was in front of the set. There was a stack of DVDs piled against each side. And he always recorded his missed programs while working to watch later on his days off. “Fifty-two inch.” He flopped down beside her. “It was my birthday present last year from my lovely wife.” “She knows how to please you all right.” “That she does. “Well,” he put his arm around her shoulders, “you’re here. Finally back home. How does it feel?” Reclining into the over-stuffed sofa, she closed her eyes, conscious that his arms around her made her feel uncomfortable. She scooted over so they fell away. “Good.” She smiled, opened her eyes to stare out the window. “Though odd. I never thought I’d be living here again. Especially without Jeff.” He leveled sympathetic eyes at her. “I miss him, too.” Then he was silent for a moment before adding, “I know I’ve said this before, Sis, but I’m so sorry about what’s happened to you. The assault. Jeff gone. The coma. Your money problems. All of it. It’s awful. I’m only grateful you’re alive and you and the kids have moved back here. You belong with family now. And I’m tickled to have you.” He hadn’t been able to say the word dead, not once. Jeff was gone. Just…gone. She understood. She might have been married to Jeff, given him children, loved him most of her life, but Joey had grown up with Jeff, too, and since childhood they’d been best friends. They’d both lost someone who could never be replaced. “Yeah, what’s left of us.” “We have each other, the children. Laurie. We’re still a family.” “I know that.” What else could she say? Nothing. It’d all been said. She was sick of the condolences and empty words from people. Words didn’t help. They didn’t fill the empty void in her life, didn’t fix the ache in her heart. Gone was gone. Dead was dead. Joey stood up. “I hate to run out on you but I promised Laurie I’d help her close the diner. She’s had her hands full the last week, running it alone and all. I owe her. Will you be okay here by yourself for a while?” “Of course.” Another half-hearted smile. “The kids are out for the night and looks like I’ll be right behind them. I’m pooped. You go on. I’ll be fine.” At the door, gazing back at her, he casually brought up, “Laurie mentioned you didn’t eat much for supper. Just so you know, there’s hamburger in the refrigerator. The frying pans are in the lower cabinet by the oven and the utensils are in the drawer to its left. If you get hungry fry yourself up a burger or two. Cheese and condiments in the fridge. Buns are in the breadbox on the counter.” “Thanks. If I get hungry I will.” She yawned. “But right now all I want is a bed under me and covers over me. See you tomorrow morning.” “Laurie and I will try to be quiet when we come home later tonight so as not to wake you or the kids.” “Don’t worry. The way I’m feeling, an earthquake wouldn’t wake me. And the kids sleep like the dead.” She realized what she’d said soon as she said it and a sensation of despair washed over her. Dead. Like Jeff. She sighed and didn’t know she had. “So I’ll see you tomorrow.” “That you will.” After her brother went out the door, drained of every ounce of energy she’d ever had, she reclined her head and shut her eyes again. She’d slipped into sleep when something–a noise or a smell–woke her. The clock on the wall showed it was eight twenty-five. She’d been asleep an hour. She was no longer tired. In fact, sitting up, she felt invigorated. Restless. And for the first time in weeks she was actually hungry. She wandered into the kitchen. The windows around the room were ebony squares. A faint breeze sung through the trees, a song of endless nights. She opened the refrigerator and saw the fat package of raw hamburger. She reached in, pulled it out and carried it to the sink. Tearing open the skin-tight plastic wrap, she brought the meat to her lips and drank the loose blood that had collected along the edges. When she’d slurped up the last drop she dropped the package to the counter and stared at it. Why had she done that? Drink hamburger blood? Ech. Ech. Ech. Damn. Grief did do strange things to a person. “You’re supposed to make patties and fry it up,” she grumbled, “put it on a bun with mustard and catsup, for God’s sake. Onions. Yum. Yum.” But that didn’t appeal to her at all. Not one bit. The hamburger was rewrapped and stuffed back in the refrigerator. Maybe she’d eat something later. She went to the door, opened it slightly and listened, thinking she heard something on the evening air. Violin music. The melody was soft and haunting and wafted across her memories like an old friend. Hadn’t she’d heard that song before? That violin with the sweet sound? Years ago? Here in Summer Haven. Impossible. Her ears strained to hold on to the music but it floated away. Whoever had been playing stopped or the wind had shifted and sent the notes in another direction. It must have been her imagination. Too many memories here. Way too many. Many good. Many bad. Shaking her head she walked through the open door into the dark. Joey and Laurie’s apartment was in the heart of town, across from the gazebo she’d pointed out to her children as they’d driven in. This was the place she’d grown up in and had run away from. Twice. Home. How come she always found herself back here? She didn’t know. For a late September evening in Florida it was chilly. She strolled, shivering, across the park grass and climbed up into the gazebo. It was one of those old-fashioned wooden structures that had been lovingly built by hand in an earlier time where that sort of craftsmanship mattered. It hadn’t changed in all these years. Still lovely. Sturdy. A little peeling paint, a creak or two was new, but otherwise, like the park and the town, it was as she remembered it. Sitting down, she inhaled the scents of the surrounding darkness. The pungent leaves, the fresh smelling grass and the gritty dirt. Somewhere above her an owl took flight. She could hear its call as its wings took it high into the sky. Hear its wings beating the air. The night soothed her; heightened her senses. Everything seemed unreal. As if she was in a dream. Each sound and sight, a kaleidoscope, folded into the next. Her heart raced as if it were someone else’s. Her skin no longer felt chilled. She felt nothing. Her eyes scanned the landscape around her. The park. The shadowed streets and the squeezed in buildings that even at this late hour were full of customers coming and going. Soon the businesses would close for the night and the people would go home. She’d grown up here; her family had lived and died here. The memories flooded into her and sent her riding on a wave of nostalgia. Joey and her, barefoot children, sprinting down Main Street on a July morning, heading to John’s Confectionary to buy penny candy; playing hide-and-seek on a sweltering evening among the fireflies in the park where she now sat. Racing each other on their battered bicycles down the back country roads. Faster. Faster. Picking wild strawberries and blackberries and gobbling them down, juice trickling down their chins, because as children it seemed they were always starving. Never enough food in the pantry, the refrigerator, the cabinets. Bill collectors banging at the door and peering in the windows. Mom, Joey and her hiding in one of the rooms with the shades drawn and the lights off. Jeff and her as teenagers so hungry for each other they found hiding places all over town…in the velvet dark…to be alone. To kiss. Fondle. Love each other. She could still hear their teenage laughter haunting the night air. So much later. After their bitter divorce when her world had grown so bleak. Her father and her painting houses and scrapping for living money in the scorching summer sun; slaving away together in the Grand Theater to recreate its old glory only then, within weeks, to see it incinerate into ashes. There she was bumping into her boozed up mother in the small supermarket down the street, and reliving the humiliation as she watched her mother run out the front door after stealing a bottle of booze…that she then had to pay for. She remembered the trailer behind the farmhouse, a tiny confined set of rooms she lived in after coming home again the first time. She could still hear the neighing of her father’s two old horses in the field behind it. A prick of sadness remained when she thought of their senseless deaths at the demons’ hands. She’d loved those old nags. Then the disappearances. The slaughter. Her heart wrenching sorrow at her father’s untimely death at the vampires’ hands. Her panicked terror at the cruel attack on Joey in his diner when he almost died. Jeff and her running through the woods knowing they didn’t have much time. Finding the basement of the theater filled with half-alive and dead victims in cages. The fight to the death with the vampires. The fire. Ah, memories. Why was she recalling the unhappy ones more than the happy? She didn’t know. It could be her frame of mind. A lot had happened to her since the days she’d last lived here, and until recently they’d been mainly happy things. Now she was back where she’d begun. At the beginning. Square one. She couldn’t do it all over again. Alone. She just couldn’t. A breeze fluttered the hair around her face. She should have tied it in a ponytail, out of the way. The night chattered around her and she listened. She could hear people moving about and whispering in the houses lining the fringe of the park. A couple was fighting on the next street over about who was going to use the car that night. A baby was crying somewhere. A cat meowed, a series of low-throated vibrations, crying out to the night and another cat answered. Probably locked out of their houses and wanting in. It was as if her ears were catching every minuscule noise. Weird. The night wind must be doing funny things with sound. A cloying smell permeated the air, a perfume of bloody raw meat juices, and almost certainly it came from the steak restaurant across the street. She had the nearly uncontrollable urge to jump up, run over there and find the source of the delicious aroma. Crazy. She forced herself to remain sitting. Her eyes that had been giving her so many problems seemed perfectly clear now. She could see everything in the dark in precise detail. The branches and leaves on the trees were sharply defined against the lighter sky and for a time she stared at the tree line and imagined there were animal or human shapes hiding among them. A game she’d played since a child, sometimes in clouds, floor tiles or among patterns or night trees. There was a prancing horse…a man reaching for the stratosphere…a monster with wide-open mouth and razor sharp teeth. She fidgeted uneasily as a man and woman, holding hands and laughing, walked by. Without warning she was so hungry nothing else in the world mattered. Coming to her feet her head tilted up to smell the air. That sweet scent was all around her. What was it? Blood. Her eyes traveled to the man and woman moving away. Her mouth watered. Oh, my God, what’s happening to me? Spinning around, she fled as if the devil and his pitchfork were behind her. She’d fry up that hamburger and stuff it down her throat if she had to. She was just a little mad from grief, very sad, exhausted and…hungry. A nice fat cheeseburger with all the trimmings would make her feel better. There were homemade brownies on the counter. She’d have a few of those, too. What chocoholic wouldn’t want brownies? But later when she lay down beside her children the hamburger was still waiting in the refrigerator, the brownies untouched on the plate. Her stomach growled. Her veins throbbed. She’d feel like eating, she promised herself desperately, tomorrow. Tomorrow she’d wake up and be okay. Please God.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 The Next Day A cool breeze danced around them and balanced out the warm sun. That morning the weather person had forecast rain and storms coming, but for now the sun ruled firm and steady. Indian summer in Summer Haven. The long twisting driveway was full of potholes and a little gravel. In the winter the holes would fill with water, mud, and tires would have a hard time getting through or around them. There’d be endless puddles to soak her shoes if she didn’t put her feet in just the right spots. Many a day coming home from school she’d slogged that driveway to the front door skip hopping all the way. The memories jumped in the car with her and made her smile. When she’d been young she’d loved coming home to fresh baked cookies and a cold glass of milk in the kitchen. When she was older, after things began to fall apart between her mother and father, not so much. The farmhouse was a decrepit, filthy mess. The wood siding had buckled and the paint was sun faded. The windows were swatches of grime and marbled cracks. It’d been empty for a long time, and before that her parents hadn’t taken good care of it anyway. But it was the house she’d grown up in. It was home once and it would be home again. But only with a whole lot of work. She exhaled loudly and plopped down on the porch steps. “Mom,” Sarah whined as she twirled around one of the posts that barely held up the front porch. “Do we really have to live here? It’s old. Dirty, too. Look, that window’s broke. There’s a hole in it. When the rain comes it’ll let all the water in. I don’t want to be a human fish.” She caught and gave her daughter a spontaneous hug, though the girl’s warmth made her ill at ease. She couldn’t start treating her children differently because she was feeling unwell. They’d been through enough the way it was. “You won’t be. It’ll be fixed long before the rainy times come, honey. It’s just September.” The top porch step was hard and Jenny shifted her weight around until she got comfortable; she pulled the girl into her lap. She was relieved Sarah had stopped asking questions about why they’d had to sell and leave their old house. Every day for weeks that’d been all she’d spoken of. Why did they have to move? Couldn’t they stay there? Her friends were there. Her school. She liked it there. It’d been difficult to convince her they were only doing what they had to do. “Sweetie, the house will look so much better when we get through with it.” Jenny was too conscious of her daughter’s sweat, the channeling of blood beneath the girl’s thin skin. She moved her face away. “After we clear it out and clean it up. You’ll see how a fresh coat of paint inside and out, our comfy furniture and pretty things inside, will make the difference.” “There’s furniture in there already. Old dusty stuff.” Sarah sulked. “I peeked in the window and saw it.” “I know.” Jenny stood up and held out her hand to the girl. She felt the need to get out of the sun. It was time to enter their new home and see how bad it was inside. “Don’t worry about it. Your Uncle Joey and some friends of his are coming out this afternoon to cart most of it away. So let’s go inside, see what has to go and what stays.” She turned her head and shouted, “Teddy, get back here. We’re going in.” Her son galloped around the yard, an untamed colt, exploring the grounds. She’d always liked where the house sat, merely four miles from town but still in the middle of rolling hills and fields. Secluded. Tranquil. Huge leafy oaks stood sentry around it and provided it with shade and cooler air in the summer. The house wasn’t much to look at, but the location was peaceful…if you enjoyed the country. She did. Always had. The symphony of frogs and crickets in the nearby trees calmed her and evoked the sweeter reminiscences of her childhood: the way she’d lay on her second floor bed and listen to the night creatures and the murmuring wind; stare through the windows at the ever changing heavens, the stars and clouds as they raced above her; plan and daydream about the future. They were some of the best times. “I’m here, Mom.” Teddy stomped up the porch steps with his clumsy big feet. Someday he was going to be as tall as or taller than his father. “Let’s see what the inside looks like. I get dibs on one of the upstairs bedrooms. The one in the back by the humongous tree.” “No fair.” Sarah’s voice was petulant. “I wanted that room!” “Hold on you two,” she informed them. “All the bedrooms are upstairs and there are three. We’ll all get one.” Well, one of the rooms was as small as a large closet. That had been Joey’s when they’d been kids. Sarah wouldn’t like it but it was going to be hers. She braced herself for the resistance she’d have to face but knew enticing the girl with fresh paint and new Twilight posters would help ease the disappointment. Sarah was easy to bribe. Whereas Teddy liked money. He’d begun to notice girls and that they noticed him…if he had the coolest clothes and had cash in his pockets. Ah, those were the innocently simple days. When all one cared about was how one appeared to others and what others thought of them. The key Joey had given her that morning stuck in the lock and it took a few tries to pry the door open. He’d said he’d been out there recently, but as she shoved in the door and went inside she couldn’t imagine when that would have been. A year ago? There was an inch of dust and mice leavings sprinkled over everything. Spider webs. The furniture, vintage nineteen sixties or earlier, looked it. After her parent’s death, the house had been abandoned. Nothing had been moved or taken out. Joey wasn’t the sort to ask for extra work if he could avoid it. So now it’d be left to her and the kids to do the bulk of it. Where to start? She meandered through the rooms taking stock. There wasn’t much trash. She had to give her brother some credit, he’d kept it fairly uncluttered; though there were old dishes, canned food in the cabinets and utensils in the drawers that would have to be disposed of. Most of the sparse furniture was junk. It hadn’t been that great when new and now most of it was rotting wood, loose nails and split seams. She opened the old fridge. It was empty but seemed to be working. Joey had had the electric and water reconnected the week before. The stove, too, looked worthy to stay. Good, that’d give her time to buy better appliances because they’d had to leave theirs in their last house. The real estate agent said it’d help its sale. In the living room she yanked open the curtains. The light blinded her, made her skin feel crawly, and she retreated into the shadows. With her children’s eyes on her, she recovered quickly. “All this stuff is going to the dump, except the fridge and the oven. The rest of it’s not worth keeping. We need the space anyway if our furniture’s going to fit.” “I can help you move the heavy things outside,” Teddy offered. “I’m strong.” He wrote TRASH on the television set’s dirty screen with his finger. She remembered the television. It was really old. “That not a bad idea, son. Joey won’t be here for hours but we can get started on things and clear this mess out so we can sweep and mop.” They had the cleaning supplies in the trunk of the car. They’d come prepared. She sent Sarah out for the brooms and mops as she and Teddy moved furniture onto the front porch or into the yard. The heaviest pieces would have to wait for Joey’s arrival; what they could move they did. There was more than enough to keep them busy. They emptied drawers, closets and cubbyholes. The trash bags filled up quickly. Jenny forced herself to work hard, not to think about the way she was feeling. She was no longer tired or weak, but she felt even stranger than the night before. As if she was in a trance. Every noise was too loud. Smells were too strong. Her mind kept going off track, distracting her with disturbing thoughts that didn’t seem to be hers. She didn’t dare close her eyes, not even for a second, or the images came. Running wildly through wet night woods. Chasing something. Something chasing her. Drinking something that filled her belly and made her feel so…good. Flying from one place to another as if she had wings, but she didn’t. So confusing. She couldn’t fly. Not for the first time she feared something was horribly wrong with her; something much more virulent, life altering, than a normal physical ailment. Maybe a brain tumor from the concussion. Or an aftermath of the coma. She should call the doctor she’d had in the hospital, but a badgering voice in her head warned her not to. What could she say? She was feeling odd…couldn’t sleep…couldn’t keep real food down…and that all her senses had gone into overdrive? She was dreaming of, craving…human blood? Smelling it everywhere? Her doctor would either say it was the backlash of her heartache and trauma, give herself a little more time, or he’d insist she check herself into a hospital for immediate observation and more tests. Yikes, more tests? Oh no. She couldn’t do that. Not now. Besides she had too much too do. Her children needed her. She needed them. She had to find a job and bring in some money. Most of all, she was frightened. Because in the deep recesses of her mind there was a possible explanation to the way she was feeling and she couldn’t face it. Couldn’t bear to even think about it. No, no, no. That morning she’d forced herself to eat a bowl of Raisin Bran with bananas, her usual breakfast, but minutes later she’d rushed to the bathroom and threw it up. The face in the mirror glared at her with fevered eyes and skin paler than she’d ever seen it. Why hadn’t she been able to keep the food down when she was so very hungry? She didn’t know. Scared as she was, she didn’t dare say anything to anyone. That tiny insistent inner voice again. Shut up. Ignore it. It’ll go away. You’ll feel better tomorrow. Ha. By the time Joey and his friends drove up in the rented truck in the late afternoon, she and the kids had half the house cleaned out. Somehow it seemed smaller than she remembered. An old-fashioned kitchen, an ample living room and modest bath on the first floor and three bedrooms, one tiny, on the second. It’d be just right for the three of them. She smiled when she discovered her mom’s hidey nooks throughout the house, stashed with rosaries, crucifixes and different size bottles of holy water. A religious woman, until the booze took over, her mother, at all times eccentric, had felt the need to hide these important items. Besides the religious stuff, Jenny found seven dollars in folded cash. Some sharp silvery-looking arrow shaped things she couldn’t identify but reminded her of the metal points some archers used on their arrow shafts. When she was younger she’d taken a year of archery and had been exceptionally good at it. Her teacher had wanted her to try out for the statewide Olympic archery team. Which, at the time, she hadn’t but years afterwards wished she would have. Jenny packed her mother’s strange items in a cardboard box, tied it with a shoestring, and placed it on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, not having the heart to throw them away. “Wow, you’ve been busy, haven’t you? Good job,” Joey praised her as he came in the front door trailed by a short guy with glasses and longish hair, and a blond-headed taller man who looked somehow familiar. “Keeping busy helps.” Joey nodded understandingly. “You want to keep anything?” “Nah. Everything goes, except the refrigerator, the stove, a few odds and ends, and some mementoes I’ve set aside.” She grinned at the two men behind Joey. “Works out great because there’s hardly enough room for the furniture that’s coming. I’d forgotten how small this place was.” “Easier to clean though, hey?” Joey looked around at what she’d done so far. “It will be that.” “It’s nice you and the kids got so much done already. Less work for us.” “You would think of it that way.” Joey tapped the shoulder of the guy with the glasses. “This is a friend of mine, Oscar Schmidt. He’s a manager at the Town Market. “And you remember Andy Sullivan, don’t you? He went to high school with us.” “Oh, I remember you,” she tilted her head at the man as he smiled and put out a hand to shake. It was the briefest shake in history. She barely touched his hand. “Graduated a year or two behind me, right? You used to come over and you and Joey flew those motorized airplanes out in the back field?” Andy’s airplanes. They were too expensive for Joey to have had one. Their father hadn’t believed in buying expensive toys when the fields and trees were around to play in free. Oh, she remembered Andy all right. The boy who’d lived in a sprawling fancy house and whose parents had money. The boy who’d had the brand name clothes and a pocketful of cash for ice cream in his pockets. She’d never understood what Joey saw in him. Andy had been spoiled, selfish, and never missed a chance to rub his wealth in their noses. She hoped he’d changed. He might have if he were helping them. So she’d give him the benefit of the doubt. For now. Andy bobbed his head, his smile wider. “Yep. That was me. I remember you, too. I used to be jealous of you in archery class. You hit so many damn bull’s eyes.” “You remember that?” She laughed. “I haven’t drawn a bow since I was sixteen.” “You were astonishingly good. The Annie Oakley of the bow and arrow. I fell in love with the sport that year myself partly because of you. You made it look so easy. Now it’s one of my passions. I hunt with bow and arrow whenever I can; even make my own bows and arrows out of the aspen wood that’s so prevalent on my dad’s property. He has a hundred acres of wooded land about fifty miles from here. I go there to hunt.” Hadn’t she read somewhere Aspen was the wood vampires despised because used as a stake it could pierce their skin? Kill them? A peculiar thought to have. “Wow, you make your own bows and arrows? The man has hidden talents,” she said. “You might want to come with me some day to my dad’s place and I’ll let you use one of the bows. I have a spare. See if you can still hit that bull’s eye.” “Thanks. I’ll consider that kind offer. But right now I’m a little busy. Moving in. Two fatherless kids, a dilapidated farmhouse to refurbish and a job to find. I’ll get back to you,” she said with a noncommittal expression, “later.” “Anytime.” His manner, his smile seemed sincere. Perhaps he had changed. People did. All the time. She should have been self-conscious with two almost strangers staring at her. Her clothes were grimy; her face was dirt smudged and her hair was tugged into an unflattering ponytail. She wasn’t. She didn’t care. These days her appearance was the last thing on her mind. “You look almost the same,” Andy told her. “Not a day older then when I last saw you. How do you do that?” Her shoulders rose slightly then fell. She didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. Her mirror said different, lately. “Everyone ages. Maybe you need your eyes checked?” She smiled sweetly. He was helping her so she didn’t want to be too unsociable. “I’ve read your books, you know. I liked them. Immensely. The one about the vampires in the theater…wow that was something. And I loved that last ghost story. So eerie.” “You and about ten other people. But thank you.” “Where do you come up with those ideas?” “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.” “Well, wherever you get your ideas, don’t stop. I, for one, appreciate your books. Can’t wait for the next one.” She brushed the compliments off, a disquiet she couldn’t understand crowding in. She didn’t care one way or another what he thought of her. He was a friend of Joey’s, that’s all. Nothing more. The remarks about her books should have pleased her, but now her writing career felt so long ago and frivolous. Another person. Another life. If you couldn’t make a living at it what good was it? “Thank you for coming today and helping.” “You’re welcome. Here in Summer Haven we help our neighbors. It’s the small town friendly thing to do, you know?” “I know. I lived here. So things haven’t changed much?” She posed the question to Joey but her eyes were on Andy. “Not much,” Joey replied. Andy nodded agreeably. “So let’s get to work.” Between the four of them and the kids the house was empty and clean by dusk. “Whew, glad that’s done.” Joey groaned, leaning against the truck filled with the remnants of their childhood home. The faint radiance from the house’s lights spilled out into the yard. She could see everyone clearly, even in the weak light. “The guys and I are going to take this load to the dump and head back to town,” Joey said. “After we drop off the truck at the rental place we’ll meet at the diner. I promised the guys, as payment for their help, that supper’s on me.” She felt her brother glance at her in the dim light. He’d been watching her a lot during the afternoon. She knew why. She never took the sunglasses off. Direct light hurt her eyes. In the mirror that morning even she’d noticed how pale she was, how colorless her irises behind the glasses. She knew she was behaving strangely, even for her circumstances, but couldn’t help herself. Now, she could tell, he was even more anxious about her. “You and the kids are invited, too. Laurie’s cooked up pot roast for the special tonight. And, trust me, it’s delicious.” Her first reaction was to say no. The thought of food made her stomach hurt, but her children were looking expectantly at her with their hungry eyes so, instead, she muttered, “That sounds fine, Joey. We’ll meet you there. I have a few things I need to wrap up here first. A couple things to check. Just call me when you’ve unloaded this stuff, dropped off the truck and you’re on your way to the diner.” “I’ll do that.” She turned to Oscar and Andy. “Thank you both for helping us today.” She stood apart from them. The smell of their warm blood pumping below their flesh was too strong, too intoxicating. She couldn’t bear to be close. The smells, the strange feelings she was having, were too disturbing. Skin could tear so easily. Andy nodded, making a dismissive gesture with his hand. “It was nothing. Jenny, it’s been great seeing you again. I’m sure I’ll be running into you around town–and at Joey’s diner tonight. See you there.” He got in the truck’s cab, but his eyes never left her. Oscar echoed, “And it’s been nice meeting you, Jenny.” He tagged on at the last second, “Sorry for your loss. If there’s anything you or the kids need and I can help, don’t hesitate to call. I’m at the Town Market most every week day and some evenings. Come on by and I’ll give you a coupon book for the weekly specials.” A friendly smile. Joey had mentioned Oscar had a wife who worked at the nearby K-Mart, five kids of his own and knew what it was like to take care of a family. He had a generous heart. A churchgoer, his church also helped anyone who needed it. “Thank you, Oscar. I’ll remember that if we need anything.” She wouldn’t but she didn’t feel like saying anything more. The day had used her up. Emotionally, it’d been difficult. Cleaning out her parent’s house brought back so many bittersweet memories. Like the town, the house had a long history for her and in the dust she’d recalled so many forgotten things. “Uncle Joey,” Teddy spoke up. “Can I ride with you to the dump? Can I?” He was standing by the truck’s passenger door, his hand already on the handle. “Please?” “Me too!” Sarah was bouncing up and down beside her brother. Her excitement exhausting. “I want to go to the dump, too!” Joey looked to Jenny for permission. “If your mom says it’s okay, you both can come.” “Is there room for them with three of you men in the cab?” She was too tired to fight. After spending the day with a sullen, strange behaving mother, the children wanted a break. She didn’t blame them. She wanted a break. Joey was more fun. “Sure,” her brother replied. “We’ll make room. Sarah can sit on my lap.” “That’s against the law, isn’t it?” Jenny asked. “She should be in a car seat.” “I know. But just this once? It’s such a short distance away. Besides, I know all the local cops by their first name and feed every one of them most days. Worse they’d do is give me a warning.” Joey laughed. “Don’t worry, Sis. I’ll drive slow. Be careful. With all this crap in the back, I have to.” “Mom, please?” Teddy begged again and she couldn’t turn him down. There’d been so little pleasure in his life, in either of her children’s lives, lately. A short ride couldn’t hurt them. “Okay. Just don’t be too big of pests, you hear? Listen to your Uncle Joey.” “Thanks Mom,” Teddy scrambled into the truck, Sarah right behind him. Jenny was surprised. They did all fit. She waved as the truck maneuvered out of the driveway and took off down the highway into the dark. She stood there, thinking, bathed in the light from the doors and windows, then sighed and walked into the house. Turning off the lights as she made her way through the rooms she ended up in the upstairs bedroom, the one that had been hers as a child and young adult, and, in the dark, stared out the windows overlooking the back yard. The homestead hadn’t changed much. The oak tree filling the windows was now a massive tangle of branches and leaves rising to the sky. She and Joey used to climb out of this very window in the wee hours when their parents were asleep, down the tree’s trunk, and escape into the night fields to play. Later as a teenager, she’d scuttle down it to dash out and meet Jeff. The memories brought a smile to her lips. Running wild and free as a child as a fair weather moon looked on. Playing tag with Joey. Eavesdropping through windows at their neighbors. Making mischief around town. Good times. The house had been full of love in those early years. Her life, too. Her night vision, sharper than ever before, focused in on other things. There was the old shed, crumbling from age and termites, at the end of the yard. Beside it, the wobbly swing set was now a rusted skeleton against the darkening sky. Lumps of discarded metal and plastic littered the rest of the yard. Old washing machines. Discarded televisions. Rusted parts of junked cars. Her dad could never get rid of anything. Might need a part or something, he’d say. Best to keep it for a bit. Problem was the bit went on into years. The leftovers never left. It’d have to be cleared out and the trash taken away. Eventually. She didn’t want to think about it now. The night was beckoning her. Locking the house, she went outside and began the well-remembered trek across the yard into the backfield. Early fall had arrived with a wisp of cool air her skin couldn’t register. She’d loved the fall in Illinois. She’d feel the air kissing her skin as the trees swayed in the breeze, and it’d make her shiver. Florida’s autumn was a mild shadow of the Midwest’s season so there’d be no frigid cold. No snow. But if she were in Millstadt now she had the suspicion her skin wouldn’t feel the chill there, either. The moon had risen and provided light to see where she was going. Though with her keen sight and her memory she didn’t need it. She would have known the way no matter what. She vaulted over a rickety wooden fence. Amazed at the ease with which she sprang into the air and landed nimbly on her feet. The debilitating fatigue she’d been experiencing the last few weeks had subsided. She felt stronger than she ever had. Stronger than she had the right to feel. The trailer where she’d lived that long ago summer after her divorce was no longer there. For an instant her eyes saw it again. Hiding in the weeds. A long metal shape, dented and shabby. Her home for a short while as she’d tried to sort out her life. At the end of that summer, after she’d reunited with Jeff and moved out, her father had had the trailer, with her approval, taken away. She wondered sometimes where it had gone and to whom. Was someone still living in it somewhere? She didn’t know. On the wind and among the distant trees a ghostly neighing and whinnying swirled as if her two old friends were still out there somewhere; still remembered and loved her. Ah, she missed them too. Black Beauty. Lightning. She hoped they were both happy wherever they were; that the grass was green and the oats were plentiful and they ran free and strong in endless pastures. They’d been such good friends to Dad and her. Rest in peace. And damn forever the vampires that had slain them. They’re surely in hell now. Just where Jeff and she sent them the night they burnt the theater down. She wandered along the fence and enjoyed the night. Animals were skittering through the underbrush, climbing in the trees or flying above her. Their wings flapping. Their eyes blinking. She could almost hear their hearts. Beating. Beating. The blood pumping through their tiny bodies. God, she was so hungry. The hunger was entirely another entity apart from her, with a will of its own. She was so lost in it, that when the fox darted out in front of her and, seeing or sensing her, scampered into the surrounding woods, she didn’t think twice before she chased it. It was quick, but she was quicker. In less than a second she had it in her hands, rung its furry neck and brought it to her lips. She plunged her teeth, which somehow felt longer and sharper, into its flesh and drank until there wasn’t anything left to drink. Then realizing what she’d done, she screamed and collapsed to the ground, her body racked with shock. Revulsion. She touched her teeth with shaking hands. They were like daggers. Why did she do that? What was she becoming? She suspected. She feared. Yet doubt was nearly gone and nothing would ever be the same again. Her life, her future, forfeited. Her world crumbled around her like sand castles buffeted by waves. She cried, dry sobs, because there were no real tears. It was as if she’d lost the ability to weep as well as to feel…human. And in that moment she knew. She knew who had attacked her and Jeff that night under the viaduct; murdering him, and putting her into a coma she wasn’t supposed to have come out of. Vampires. “They’ve made me a monster like them. A monster.” She ranted and railed at her fate until her throat was raw. Sprinting through the woods, she ran to forget, ran to escape the inescapable truth. What about her children? Joey and Laurie? Was she a threat to them? Should she find a way to kill herself or should she just dissolve from their lives? She’d already lost Jeff. How could she leave her children? The thought of losing them was so unbearable her heart wouldn’t accept it. Running blindly, her panic-stricken mind couldn’t come up with the answers. What should she do? There was no cure for vampirism and so she was a danger to them. What should she do? Later, when she’d calmed down and dropped to her knees in the grass beneath her bedroom window, her heart answered. She could never leave Teddy and Sarah. After losing her husband, she cherished, loved them more than life itself. She couldn’t live, didn’t want to live, without them. And they needed her. If she abandoned them, it’d break what was left of their hearts. Destroy them completely. Joey, too. Then again, they might need her to protect them from the monsters who’d done this. They could be in danger. She knew better than most people vampires didn’t like to leave loose ends; would do anything to protect their secret lives, their existence. They didn’t allow witnesses to live and she had. Survived. She knew of them and they wouldn’t take the chance she’d keep quiet. So if she left her children alone they might not be safe. As she lay on the ground, her nose filling with the pungent smell of dirt, a raging instinct for survival took over and it was stronger than all her doubts and fears or her uptight morality. She didn’t want to leave those she loved. She didn’t want to be alone. There had to be a way to exist as a vampire but to do no harm to others and she had to find it. She’d killed the fox and drank its blood. And felt all right. Not great, but she could live with it. At least, the intense hunger had dissipated. Who said she had to prey on humans to live when animals would do? No one. Later she’d question if it was because of what she’d become, or because of the love she had for her family and her own life, that she made the decision she did. She’d never know. Because by the time she’d moved to the front yard and dropped onto the top step of the porch, her breathing steady but heart pounding, she had only one thought in her mind as she gazed around her childhood home. She was going to find a way to raise and love her children. Protect them from her…and from harm. Live her life without being a monster. Somehow. And if there wasn’t a way? No. Then she’d damn well find one. Because she would never, never, never leave her children. *** She wanted to call Joey and beg off for late supper at the diner but he was worried enough and she didn’t want to give him more cause. The fox’s blood had done the trick and as she peered into the bathroom mirror she had to admit she looked healthier than she had since before the attack. Her eyes shone, her skin was flushed and her mind was clear. She was cognizant of everything around her. Every little thing. After rinsing most of the blood from her sweater and blue jeans she stuffed the wet clothes, and the towel she’d gotten from the car, into a plastic bag and hid them in the closet of the room upstairs that would be hers. She’d clean them as soon as her washer and dryer arrived and hoped the blood would come out. She telephoned the movers and they promised the furniture would be at the house the following afternoon. That’d give her and the kids half the day tomorrow to finish getting the place ready. If she started early it could be done. If she worked real hard she might avoid thinking about her situation. Then she drove into town. All she knew, as she parked in front of the restaurant, was she felt better than she had in weeks. It was such a huge relief even the guilt at killing the fox and at what she now knew she was becoming couldn’t dampen it. It was a high that kept the growing revulsion away. It wasn’t normal, any of it, but she didn’t care. Self-survival had kicked in. She got out of the car and went into the diner. She didn’t look at the Dollar General; didn’t think about the theater that had once been there. Didn’t think about the irony of what Jeff and she had done all those years ago and now her own situation. There’d be time enough for that later once she and her children were situated in their new home. At the moment, she had other more important things to tend to. Inside, the bright lights didn’t hurt her eyes as much as they had earlier. Her smile came easily as her daughter ran up and burrowed into her embrace. “Mom, where were you? We tried to wait but we were hungry.” “That’s all right, honey. You should have eaten. I didn’t mean to take so long but…something came up and I had to deal with it.” She gazed down at the girl, gently brushed the hair from her eyes. Time for another haircut. Sarah’s hair grew faster than weeds. It was halfway down her back. Tomorrow morning she’d have to braid it. She needed to start being a better mom. She’d let so much go the past few weeks. “That’s good cause we’re done. You’ll have to eat alone. Sorry Mom.” “That’s okay. I ate snacks I had in the car so I’m not hungry. I’ll just have coffee.” Joey stood beside her. “Not going to eat? Again?” That look of puzzlement she’d come to know too well shadowing his face. “Sis, you’re skin and bones. Snacks won’t do it. You sure you don’t want something more substantial? Like real food? A roast beef sandwich maybe? You always liked roast beef as I recall.” “No thanks.” She tried a different tact. “I think I ate a moldy cupcake or something. My stomach’s upset. I promise I’ll eat something later. I’m an adult remember? Stop bugging me.” Joey’s expression was skeptical but he didn’t nag her further. He’d stopped telling her what to do years ago and she’d stopped listening. Growing up and moving far away could do that. Teddy came up behind her and slipped his hand into hers. “We’re over there in the corner with the others, Mom.” He led her to the booth where Andy, Oscar and Laurie were talking and laughing over what remained of their meals, Laurie having taken a break to eat with everyone. Jenny and the kids joined them as Joey waited on an older couple at the counter. He kept an eye on Jenny, though, his lips in a slight downturn. She didn’t stay long, using an early morning get-up and sleepy children as an excuse. Not even Andy’s pleading for her to stay and talk a little couldn’t tempt her. “Thanks but another time. We’re just all tired. The kids need to get to bed.” “We have another two hours before the diner closes,” Joey said before they departed. “Afterwards we’ll be home. Call me or Laurie if you or the kids need anything, ya hear?” “I hear. But we’ll be fine.” She said goodnight to everyone, packed up Sarah and Teddy and returned to the apartment. “One more night,” she told the kids, “and we’ll be sleeping in our own place again.” When they were asleep she restlessly roamed the apartment and didn’t know why. The hunger had returned. Not as strong as before but it gnawed, a tiny voracious animal in the pit of her stomach, reminding her sooner or later she’d have to hunt again. To even think she’d become what she’d once reviled, galled her. Just knowing she’d have to hunt and kill again was making her physically ill. So she put it out of her mind, or tried to. She couldn’t sleep and spent the time making lists of what she had to do the following morning at the house and brooding about her dilemma. Was there some way to reverse what was happening to her? Was there someone somewhere who could help her? Perhaps there could be salvation for her yet. All she had to do was search for and find it. Or–maybe she was wrong about everything…and it was really just a medical condition? Maybe it’s all in her head? That grief, trauma thing again? Yes, that’s what it was. When Laurie and Joey drove up she snuck quietly into her room. Let Joey think she was sleeping. She wasn’t ready to tell him what was happening and if he saw her alone he’d weasel it out of her. She lay on the air mattress and closed her eyes. When she opened them again it was daylight and the hunger was now a growing fire in her belly. She’d have to put up with it until the night came and she was in her own house with the woods around her. Then she’d tend to it. She rose, dressed, and woke her children. The scent of their blood, so sweet and warm, filling their bodies made her hungrier. Their skin seemed to glow. She looked at them and for the briefest of moments they were no longer her beloved children, her flesh and blood, and her future but…breakfast. It would have been so easy to lay her lips against their baby soft necks and–Stop! What the hell was she thinking? Horrified, she moved away and began furiously packing up their clothes. Would there come a time when she wouldn’t be able to resist the call of their blood? Would she turn into a monster like the ones she’d once fought? God please no. “Come on,” she gently urged. “Let’s get you both something to eat and get out to the house. It’s going to be a busy day.” “Moving day, huh, Mommy?” Sarah’s eyes sparkled, she was so excited. Like her mother she wasn’t happy unless she had a place to nest, a roof over her head and her own bed in her own room. All the things she loved, her clothes, her stuffed animals, her collection of horse statues, her tiny bracelets and necklaces, her feather-soft bed with the Twilight themed comforter on it, were on a truck moving closer to the house that by nightfall would be their new home. “Yep, moving day.” “I’m glad. I miss my stuff.” The child smiled as she slipped into a clean yellow shirt and a pair of worn blue jeans. “My horses. I know they’re not real horses. They’re just little bitty plastic and wooden ones but I still love them and I’ve missed them. I can’t wait until they’re home with me, too.” “I know.” For a while, at around Sarah’s age, or until her parents no longer could afford to keep them, Jenny had had real horses, two of them, and had loved them dearly. The true joy of her childhood. She wanted the same for her daughter, but she had to have an income first. Horses cost money to keep, care for and feed. A lot of money. “Now that we live in the country we might try to get you a real horse someday. Not an expensive thoroughbred or anything like that but a sturdy quarter horse we can all ride.” “Could we really?” Sarah’s hand, so small and trusting, grabbed hers and her smile was like the sun. A sun Jenny hadn’t seen much of lately. “Yes, really. Probably. One day.” “I don’t care much for horses, Mom, you know that,” Teddy chimed in sullenly. “But I would sure like a new bike. My old one’s too small. I’m bigger now. Living out of town like we’ll be doing I’ll need one.” He seemed to mull over something and quickly added, “A used one would be okay. I know we’re short on cash and all.” Her frown came and went quickly. She’d never wanted her kids to endure the poverty she had when she’d been growing up. The truth was it wasn’t going to be easy doing it alone. Jobs, these days, were hard to find and even harder to keep. And she had no idea what she could do for a living. Writing novels was out of the question. It wasn’t dependable. “I think we can swing that. Soon as we’re settled in the farmhouse I’ll look for one for you.” “That would be great.” Teddy smiled, too. Another sun. “Now let’s get our butts moving and get out of here. Day’s a wasting.” She followed them into the kitchen and as her stomach protested she made them breakfast. Bowls of cereal with bananas. They were in a hurry. When she walked past the windows and the sunlight hit her skin, it burned. Left red patches. Oh, oh. When she went outside she’d have to wear long sleeves. Blue jeans. No shorts. Sunglasses again and a hat. Thank goodness it was fall. No one would question her choice of clothes. Joey and Laurie had gotten up earlier and were at the diner making breakfast for their customers. Good thing. She couldn’t face Joey. Not yet. Not until she had more time to work out what she was going to say and how she was going to say it. He’d see right through her evasions. He always did. And she’d have to confess everything. Since she had no idea, not a glimmer, of what she was going to do about her problem, she had no idea what she was going to say. Not yet, anyway.",

      "content": "Chapter 4 Jenny The farmhouse was bare and scrubbed when the big truck rumbled into the driveway. The sun was directly above. The two men, heavy-set and muscled, dispatched from the moving company unloaded everything and kindly placed them in the exact spots Jenny directed them to. Family men themselves, they knew she was a widow, a mother, and couldn’t do enough. One of them, Leonard, joked and spent time with Teddy as they worked, talked about cars and bicycles. Teddy lapped up the attention seemed happy the entire time. Besides evil in the world there were good people as well. A shame she was no longer one of them. Through the excruciatingly long hours of the day as the sun beat down she had the hardest time keeping herself together. Her stomach was crying for food. The sun was way too bright. Her mind was crowded with strange yearnings and bloody vignettes of what she believed were someone else’s thoughts. She was fairly sure of that. In them she was on the hunt in thick gloomy woods, but the quarry was human. There were screaming faces with terror-filled eyes as the life was drained from them and their existence came to an end. Nightmares she couldn’t stop. They made her sick to her stomach…and made her heart race. Whoever or whatever was in her mind was brutally strong, relentless. She shuddered but didn’t think it, whatever it was, knew she was eavesdropping…yet. Over and over she chased the intruder from her mind but as her hunger grew each hour she thought she was going crazy. All she wanted was to flee into the shadowed forest behind the house and hunt anything that was warm and full of blood, rip its throat open and drink. Of course, busy moving into their house and mothering the children she loved and who needed her, she couldn’t. She worked harder. Faster. By dusk her clothes and skin were dirty yet she wasn’t sweating. Sarah and Teddy were tired and sat on the front porch taking a break, lightly bickering back and forth, the stress and the move having finally gotten to them. She was about to give up working for the day when Joey and Andy drove up. “We thought we’d drop by and help you put the beds together,” her brother explained with a smile when he found her in the kitchen stacking dishes in the cabinet. She turned to look at him and was only aware of the enticing aroma of the blood which pumped through his body. It formed a churning mist around him and made her mouth water. It took every ounce of her will to not run over and bite him or Andy. “Thanks,” she muttered, sending her eyes away from the two so they wouldn’t see the hunger burning in them. “That’s sweet of you. Both of you.” “Well,” Joey went on. “You three have to have something to sleep in tonight. I assume you’re staying here?” “You assume right.” “Jenny?” Her brother touched her arm. “Are you okay?” Oh, why could she never hide anything from him? “Sure.” She glanced up. Sighed. “Tired that’s all. Everything’s catching up with me. Guess I’ve over done it the last few days.” “Guess so. Remember only a couple weeks ago you were in a coma. You’re supposed to take it easy. Your doctor warned it’d be awhile before you’d be yourself again.” She almost laughed. If he only knew. Instead she decided to play the weak patient card and sat down at the kitchen table, hung her face in her hands and moaned. “I am really beat.” A tired smile. “I’m so glad you two are here to help. I had thought about the beds needing to be put together but figured we’d just drop the mattresses on the floor and sleep on them that way. Wouldn’t hurt for a night or two.” “Well, now you won’t have to. Andy and I will just tramp upstairs and put them together for you. We brought tools and everything.” Andy waved at her from behind him. “You have become the resourceful one, haven’t you?” she kidded her brother. “I try to be. These days. Everyone has to grow up, right?” His smile, as if he had a secret no one else knew, was the same one she remembered from their childhood. He liked being a hero. “Right.” Joey laid a bulky plastic bag on the table next to her. “Laurie also sent you guys some supper. Hamburgers. Onion rings. Chocolate malts. A pumpkin pie for dessert. There’s a large cup of coffee in there for you. Laurie thought you’d be too tired or busy to bother making something tonight to eat.” She was touched by their thoughtfulness. “Thank you, Brother. And thank Laurie for me when you get back. You two think of everything.” “We try.” “Can you do Sarah’s bed first? I’m pretty sure she won’t be staying up much longer. Last time I saw her she was getting cranky. A sure sign her bedtime’s not far off.” “Will do.” When the two men were upstairs banging at things and cussing she opened the container of coffee and after one sip dumped it down the drain. But it sent her in search of the coffee maker hidden in a cardboard box in a kitchen corner. Once she’d located it she cleaned it out and started a fresh pot of coffee for the guys. They’d probably need a few cups after their tasks were done. Even the smell of percolating coffee roiled her stomach. She called the kids in to eat and, poised by the window, fought the increasing summons of the night as hard as she could. Once she found herself at the door, her hand reaching for the knob to go outside. She froze. “Mom,” Teddy drug her back to reality. “I’m done eating. I’m going outside.” He ran past her, opened the door, and burst out into the yard, singing off key at the top of his lungs. The enticing elixir of what raced below his skin lingered in her nose and tore at her senses. She forgot he was a child…forgot he was her son. All she cared about was bringing him down like a stampeding deer and taking what she so urgently needed. No, no, no. Her moment of insanity was abruptly over and the room began to spin. By the door she leaned against the wall and laughed nervously to cover her shock. It was getting worse. She was losing herself. If Teddy hadn’t bumped into her as he ran out and snapped her out of it she would have been gone. Out the door, too. Into the dark. Doing God knows what to God knows whom. Possibly even to her son. Oh, God. Sarah was slumped in a chair, picking at her food. Jenny walked over and laid a trembling hand on her daughter’s shoulder. “Honey, it’s been a long day. You’re sleepy aren’t you?” “Nah.” The girl yawned, her eyelids drifting downward. Jenny knew her child. In another minute she’d been asleep in the chair. “Well, a little.” A second yawn. “Soon as your uncle’s done putting your bed together we’ll tuck you in. Okay?” “Sure Mommy.” Sarah took another sip of her malt and another bite of hamburger. Jenny couldn’t bear to stand near the child and resumed putting glasses and cups away. Outside she could hear Teddy playing around the house, climbing the tree in the backyard and humming to himself. Part of her wanted to go out and join him. Kick her heels up like an innocent child, ignorant of the bad things that could come out of the dark. Her soul shivered. To be in her childhood home again was strange. She’d always loved the farmhouse, the towering shade trees, and the rolling land, fields and lush woods veined with flowing creeks and dotted with shady ponds, surrounding it. A peaceful setting of beauty, it’d been her Walden’s Pond during her growing up years through the good times and her refuge during the bad. Their furniture from the other house was all around her, blending the old life with the new. So it was home, a different home, but it felt comfortable. Tomorrow morning she’d begin painting the rooms until the whole house was done. Fresh and cheerful. It would have been easier if the place had been empty a little longer but that hadn’t been the way it’d worked out. She’d cover things with plastic and move them around, until her task was finished. Then she’d lay the rugs the movers had rolled up and stashed in the downstairs hallway. And the farmhouse would become a lovely home for her children. But even paint and better furniture couldn’t cancel the past. The room around her was filled with bygone angst. There were unhappy memories here, as well. Going hungry too many nights because her father had no handyman jobs or hadn’t been paid. Her mother, Estelle, didn’t work outside the home. At night she’d listen, trembling, in her cold bed to her parents arguing over money. Then years later, her father had lived here alone, broken-hearted and fragile, after her mother had escaped to a barren apartment in town so she could drink herself to death in peace. Only, in the end, she hadn’t died of alcohol. No, she hadn’t. She’d been taken by vampires. Jenny hung her head, shook away the clinging memories. All houses had ghosts of one kind or another. Right now it was more of a concern to her that the wiring and plumbing weren’t up to code and probably unsafe. Ghosts she could handle. Broken pipes and house fires she couldn’t. Sarah was snoozing in the chair and Jenny tried to wake her. She couldn’t. When the child was asleep not much could rouse her. Jenny marveled at how light the girl seemed in her arms as she carried her up the stairs. In the doorway to Teddy’s room, she stood, holding her child. “Joey, is Sarah’s bed ready?” “Yep.” Her brother stepped away from the bed. “Got both kid’s beds together. Now we’ll go work on yours.” He took Sarah from her arms and laid her on Teddy’s mattress. “She’ll be okay here while you make up her bed in the other room.” “Good idea. Why didn’t I think of that?” she said with a touch of sarcasm. “There’s fresh coffee downstairs if either one of you want some. I left cups and sugar on the counter. Creamer’s in the fridge.” She moved into the other room. Gathering the sheet and covers, she made Sarah’s bed, and fetched her. Andy insisted on carrying the girl from Teddy’s room and laid her on her bed. Jenny tucked the child beneath the covers. Sarah hadn’t quivered an eyelid. “She’s really out of it, isn’t she?” Andy spoke softly. “Well, she’s had a hard day in a really hard month.” Jenny stepped away so she wasn’t in close proximity to him. After feeling Sarah in her arms, her flesh soft against hers, she had little tolerance left for being close to anyone else. “You’ve all had a hard time.” Andy looked at her in the pale light from the hallway. She’d switched the dresser’s lamp off once Sarah was under the blankets. “I didn’t say anything yesterday, but I heard about your husband. I’m so sorry for your loss.” “Thank you.” She had no tears left to shed, even if she could have. She waited for the inevitable conclusion to his pity. Ah, here it was. “And if there’s anything I can do to help you or the kids, don’t hesitate to ask.” He must have heard her choked breath because he gently touched her arm. “Jenny, I know how you’re feeling. I do. I lost my wife four years ago in a car accident. I know words won’t change a thing. They don’t ease the sorrow. Stop the pain. Only time will.” His smile was hesitant, poignantly sad. He was still hurting. She could see it. “Then I’m sorry for your loss. You have any children?” “No. Oh, we wanted some. God just never saw fit to grant us our wish.” “I’m sorry for that as well.” She fell silent and the moment was over. She found herself staring at his neck and had to drag her eyes, her body, away. Get a grip. “Excuse me, I need to get Teddy’s bed ready. He’s outside playing but I bet here real soon he’ll want his bed, too.” “I know,” Andy finished for her, “it’s been a hard day.” For the first time, a small smile crept out. “Yes, it has. But we accomplished a lot. We’re moved in. Thanks to the help of family and friends. Thank you, Andy.” “You’re welcome. I’m glad you think of me as a friend. I realize back in the day I was your brother’s friend, and you and I weren’t close, but I hope now you consider me one of yours.” “I will.” “You know,” he kept talking, trailing her to the room Joey had just left. “I did know Jeff, your husband.” Surprised, she swung around and met his eyes. Well, Jeff had been born and raised in Summer Haven after all. Many people knew him. “You did?” “Oh, he was a year ahead of me in school but we played together in the school band for two years and we were sort of friends. He used to call me his little brother because I tagged along after him so much. It’s how I first met Joey actually, once you and Jeff started dating all those years ago, through Jeff. We grew apart, out of touch, when Jeff left town the first time, though. When he returned the second time he wasn’t here long enough for us to renew that friendship. But I never forgot him.” “You and my husband were really friends, huh?” “Yeah, really. I have fond memories of our high school years. He was a good guy. The best. He could make me laugh when no one else could. You know? With those tasteless but endearing jokes of his?” Jenny didn’t know what to say. Just thinking of her husband sent a splinter through her heart. She would have given anything to have him there to talk over what was happening to her. Anything. Joey called him from the other room. “Hey, Andy, come and help me with Jenny’s bed, would you?” “I’m on my way, buddy.” He disappeared into her room and Jenny made up her son’s bed, the whole time fighting the compulsion to scramble out the window and down the branches of the oak tree and flee into the night. To find food. To feed. Not yet. Soon. When everyone left and she was alone. The children sleeping. Soon. Not soon enough. A half hour later her company hadn’t left. She couldn’t be rude to someone who’d helped her and had to suffer through the socializing. The three of them sat in the kitchen having coffee, Joey and Andy having leftover pie, and chatting about how the town had changed. Teddy, finally worn out from the day, slept upstairs in his room. Deep night had fallen outside. Jenny kept her eyes off the windows; fearful the siren call of the night would bewitch and drag her from the light. She drummed her fingers on the table, pushed down the intense thirst and beneath the droning of conversation she kept telling herself to wait. Soon. Soon. Joey and Andy wouldn’t stay forever. And the night would still be out there. She was terrified at the changes she’d been experiencing in her body and her mind. Her physical strength was growing, her senses were more acute and her thought patterns, her very way of viewing the world, were changing. She couldn’t stop them and, though she didn’t want to admit it, she liked them and that upset her, too. Before the attack under the viaduct she would have only seen the evil side of what she was morphing into…but now she saw her evolving in endless shades of gray. Funny how, in the end, raw survival took over. Somewhere along the way she’d ceased thinking of herself as a monster. Now she was just a widow, mother of two children who really needed her, who had to find a way to manage something horrible that had happened to her. Sort of like a handicap. Like paralysis, missing limbs or a scarred body. Didn’t people adapt and learn to live with them all the time? They did. It hadn’t been her fault. She hadn’t asked for it. Now all she wanted was to live and shield those she loved because they might need her to do so. Yet self-control was the first issue she had to address. If she couldn’t keep from draining her loved ones of all their blood then she was in big trouble. She focused on the discussion they were having. It took a lot of focus. “Yeah, Summer Haven isn’t the same town you vacated a decade ago,” Andy was saying and she concentrated to understand his words. “This bad economy has thinned the business base around here, particularly downtown. Did you see how many shops and businesses were closed up, shuttered and empty?” A plate in front of him held a remnant of pumpkin pie, his second piece. He’d had three cups of coffee and she had no doubt he’d be having a fourth. He was hungry. Like her. She felt bad she didn’t have something else to give the guy besides leftover pie. A sandwich or something. But her refrigerator was empty until she went shopping. There she was…thinking like a puny caregiving human. Ech. Old habits were hard to break. “Nah, I guess I was too busy soaking in the nostalgia.” And worrying about what the hell was happening to her. “It’s that bad?” She tried not to stare at the vein throbbing in his temple. She licked her lips. “Well, at least half the shops lining Main Street have shut their doors in the last two years. Not to mention the residential foreclosures and job losses. Last summer the biggest employer in the area, the Golden Stove Factory out on Fifth Street, shut down and laid off two thirds of the town. People are really hurting now.” “Working at the bank I imagine you’ve seen it all.” “Unfortunately, I have. I’ve watched friends and neighbors apply for loans we can’t give them. Seen people deplete their savings and bank accounts just to pay their monthly bills. Many of my friends have lost their houses and are living with relatives. It’s hurt the bank, too. If we can’t loan money and our customers are leaving then we also feel it. There’s been rumors of layoffs where I work.” He shook his head. “Difficult times.” Joey agreed. “Running a diner I’ve seen and heard all the hard luck stories. Laurie and I have steadily lowered prices this last year to help people out. I even give free meals to some I know are hungry. “There’s this one old gal, Lizzie Davenport, who’s been out of work for a very long time. She had a job at the stove foundry for twenty-five years, no pension cause the place went belly up, yet since she’s over sixty she can’t find another job no matter how hard she tries. Used up her retirement savings. Lost her car and then her house. I really feel for her because I’ve known her since we were kids. I help her as much as I can.” He glanced at her. “Remember her, Jenny? She had that brick house on Rose Street. In the winter we used to shovel the snow off her driveway and sidewalks and afterwards, along with the money, she’d give us homemade brownies and milk?” “I remember Lizzie and those brownies. Though anything tastes great when you’re starving.” Everyone in town knew Lizzie, a sweet woman who’d do anything for anyone. In her time she’d helped many people so it was only fair people helped her now. “Lizzie spells us now sometimes at the restaurant,” Joey said. “Not much of a waitress but she’s a pretty fair cook. We don’t pay her much but we give her free room and board in a tiny bedroom we fixed up for her behind the diner. Once we added on there was this cubby space in the rear we at first used for extra storage. Walk-in closet size. Now it has a bed and a few things squeezed in. At least she has a place to sleep and keep her belongings. Until things get better for her anyway. She’s been saving her money.” “You have a good heart, Brother.” “I try. There’s so much sorrow in the world. I do what I can.” He stood up, stretched; and sent a nod towards Andy, who was stuffing the last piece of pie into his mouth. “I think it’s time for us to go, buddy. Knowing my sister, she can’t wait to get back to cleaning and pushing furniture around.” His eyes skimmed the kitchen and peered into the living room. “It looks good already. Homey. Your furniture dresses up the old place mucho. You have excellent taste.” “Wait until I get the walls painted and add the final decorating touches. It won’t look like the same house.” “Heck, it doesn’t look like the same house now. After you’re done I won’t recognize it. I’m sorry I never got in here and fixed it up.” Joey was inching towards the door. She wanted to help move him along but held herself in check. “I honestly didn’t know what to do with it for the longest time and then I started the renovations on the diner and kind of forgot about it.” “At least you remembered to pay the yearly taxes. I have to thank you for that. Otherwise I’d be homeless now because I can’t afford squat.” “You’re welcome.” Her brother came over and hugged her. His flesh was so warm. His skin so thin. So breakable. She could hear his heart beating loudly in his chest. Cymbals clanging to a mystifying symphony. “I always knew I’d need this old house somewhere down the road. For you or someone. Had a premonition. Almost let Lizzie move in last year but she didn’t want the hassle of caring for a house and she didn’t have a car anyway to get back and forth to work. She walks everywhere so she needed to stay in town.” “I’m happy to have it.” Her eyes went to Andy as he got up from his chair. “Again, thanks for your help yesterday and today, Andy.” “You’re more than welcome. Remember if you need anything–” “I know, call you. But ask my brother, I can take care of myself.” “That she can.” Joey nodded. “See ya later, Sis. I’ll call tomorrow to see how you’re doing. Phone me if you need me before that, okay?” She gave her brother a mock salute. “I will. Now goodnight both of you.” The two men trudged out the door. Their feet crunched in the gravel. Joey’s truck revved up and drove away. Free at last. Shutting her eyes, she lingered at the door and listened to the night animals beyond the glass. They were frolicking out there in the autumn murkiness among the crispy leaves and cool dirt covered ground. Little creatures, with nocturne eyes and speedy feet, full of hot blood. The mother in her fretted over leaving her children alone in the house but the hunger overpowered the mother and she snuck outside into the darkness. She told herself they’d be fine. She’d be back shortly. That she should reward herself for her self-restraint all day. She hadn’t attacked one living person. Hadn’t gone crazy or hung from the rafters by her feet. She’d done well. She told herself that killing innocent little animals wasn’t all that creepy, wasn’t all that bad, considering the alternative. It didn’t work. She loved animals and hated having to kill them at all for any reason. Or had. But, she had to keep reminding herself, animals died every minute of the day to fill humans’ stomachs. Right? Was what she did any worse than that? All she wanted was their blood. It was her food. She felt guilty only until she captured the large fox, humanely snapped its neck to drink the blood (which tasted better than anything she’d ever drank or eaten) and then was too exhilarated to think of anything but further feeding her hunger; not even that she could run faster than she ever had, could see like an owl through the darkness, smell her prey miles away and that her teeth were changing. When she stuck her finger into her mouth she could feel the points. Oh, great. Little fangs. Oh, Lord, could this get any weirder? She thought about those horror movies she’d seen over the years where some unlucky human had been bitten and was slowly turning into god-knows-what and couldn’t believe or accept it. Was in shock. Now she knew exactly how they’d felt. Though, in the end, she did feel regret for killing the poor fox and the one the night before. But, yes, it was better than feeding off homo sapiens. Damn straight it was. After ingesting the blood she felt as if there was nothing she couldn’t deal with. No problem she couldn’t solve, no disaster she couldn’t avert. She was superwoman. This wasn’t so bad, was it? It’d occurred to her perhaps if a good person became a vampire that might be the key. Good person equals good vampire? Bad person equals bad vampire? She could only pray that was the case. Oh, it could be worse. She could lust after human blood and not be able to resist. Now that would be a deal breaker. She absorbed the night poised beside a towering tree, its limbs shifting in the wind; inhaled the dizzying perfumes of the forest. Her lips on the verge of smiling. She felt better than she had since she’d come out of the coma weeks ago. Her new world revolved around her in slow motion. The night birds cooed in their nests. The air danced among the dying leaves. Insects skittered between limbs and under bushes. On the breeze there were aromatic wisps of brewing coffee and chocolate (cake she thought), fresh baking bread and as always now, blood. Animal blood in the small bustling creatures hiding out all around her and in the distance the cloying scent of human blood. Her children asleep in their beds. Amazing. God, the night was beautiful. That’s when she saw the pale figure hiding between the trees to her left. A tall man dressed in drab clothes watched her. She merged deeper into the woods among the thicker underbrush but when she looked back, he was still on the fringe observing. Waves of uneasiness rippled through her and the vertigo was unbalancing. This man stalking her wasn’t her friend. This man was dangerous. If he was a man. She ran all the way home at a speed she never would have imagined a human capable of. More like flying really. Her feet barely touched the ground, her night eyes so keen she never once collided with a tree or stumbled over a rock. Within seconds she was inside the farmhouse peeking out the windows; the mysterious stranger nowhere in sight. Thank God. Had she really seen him? Or had it been a trick of her imagination, her eyes seeing strange things in the darkness? Maybe it’d been a pale hued limb split and broken besides a darker trunk? Since the attack she was paranoid, that’s all. Seeing things that weren’t there. Minutes later she’d nearly forgotten the man and the gut-wrenching fear. She continued cleaning and rearranging furniture, no longer tired. She worked through the night and didn’t look out the windows again. By morning she’d forgotten the man in the woods. Almost. There was so much to do before the children woke.",

      "content": "Chapter 5 Jenny “Mom, we got to go to the grocery store today for sure.” Sarah stared into the refrigerator, her hand holding the door open. “We don’t have no milk. Well, we don’t have anything really. How are we going to eat breakfast?” “Pop Tarts. There’s a box in the cabinet above you. Strawberry iced. You like strawberry. Water to drink.” A twinge of guilt bit her. What kind of a mother was she…no food in the house, no milk? Terrible. But she’d had other things on her mind. “Positively, we’ll go to the store today. First thing.” “We haven’t unpacked the toaster yet.” Sarah pointed out. “I’ll find it.” Teddy volunteered. “It’ll be in a box marked kitchen appliances, right?” “It should be.” Jenny was wiping down the doors of the cabinets with furniture polish, erasing a thin film of grime that covered everything. An empty house collected a lot of dusty gunk. Outside the sun was hiding behind clouds. Rain was coming. She could smell it as she could smell the blood in the animals frolicking in the forest behind the house. Rabbits. The kids had been up for fifteen minutes and were in their pajamas. Tired from the move, they’d slept late. Jenny had never gone to bed. Too much to do. She looked at her daughter. “Soon as you eat and get dressed we’ll go shopping. You’re right, we need food. Supplies.” “Can I come, too?” Teddy shouted from the other room where he was rummaging around in the boxes. “Of course. You’re the man of the house. You can load up and bring the groceries in.” “Thanks. I always wanted to be a pack mule,” he shouted back. “And you’d make a fine one, too.” Jenny snickered. “With those big strong shoulders of yours.” “Mom,” her son’s voice irritated as only a pre-teen’s could be. “Please.” When he put the toaster on the counter she gave him a hug. He was getting so tall. Every day he reminded her more and more of his father. An uncannily smart kid. Hard working and dependable. “Thanks for finding the toaster, son.” “Wasn’t hard. You wrote on the side of the boxes what was inside each one. Makes it pretty easy–if you can read that scribble of yours. Mom, you got to write clearer.” “I’ll remember that next time we move.” She’d forgotten she’d listed the items on each box. Just another thing she’d forgotten. She wondered what was happening to her memory then that thought, too, escaped from her mind. She couldn’t hold on to them anymore. Sarah was beside her, tugging at her hand. “I like my room. It’s not real big, but that’s okay. It won’t take too long to paint. I won’t have as much to keep clean, either. Can I get new curtains today for the windows? Black ones to keep out the light, just like a vampire would want, and a purple rug to put on the floor? Oh, maybe black paint for the walls, too?” Jenny’s breath caught in her throat. “Black curtains and paint? Why would you want that?” “It’s the Twilight influence,” Teddy sing-songed, rolling his eyes. “You know, vampires, like in the books? They like the dark, and black and purple are their colors.” “Oh.” Jenny gazed at her daughter, inwardly relieved. “Sarah, sorry, no black curtains. No black walls. I draw the line at that. Black walls would make that room look like a mouse’s closet. Pick lighter colors please.” “Mom.” “No argument on this, Sarah. You’ll thank me later.” When she grows out of this Twilight stage and into the next. “Fat chance,” her daughter grumbled sarcastically under her breath but when she saw the warning look Jenny sent her, she shut up. A sulky expression covered her face instead. A minute later the girl’s moodiness was gone. “Can I still have new curtains and stuff?” Sarah wanted to make the room her daughter’s, make it pretty. A new start deserved a new room. Paint, curtains and a rug couldn’t cost that much, could they? She’d try not to let her money worries spoil their shopping expedition. They’d check out the Dollar Store next to Joey’s Diner. It’d be their third stop after the grocery and the paint store. Though she didn’t relish going in there; treading on the hallowed ground where once the old theater had stood. She didn’t want to wake up the ghosts. But a bargain was a bargain and right now money was tight. “Sure, honey. We’ll get paint for the rooms today. It’ll be our first project.” Her eyes traveled around the dingy kitchen. “How about yellow for the kitchen and warm beige for the living room?” “I like yellow.” Sarah was putting Pop Tarts in the toaster Teddy had plugged in. She watched them eat Pop Tarts, still feeling bad for not providing a more wholesome breakfast, and paid attention as they talked about the house, their rooms, what they wanted for lunch and supper. If they were going to like living in Summer Haven. If there’d be any cool kids in such a hick town. If there was a mall close by. For a few moments, bathed in the normalcy of her children’s lives she nearly forgot the abnormality of hers. “Don’t you want one?” Sarah offered her a warm Pop Tart wrapped in a napkin. “No thanks. I’m not hungry. I’ll have one later. Right now you two go get showers, get dressed and we’ll drive into town. We have a full day ahead of us.” “I’m first in the bathroom,” Sarah called. “You got it. There’re clean towels, wash cloths and soap in there for you.” “Thanks, Mom.” “Teddy you’re next.” “Only one bathroom in this place, jeez,” Teddy bemoaned. “How did you and Uncle Joey stand it?” “We had no choice. This is an old house built by your great grandfather, Jeremiah Lacey. Conveniences like more than one bathroom were luxuries in those days. Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it. We all will.” Their last house had had two full and one three-quarter bathrooms. One bathroom would take some getting used to. After breakfast they rushed off to do as she’d asked. They were good kids and rarely gave her trouble. Well, not real trouble anyway. Jeff had had a hand in that. He’d been a loving but firm father; he’d taught them to be independent and resourceful. And they’d both taught them right from wrong. Now what would she be able to teach them? Their journey into town and their visit to the Summer Haven Town Market was a trip down memory lane. Nothing had changed much. Oh, the market was modernized in many ways, rearranged and brightened up more than when she’d run around it as a child stealing pieces of chocolate from cellophane bags when no one was looking. Even now, after all these years, she felt bad about that. Stealing candy. She and Joey made their own spending money when they’d gotten older but when they’d been small and hungry there’d been times they’d snatched things to eat from stores. Stray pieces of fruit. Cupcakes. Candy. They’d both had a sweet tooth. Oh well, that was then and this was now. Her childhood was long behind her and her stealing phase was part of that. Over the years she’d made amends for those petty sins by being kind and giving to others. Lately, after all that had happened to her, she wondered if it’d been enough. She was being punished for something. When in the store she’d looked for Oscar but didn’t see him. At the checkout she’d asked and was told he worked the evening shift that day and wouldn’t be in until three. She’d have to catch him another time. Outside it was overcast, a solid murky sky, but she found she still needed a hat and sunglasses. Light hurt her eyes, though now she understood why. The outing went well. The grocery store had everything she needed and at fair prices. There was a modest hardware store down the road where she got the paint and supplies at sale prices and stayed within her budget. She made a brief stop at the library, and leaving the kids in the car so they wouldn’t see the books she was checking out, she walked in and on a temporary library card took out three scholarly looking books on vampires. She could Google the subject on the Internet but a creature of old habits she figured a hardcopy backup couldn’t hurt. Besides she didn’t have the Internet yet. Another thing to put on her list of to do’s. There was one last place to shop and she dreaded it. The Dollar General that stood where the Grand Theater once had; where she and Jeff had destroyed the vampire family who’d been culling the town’s people–and burned it to the ground. She parked in front of the dollar store as far away from Joey’s Diner as she could get, hoping he wouldn’t see her car. No such luck. Her hawk-eyed brother saw her and the kids through the diner’s window and waved. She motioned she was going next door and kept walking. “Can we go in for something to eat first before we go to the Dollar Store?” Sarah begged. “Since breakfast was so skimpy.” Her black sweatshirt brought out the gold in her brown eyes and blond hair. Jenny had braided it and the braid hung halfway down her daughter’s back. The girl had grown inches since spring. People thought she was at least ten years old because of how tall she was. “I second that.” Teddy was halfway to the diner. “I’m starving, too. That Pop Tart didn’t do the trick for me. I’m a growing boy.” “You know,” Sarah ended in a timorous voice, “Uncle Joey will give us free food.” Jenny felt a tug to her heart. Her children’s sensitivity to their financial situation was touching. For their sake she kept her tone light. “All righty, food first. We’ll go in and play the family card. Joey can’t resist starving people any way. He’ll feed us. Free we can afford.” And they did. Joey filled their bellies and their ears with town gossip as he filled her cup with coffee. “Police Chief Donald was in early this morning for breakfast. You remember Rusty Donald, don’t you? Little fat kid who used to invite us to his house to swim in his gigantic swimming pool and lorded it over us like a tyrant?” “I remember him. Vaguely.” Another rich kid from their poor youth. There’d been many. However, she remembered him differently than her brother. Rusty had been a little over bearing but she’d seen through his lack of self-confidence to the lonely child beneath. Joey had made fun of him but she’d liked him. They’d become friends, sort of, in her junior and senior year. They were both honor roll and loved to read. Unlike what Joey believed, Rusty had been highly intelligent, merely socially backward. Then. “He still as fat?” “Naw, he’s tall and slim now. A couple years ago he found out he had a minor heart problem and dropped about a hundred pounds. Though he was a pain in the butt as a kid he’s turned into a mighty fine law officer, educated, professional and thorough–and a good friend. “Anyway, Rusty told me Nellie and Sammy Jameson have up and gone missing. Their kids called up worried saying they had Sunday dinner with their folks every week at their house but when they went out there day before yesterday the old couple were nowhere to be seen. Not a trace. No dinner. Nothing. “No sign, in fact, they’d been there since the night before. Dirty plates were found in the sink from a late night snack and that was about it. And the car, their keys and cell phones, Nellie’s purse, were still there.” Jenny didn’t recall the Jamesons but the knowledge they were missing bothered her. Déjà vu. Missing people. That’s how the vampire trouble began all those years ago. “That’s mysterious. I don’t know them but I hope they find them soon.” “Me, too. The town is getting spooked, more so since Graham Lintoner, a night guard at the vacant stove factory, was attacked last night. The rumor is by some animal or something. He was bitten up pretty bad. He’s only alive because he was able to get to his gun, shoot, and hit, he says, whatever tackled him. It got away. But he’s in the hospital.” “That’s horrible.” Her thoughts weren’t on the wounded security guard, it was on what she feared might have done the wounding. Animal, her butt. Ha. Was it her? Did she steal out in the night and do these horrible things unaware she was doing them? Was she truly as in control as she believed or was she in reality a feral bloodsucker now, too? Was she fooling herself? For a second an image of a ghostly man hiding behind night trees flashed in her mind but when she attempted to capture it, it melted away, a snowflake in her fingers, leaving behind only a nagging guilt that somehow she was to blame. She couldn’t shake it. Sarah then toppled off one of the barstools she was spinning on and attending to her swept everything else from Jenny’s mind. A small bump and hurt pride was the result. Teddy teased his sister until she forgot about both of them as Laurie brought out ice for it. Afterwards Jenny hurried the kids through lunch. “We have a lot left to do today, rooms to paint and rugs to put down, and we should get going. So eat up kiddos. Chop, chop.” This time to avoid her brother’s prying she ate a part of her lunch but later, in the restroom threw it up. Her ploy worked. No one suspected what she’d done. The hunger had returned and was torturing her. Everywhere she looked she smelled and saw walking bags of blood. Her stomach began to ache. Her reason to skew. Every bone in her body began to melt, or at least it felt that way. In the Dollar General they quickly picked up the remainder of the items they needed. Jenny wasn’t sure how much longer she could last. The whole time she was jumpy knowing what had once stood there and had happened there when it’d been the movie theater. Terror and pain clung to the site in the form of misty phantoms. Remnants of the tormented humans that had been kept in basement cages and of the torture, psychological and physical, and the ultimate deaths of the vampires’ victims. They were beneath the bricks and wood of the new store. Screaming at her. And because of her condition she was more attuned to it than most people would have been. Well that and because she and Jeff had been responsible for the freeing of those souls. She couldn’t stand being there. She hurried her kids through the store and drove home as if something awful was following her. In a way it was. The past. Returning to Summer Haven had revived the memories time had diluted and hidden deep in her psyche. Now the ghosts were closer and their voices louder. For the first time she questioned if returning had been a smart move. Too late now, she thought, as she drove up to the farmhouse. For better or worse, this was where they were and this was where they had to stay. If there were…problems…she’d have to deal with them as best she could. It was her children she was anxious for. Because this time she had so much more to lose. As they entered the house the rain began, changing the afternoon into a premature evening. It sang through the air above them and left spots on the house’s old wooden siding. When the door closed, she could hear it slapping against the outside walls. For as long as she could recall rain had soothed her. The music, the fragrance of it, above all at night when it filled the world and made her feel snug behind the strong walls of home. Tonight the rain just made her restless. It was outside. Not locked in as she was. She had a longing to escape and race the raindrops, but she had things to do. She had children to take care of. There were endless chores. The basic pieces of furniture were in place but there was so much more to do. Painting came first. Of all the things that could instantly beautify a home, that was at the top of the list. They painted the living room first. Her plan was to do one room a day. It shouldn’t be hard. She’d been the resident painter in the family since she’d been a child. If something needed to be painted, she did it. It was one of the reasons she’d teamed up with her father years ago to paint houses. Painting, like writing, was in her blood. Sarah was like her. Good with the paintbrush. Neat. Precise. She loved to paint and draw, she was really good at it, and it didn’t matter how big the canvas was. Putting color on anything made her happy. She hummed a string of songs from the Twilight soundtrack as she worked. The girl wanted to become a singer or an artist one day. She had that creative soul. Poor thing. Teddy not so much. He picked up the roller and being nearly as tall as Jenny he was given the job of the higher places. He did it with a grimace on his lips and a grouchy look on his face, but he did it. She’d bribed him. His room would be painted next. He’d wanted an electric purple with neon orange stripes but she talked him into a medium blue splattered with white stars on the ceiling instead. “You like astronomy, so wouldn’t that be neat? A room of stars? I’ll cut out a star stencil and that’ll make it easy.” Anything would be better than a room striped like a toy racing car. Purple and orange, ugh. “I guess.” He mumbled something under his breath he thought she couldn’t hear but she did. “Yeah, I liked staring at the damn stars when I was like five. Jeez.” “Teddy!” she admonished. “Watch your language.” His stare tipped her off he couldn’t believe she’d heard what he’d said. He mouthed something else, no voice, just mouth, which she could still hear. She ignored it. Shaking her head, she kept pushing the brush around the trim on the door. Using all her self-control she kept the hunger at bay. Seven more hours. Six more. Five. She silently counted down the time before the children went to bed and she could venture out into the rainy night to find what she needed. What she had to have. “The room looks so good, Momma,” Sarah gushed after they’d finished the first coat. It was after seven and the wet afternoon had evolved into a wet evening. “It makes the room look brand new. I like it.” The girl was sitting on the couch, her legs motionless for once because she was worn out. There were paint splotches on her cheeks, hands and old clothes she’d put on when they’d returned from shopping. Teddy’s painting outfit had no splotches on them. Not a one. “Yeah, it looks good. Real good. I’m proud of us. “Now what’s for supper?” Supper. The thought of food made her want to gag. “I stuck frozen lasagna in the oven forty-five minutes ago. It’ll be ready to eat about the time you two are clean and changed.” She didn’t have to tell them twice. While they were washing up she made their salads and popped rolls in beside the lasagna. She was surprised the ancient stove still worked. The food was on the table by the time Sarah and Teddy wandered into the kitchen with droopy shoulders and sleepy eyes. The day had worn them out. They ate in weary silence, the rain as a backdrop. Jenny pushed her lasagna around on the plate but didn’t eat much. That happened when she was too tired. Usually before they’d go to bed they’d watch television or play on the computer (which hadn’t been set up and connected yet) but that night by the time their stomachs were full they kissed her goodnight and drug themselves to bed without a peep of dissent. Fine with her. She waited for fifteen minutes and tiptoed up to their rooms to check them. Both were sleeping. Good. She bolted into the evening drizzle. No raincoat. Nothing on her head. Just her in her old jeans and T-Shirt and the cool night. Her skin had changed. It was whiter. Firmer. The chilly wind and raindrops didn’t affect her. She wasn’t cold. She wasn’t anything. Earlier, while she’d been prying a lid off a paint can, she’d gouged her hand, but it hadn’t bled and the cut healed before her eyes. She hid it from the kids. She was learning that being different had beneficial side effects. Were they enough to outweigh the unpleasant realities of being what she’d become? She’d probably find that out sooner or later. By the time she’d gotten to the place where her trailer had once stood the light rain had changed into a downpour and lightning was slashing through the night behind the ebony silhouetted trees. Thunder boomed above her head. She didn’t care. She was one with the night and her new abilities alerted her nourishment was near. She could smell it. Hear it. As she stood there, the raindrops cascading off her face and down her body, she saw it. A deer was making its way painfully through the tangled underbrush. It was old and sick. She sensed soon it would die. She didn’t hesitate but came up behind the creature and took its life, drank its blood. She thought the bigger the animal she drank from the longer it’d stave off her hunger. It seemed to make sense. If she didn’t want to end up feeding on her children. She thought someone was following her long before they made their move. She wasn’t afraid. Her strength had grown and she no longer felt so vulnerable. Fast as the wind, she believed she could outrun them. Or hide from them by climbing a tree. A bolt of lightning hit the ground not far away, shuddering the earth and blinding her. When the earth stopped shaking and her eyesight returned she was looking into the face of a man. But a strange man. He was so tall, freakishly taller than her, dressed in somber clothes that merged into the blackness; with long silverish hair, a sharp predatory face and unsmiling lips. Then she remembered. The other night. The other man she’d seen from a distance. She wasn’t sure it was the same one but she believed he was. She could have run, but emboldened by her new strengths, she stood her ground. “Who are you and what do you want from me?” She glared at him through the heavy rain. He didn’t move. “I’m Zebulon. Servant to our leader. He’s sent me to fetch you.” The man had a heavy accent, yet she couldn’t place it. European perhaps. “Fetch me?” What was she, some prey to be bagged; a trophy to be gathered? His smile struck her as sinister. “No trophy, Jenny. One of us and we’ve come to collect you.” The fear was strong and bitter in her mouth. Heart stopping. My children. “What if I don’t want to come? I don’t know you or this…leader of yours.” Her voice cracked as she said the name. Her mind was seeking a way for her to escape, as she sensed great danger from this stranger. “You haven’t got a choice. He’s sent for you and you must come, leave this human world you know behind. Forever. You’re not one of them anymore. You know that. You’re one of us. Come. Now! Or you’ll make our leader angry and you wouldn’t want to see him angry, believe me.” The curve of his lips was another threat. He’d somehow drawn closer without her seeing it. No more than five feet away. His eyes glittered through the rainfall as a sky of lightning erupted behind him. He put his hand out and she was filled with the almost overpowering urge to give him hers. Go with him. Do anything and everything he asked of her. No! She rocked her head back and forth. She couldn’t leave her children. Joey. The farmhouse that was becoming her home. “I don’t know you and I sure as hell don’t know this leader of yours. Leave me alone. Tell him I’m sorry, I decline the offer.” She didn’t dare speak of her children alone in the farmhouse or even think of them. The man, or whatever he was, might be able to read her mind. She felt the stranger’s rage more than saw it and what came next happened so swiftly later she’d wonder if it had happened at all. He was on her, his arms, a vice, around her and all she could do was scream. Kick. Fight. She broke his hold and shoved away from him. She got away. As she fled through the rain she heard him behind her, bellowing, an angry devil deprived of his quarry, but he couldn’t catch her. She was too fast. Her feet flew over the wet ground as she wove through the trees. Please God, let her get home safely! Even before she finished the silent prayer she found herself, clothes dripping water in a puddle on the old linoleum floor, standing in her kitchen. Just like that. “Whoa,” she rasped, doubling over. “How did I get here so fast? I don’t remember getting here. Coming inside.” Trembling, she staggered to the window and, hiding against the wall, looked out; scared the man had pursued her home and was even now ready to break in the door to take her away. Or to hurt her children. But there was no one out there. The rain was a solid curtain of water, lightning ripped the sky and thunder shook the world, but she was safe. She didn’t know how she knew that but she did. He couldn’t follow her inside. Not into her home, unless she invited him in. Which she’d never do. Shivering, she slumped against the wall and lowered her wet face into her hands. If she’d been able, she would have cried. She couldn’t. She could only feel panic. She didn’t know who this Zebulon or his leader was, although she had her suspicions. Vampires. For some reason they wanted her. And she and her family were in danger. She checked on her children, relieved to see they were sleeping peacefully in their beds. Nothing had hurt them. No one had stolen them away. She kept an eye on the windows for a long time. Alert to every night sound and whisper. Only silence, except for the rain and wind. No one came. The rain slowed, the sky’s fireworks blustered away to annoy another town and when nothing else happened she switched on a nightlight in the bathroom and took a two-minute shower. As the night wore on she opened the library books, the ones on vampires, and began to pour through them at the kitchen table. Guarding her home and her children. Trying to find answers she was afraid she wasn’t going to find. Normal people didn’t believe in vampires and normal people wrote those books. By the time she was done she knew no more than she had when she’d begun. She probably knew more than the authors…because, unlike them, she knew vampires existed. They were real creatures. Use wooden stakes of Aspen to kill the things. Cut off their evil heads. Burn them to ashes. Bah! Nothing she didn’t already know. Nothing she thought would help her in her situation…because, deep inside, she feared they weren’t normal vampires. She didn’t know how she knew this, but she did. She suddenly had acquired an eleventh sense. A vampire sense. Most people didn’t know that humans actually had ten senses. She’d read that somewhere. That the sense of touch involved four different sets of nerves, the skin senses and were considered four separate ones. Heat. Cold. Pressure. Pain. Motion (kinesthetic sense). Balance (vestibular sense). So there were ten. But now she had eleven. She’d have to find help somewhere else. Where? From whom? She would have done anything to have been able to ask Jeff for help. He’d been good at solving mysteries, formulating a plan. Fixing the problem. He would have known what to do. Because she didn’t. When she had the Internet up and going she could look for answers there. In her bed, at first, she didn’t sleep. She was too afraid. Then finally oblivion came. Filling her stomach with blood, fleeing through the black woods, and waiting for the intruder to come, had exhausted her.",

      "content": "Chapter 6 Jenny The sun was out the next morning, yet an inexplicable feeling of dismay lingered though she couldn’t remember exactly why. Something frightening had happened to her in the woods the night before. But what? When she tried to remember she got nothing. Lost time. A blank. It was as if a chunk of her life had vanished from her mind. All she knew was she had to be careful. She had to be vigilant. There was something that wanted to hurt her and her family and she couldn’t let it. In the meantime, there was work to do, rooms to paint and a house beautification to accomplish. So she and the kids spent the day working on Teddy’s bedroom and the kitchen. The following days they finished the other rooms. Each night, with a sense of disquiet she couldn’t rationalize, as the children slept she’d wait until practically dawn before she’d venture out and hunt. Deep in the forest and nowhere near the meadow where her trailer had once sat among the weeds. The days passed. New powers, amazing speed, agility, endless vigor and self-healing, emerged. Her senses improved a hundred fold. She could see the bugs crawling up the trees in the dark. Hear faint noises or smell blood miles away. At times, a gift she couldn’t quite master but was learning to, she’d will herself instantly to another place. Once she ended up in the middle of town by the gazebo, laughed softly–good thing it was pre-dawn and no one was around to see her–and tried again. Three tries later she got home. In time she’d learn she couldn’t always wind travel, as she began to call it. Some days she couldn’t do it at all. The hunger drove her mad at times but if she fed most nights she found she could endure it. It became easier every day. And she kept busy. Denial became a part of her thought process. If she didn’t think about her being a vampire…then surely it didn’t exist. Right? The farmhouse flowered into life, like an old sick cat given love and care until it learned to trust and purr again. The more she did to it the more she wanted to do. The three of them were going to make it beautiful. Better than it’d ever been. Once the house had been sad, now it was happy. It’d never looked so good. Her heart swelled with pride with each room they finished. The place looked so different from the one they’d stepped into days before. The freshly colored walls and the nicer furniture and paintings they’d brought with them had transformed it. Joey, leaving Laurie in charge of the diner, stopped by most days to see their progress. Sometimes he lent a hand, though Laurie couldn’t handle the diner crowds by herself for long. Bad economy or not, their business was booming. Best thing was, whenever Joey dropped by he brought food, which saved her from cooking for the kids. It was nice to have him around again. Catered food didn’t hurt, either. “You know, Mom,” Teddy proclaimed at the end of the week, “this place is starting to look pretty good. For an old wreck of a house, that is.” “We have all of us to thank. You two are doing a fantastic job. I’m proud of you.” They were eating at the supper table. Or the kids were. Jenny told them she’d nibbled at the stove while she was cooking the meal. She watched them eat. There was still a lot to do but she was feeling energized. Another interesting side effect of her condition, as she was beginning to call it, she did like. The children asked to go to their rooms when the meal was over. The next day they were starting school. “Do we have to go to school tomorrow?” Teddy was nearly to the stairs; he turned to look at her, his face petulant. “We have more painting and other stuff to do.” “I can manage it from here, Son. There’s only a little left to do. And yes, you have to go to school. You’ve missed enough days. If you go now you won’t be too far behind the others in your class. I called the school this morning and enrolled both of you. It’s a small town so both the elementary and the junior high school are in the same building. Grades one through eight. So you’ll be together. “Your father and I went to that school, you know, though the principal said it’s been remodeled since. You’ll like it and you’re going to make loads of new friends.” “Do we ride the bus or are you driving us?” Teddy had halted midway up the steps. “The bus. It’ll come by in front of the house around 7:45 tomorrow morning. When you get to the school go by the main office and they’ll give you papers to bring home for me to sign. They’ll also help you get situated and direct you to your classrooms. “So pick out the clothes you’ll want to wear tomorrow. If you need them cleaned or pressed, give them to me before you go to bed, you two, deal?” Sarah stood before her, smiling. She loved school. “Deal.” She clapped her hands together. “I can’t wait. I’m going upstairs and find something cute to wear tomorrow.” Her face grew serious. “I miss my old friends so much. You think I’ll find new ones tomorrow?” “Of course you will.” Jenny took the girl into her arms and stroked her hair. She’d been trying not to behave differently towards them, but it was hard. Kids needed physical contact. “Give it a little time, honey. Nothing comes quick. Remember you might be new to Summer Haven but your family has lived here for a long time. You’re not actually an outsider. You’re going to have lots of friends, you’ll see.” “Oh, I hope so. I can’t wait!” “I’ll come up later and tuck you both in.” “Don’t worry about me,” Teddy said from the top of the stairs. “I’m too big for that nonsense. Besides I’ll be busy on the computer.” They’d connected it the night before with Joey’s help. Teddy was content. “So I’ll say goodnight now. Goodnight.” She almost argued with him but stopped, remembering herself at that age. How independent she’d been. Craving her solitude. Teddy was growing up and she had to let him. Respect his growing independence. So she said nothing. She’d look in and steal a kiss when he was sleeping. Jenny watched Sarah skip up the steps to watch television in her room. Then she cleared away and washed the supper dishes. She was going to paint the bathroom but decided to do it the next day. There were other things she needed to do. She settled in a corner of the living room, keyed up her laptop and tapped in the words she knew would direct her to the right websites. Everything she ever wanted to know about vampires. Two hours later, glancing at the clock she’d hung between paintings of autumn woods, she turned the computer off, disappointed. Again myths and speculation was all she’d found. The only people that admitted to believing in vampires sounded like they were crazy. She’d found nothing that could help her. Upstairs she embraced and kissed Sarah goodnight then snuggled the cover up around her once she got in bed. “You okay for clothes tomorrow?” “Uh huh, I’m wearing the sunflower dress daddy bought me for my last birthday. It’s clean and everything. See, it’s right there in my closet.” Jenny looked. It was a light cotton material and had short sleeves. “Kind of cool for the weather we’re having, isn’t it?” “Nah. I’ll wear my brown sweater with it. That’ll keep me warm enough.” “Okay. The sunflower dress it is. Now get some sleep.” After turning on the nightlight her daughter insisted on having beside her bed, she snapped off the lamp and left the room. Just as she thought, Teddy was sleeping. She tiptoed into his room and laid a kiss on his forehead. Gazing down at her son in the dark she felt the greatest wave of sorrow she’d experienced so far. Was she a fool for thinking she could continue her life as if nothing (other than having to wring poor animal’s necks and drain their blood for food) had changed? A fool for staying with Teddy and Sarah? Every day her doubts tore her apart. She’d begun to think ahead, far ahead–what would she do when her children grew up, grew older, and she never aged? How would she hide that? Not a clue. It was too odd a notion to dwell on for too long. Not when she had other immediate concerns. She was having more blackouts during her night hunts. Some of them lasted a few minutes, some longer. She’d return from her forays and, by the clock, more time had passed than she’d thought. Last night she’d lost track of three hours. Totally lost them. She was changing even more. She could feel it in her bones, her flesh, and her very thoughts. What happened if she mutated into something alien? Something she couldn’t control? What happened if she truly became a danger to her children? She had to find out more about her condition. Get help. From somewhere or someone. She was at the computer twenty minutes later when she heard a knock at the front door. Nine-thirty. Not too late. It was probably Joey. She opened it. “Andy?” She was surprised to see Joey’s friend standing on the other side of the screen door. “What are you doing out this late on a work night?” Her smile covered her annoyance. She’d been about to go out. The night was clear, the air crisp and the moon full. A perfect night to hunt. Except now she had company. “I hate to bother you but I was driving by and spied the lights still on. I had to talk to someone and for some reason you came to mind. If it’s too late or a bad time,” he said softly, eyes down, “I’ll leave you alone.” It was the disheartened tone of his voice that let her know something was wrong and her natural empathy kicked in. “No, no. It’s not too late. Come on in.” He came inside and with trudging steps followed her to the sofa. “The kids are in bed, I take it?” “Yep. They go back to school tomorrow. New town. New school. It won’t be easy so a good night’s sleep was in order. Sit down, Andy.” He sat down. “Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?” “Now that sounds perfect. I’d appreciate that after the day I’ve had.” When she went to start the pot he surprised her again, got up and followed her. “The house looks great.” His eyes took in his kitchen surroundings. “I can’t believe you’ve done so much to it in such a short time. It’s so homey and all.” “Thanks. We were motivated.” She flashed him a smile as he lowered himself onto a chair. “There’s a lot left to do, painting, minor repairs, but we’re working on it.” As the coffee perked she sat across from him. She’d only seen him twice since she’d moved home but tonight he looked dreadful. His hair was uncombed and his eyes were shaded with what she thought was stunned disbelief. “Okay,” she murmured gently. “It’s all over your face. What’s wrong?” “It’s been a terrible day.” His eyes met hers. His expression was troubled. He stopped talking. “And?” “First thing this morning, like most mornings before work, I go to your brother’s diner for breakfast and Police Chief Donald, who’s also there for breakfast, tells me Graham Lintoner, the night guard who was wounded last weekend at the factory didn’t make it.” “Didn’t make it?” “He died.” His sigh was heavy. “Or was found dead at his house. They’d released him from the hospital yesterday, his condition satisfactory, and last night someone broke in and–oh, God, this is so horrendous–cut his head off.” She was too shocked to say anything. “That wasn’t all the good Police Chief had to say. Seems they located Nellie and Sammy Jameson. You know the couple that’s been missing the last few days?” Oh, no. She didn’t want to hear what he was about to say, afraid of what was coming. Still she nodded. “Well, they found their bodies out in the woods. In fact, not far from here.” He stared out the window behind her. “Both dead. The Chief wouldn’t tell me how they died but I could see the worry in him. He said they’d been dead for days. Murdered.” “Oh, that’s terrible. I mean I don’t know any of these people but since they’re neighbors, so to speak, I feel bad about what’s happened to them.” “I knew all three. Not real well but well enough to feel a loss. And it hit me hard. All dead. I couldn’t believe it. So my day was already tainted. Then I went to work.” Ah, ha. Here it was. “Walked in, and first thing, my supervisor comes into my office and lowers the boom. He has to lay off three people. And I’m one of them. Said he was so sorry but the bank was in financial trouble with the sick economy and the people around here forfeiting on their loans, and he had no choice.” Andy’s distress was painful to see. “I’ve seen people lose their jobs but I never thought it’d happen to me. I’ve worked at the bank over twenty years. Been a dependable innovative employee. Worked hard. Worse thing was I didn’t see it coming. Not at all. Heck, I recently bought bedroom furniture and a new car.” He massaged his fingers along the side of his head. A tiny groan escaped. “I was such a fool not to see the writing on the wall. There’d been rumors going around the office for months about some of our jobs being gone. I didn’t pick up on any of it. So positive that, sure, half the town, half the country were losing their jobs, but mine was safe. They needed me. Stupid me.” She almost reached out to touch him, but remembering how cold her skin was and how his flesh would affect her, she didn’t. Instead she said, “I’m so sorry, Andy. I kind of know how you feel. Not exactly. I haven’t lost a job I’d been at for two decades. I’m so sorry for you. But I don’t have a job, either. We’ll look for new jobs together.” He smiled for the first time since he’d arrived. “We’re in the same boat. Does it always feel this bad?” “It gets better, you’ll see. What you have to do is keep in mind this happens all the time to people. Leave one job, find another. That’s life. Think of it this way. You were way overdue, that’s all.” “Jenny, why would you want a regular job anyway? You’re a published author. A good one. I’d think publishers would be breaking down your door for your next novel.” Her laughter must have sounded sarcastic. “That would be if there was a next novel. I haven’t been writing the last few years. Life, my family’s needs, got in the way. Don’t get me wrong, I loved being a full time mom and helping my husband with his business but my writing has suffered. Besides, the sales of my last book didn’t do that well so I imagine I’d have a tough time selling any new ones. The publishing world has changed. The bad economy has hit it, too. Oh, and e-books and self-publishing are taking over the world.” “Then write e-books. Self-publish them. Heck,” he looked embarrassed, “I fought it at first but in the end even I broke down and bought a Kindle. It’s great. I can make the type as large as I want and it holds hundreds of books. No more lugging a pile of novels around. I take it everywhere. It’s great. I buy self-published books all the time.” “I’ve heard the new Kindle’s great, too.” Jeff had been going to give me one for my birthday but he hadn’t made it to August. So no Kindle. She got Andy a cup of coffee. One for herself, though she barely touched it. And for a time they sat and talked about other things. How the town had changed since she’d been away; how life and the world had changed. Current events. The topics always came back to the murders and his last day at his job. It’d hurt him the way his supervisor had him watched like a thief as he’d packed up his personal things and then had him escorted out of the building to his new Ford Mustang. “I didn’t even get a going away party. After all I’ve done for them. The years I gave.” He shook his head. “Well, here’s your party. I have some left over pie in the fridge Joey sent over yesterday. Apple. You want a piece? Got Cool Whip, too.” He smiled. “Sure. To both. Thank you. Come to think of it, I never ate supper. Too upset. I’ve been driving around all day since I got the boot. Yep, come to think of it, I am hungry.” So was she. But she’d have to wait for her food. “I’ll give you an extra big piece and an extra scoop of topping.” He stayed a little longer. He was easy to be with; easy to talk to. She just didn’t get too near. About the time she caught herself staring longingly at his throat and wondering if it would hurt if she just took a little of his blood, she sent him home. He seemed in a better frame of mind, not as desperate and lost, than when he’d first arrived. As he left in his car she could barely keep from dashing outside and into the night, her hunger demanding to be fed. She waited ten minutes, looked in on her sleeping children one last time; locked up the house, then faded into the moonlight bathed woods. She raced through the trees trying to escape the nagging fear that had taken root when Andy told her about the dead bodies. Did she kill that guard last night…did she murder those two elderly people during one of her blackouts in the woods…and then forgot she had? Has she become the monster she feared she would become? She jogged faster and deeper into the woods, far away from her house and Summer Haven. She was careful, kept her ears and eyes open, caught her supper swiftly, drank it, and scurried home, where she dropped into bed and tried to sleep, tried to be normal as she’d once been. Her rat-in-a-maze thinking wouldn’t let her. She needed help and the only person she could trust with her secret, who’d believe her and not want to kill her, was Joey. But she was afraid of telling him, what with his history of vampires having nearly killed him and having killed their father and mother, but she had to. There was no other choice. Her secret was too much for her to deal with alone. If she were responsible for the murders, if she really had gone rogue, someone would have to protect her children and the community from her. Joey was the one. Tomorrow she’d speak to him. Confess she was a vampire and needed his help. His life was about to change. Like hers had. And it’d never be the same. Poor Joey.",

      "content": "Chapter 7 Jenny Teddy and Sarah had no trouble catching the school bus when it lurched to a stop at the end of the driveway. Vacation had lasted long enough and they were ready to resume their children’s lives. They missed their old friends, their routines, and were looking forward to forming new ones. Hiding in the shadows behind the door, she watched them skip down the driveway and climb onto the bus. Sarah had decided against the sunflower dress in favor of a dark purple one with black leggings. A black and purple bracelet. The Twilight influence again. All those dark colors. For Jenny, the girl couldn’t grow out of it too soon. Before he got on the bus, Teddy pivoted and glanced at the house. The look on his face apprehensive. With her new eyes she could see his expression clear as day. He was worried about her. The strange way she’d been acting. Her appearance. Perhaps he’d woke up and found her gone at night. Something about the way he looked at her in the morning. He’s hesitant to ask what’s wrong. Does he wonder what she does outside alone in the woods. He’s afraid of her. Oh, no. After the bus drove off she closed the door and telephoned Joey. “Hi Joey. How’s it going?” “Same old same old, you know. Business is steady. Meatloaf special today and we’re finishing up the breakfast crowd so we can start cooking tons of modified hamburger. “Laurie’s changed her hair color again. Next time you see her she’ll be a flaming redhead. It looks ridiculous, her head’s on fire, but please don’t tell her that. Pretend it looks just beautiful.” “I’ll do that.” In the background she could hear the light banter of customers and the clatter of silverware. Laurie yelling an order in. Scrambled eggs and toast. “What can I do for you? Cause you never call this early unless you want something.” There was good-natured humor in his voice. Basically Joey was a happy person. Or he was now. After she told him what she was going to tell him. Not so much. “Can you come over? Right now? There’s something really important I need to discuss with you.” “Right now…at eight o’clock in the morning…before our breakfast rush is over?” “Yes, please.” “Whoa, this must be important.” “Oh, it is. You have no idea. Please?” “I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Fire up the coffee and I’ll bring donuts.” “None for me, Brother. Just for you,” she imparted sadly. “Hurry.” She hung up, got out of her robe and dressed. She was feeling even stranger than usual. Frighteningly detached. Increasingly restless. The lure of fresh blood, the hunt, was so strong; the urge to start running and never stop beat at her until she thought she’d go crazy. To be free of all human ties and restrictions. Feed. Be free. Feed. Free. The only thing that kept her there was Teddy and Sarah. Joey. Fear of the unknown. What her life might now become. Otherwise, she’d be gone. She had the oddest thought. When she’d been a child she’d seen this old science fiction movie about this man who’d been affected by radiation or something and then began to shrink. He got smaller and smaller and smaller. He lost his wife, his family, his career and finally his very way of life. It was as if he ceased to exist as a man. In the end he was so tiny, miniscule really, that he had no idea what his future, his life, would become. She felt like that microscopic man…on the threshold of a new world. She didn’t know if she should be terrified, resigned or awed. *** An hour later, at the kitchen table with shadows crowding around them (all the curtains were tightly closed), Joey stared at her, his face tinged with horrified pity as he tried to hide another emotion. Fear. The bag of donuts untouched. She’d confessed everything. What she believed had happened during the attack in St. Louis. Her discovery of what she was becoming, her growing strength and powers; her night hunts for animals to feed on. Her blackouts. Most of her fears. “Oh, my God, Jenny.” At first he’d recoiled, shifting his body away as if she’d had the plague. Slowly, as they talked, he stopped moving away. When she reached out her hand, her eyes pleading for understanding and comfort, he took it. “That explains the absence of an appetite, I guess. Your moodiness. Paleness. Aversion to the sun. Oh, my God.” “You saw all that?” “Of course, I did. You never wore hats or sunglasses much before. In the beginning I thought you were hiding tear-swollen eyes. Hiding the grief over losing Jeff. Aftereffects of your trauma and coma. I did wonder, though. You haven’t really been yourself lately. Not since the–” “Attack? Jeff’s death? The coma?” “Yeah. All of those.” There was a hesitation she caught in his reply. She could smell the fear on him. “I won’t hurt you, Joey,” she spoke in a whisper, her gaze on his face. “I love you. It seems to make the difference. I can control it so far. Or I think I can. That’s the problem. I’m changing rapidly now and I’m scared. I have these,” her voice trailed off, “blackouts.” He was thoughtful for a minute and finally said, “We’ll find a way to beat it. I swear. We’ll find a cure. Or something. “But right now I need time to wrap my head around this. Some time to think.” He squeezed her hand, reassuringly. “I don’t believe this has happened. Not to you. Of all the people in the world, after all you’ve been through,” he shook his head, “not to you.” “Join the club. I can’t believe it either. Ironic, huh? Long ago I hunted and killed vampires and now I am one. Ha, ha. Every day I open my eyes and think it’s been a really bad dream. I wake up all the way and–whoops–it isn’t a nightmare at all. It’s my life.” “God’s got a mean sense of humor.” “God had nothing to do with this.” She couldn’t help it, her bitterness oozed through. “I’m so sorry.” He released her hand and rubbed his eyes. All the happiness she’d seen in him the last week had evaporated. His shoulders slumped. His eyes looked so sad. “I was scared you wouldn’t understand. You wouldn’t accept me after what’s happened. What I’ve become. I’m so relieved.” “That I don’t want to ostracize you or put a stake through your bloodsucking heart? That I still love you as a brother should and that I’m going to help?” “Yes.” “What else would I do? You’re my sister. You and the kids are all I have left of my family. I wouldn’t let you or them down. No way. I’m in for the long haul. I love you.” “Thank you, Joey.” She would have hugged him but was afraid to. He seemed edgy. “I love you, too.” “Is there anything I can do now? Anything at all?” She’d thought long and hard about that before she’d called him. “No. Be there for me. Keep loving me and the kids. Help me fight this scourge or learn to live with it. Keep an eye on me. In case. You know.” She tensed up. “Be ready to take the children if things go really wrong.” “Take the children?” She refilled his coffee cup. Outside birds were singing and a parade of dried leaves flew by the window. The seasons and the world went on as they always had. Uncaring about humans and their trivial affairs. Their sorrows or tribulations. “You know, take them to live with you and Laurie if I can’t beat this thing.” He was shaking his head, then got it. “Oh, if you have to go away or if…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. They looked at each other. If she could have cried, she would have. “It won’t come to that. I know it,” he insisted. “We’ll find a way out of this, I promise. We’ll research. Dig. There’s got to be something or someone that can help you. We’ll find an expert who’ll know how to deal with these things.” “Yeah, sure, we’ll find a witch or something,” she said mockingly, “who can change me back into a human or send me backward in time so I can keep it from happening. Fat chance.” “Aah, I don’t think that’s possible.” Joey had no sense of humor. She forced a smile out of her lips. “A long shot, I know.” “Except for disliking the sun, your white skin–and plenty of people have pale skin–you don’t seem too different, Sis.” “You should see me killing and sucking the blood out of the wild animals I catch.” “You have fangs and everything?” “They’re growing. Only come out when I feed.” He blinked. “Your eyes are different.” “I know. They glitter.” “Not a lot. Just don’t look directly at people for too long.” “I’ll try not to. It’s kinda hard if you don’t look at people when they’re speaking to you. Makes them think you aren’t paying attention, you’re rude or you’re hiding something.” “There’s that, you’re right. Sunglasses?” “Outside, perhaps. Inside it’s the other side of eccentric.” He laughed meekly and came to his feet. “I have to get back to the diner for the lunch rush. Is there anything I can do for you now?” “No. I had to tell you, that’s all. You needed to know. I needed help. Support. Thank you for coming.” “I’ll phone you later. In the meantime, I’ll try to come up with some ideas. I’ll put my thinking cap on.” They smiled together at the reference to an old television show they used to watch as kids. “All right,” she said. “I’ve already spent hours reading dusty books and scouring the Internet for anything that might help, but so far zippo. Apparently vampires only exist in fiction novels, movies and in Stephanie Meyer’s vivid imagination.” “Wouldn’t she be surprised?” “No doubt.” He threw his arms around her and gave her a big hug before he left. She knew he was afraid of her, but he did it anyway. He loved her that much. Feeling better now that someone knew her secret, was on her side, her fingers motioned goodbye as he drove away. She wasn’t alone any longer. Still the doubts snuck back in. What was he thinking now? That the attack and the coma had addled her brain, made her delusional, or that, wow, did they have a huge problem on their backs? She could have showed him her fangs, but she hadn’t learned how to make them appear without biting into something. Anyway, that would have scared him even more. He hadn’t asked about the three dead people and she hadn’t brought it up. Hadn’t he made the connection or had he been too freaked out to broach the subject under the circumstances? Probably the latter. If she’d been in his shoes she would have been freaked out, too. After all, he’d seen firsthand, as she had, what vampires were capable of. Endless carnage and heartless bloodshed. Insidious powers a normal gun or knife couldn’t fight. The rest of the day she painted walls, baseboards, and drove herself nuts going over everything again and again. She didn’t know what the hell to do. Please, let Joey think of something. The ringing of the telephone interrupted and, laying down the paintbrush, she answered it. It was the school. Contrary to what she’d been told a few days earlier when she’d called them they did need her to show up in person to sign the kids’ enrollment papers. They asked her to come in, sooner the better. Today would be better. She didn’t want to go into town and mingle with people but didn’t see a way out of it. So she cleaned up, grabbed her hat and sunglasses, and drove into Summer Haven. It was a bright sunny day so she wore long sleeves and blue jeans. Parking the car beneath lofty shade trees, she rushed into the building. She’d never get used to avoiding the sun, which she loved. And beaches. Water. What would she do if she got to the point where she couldn’t tolerate the sunlight at all? Don’t think about that. Not now. The school, a brick oblong with rolls of identical windows, was the same building she’d gone to years before but it’d been remodeled, modernized, and was as good as new inside. It felt strange entering the doors. She was relieved that no invisible wall stopped her. She walked right in. Must be because it was a public building. She signed what she had to sign in a cubby hole of an office, quickly snooped around, liked what she saw (everything spic and span and friendly faces) and scooted out of there. The library. She decided to see if there were any more books she could check out about vampires. Her last visit had been so rushed. What she hadn’t found on the Internet might be inside a dusty old tome high on a shelf somewhere. Not everything written about vampires had to be romances. Somewhere, sometime, someone must have written something she could use to fight what was happening to her. Something real. So it was worth at least another look. Vampires did exist so it stood to reason others had discovered that truth as well and lived to tell or write about it. Well, she could hope, couldn’t she? The library was cool and dim. Taking off her hat, she left the sunglasses on. She located a handful of hardbacks seeming more serious than the fluff she’d taken out before or had read about on the Web and checked them out on her shiny new library card, which had been waiting at the front desk for her. One of the books was tattered; its pages brown-edged with age, and had been written by some hoity-toity professor from Harvard. The cover wasn’t sensational, no lurid pictures of blood-dripping and fanged monsters, but simply silver embossed words on black: Vampires. They Exist. Hmm, there might be something in it she could use. Jenny thought she recognized the older lady taking care of her as someone who’d worked there when she’d been a kid–or looked like that other woman anyway. Tall, skinny, with ash gray hair in a bun, gold rimmed glasses; dowdy dress that could have been in style in the nineteen sixties. Tight smile. She hadn’t been in the library her last visit. The woman gave her a funny look when she saw the titles. “I’m a writer,” Jenny explained. “I write about vampires, ghosts and such.” She lightly tapped the books stacked before her. “This is research.” And, in a way, it was. “Oh, I know who you are. Jenny Lacy.” “Jenny Sanders now.” “Yes, Sanders. You married Jeff Sanders, a local boy…and I’m so sorry to hear of his death.” Jenny barely blinked, inclining her head in assent. “Don’t remember me, huh? I’ve known you since you were a tot. Knew your mom and dad, too.” The woman’s eyes were gentle but knowing. “I’m Mrs. Willard? You used to come in here every Saturday for your books. I never saw a child love to read as much as you did. I wasn’t surprised at all when you became a writer. And I’ve read some of your novels. You’re not much on reality but what a storyteller.” “Oh. Thank you.” Self-conscious for a moment. It’d been a long time since someone had recognized her as an author. “I’m sorry I don’t remember you but I’ve never been good with faces. Or names. My husband used to say it was because I’m always making up names and descriptions for my fictitious characters so my mind gets confused and forgets the real ones.” “That’s all right. I have a forgettable face. But that’s as imaginative an excuse as I’ve ever heard.” The woman’s quick smile told Jenny she was forgiven for not recognizing her. “I heard you and your two children had moved back here.” Small towns. Nothing stayed a secret. “We’re living in my mom and dad’s farmhouse out on Suncrest Road. Fixing it up. It needs it.” “Hmm.” The look on the librarian’s face became guarded. “Hmm what?” “Well, I’m not one to spread unfounded gossip but since you’re living there now and you’re a writer you might be interested. Rumor is your farmhouse is haunted.” “Haunted?” A shiver rippled across the skin of her neck. “With…?” “Ghosts. So they say.” Weren’t vampires enough? Now there were translucent dead, too? Oh, great. “Who says?” “Well.” The woman, eyes shifting to a person browsing through the aisle to her left then to man clicking away on one of the library’s new computers in the corner acted as if she didn’t want to tell her, and it disturbed Jenny. “Well?” The woman cleared her throat softly. “Townsfolk say they’ve heard crying from the empty farmhouse during the day. Voices. Creepy noises. They’ve driven or walked by at night and seen strange lights moving around in the windows. There have been lots of such stories. For years.” Joey had the electricity turned on only last week. What was the woman talking about? Jenny didn’t move. Standing there, she’d scooped up her books and cradled them in her arms. An eerie feeling came over her. “That was probably my brother Joey stumbling around in the house with a flashlight.” “At two o’clock in the morning?” “Joey has weird working hours at his diner. And he’s a night person.” The woman gave her a cynical look. “Some people have heard horses neighing behind your house, as well, and there aren’t any horses out that way. Not anymore, anyway.” Jenny shrugged. “It was an old abandoned house. People sometimes think they’re haunted.” “Not all houses have that place’s history, though. Your mother and father?” Jenny knew what she meant. To the townspeople, person or persons unknown murdered her parents. But no one now but Joey and she knew the murders, all the murders which had taken place that long ago summer, had been done by vampires. Officially they remained unsolved. Deadly mysteries. No wonder people believed the Lacy farmhouse was haunted. “Well, I’ve been living there for a few days and haven’t heard or seen a thing. No lights. No ghosts of my dead parents hovering around. So there. Nothing strange going on at all.” Except she was a vampire, haunted the woods and fields at night herself snuffing out tiny animals for their life’s blood, and she lived in the house. But that was another story altogether. “Anyway, I’ll divulge a secret. Ghosts don’t exist.” With what she hoped was a whimsical shrug she asked, “Do you believe in them?” Mrs. Willard smiled. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” Jenny stared at her. Odd answer. “Only if you want me to know.” “A discussion for another time. Right now I have work to do.” The woman turned to the computer and started keying something in. “I’m sure I’ll see you again. You being a writer, loving books and all.” Her gentle laughter was good-natured. Then Jenny remembered Mrs. Willard. A lot of people had thought she was a little more than eccentric. She lived by herself in a rambling Victorian behemoth on the edge of town. She’d never remarried after her husband had died when she was in her twenties. Her life, her world, had been, and apparently still was, the library. Classic librarian. From the old school. These days Jenny was used to seeing young people scurrying around and working in a library. Out with the old, in with the young. Wasn’t that the way of the world. “Okay then. See you soon.” Hugging the books closely, Jenny exited the building. The day had grown overcast while she’d been inside. The clouds scudded across the slate sky and created puddles of shadows. The world had melted into an early dusk. Jenny breathed a sigh of relief because in the last week the sun had become her enemy. She couldn’t stop mulling over what Mrs. Willard had said about ghosts in the farmhouse. What if it weren’t ghosts at all? What if it was? Who were they and what did they want? Oh, please. Didn’t she have enough problems? There was sudden movement in the corner of her eye. Quick as she twisted her head, sharp as her sight had become, she barely caught the silhouetted figure before it merged into the grove of trees behind the library. Someone was stalking her. It wasn’t the first time she’d seen a figure or felt watched. So many times, out in the night woods, she could have sworn someone or something was tracking her. If only she could remember. But it was creeping her out and damned if she was going to put up with it any longer. Tossing the books and her purse in the car, she chased after the intruder. She didn’t catch him. He evaporated into the forest like a mist. After running around in circles for way too long, she returned to the car and headed to the farmhouse. Wondering what that had been about. At home she kept busy as her mind plagued her with what she was going to do about her vampirism and how her brother was handling it. She kept expecting him to call or drop by. Knowing him, what she’d confessed that morning would sooner or later come to a boil and he’d be on her doorstep with more questions and fears. She was right. Later that night after the children were in bed, after she’d taken her run out in the woods and the diner had been closed a half-hour, he rapped on her door. He was mutely red-eyed and she knew he was upset. The reality of what had befallen her–them–had hit home. “I had to see you, Jenny. We need to talk.” “I know.” She let him in and they went into the kitchen. They sat down. The house was silent. The night, for once, was, too. She’d fed and it’d filled her belly and calmed her nerves. “You know about the recent murders around town, don’t you?” Her hands were folded before her on the table, her eyes on her brother’s frightened face. “I knew about them this morning, too. I just….” She inhaled slowly, a wretchedness she was beginning to know all too well revisiting. “Hadn’t made the connection yet. Afraid to ask me about them, right?” “Right.” “But you have anyway.” She leveled her eyes at him. “It wasn’t me, Joey. I’ve thought and thought about it and I’m pretty sure it wasn’t me. I didn’t kill those people.” “Pretty sure? You said you’ve had blackouts.” “I have. But I don’t think I’ve been out killing people. I’d feel it here if I had.” She laid a hand over her heart. “And there’s something else. Someone’s stalking me. I’ve suspected it, sort of, for days but this morning I saw him outside the library. He was inhumanly tall. He moved like some horror movie apparition with lightning speed. I lost him in that patch of woods behind the building.” “Could be he’s who the cops are looking for.” His voice was hopeful, latching on to any other possibility for the slayings other than his sister was a cold-blood murderess. “Could be. Isn’t it conveniently coincidental that someone is following me, with what’s happened and all, skulking around town, and people are ending up dead?” “Or not,” Joey countered. “Or not.” She cocked her head, listening to the night beyond the walls. Something or someone was moving out there somewhere. Suddenly her body was on alert. Danger. Danger. “You’re scared of me, aren’t you?” She posed the question she’d been dreading. He took too long to answer. “No. You’re my sister. I know you wouldn’t hurt me.” “Scared, tell me the truth now,” she smiled sadly, “a little?” “A little.” He spread two of his fingers about an inch apart. She got up, walked to the window and stared out. “Don’t be. I might be one of them,” she couldn’t say the word, “but I’m still me, too. Like I said I love you. You’ll always be safe from me. One way or another. “Is that what you were worried about? Why you came over?” Outside there were shadows shape shifting among the stark trees and a low hissing as if someone were angrily whispering far away. She tried to make sense of the black noise, form it into words, something she could understand. But couldn’t. “I agonized all day over what you told me this morning and I had to see how you were doing. If I’d heard what I thought I’d heard. You’re a…vampire.” She laughed humorlessly. “Oh, you heard right.” “And to tell you a Detective Ben Bradley from St. Louis telephoned me today. Asked a mess of questions about you. He wanted your new cell, home phone number and address.” “You gave it to him?” “What do you think? Not to would have raised suspicion. He’ll probably phone you.” “He probably will.” She hazily recalled the detective as a polite man with melancholy eyes who’d visited in the hospital and wanted her to remember more of what had happened the night of the attack. It seemed so long ago. Coma-stunned and still reeling from her ordeal, she hadn’t been able to dredge up much of anything. Not then anyway. “Do you think he knows about the disappearances and new murders here?” Joey gave her something else to fret about. “Police communicate by computers now and talk among themselves. Compare assault and murder statistics. Look for threads.” Oh boy. “I don’t know, even if he’s aware of the murders why would he want to talk to me?” “Just a thought,” Joey said. “Nah, he probably wants to ask me more questions about the attack. Follow up, that’s all.” Or so she hoped, but she had a bad feeling. What if the detective did know about the recent murders and had made the link to the St. Louis attack and somehow to her? Not likely. How could he? There were still too many missing pieces–or were there? “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be cool when I talk to him. Pretend I haven’t remembered anything else.” That was easy to do on the telephone. Long distance. She was getting good at hiding her true emotions. With his confusion and concern, her brother looked older. Or perhaps it was her acute eyesight. “Then I won’t worry about it. I just thought I’d give you a heads up.” “Thanks.” “But I am really bothered about what’s happening here. The murders. What do you think is going on? Who could be doing them?” “I wish I knew.” She had a theory but it was too scary to dwell on for long. “Me, too. The town is spooked. People are staying inside because they’re scared, especially at night. Boy, does this feel familiar.” A faint sneer formed on his lips. He didn’t have to say the words: It’s just like twelve years ago but she heard them in her head anyway. “Yep, Déjà vu. Be careful out there, Joey. I mean it. Something’s not right.” “You’re telling me?” He tugged at his ear and let out a breath. “Enough bad news, I got to get home. Laurie’s waiting up for me.” He slowly rose to his feet. At the door he stopped. “Andy was in tonight. It’s dreadful about him losing his job.” “I know. He came by and told me about it.” “Hmmm. Interesting. He came by here? When?” “The day he lost his job. He said he needed someone to talk to.” “You know he’s always had a crush on you.” “On me?” “When we were kids he always asked about you. Almost asked you out for a date once.” “You’re kidding? I never knew that. Why didn’t he?” “You began dating Jeff and married him if I recollect correctly. When your first book came out Andy bought it and had me send it to you to autograph. And every book you wrote after it. I guess you don’t remember that, huh?” “Sorry. No. It was a lifetime ago it seems like when I was an author.” She changed the subject. “Speaking of Andy, how’s he doing?” “After losing his job and it had time to sink in? Devastated. I’ve never seen him so depressed. That guy loved his job. Loved that bank. A proud man, it defined him. I don’t know what he’s going to do. There’re no jobs around here. None that would suit him. His family trust fund dried up years ago so now he’s like the rest of us. Scrambling to make a living. “I’m so sick of this recession. More like a depression,” he groused. “One night I saw a man rummaging through our dumpster. The dumpster. Where is it going to end?” “I don’t know.” She wouldn’t meet his eyes, shifted from foot to foot, her hand on the door. She had to find a job. She’d lost her home, too. And until her house sold in Millstadt she was basically broke. Jeff’s small life insurance payout was about gone and her bank balance was low. “Oh, I’m sorry, Sis. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. You’re going to find a job. I know it. There’s one out there somewhere for a woman as smart as you.” How about one for a vampire? Not likely. “Yeah, sure. How about a night job? Guarding a blood bank in some hospital? A very big hospital.” So a couple of missing bags of blood a night wouldn’t tip them off. “Out of town, of course.” Her brother actually forced out a laugh. He still regarded her with wary eyes. It broke her heart. He was scared of her and what she’d become. Could be he’d never get over it. “Before I go,” he murmured, “how are you doing?” He reached out and when his flesh touched hers she saw the sorrow in his eyes. Her skin was as cold as snow-covered stone. “Coping. Barely. So far I’ve resisted the urge to suck a human dry or knock my brains out. I get my nourishment from running down terrified animals like a wild beast and sinking my fangs into them. As I learn to control my hunger, I’m trying not to kill them, just drink enough to sustain me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. “But, oh Joey,” her disgust must have shown in her expression, “What’ll I do if I go bonkers and start randomly killing people like those other vampires we destroyed years ago? I’m only still here because of you and the kids. I love you too much to leave. Otherwise I’d be gone or I’d kill myself.” “God, Jenny, don’t do that!” he cried. “I couldn’t bear it. Have patience. Hang on. We’ll figure something out, I swear.” “Joey, why did this have to happen to me? What have I done so wrong that I deserve it? Weren’t the attack and my coma, Jeff’s death enough? Haven’t I suffered enough?” She felt like ranting at the sky and did every night, deep in the woods where no one would hear. “It’ll be okay, Sis.” She could hear the desperation in his voice. “I took off from the diner tonight. Told Laurie I wasn’t feeling well. I’ve been researching on the Internet; reading stuff. Looking for an answer.” “Me, too. You discover anything we don’t already know?” “Not so far. I’m still looking. I won’t give up until I find something or someone that can help you.” “Thanks Joey. I love you, you know that?” “I know that. And back at ya.” When he was gone she tried to sleep. To hide. Sleep kept her from thinking about how messed up her life was. Kept her from probing for solutions she couldn’t find. Things would look better tomorrow. Or she prayed so.",

      "content": "Chapter 8 Jenny “I don’t want to go to school today,” her son announced the next morning, plopping down in a kitchen chair. The sun hid behind fat steel-tipped clouds. The wind whistled past the windows and the house groaned. “I hate this new school. All the kids are hicks.” This from a boy who’d basically enjoyed school until now. Her mother’s intuition told her something else was going on. “Now that’s not a nice thing to say, Teddy. They’re children just like you. And isn’t it too early to be making fun of your new neighbors?” She tilted up his defiant chin and made him look at her. “What’s really wrong?” He wouldn’t answer. “Teddy?” “The other kids don’t like me that’s what.” “Why?” “Don’t know,” he mumbled between bites of oatmeal. Lately it was hard making food for her children. Sometimes the smells made her sick. She’d taken to putting Vick’s Vapor Rub in her nostrils and telling the kids she had a slight cold. Didn’t help much, though. She used to love oatmeal. Sarah was watching them closely, her eyes hiding secrets, too. “Oatmeal’s good, Mom. Nice and hot. Can I have some more cinnamon on mine?” The girl was dressed in a pair of her worn blue jeans and a plain black sweater. Her daughter’s I-don’t-want-to-be-noticed clothes. She got the cinnamon from the cabinet; sprinkled some in Sarah’s bowl. Turning back to Teddy, she sat down. “I think you do. Tell me.” “What difference would it make if I tell you?” For the first time she saw rebellion in her son’s stance. He was growing up. Changing. He didn’t want his mother fixing things for him anymore. “What would it change?” “I don’t know. We could talk and decide what you could do to fix it like we’ve always done.” When her son remained silent her daughter spoke up. “I know why the other kids don’t like us.” Sensitive brown eyes gazed at her. “First off it’s because we live here. They think our house is haunted, and now that people are disappearing and getting knocked off–” Oh, no, her kids know what’s happening around town. “–since we’ve moved in they really don’t like us.” She muttered, “They think we have something to do with it.” Simple child logic but Jenny saw through it to the truth. People were frightened and they were looking for scapegoats. A new family in town would do it. Then there might be those who remembered past murders and that they ceased about the time she and Jeff moved away. Now she was back and so were the troubles. Yes, that could be part of it. Suddenly, staring at her children, she grew angry. How dare anyone take it out on her kids? “Have they hurt either of you?” “No, not exactly.” Sarah’s eyes were guarded, though, as they flicked to her brother. In a meeker voice she added, “Except I saw them pushing Teddy around after school on the sidewalk. This one kid called him a bunch of bad names. I got mad and kicked one of them but they didn’t stop.” “Sarah! Why did ya have to tell her that?” Teddy sputtered. “Told you not to.” “Physical violence doesn’t solve anything,” Jenny reminded them. “It felt good, though,” Sarah bragged, then dropped her shoulders. “Sorry, Mom but I’d do it again if they try to hurt Teddy.” “It’s admirable you’re so protective of each other. That’s a good thing. But you can’t strike back like that. Hitting when you’re hit. Two wrongs don’t make a right.” She couldn’t believe she’d said that. God, and how many times had her parents mouthed that to her when she’d been a child? Lots. And had she ever listened? Not hardly. “You won’t do it again. I’ll take care of it.” “No Mom,” Teddy whined, with a shocked look in his eyes she’d been seeing too often since he’d turned twelve. “What are you going to do? Talk to their parents or to them? That’ll only make it worse.” “I don’t know yet, but I’ll take care of it.” Teddy jumped up from his chair and stomped out of the room, leaving his oatmeal uneaten. She would have gone after him but figured it was better to give him space for a while. He’d get over it. And in a couple minutes he did. She wanted to drive them to school but they vetoed it. “If you start that the kids will make even more fun of us,” Teddy said. “Everyone rides the bus. We can’t be different if we’re trying to fit in.” “Yeah, Teddy’s right.” Sarah scrunched her lips together. “We just need to fit in.” So she watched them get on the bus then took the short cut through the woods to the school. The day, foggy and overcast, allowed her to travel comfortably. She didn’t need dark glasses or a scarf, but stuck both of them in her jacket’s pocket just in case. One thing she remembered from growing up there was the eerie way the autumn mist could swiftly creep into the surrounding woods and town and cloak them like gray cotton candy. She could see through it easily enough but others couldn’t. Her new speed got her to the school before the bus arrived. Which was good because she didn’t want her kids to know what she was up to; didn’t want anyone to know. She waited behind an elm tree by the school’s entrance and kept vigil until the children began to file into the building. Buses were pulling into the parking lot and her eyes found Teddy and Sarah as they exited theirs. There was a group of older boys waiting for them. One was bigger than the rest, heavy-set, with dirty rumpled clothes; one in a red sock cap, had a spiteful stare and the other two hid their spinelessness behind smirking smiles. The usual gang of unloved, angry low self-esteemed bullies that frequented and terrorized most schoolyards and who got their jollies by planting fear in others weaker or smaller than themselves. She’d seen their kind all her life and not just in the schoolyard. They were everywhere, beaten-down people who only felt better when they were beating down someone else, and she’d always despised them and their kind. The boys crowded around her children and she clearly heard every word. “Hey you two weirdoes?” The fat boy had a malicious grin. “How are the ghosts at your house doing? Made friends with them yet? They tell you yet where they’re stashing the bodies?” “We don’t want any trouble.” Teddy stood up to them with Sarah behind him. She could see the anxiety on his face but he wasn’t backing down. He reminded her of Jeff. Gutsy. “Just let us through so we can get to class.” “Sure.” The boy with the sock cap was within an arm’s reach of her son. “My mom says that everything was fine around here until you moved back into that damned house. Now my cousin, Sid, is missing, too. He’s only ten. He was last seen out by your place. Mom says your family is cursed, always have been. We don’t want you here.” Another one missing, a boy? Oh, no. Was it her? Oh, no, no, no. “We’ve got every right to live here as you.” Teddy was being brave as he inched his way nearer to the school; Sarah hiding behind him. “Get out of our way. Go push around somebody else.” The six of them were the only ones left outside as the first school bell rang. The mist churned around them, a prowling animal that nipped at their shoes. That’s when Teddy made his move. He elbowed past the chubby kid, dragging Sarah in his wake, and somehow the other boy ended up on the ground on his backside. Teddy laughed. Jenny almost laughed herself. The furious look on the ground kid’s face would have been a funny picture. Then the one in the red cap picked up and threw a hand-sized rock at Teddy and her good humor was gone. The rock hit her son on his left cheek. Blood ran down his face but he didn’t utter a cry. Not a whimper. The other boys had rocks and launched them as Teddy and Sarah made a dash for the school’s front doors. That’s when she acted. With her thoughts and a ceremonial flick of her hands the rocks somehow veered off in mid-air just enough so they missed their targets. Not by much, but it looked strange as hell, as if the two Sanders children had an invisible bubble around them. Confused disbelief transformed the bullies’ faces. Another YouTube moment. She chuckled softly as the aggressors turned tail and ran; scattering like the frightened children they were. Not a great show of power, she still didn’t have a lot of control over it yet, but she’d bet those bully boys wouldn’t try that again and they’d leave her children alone. For now anyway. Teddy and Sarah were statues. Teddy had seen the rocks deflect and his mouth had fallen open. He wiped the blood from his face and glanced around. As if he knew what had happened wasn’t natural. She crouched behind the tree so he wouldn’t see her. “Come on, Sarah, we’re late for class,” he murmured and ushered her into the building. At last, something good from what she’d become. Jenny went home the way she’d come; spending time in the woods catching something to feed on so she could stay home that night. The fog helped hide her. This time she didn’t leave a dead carcass behind, just a weaker deer hobbling away into the bushes, and she was so proud of herself. She was learning and adapting. This vampire stuff, she mused, wasn’t all that hard. *** After she’d been home awhile and was in the middle of decorating her bedroom there was a knock on the front door. When she answered it she was eye to eye with a man she didn’t recognize…at first. Then, slowly, the memory returned. Detective Bradley. The St. Louis cop who’d handled her husband’s murder case. He hadn’t wasted any time contacting her. In person, no less. For some reason it made her instinctively wary. “Mrs. Jenny Sanders, remember me, Detective Bradley?” He presented a shiny gold badge and afterwards slipped it into his jacket pocket. “I spoke to you in the hospital?” “I remember.” A faint smile covered her uneasiness. In the two times he’d visited her as she’d been recovering she’d gleaned he was clever and intuitive on a high level. Which meant she had to be careful around him. Watch what she said. Guard what she did. “You’re a ways from home, Detective.” “That I am. Can I come in and chat with you for a bit?” He was dressed in a tawny-colored leather jacket and beige pants, a jaunty hat tilted down across his forehead. His hair was still short and his eyes were still full of concern. But there was something else in them that made her leery. He was a man on a mission searching for answers and there was a personal reason behind it. Just a strong hunch she had. “About the attack?” “Among other things. I was here earlier but no one was home.” “I was on an errand. Come on in.” “I spent the time waiting at your brother’s diner–great food, by the way–and had an informative conversation with your Chief Donald. He brought me up to speed on what’s been going on in town.” He followed her into the house and into the kitchen. So he knew about the latest murders. Great. “I’ll make you some coffee.” “That would be kind of you.” Gazing around, he said, “By the fresh paint smell, appears you’re fixing things up. By what I can see, you’re doing a fine job.” He sat in the chair closest to the back door. Cops. Always wanting to be near an exit. “Your brother told me all about you and the kids moving in here. The house your parents used to own. How lovely you’re making it.” “Our childhood home to be exact.” The coffee perking, she turned to the man. She hated looking at him, showing her face. Could he tell she’d changed? Could he tell with those sharp eyes of his what she really was? She prayed not. “How are your children?” He was being so polite. “You have a boy and a girl, right?” “Teddy and Sarah. They’re doing as well as can be expected.” She thought of the bullies at the school. The rocks. “It’s hard for them, losing a dad and moving to a new town and school half way across the country. They’re coping. We all are.” “How have you been feeling?” “Much better. As you can see.” “It was like a miracle, you waking up from that coma the way you did and how quickly you’ve recovered.” Was that a note of skepticism in his voice? She wasn’t sure. “Good medical care. And,” she let a friendly smile slip out, “I had a few good reasons to get better fast.” “Your kids.” “Yes.” “We parents would do about anything for our kids, wouldn’t we?” She didn’t know what he was getting at so she said, “They’re at school now.” “I know.” She couldn’t bear it any longer. “Detective, I appreciate you coming all the way out here to speak to me but wouldn’t a telephone call have been a lot easier? And cheaper?” “Would have been, but I’m also interested in the strange occurrences happening here in Summer Haven.” Oh, oh. In she plunged. “Like what?” “Oh, disappearances. Unusual…homicides. Quite a few of them now. Fact is, the deaths are very similar to,” he hesitated and, as if he’d made a decision, forged on, “the way your husband died–and others.” “The way my husband died?” “You know what I’m talking about. Your husband had very little blood left in him. There were odd wounds along his neck, though the doctors believed he died from…other causes.” Once she’d been well enough she’d been told Jeff had been beaten to death, his throat cut so severely he’d practically been beheaded. Something else she couldn’t stand to think about. The police hadn’t mentioned the blood loss. Not to her anyway. She’d just assumed he’d bled a lot from his wounds. “Not an ordinary death. I’m thinking you know a little more than you’re letting on. That’s why I’m here.” So there it was. Her suspicion materialized. A vampire had killed Jeff. Oh, she’d known that truth some place deep inside but hadn’t wanted to accept it. But it made sense. Now someone, besides her and Joey, knew others were dying the same way. And he was a cop. Not good. Not good at all. This detective was too smart to be so close to the truth. “Why do you think I know something?” She evaded his eyes. “Because you survived.” “Oh.” “So I’m asking you: You know anything about these new murders here in town? Can you give me any information that might help in my investigation?” “Isn’t this out of your jurisdiction?” “It is.” “Then why are you here investigating these murders?” He gave her another intense look. “It’s my job.” “That can’t be all.” She’d caught that air of sadness about him again. This time she met his eyes and with a simple silent command made him tell her. Another little trick she’d learned she could sometimes perform. For a moment his strong will fought it. Then he spoke softly. “I think there’s a connection between your attack, the new murders here and some older ones in St. Louis. “Over five years ago my daughter, Meg, was mugged, like you and your husband, while she was out one evening shopping. Alone. They, whoever they were, killed her. Her body was drained of blood; nearly decapitated. Same wounds on her neck you and your husband had. Same senseless ferocity in the beating. “She was my only child. Just sixteen. Pretty, intelligent and loving. She wanted to be a nurse, but she never got the chance.” His hands clenched as they rested on the table. His coffee cold. Forgotten. “I’ve been chasing her murderers and investigating any similar crimes ever since. I won’t–I can’t–give up until I find her killers and bring them to justice. Put them away so they never hurt another innocent person. “I believe your attackers are the same ones who killed my little girl. They’re the same ones who’ve probably followed you back here and are killing your neighbors.” Ahhh. Now she understood and it softened her heart towards him. He’d lost his only daughter. She, too, feared something happening to her children and couldn’t imagine the heartbreak of losing one. Oh, how she wanted to help him. But she couldn’t. Not without giving away what she was; what she’d done in the distant past. Giving away that vampires did exist. That she was one now. His enemy. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, “for your loss.” “Thank you.” He swung his head towards the window. The fog was crowding up against the glass but couldn’t get in. There was such misery on his face she looked away. “Do you remember anything more now about the attack on you and your husband or that night? Is there anything, no matter how small, you could tell me that might help? Even an inconsequential detail might give us a clue.” She could have told him the truth but that would have been suicide. For her anyway. What would he do if he found out she was one of them? One of the same breed that had killed his daughter and those other people? There was no way she could confess her secret to him. Not now. Not ever. She had to be very careful. It was so different being on the other side, wasn’t it? “No. Not anything more than you already know,” she lied. “My memory draws a blank when it comes to that night. I’m sorry.” At least that part was true. He gulped down what was left of his coffee and stood up. “That’s a shame. I’m afraid there’ll be more murders if we don’t find and stop these animals.” “You think there is more than one?” That didn’t shock her. Vampires ran in packs. “There could be.” “And you don’t have any leads at all?” Now he wouldn’t look at her. “A few I need to follow up on.” “So you’ll be sticking around for a bit, huh?” “For a bit, yes. I’m staying in town at Hannah’s Bed and Breakfast.” Now his eyes met hers. “If you remember anything at all I’ll be there if you need to talk.” He handed her a business card. “My cell phone number is on the back. Call anytime.” “I will. If I remember anything else.” “Thank you for the chat and the coffee.” He paused at the door. “I am happy you’re doing better, Mrs. Sanders. After all that happened to you, you deserve it. “Take care of those kids of yours.” He finally smiled at her. She let him out and watched him plod into the mist; heard his car drive away. Not waiting long, she grabbed her purse and keys and rushed out the door. She had to talk to someone who’d understand; someone she trusted. Joey. She was scared and didn’t want to be alone. For as Detective Bradley walked out the door she’d heard voices in her head. Many voices. One or two stronger than the rest. Vampire voices. They were looking for her. Calling her. They were strong. And they wouldn’t give up. If she fell under their spell she’d never be able to remain in this, her life. With her children and brother. She’d become one of them, a soulless killer rampaging through the night seeking human blood. An enemy of mankind. A monster. Forever. Fight it! But it took all her strength not to go to them. Instead she drove to Joey’s Diner. He’d help. She knew he’d help. Since they’d been kids she could always count on him, no matter how bad the problem. She sure hoped he could calm her fears now. Because she was really frightened.",

      "content": "Chapter 9 The Vampires There were four of them. There’d been five but their leader had banished the fifth back to the other place for the unforgivable crime of disobeying him. The empty, skyless land they all came from and despised; the land of their birth where the remainder of their kind lived in a state of numb terror among the rapacious denizens that resided there. The other place, as they all called it, was a sort of hell for their kind. None wanted to be there and all fought, every moment of every minute of their existence, to escape from. Few could. Because few had the power it took to travel from that place to the world of men. The world of men where the sky was a rainbow of colors instead of dirty water; the scents were intoxicating, the seasons were temperate, not glacial all the time, and the blood, human blood, was a sweet nectar they craved like humans craved heroin. The blood made them stronger. The more they had the longer they could remain in the human world. And they desired that above all. Their leader more than any of them. He had loathsome and formidable enemies in the other place. He, ancient and ruthless, had the control to go from world to world and bring along those he wished. Which made him someone with immense power in his old realm. Fog surged around the four stygian figures as they hunkered in the woods on the town’s edge. When standing at their full height, they were all nearly seven feet tall, with flowing hair the color of the moon. But their leader was the tallest; the most frightful of face and limb. Strong. Fierce. The hungriest and the cruelest. “Have you at least found out where she lives, Zebulan? Who she is?” he berated his subordinate coldly. The wind raked across his sharp-featured face and tugged at his long coat. Though he didn’t need one, none of them did. They couldn’t feel cold or warmth. Not in this world anyway. “No, and I’ve tried. She’s too strong already. She’s learned to cloak her thoughts and move through the air like lightning. I couldn’t catch her.” “Damn. How can she be stronger than you? You’re as old as I. Strongest behind me.” “She is. There’s something different about her. None of us made her. She turned all by herself. Unheard of.” “Not entirely,” he spoke harshly against the rising wind. He didn’t say it aloud or let them hear his thoughts but he’d known a few like her in his time. Mutants all. They turned mysteriously without his or his brethren’s’ blood. Yet they had some things in common. They were dangerous. Unpredictable. Strong. Would she be the one? Would she? “You must find her, Zebulan. Or one of you.” He glared at each of them in turn with rock black eyes. “I have this feeling about her.” He didn’t have to tell them what would happen if they didn’t do as ordered. They knew and it wasn’t pretty. Snapping his fingers, he’d send them back to the other place and imprison them there. Some never arrived…in one piece. They weren’t fools. They’d find the girl. The other two exchanged panicky looks. One sniffed the air as his comrade shifted from foot to foot, clenching and unclenching his claw like hands. They were hungry. Their inhuman eyes glittered. Their leader, knowing what was in their hearts said, “First we hunt, replenish our strength.” Then strode away. “Where?” One skittered along behind him. “There’s a road not far from here that sees much traffic even at this late hour. We’ll go there and pick something up.” The four of them floated into the mist between the trees and the night swallowed them. *** “Jack, please slow down,” his wife snapped as she peered through the condensation rimming the car’s window. She was a fragile woman with blond hair, thin skin and not much meat on her bones. A grade school teacher with a yearning to write children’s books someday. “This damn fog-soup,” he said, a gregarious man who sold siding for a living. Taking his right hand and using the cuff of his shirtsleeve he smeared the film away from the windshield so he could see. “I can barely make out the road. I hope I’m still on it.” The frown on his face was one he’d been wearing for the last hour. They’d been driving since early morning on their way to see his wife’s grandmother, in the hospital after suffering a stroke. The old lady had raised his wife so the two were close even though they now lived in different states. Their daughter was asleep, sprawled across the rear seat. He glanced at her to be sure she was okay. She was. The girl loved her great-grandmother and the old lady’s illness had upset her. When she was upset, she slept. But then the girl, at twelve years old, was a sensitive soul and ached for everyone and anyone who was having troubles. She helped the old people in their neighborhood by fetching groceries or cleaning their untidy little houses. She had a smile for everyone and everyone loved her. Grunting, he squinted through the cloudy window again. His wife was right about slowing down and his foot let up on the accelerator. The fog was a wall of gray all around them. “I have no idea where we are,” he admitted. “Could be on Jupiter for all I know.” “We’re somewhere in Florida,” she responded with a sense of humor he’d come to depend on and appreciate in hard times. She flashed him an encouraging smile. “Yeah, somewhere in Florida. Maybe we should pull over and wait this out?” His wife shook her head. “Mom said there wasn’t much time. She thinks Grandma is only holding on waiting to see us.” “I know, I know.” Something thumped on the car’s roof. Unusual because they were driving a sturdy over-sized SUV with a luggage rack on top. It happened again. The car swerved violently to the right and they almost careened off the road. “What the hell was that?” Listening, the man cocked his head and slowed the car down to a crawl. All he could hear was the engine and tree limbs sliding along the side of the vehicle. Outside, the wind was a soft moan. The night was endless. Their headlights cut through it but showed little. More fog. A gauntlet of dark swaying trees ahead of them. A thin ribbon of road. Another thump on the roof. Louder. Something dragging towards the front. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Jack had a really bad feeling about it all right before the man’s face–horrifying to look at because of the unearthly hunger in its mad eyes and the sharp spike like teeth–lowered down and stared at him through the windshield. A man’s on top of the car? While I’m driving? What– His wife screamed as the man’s fist shattered in the glass; came in and snatched her. Jack yelled when she was yanked up and through the hole as if she’d been a rag doll. There hadn’t even been time to reach out for her. Save her. His daughter thrashed in the back seat; he glimpsed her in the rearview mirror, in a death struggle with something that had gotten in the car. Another one? The girl was crying and whimpering for him. Daddy help me! Daddy. D-a-d-d-y! She shrieked and was gone. Like his wife. Gone. This is a damn nightmare! I’ve fallen asleep at the wheel, he thought as a hand rammed through the side window and wrenched him out. His screams reverberated into the October night as the car, driverless, veered off the road and crashed into a tree. The fog surrounded the vehicle like a shroud, muffling the car’s death throes. The headlights remained on for hours before the battery gave out. There was a bloody purse in the front seat and a fuzzy pink stuffed animal in the back. Suitcases in the trunk. But of people the car was empty.",

      "content": "Chapter 10 Jenny Joey calmed her down. He took her in the diner’s kitchen and, comforting her only the way he could, talked most of her fears away in a soft voice so no one around them could hear. There among the people working with the food and the normal activity of everyday life she let herself be persuaded that everything would be all right. Somehow. “That detective came out to the farmhouse. Asked a mess of questions,” she said right off. “He was here earlier. I told him how to get to where you lived.” He looked guilty. “Sorry. I had to. He asked. Wouldn’t take no for an answer.” “That’s okay. He would have found me sooner or later. I’m afraid I wasn’t much help to him. Of course, I couldn’t be. I’m almost in as much of the dark as he is.” There was doubt on her brother’s face. “Not really. At least you know what’s doing the killings.” She just stared at him and nodded. “Those voices I heard in my head are scaring the daylights out of me,” she whispered. The kitchen smelled of onion rings. Once one of her favorite foods, the odor now made her queasy. “I could lie to you and say it’s going to be hunky-dory, Sis, but I won’t. Cause I don’t know. I’ve searched the Internet high and low for help and, so far, nothing.” “Isn’t that what I said? People,” she breathed, “don’t believe in vampires. Not really. That’s the supernatural’s greatest defense. A vampire once told me that.” “I haven’t given up. I’ve sent e-mails to so-called experts in the field who might be able to enlighten us. I even sent one to that Harvard professor of yours who wrote that book. Don’t worry, I didn’t mention our names or where we live. I’m waiting for answers. Maybe one of them will help us or send us in the right direction.” “When and if they stop laughing. Give it up, Joey. No one’s going to help us. No one human, anyway.” “I won’t give up.” “And it eases my heart just knowing you won’t.” “That’s the courageous woman I know. All I can tell you now is to be careful. Stay alert. Keep in touch with me. Until we can figure out what to do.” “That’s the problem. I don’t have a clue, either. It’s bad enough,” she dropped her gaze, hung her head, “what happened to Jeff. Me. Now I’m really frightened. I need time to adjust to my new form of existence.” Her smile was brittle. “But it looks like I won’t be getting it. “When I heard those voices I realized we were all in danger. That’s one thing I’m sure of.” “and you have no idea who or where they are?” “No, but overhearing them sent a panic through me. I believe they’re behind the disappearances and the murders. No, I know it. And they’re going to kill again. Soon.” “More?” She nodded. “Oh, God, we can’t let that happen.” “How can we stop it?” He shook his head and said what she was afraid to, “Maybe we can’t.” She headed for the door. School would be out soon and she had to be there when the kids got home. “I have to go but I’ll stay in touch. You, too.” “I will.” She’d gone home. The sun went down. She fixed supper for Teddy and Sarah. Hot dogs and pork and beans. Evening news came on as they ate, her pushing her food around on the plate, going to her lips but not going in, so it looked like she was eating, and they watched the small TV on the kitchen counter. Long ago she’d given up no television at supper. The kids liked to watch it as they ate. It made them happy. So she let them. It’d worked out. Teddy liked the world news. Sarah rarely watched because she was too busy yakking about her day. “Mom?” Sarah asked during a commercial after observing her pretense of eating. It hadn’t fooled her. “You’re not eating. Again. If you don’t eat you’re going to turn into a skeleton.” Sarah stuck a bite of her hot dog in front of her mother’s mouth and Jenny took it. First chance she got, she got up, sidled to the sink, spit it out and washed it away. Then cleared off the table. Teddy with his see-everything eyes. “Mom, you spit that out, didn’t you?” Caught. “It didn’t taste right, that’s all. Don’t worry about it.” “Are you sure you’re okay?” he pressed. “You seem different lately.” “I’m fine. Just tired. It takes a long time to get over a coma.” She put on a smile and hugged him. “Sarah’s been hogging the conversation. How was your day at school?” Teddy squirmed in his chair. Before he could reply Sarah butted in, “Something weird happened to us this morning.” Teddy kicked her under the table. “Ouch!” she yelped. “No it didn’t,” he grumbled, throwing her a shut-up look. “What happened?” Jenny directed the question to her daughter. “Nothing,” Teddy cut his sister off again. Sarah giggled. “Wade Cruthers and his stupid friends won’t bother us anymore, that’s what happened. They got theirs. Should have saw their faces when those rocks nearly hit them.” Another giggle. Jenny looked at Teddy. His shoulders gave a dismissive shrug. “We were having a little trouble with a couple of kids, that’s all. Cause we’re new. We got it straightened out, though. They won’t be pestering us anymore.” “They were even nice to us after school. Smiled, were polite and everything.” Sarah rinsed her empty plate off. It was her turn to wash dishes. Teddy would dry. That was the deal when Jenny made the meal. “That’s good.” “Ha, I told them the ghosts were protecting us and they better not bother us no more or the ghosts would get them,” Sarah said in a low whisper and snickered mischievously. “Boy, were they scared.” Jenny hid her smile. So it’d worked. She caught the strange look Teddy gave her. His eyes were on her face for a long time until she turned away. “You have homework?” she grilled them. Teddy nodded. “Not much.” Sarah returned to the table and snuggled into Jenny’s arms. Jenny hoped her clothes would keep the coldness of her skin from the child. “My teacher, Mrs. Riceall, doesn’t believe in a lot of homework. She says if we can’t learn it during school hours we shouldn’t worry about it after school. I like her.” “Mrs. Riceall? Oh, your Uncle Joey and I both had her when we were kids. She must be old as dirt.” “Older.” Sarah grinned. “But she’s nice.” “She always was.” Jenny had the memory of a plain woman with a gentle smile and kind blue eyes, raspy voice. Short of stature. She’d been the teacher who’d first inspired her to write after Jenny had stood in front of the class and read a story about her and Joey, when they’d been really young, trying to ride some wild ponies in Sutton’s field; long before her father had bought them horses. An adventure that had ended disastrously. Jenny had been thrown into a thorn bush and Joey’s pony had run away with him and then dumped him unceremoniously into a muddy creek. Their mom has been so mad. They could have been hurt. But it made for a great story. Forbidden ponies. Just punishment. Afterwards, Mrs. Riceall had clapped and exclaimed, “Someday, Jenny Lacey, you’re going to be a writer!” Funny, she’d never told her: Jenny, you’re also going to be a vampire. Oh well. “Mom.” Sarah snuggled closer. “I don’t feel so good.” “What’s wrong, honey?” “I think I got a fever. My throat’s sore. Has been all day but now it’s worse. Do I need to go to the doctor?” Reality hit home and not for the first time. They didn’t have a doctor. Not here anyway. Worse, they didn’t have medical coverage. Another thing that had departed with Jeff’s business. A doctor’s appointment with the usual tests or an emergency room visit could wipe out what was left of their savings. They needed medical coverage and she needed a job that would give it to them. “No, I don’t think so. Not yet. Let’s take your temperature, though.” She took Sarah’s hand, led her into the bathroom and, pulling the thermometer from the medicine cabinet, checked her temperature, with an anxious Teddy looking on. “Ninety-nine point one. You have a slight fever. Nothing to worry about yet. I’ll give you an aspirin and you’re going to bed early tonight. We’ll see how you’re feeling in the morning.” “Okay, Mommy.” Her daughter’s face was flushed. “Don’t worry, Sarah,” Teddy said. “You’ll feel better tomorrow. You’ll see.” How she loved them. She was relieved what she felt for them hadn’t changed. Now that Jeff was gone they were her life. One of her greatest uncertainties was she’d stop loving them or harm them in some way. She didn’t know what she’d do if that happened. Just the thought filled her with anguish. Without her children she wouldn’t be able to go on. Surely, because of that love she could never become evil, never become a monster, could she? They’d keep her human. The kids went to their rooms, teddy did his homework, and the three of them watched television until bedtime, which was earlier than usual because Sarah wasn’t feeling well and Teddy said he was tired. By eight o’clock they were both tucked in. Worried about the kids, she didn’t want to be away from the house for long and didn’t wander far from it. That night she was going to try something different. She came upon a large doe, stopped and gently called it to her with her thoughts. It came. Let her touch it. She talked soothingly as she drank, just what she needed, and let it go. With grateful wonder she watched as it plunged into the undergrowth and into the night. She hadn’t killed it; didn’t think she’d even hurt it. Thank you, God. Perhaps she wasn’t a monster. Her gratefulness was short lived. Returning to the house, she felt eyes on her. A dark clothed man with glowing silver hair hid concealed behind a tree. A forgotten memory uncoiled inside of her. She’d seen this man before, but couldn’t place where or when. She hated that her memory was being so spotty lately, but the terror was instant. She couldn’t let him catch her. By then his hands were on her throat and she was caught like the doe. Staring up into a face so far above her. “Our leader wants to see you. Now. Don’t fight. Come along quietly.” A voice in her mind attempted to mesmerize her as she’d mesmerized her prey earlier. She listened but fought obeying it. “And if I don’t?” she clenched through her teeth. “I’ll drag you.” There was callousness in the way he held her. As if she was a lower creature. His fingers tightened and she thought she’d pass out. “Who’s your leader?” She forced the words out. “Your master. He calls. You come. You’ll learn.” So afraid she had difficulty breathing. “What…does…he…want from me?” “You.” A deep cold invaded her and she knew she had to get away. She couldn’t let herself be captured. She couldn’t be taken to this leader. Couldn’t abandon her children. Her family. Her home. It was a defensive response. She pried the man’s hands off her neck and kicked him. Hard. He squealed in angry shock, flew into the air and the dark mist swallowed him. Before she willed herself away, she sent a burst of pain at him and smiled when he screamed from inside the mist. Her powers were growing. She sent him another for good measure. His second shriek wasn’t finished before she found herself standing, alone, in her own kitchen. She’d escaped the danger. If he couldn’t follow her, that is. Frowning, her mind clutched at the memory of what had just happened and as it began to fade away, she fought to retain it. She’d about forgotten the encounter when something clicked in her mind and the cloud lifted. They couldn’t make her forget them, their threat, any longer. She brought forth the image of the man in the woods and the horror he’d produced. She wouldn’t forget him now. Someone was looking for her. Someone dangerous. Someone she must avoid at any cost. Who was he? She didn’t know and she didn’t want to. But she mustn’t forget. The next hour the black squares of the windows made her jumpy. She was worried his henchman had followed her home; that her and her children were in peril. No one came for her. Two hours went by. She realized she was fighting, every minute, to keep from forgetting the incident. She wrote a note to herself, in case, she did forget. It bothered her to no end that the memory wanted to dissolve on her. Was she going insane? Losing her human identity? Being forced to change even more? Under someone else’s control? She couldn’t be sure of anything. Again her eyes scanned the windows. Outside the wind moaned and the leaves clicked against the windowpanes. There was no man in dark clothes out there. No one. It startled her an hour later when her cell phone rang. “Who’d be calling at ten o’clock at night,” she muttered as she placed the phone to her ear, putting the checkbook aside she’d been trying to balance. Though no matter what she did, the column of figures came out lacking. Barely enough for next month’s bills. She’d made the decision as tough as it would be she had to look for a job. Had to make money somehow. They needed groceries, warmth and light, and, yes, medical coverage. “Hello?” “Jenny?” It was Andy. “Here.” “I hate calling you this late but can I could stop by for a while? I was out getting ice cream and thought you might like some, too.” She wanted to say no but the loneliness in his voice wouldn’t let her. “Sure. The kids are in bed and I could use some grownup company. Don’t bother with the ice cream, though, I had a huge supper and, I swear, couldn’t eat another thing.” “Too late. I’m at your door, ice cream and all.” “I’ll let you in.” “Chocolate, huh? Thank you. But you’ll have to eat it yourself,” she told him as she shut the door behind him. He was carrying a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. “No thanks. I’ve had my pint. Second of the day, to be exact. Put this in the freezer for later?” “If I don’t eat it the kids will enjoy it tomorrow after supper.” She took it from him and put it in the freezer. “What brings you out on a night like this? Visibility can’t be more than three feet in any direction. Not a fit night for man or beast.” They sat on the couch in the living room in front of the muted television. He didn’t look happy. His strained expression and slouching figure told her that story. “Job hunting, huh?” She turned off the television with the remote, crossed her legs under her and swung around to face him. “I suppose you’ve had a grueling day of it?” “How can you tell?” He leaned against the cushions. His fingers moved up his face and kneaded the skin around his eyes, his body filled up the contours of the sofa. His uncombed hair brushed his shoulders. There were the beginnings of gray streaks among the blond. He was, frustration aside, a fairly good-looking man. It came to her that, yes indeed, he’d changed. He was no longer the spoiled adolescent she’d known when they’d been young. Something had transformed him. She wondered what it’d been. “Easy. I’ve had friends and family lose their jobs in this recession. I recognize the look.” “What look?” He was studying her now. The house around them was hushed, but the night was listening. “That look of hopeless despair when someone has gone out looking and can’t find anything. Wretched exasperation.” “Ah, that look. I imagine my aggravation is showing?” “It sure is.” She reached out and patted his hand. Withdrew it hastily. “Don’t worry so much, Andy, it’s only been a few days since you lost your job. It can’t be all that bad.” “It is. This is a small town. I’ve hit every bank, financial institution and mortgage company for miles around and there isn’t anything available for someone with my qualifications. I know. I’ve been to every one of them. Most places wouldn’t accept my applications. Hiring freeze. In twenty years working, I’ve never seen it this bad.” “And I commiserate with you. I’m in the same boat. Only difference is I haven’t started actually looking for a job yet, though I will be real soon. The money we have left won’t last long and today I realized my children need health care. Ours lapsed after I came home from the hospital and buying it out on the market is way too expensive for our budget. A job with benefits would take care of everything. It’s the only thing, aside from winning the lottery, that will.” His glance was empathetic. “We’re both on the Titanic then. Pity us.” “Head for the lifeboats.” She tried to lighten the mood. “What lifeboats?” Her laugh was a sorry excuse for one. “I’ve been dreading the job search. I have to write up a resume. Don’t know what the heck I’m going to put in it.” She stared out the windows. Was that something flitting behind the glass? She stiffened. “What about your writing?” “Ha, ha. How many places would hire me around here if I wrote down I was a published novelist, of horror stories no less? No one. Like I said the other night I don’t have a new book to sell. I was going to begin one about the time….” she trailed off unable to finish. “Oh, I see.” Then after a pause, he said, “Can’t you start something and get an advance? Isn’t that how it’s done?” “A pitch, a book proposal? In better times I could have. Not now. The publishing world has collapsed like the economy. Companies have shed editors and personnel down to the bone. My agent said I’d have to have a completed blockbuster to be in the running. I have zippo. Not even one idea. My mind’s been either absent,” she gave him a small smile, “or on other things lately.” He didn’t have to ask what. “So what sort of job are you looking for?” “Beats me. I’m really not qualified for much else. That’s the way it is with writers. Seems all we can do well is write. Not real necessary in the real world. So you see, my problem’s worse than yours. Though, when I was younger, I painted houses and did small home improvements working with my dad. I loved fixing up peoples’ homes. Making them pretty. Still do. It makes me happy.” He looked around. “I can see you have a talent for it. This place looks better every time I come over. You have a way with a paintbrush.” “Well, if you can come up with a job that would incorporate all this,” she spread her hands to encompass her restorations, “and pay me, let me know. It has to be close and during school hours. I’d want to be home evenings and weekends for my kids.” Outside the windows nothing stirred. She’d about forgotten the man in the woods when his image slithered into her mind and the panic with it. The fact that she’d nearly forgotten the episode again alarmed her. What was wrong with her? “I will, though…come to think of it, there is a job in town you might be interested in.” “There is?” “The Ace Hardware store across from the grocery market needs someone. They have to be knowledgeable on home improvements, paints and things like that. Tools. It’s daytime work. Pays not great but Glen Dryer, the man who owns and runs the place, is a sweetheart to work for I’ve heard. The store is family friendly because he’s a devoted family man. He offers health care, too, which is rare these days. He’d work with you on the hours. Tell him I sent you.” “Why aren’t you going for it?” “Please. I don’t know a finishing nail from a paint swatch. Color blind, on top of it. Looking around at the work you’ve done here, I see you do.” “Well, then, thank you for the tip. I’ll look into it.” “You’re welcome.” He slumped down, released a sigh. “What else is making you so sad?” she asked. “It’s easy to see something more is bothering you.” “Ah, you know, it’s not just the lousy job market, layoffs and plant closings, it’s the gruesome goings on around here lately. The slayings. There’s this mood of doom hanging over the town. Everyone’s experiencing it. I can see it in peoples’ faces and in the way they’re acting. Spooked.” Her heart, if any heavier, would have fallen to her feet. She was responsible, somehow, for the town’s misfortunes. She knew it. Like the detective said, she’d brought them with her. Something awful had followed her. Was stalking her. And now the town. “Has something else happened?” She was afraid of the answer. “A boy’s missing. The town’s waiting, holding its breath. Everyone’s waiting for the next–” “Murder?” She glanced away, gnawing on her lip. “Yes. Anyway, losing my job was traumatic enough but with all this other stuff I don’t know what to think. It’s like the town is cursed.” His apologetic smile came then, as if knowing he was bringing her down, too. He patted her hand and let it linger. Could he feel the iciness of her skin? See her eyes that glittered like black stars? She lowered her eyelids and slowly pulled her hand from his as she repositioned her body. “I’m sure it’ll be okay. It’s going to get better. You’ll see.” She hated lying but what else could she say? That, yes, there’ll be more murders? Many more. And it could get worse? She couldn’t do that. “Let’s pray you’re right. Another murder and the town will go ballistic.” She closed her eyes. Oh, please God, don’t let there be any more. “Oh, I’m sorry. You must be tired. The work here. The kids. It’s late. I should be going. I just wanted to check up on the three of you. Make sure you’re doing okay.” Her eyes opened. She made her lips smile. “We are. Thank you for worrying about us. Bringing the ice cream. Tipping me off about the job. It’s kind of you.” He returned her half-hearted smile and the caring reflected in his eyes wasn’t lost on her. Was he falling for her? Heaven help him. That would never do for so many reasons. Her worst fears were confirmed when, still looking at her, he leaned over and laid a soft kiss on her cheek. The beginning of love. A tiny glimmer. Yet it was there. Not now. The thought of it overwhelmed her and she couldn’t breathe for a moment. His blood smells so delicious. Warm. Pumping below his soft skin. Yummy. She stared at him, not moving. Not trusting herself. He misunderstood her reaction and rose from the couch. “I shouldn’t have done that. I’m sorry. With Jeff being gone such a short time and all. It was thoughtless of me. I’ll go now. I can let myself out.” She could have smoothed things over but, again, she didn’t trust herself. When he’d kissed her all she’d wanted to do was bite his neck and drink…and she’d just fed. Why was she so weak? Was it something about Andy or was it the way he felt about her? The caring? She wasn’t sure but couldn’t take the chance. He needed to leave. Run. So she stayed where she was. Her and her tired smile. “Thank you for worrying about us, Andy. I hope you find a job.” She watched him slip out the door. She got up and locked it securely behind him. Not for her sake, her safety, but for his. After checking the windows, and seeing nothing unusual on the other side, she trudged upstairs. She lay in the dark bedroom, tossing and turning. If she could just sleep, when she awoke her problems, the murders, everything, might be only a terrible nightmare. Lots of rest was what she needed. Or a new life. Of course, that she couldn’t have. The night silently laughed at her as she prayed for deliverance.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 Jenny The next morning, after the children climbed on the bus for school, Jenny got dressed and drove into town. She wore her best slacks, a sweater top, a light car coat and a trendy sock cap. Almost overnight the weather had turned into winter. Winter in Florida. Not cold but chilly. The sky was a flat pewter, which allowed her to move about freely, and the wind was capricious. Dry leaves danced around on the sidewalks and streets. She no longer felt the chill but she’d look funny running around town without proper attire. So she put on her costume. It did strike her, as she was dressing, that it was funny…she was a vampire going out to apply for a job. But she couldn’t think of any other legitimate way to raise money. The Ace Hardware had been there for over thirty years so she was well acquainted with it. She used to go there with her father for building supplies. But Glen Dryer was new. According to Joey, who she’d called before she’d set out, he’d been the owner for the last eight years and was doing a bang up job of it. He’d expanded the building and the business and was widely respected as a savvy businessman and an excellent employer. “It’s not a bad idea,” Joey had confirmed when she’d called him. “You working there. The pay’s fairly high for a service job and the work environment is amiable. Laid back. And remember, it is kinda shadowy in there. Not many windows.” “Sounds perfect to me.” “Say hi to Shelly for me, would you? She’s one of Laurie’s friends who’s been working there the last year. She likes it.” Jenny slipped her sunglasses into her purse, stood straight and walked in. Her first impression was the store was larger than she recalled. More organized. It was festively decorated for Halloween. There were pumpkins and raven colored cats taped on the walls and orange and black crepe twisted around the checkout counters. Real festive. Bowls of candy corn sat welcoming by the three cash registers. Computers really. The store had been updated to the twenty-first century and everything looked shiny and new. Impressive. It smelled of paint and metal and brought back so many memories of her and her dad. The woman at the one open checkout smiled brightly at her. “Hello. I’m Shelly, can I help you?” “Is Mr. Dryer in?” Jenny returned the smile, a tense flutter behind it. It’d been so long since she’d applied for a job of any kind her mind was running in circles. She’d lost the social skill for it. Her stomach was uneasy. She tried to look smart. Helpful. And nothing like a vampire. “He’s in the back. Are you Jenny?” “I am. How do you know my name?” “Oh, your brother, Joey, called and told me to be nice to you. That you were applying for the job here and would probably be a little nervous.” “Joey’s got a big mouth,” she said with a chuckle. “That he does.” The short woman with frizzy red hair circling her head like a round helmet came from behind the counter and stuck out her plump hand. Her eyes a Christmas green. “But he’s a lovable big mouth, makes the best cheeseburgers in the county, and any sister of his is a welcome addition to our little town. Nice to meet you.” “Same here.” Jenny couldn’t help herself. She liked the bubbly woman right off. There was an instant bond as if she’d known her before. Perhaps she had. In her other life. “You don’t remember me, do you?” “You look familiar. Sorry. I’m not good at recalling faces.” “That’s okay. I’ve changed a lot. I used to be real skinny and real pretty. No freckles. No joke.” I used to see you around town with your father when I was a teenager. Everyone knew who you were. The town’s famous writer.” The woman didn’t see her flinch. Shelly gestured her towards the rear of the room. “Glen’s at his desk back there in the corner waiting for you. I told him you were coming.” The woman grinned and mouthed softly, “Don’t worry. If you can add, talk in complete sentences and have a friendly smile, Glen will hire you. We really need help. “The last girl walked out a month ago. She was a real nitwit who never showed up on time, not once. We’ve been hard put to cover all the hours since. Glen’s happy you’re interested. Me, too. Go get it, girl. Good luck.” “Thanks, Shelly.” With a lighter step Jenny went in search of who she optimistically hoped would be her new boss. A bald-headed man with glasses scribbling away at a desk at the other end of the store, he was easy to find. When she walked up he came from behind it, and smiling, grabbed her hand. “Jenny Sanders, huh?” “Yes.” “Well, here, sit on down in this chair and let’s converse.” He was polite, professional, but easy to talk to. She could see where he’d be a good boss. He seemed to care about people and he listened. They spoke and she told him about herself, her children, and what had brought her back to town. Well, not everything, of course. But enough. “I heard about the job from Andy Sullivan.” He nodded his head. “Fantastic guy. Shame he lost his job. But, knowing Andy, he’ll bounce back quick enough. He’s smart. Tried to hire him myself but he’s allergic to everything to do with home improvements. He couldn’t get out of here fast enough.” Mr. Dryer appeared amused. She told him about her history with fixing buildings, her work with her father years before and how she liked decorating. They discussed the pay and benefits, which were generous, as Andy had said. Then he offered her the job. She accepted. “When can you start?” he inquired, eagerly. “Monday? That’s not too far off, is it?” It was Wednesday. “I’m finishing up moving us into my mom and dad’s old farmhouse. I’m still painting. Repairing. But I should be about done by Monday.” “That’ll be fine. I heard you were fixing the old place up and I’m glad. It’s a house that needed it. They don’t build them like that anymore. Solid. Lovely location. Like being in the country but close to town.” He took his glasses off and cleaned them with a cloth he’d produced from a drawer. His smile showed slightly crooked teeth. “You said your kids start school at eight, so would starting work at nine be acceptable? Working until three? Monday through Friday? Shelly and my other employee, Sam, who’s my sister Ella’s boy, will work the weekends.” “Perfect.” She rose from the chair and they shook hands, sealing the deal. “I’ll be here Monday morning at nine o’clock. Thank you so much, Mr. Dryer. You won’t be sorry. I’m a hard worker and a fast learner.” “Of that, I have little doubt. Ah, and call me Glen. We’re friends here. You’ll see. The town is tight knit. Why your brother Joey and I play chess sometimes at the diner when it isn’t too busy. With Andy, we go hunting sometimes. For deer, in season, you know. Like Joey, he’s a good friend of mine, too.” Jenny, again, was amazed at how Joey had changed since she’d been gone. Once a self-involved loner he’d actually turned into a man with an army of friends and a real place in the community. She was glad he was so well known and liked. It made her proud. Their dad would have been proud. He’d been a social fun-loving person as well. Very community minded. “See you Monday then.” She passed Shelly on the way out and gave her a thumbs up. “Monday morning,” she informed the girl, who laughed and gave her a thumbs up back. For the first time since she’d been home, Jenny felt a twinge of relief; a sense that perhaps she was going to make it. Fit in. Have a new life. Well, as much as she could with her secret. And she realized that, not once, had she looked at Shelly or Glen and wanted to slurp up their tasty blood. Must have been the excitement of the whole job thing. Perhaps everything was going to work out. Whistling as she slipped into her car, she caught sight of the Summer Haven Market and it reminded her the kids needed milk and fresh fruit. She maneuvered the car into the parking lot. She’d run in and get what they needed. A gallon of milk. A bag of Red Delicious apples. Four bananas. A Three Musketeers candy bar for Teddy and an Almond Joy for Sarah. Already checked out, her hand was extended, palm upwards, to receive her change when the girl, who’d waited on her, remarked, “Did you hear about the new killings?” A sense of doom washed over her. She didn’t want to know, but had to ask, “I know about that little boy who’s missing. There have been more killings since that old couple and the factory security guard?” The girl had bobbed above-her-ears chestnut hair, a pretty face, but didn’t look older than fifteen. Now her childish face wore a mask of anxiety. There was fright in her blue eyes. Her blood, below thick skin covered with light hair, had a musky strong smell to it. “Yep. Three more. A family, father, mother and child, found dead out past Norma’s Orchard right before you get to Lesterville Bridge. The bodies were in the woods, terribly mauled, they say. Their car had smashed into a tree. It happened in that thick fog the other night.” A family. Another child.Oh, no. Norma’s Orchard wasn’t far from her house. Deep in the woods. The other night. “Who told you this?” “Well, my sister, Jackie, goes out with George Kasper, one of the deputies who were at the scene and he tells her everything. Can’t keep a secret. Then she tells me everything.” A sly grin. “Nobody can keep a secret in Summer Haven. You know that.” Oh, how well she knew that. “The police have any idea what happened? Was it the accident?” “No. They were beaten to death. Accident happened during or after. Police aren’t sure.” “They know who might have done it?” Jenny kept her face emotionless. Not easy. She’d had a black out the night of the heavy fog, too. Not a long one, but still. Enough to put fear in her heart. And there was that strange stalker of hers. The one she’d recently not forgotten. “Just like the others, they probably don’t know squat. Chief Donald won’t talk about it and he’s warned his deputies to keep their mouths shut, too. George will be in so much trouble if the Chief finds out he’s blabbed.” “Why so close-mouthed? Shouldn’t we be told everything so we can protect ourselves?” “You’d think so, wouldn’t you? Chief’s doing everything strictly by the book, George says, because there’s this big city detective in town nosing around and he wants to impress him. Good an excuse as any, I suppose. But all this secrecy? It’s not natural. We’re all scared silly. As you said, people need to know what’s going on. “I’ll tell you what. I keep my dad’s shotgun close these days. And loaded. You’d be smart to do the same. But I’d like to know…what are the cops hiding?” That there are vampires in town again? “I don’t know,” Jenny replied blandly and dropped her change into her purse. She grabbed the brown paper bag, said her thank you and goodbye, and scurried out into the cloudy day. In the car’s shadows, she leaned against the steering wheel, head down, and shivered. Not from the chill which she couldn’t feel but from the knowledge she was still in a nightmare and might not come out again. She didn’t know what to do. “Oh, Jeff, where are you when I need you? What do I do now? Who’s going to protect the kids and me? How am I supposed to handle this alone?” Three more dead. A family. A child. Like Teddy and Sarah. Oh, God. All her earlier happiness at snagging a job had dulled. She sat there for a long time watching the townspeople going about their normal activities. Running from store to store. Stopping to gossip with their neighbors. Driving by with everyday thoughts on their faces. If they only knew what had come among them. Poor things. When she’d gathered her wits about her again she drove to Joey’s diner. Since it was the gossip center of the town he might know more than the checkout girl had. She was right. For the first time Joey didn’t try to force a cheeseburger down her throat. Though he commented she was getting too skinny. Too pale. “You’re changing.” He stood above her as she sat in the most private, lightless corner booth they had. “Your skin’s as white as mashed potatoes. Your eyes are weird. Black glass. You move…faster.” She tipped her head. “Got to work on that. That’s what a vampire looks and acts like, remember?” she muttered. “You feeling all right still?” It was between breakfast and lunch and the diner was practically empty. Laurie was in the back preparing the lunch specials. Joey sat down beside her. “Sure, as right as a vampire can feel among what she likes to eat.” She flashed him a full set of teeth. Now, when she wanted, she could force the tips of her fangs out. Joey stared at them and her and she was suddenly uncomfortable. Her brother’s eyes hadn’t left her once since she’d come in. Trying to see if she was still her. Looking for signs of malignancy. It made her guilt worse. She asked about the new murders. “I know about them. Chief Donald was in for breakfast when we first opened this morning. He’s a mess. Worried. They have no leads and no suspects. The mystery and the sheer brutality of the killings unnerved him and it takes a lot to unnerve that guy.” “It’s unnerved me, too.” She met her brother’s eyes and tried to hide her guilt. “You didn’t do this, Jenny. You didn’t. You’d never hurt another human being, and never a child. So stop blaming yourself. You didn’t bring this on yourself or the town.” “I wish I had your faith in my goodness.” “If need be I’ll have enough for both of us.” He lowered his voice. “Problem is, though Chief Donald wasn’t Chief when we had our little, er, war with those bloodsuckers a dozen years ago, he’s seen the similarities. He asked me about it and the murders today. My being assaulted all those years ago. About you and dad and the destruction of the old theater. I don’t think I said anything that would incriminate us but I bet he’s going to pay you a visit soon. He’s got questions.” “Oh, great. Another cop nosing around. Just what I need.” “You’ll be okay. Keep your cool when he comes to question you. Tell him as much of the truth as you can without saying we were fighting vampires or that you’re one now. You’re a writer, you have a way with words. Convince him.” “I’ll try. It’s getting harder. With all that’s happening. I’m not sure what the truth is anymore and that makes it harder to lie…about anything.” Joey put his arm around her. “It’ll be okay. We’ll figure this out. Right now I’m just as troubled about you and the kids out there at the farmhouse alone with this maniac or whatever is out there as I am for myself, Laurie and the town. “You should move back into the apartment with me and Laurie until they catch whoever or whatever is doing this.” She actually laughed. “Hey, budding vampire here. Supernatural abilities. I can take care of myself.” “Yeah, maybe you can. How about the kids? Can you watch them every second? I mean, don’t you go out sometimes at night?” He had her there. “I never go far or stay gone long. And what difference does it make where we are? We all have to work. We will all be away from the house or apartment at times. I believe they’re safer now with me at the farmhouse. I’m better equipped now more than ever to fight whoever is behind these crimes. And I’m being very careful.” “Then that’s that.” He wiped his hands on his apron, brushed his hair from his face. “I haven’t stopped searching for help for you. I’ve gotten responses to my e-mails from a couple so-called supernatural experts but so far they’re just nonsense. One guy said I was nuts. “Another one, that professor, at that prestigious college who wrote that book on vampires claimed he believed in them but not as true mystical beings with super powers, as he called them. They were people who thought they needed to drink blood. “One guy said it was a sign of mental illness. Blah, blah, blah. The closest I came to someone who sounded half sane was this writer who lives in Maine who told me the best way to kill a vampire was to shoot it with a crossbow. The arrow tipped in silver and holy water. Aim for the eyes, he told me. That goes into their brains and sort of short circuits them. Then they die and just melt away to goo. Sheesh. None of them know what they’re talking about. Sorry. I won’t give up, though, I promise.” “Thanks, Brother. I’m reading up on it, too. Like you, so far, nothing that can help me.” A couple entered the diner and sat down nearby. Joey inhaled deeply and slid out of the booth. “Duty calls. Listen, telephone me anytime, day or night, if you need me. Or you and the kids stop by here or at the apartment anytime. If you are afraid or something happens, call me. I’ll come. With my shotgun loaded, my pockets full of holy water and wooden stakes.” “Thanks, but you know none of those things work. Fire or beheading is what it takes.” “If you can get that close. I was trying to get a smile out of you.” “It didn’t work.” “I know.” He reached down and squeezed her hand before he moved away to tend to his customers. Then she got up and left.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 Jenny Driving home, she’d had to put her sunglasses and a brimmed hat on. The sun had come out and driven away the shadows. She wished she could have felt the warmth on her skin. As she passed through town her eyes caught the Halloween decorations going up everywhere. The town, as it did every year, was evolving into a quaint postcard of spooky decorations and a plague of carved pumpkins. So picturesque. The holiday two weeks away. It seemed an appropriate time of year for what her life had become. For her, she mused as she pivoted the wheel, it would be Halloween forever. So she felt right at home. At the house she put the groceries away and got her mind off what was bothering her by finishing painting her room. She’d picked a subtle shade of milk chocolate brown she liked. When she was done, after she’d cleaned up the paint stuff and herself, she returned upstairs to her room; walked to the wall of windows and studied the yard below. The leaves on the trees fringing the woods were still lush and fairly green. She missed the turning of the colors, gold, orange and crimson, that’d be common in Illinois. She’d loved autumn in the Midwest. Fall in Summer Haven was sweet, but different. The farmhouse’s yard with the trees and shrubs, though, were breathtaking anyway, like looking at an expensive calendar picture. She loved this house. This room. All the memories of her childhood it contained. Good and bad. This would forever be home to her. She’d realized since she’d moved back she’d never leave it again. She’d grow old and die here. If she could grow old or die now. Her possible immortality and the tribulations it would cause down the line were too new to be real to her, but they were beginning to sink in. In time they’d come to light and she’d face them. If nothing else, her husband’s murder taught her she could only live in the moment. Noting else was promised. She heard the school bus braking in front of the house. Her children were home. Downstairs she let them in and knew something was going on the second they streamed past her. They were giggling. Happy. They hadn’t been in a long time and it made her happy, too. “Okay, you two, what’s up?” Sarah, her cheeks flushed and a secret ready to burst out of her mouth, swung around and opened her jacket. “Can we keep it, Mommy? Please?” There nestled between the coat and her daughter’s sweatshirt was a tiny mewling kitten. Its fur, patches of it missing, was black and its eyes big and full of contentment. An ugly scab covered its nose and it was scrawny. It raked its tiny claws in the air at her and hissed, scuttled back into the warmth and safety of Sarah’s jacket. It didn’t like her. Perhaps it knew what she was. “A kitten? How did you get it home and where did it come from?” Teddy dropped his books on the couch. “She smuggled it home on the bus. It’s a sneaky cat because it stayed quiet all the way, like it knew it had to. No one suspected we had it. We found it on the sidewalk in front of the school. It’d been hiding in the bushes. Some of the kids were teasing and kicking at it. It’s a fighter. You should have seen it attacking those kids. It bit one of them. Scratched another.” She looked at the kitten again. It was so little. Just a bit of dirty fur over a few tiny bones. But, bedraggled as it was, it was precious. There was something about a kitten that tugged at people’s hearts. Most people anyway. If they could ever find a way to keep a kitten a kitten forever it’d be the most sought after pet in the world. “Yeah, and Teddy saved it. He pushed right into those kids and rescued it. Kicked them good. You should have seen them scatter. No one bothers Teddy anymore, not since he showed them what for.” Sarah beamed up at her brother. “He’s my hero.” “Ah, it was nothing,” Teddy huffed proudly as he petted the kitten’s knobby head. “Who’d hurt a little poor defenseless kitten? Those kids were so mean. I showed them.” “Listen to it purr. It loves us already. Well, except for you, Mommy. It doesn’t know you yet, that’s all.” Sarah lifted the kitten up in her hands and whirled around, then snuggled the creature tenderly in her arms. “Look, it wants to stay with us. It picked us and now it belongs to us and us to it.” Sarah looked at her pleadingly. “Can we keep it?” Ugly as it was it was cute. She loved cats. She’d had a few as a child, but not in recent years. Now that she thought on it, she’d missed not having a cat and couldn’t say no. “You sure it doesn’t belong to anyone?” “We’re sure. If it belonged to someone would it be starving? Pitiful looking? So scared of people? No.” Sarah was watching her as she cuddled the kitten. “Please?” “Okay. But you two will have to help take care of it, you hear me? Feed it. Let it out when it wants to go out. It’ll have to be trained to go outside to do its business. I won’t have a litter box in the house. They stink too much.” She could get one of those cat doors. That was an idea. If the creature lived through the night, that is. It was so emaciated she wasn’t sure it’d make it. That would hurt her children. Yet getting rid of the kitten would also hurt them. The first nights after her change she’d had to kill those animals out in the woods. She still felt guilty about it. Saving this kitten might in some small way atone for some of that. “We hear you. We’ll take good care of it,” Sarah promised and Teddy echoed her. “What do you want to name the kitten?” she asked, coming close and stroking its skinny body. She couldn’t smell blood at all. There was so little of it in the creature. “Amadeus,” Sarah proclaimed smugly. “That’s a strange name for a kitten, honey. Amadeus is an old dead composer. You sure?” “Oh, I’m sure. It just popped into my head on the way home. I think the kitten told me.” “Oh, so it talks, huh?” Jenny smiled. “Nah, I can just hear it in my mind. Amadeus is a special kitty.” Teddy twirled his finger in a series of circles by his ear. “My sister’s wacky, I always knew it.” Then he smiled, too. She hadn’t seen her children so excited by something in a long time. She enjoyed their happiness and was glad the creature had come home with them. The kitten leapt from her daughter’s arms into hers. It missed and its little claws dug into her shirt and hung on as it meowed over and over. Laughing, she took it into her hands and snuggled it. It purred loudly. Something jumped in its fur. Fleas. “It needs a bath,” she said. “First thing.” Together they took the kitten into the kitchen and gave it milk. A little leftover meat she found in the refrigerator. They made a trip to the market for flea shampoo and cat food leaving Teddy in the car to hold the cat until they returned. Jenny gave the kitten a bath, dried it and fed it again. It could barely walk and she wondered if it’d live through the night. It’d break the kids’ hearts if it died now. Even she was getting attached to it. The evening was about the cat. Talking about it. Petting it. Trying to decide whether it was male or female. It was too little and none of them could tell, so they just called it an it when they didn’t use its name. After supper they made a bed in the kitchen but the cat ended up sleeping with Sarah. Somehow its tiny legs made it up the steps and next thing Jenny knew it’d found her daughter’s room and bed and crawled up into it. When she went to check on Sarah later, the kitten was there sleeping peacefully beside her daughter’s neck. She left it there. Later as Jenny watched television trying to get up the courage to go out and hunt, her mind heavy with her own problems, the kitten appeared out of nowhere and scrambled into her lap. It ran up her robe onto her shoulder and rested against her neck where it purred so loudly she ended up forgetting everything and laughing softly. It had adopted all of them. Even her. “Hey, cat, you got it wrong. I’m a vampire, not a witch,” she told it. For an answer it licked her neck and promptly fell asleep. “You’re a sweetheart, Amadeus.” The cat didn’t wake up but flexed its claws against her cold skin as if it’d heard her. “Ah, not afraid of me, huh? If you knew what I was you would be. “Or do you know?” The kitten moved in its sleep and a strange trilling sound came from its throat. She’d never heard a cat make sounds like that. As if it was talking to her. She stroked its now soft fur. “I hope you make it, Amadeus, I really do. I think I could like having you around. And you make my children happy.” She remained with the kitten on her shoulder for a time, thinking. Afterward she placed the tiny fur ball, asleep, in its bed in the kitchen and slipped out the back door. She’d put off going out to hunt for as long as she could. The hunger had flared up and she couldn’t fight it any longer. The night, for once, was clear. No wind or fog. A quarter moon lit her way as she glided through the yard and into the woods. She was cautious, a memory haunted her that there was a man in the woods she should be afraid of, she should avoid. It was odd having the memory but not recalling what the man looked like or what he’d done to her. Odd that she knew the memory of the man fought to escape her and, so far, by will alone, she’d retained it. As if something or someone was trying to erase it. So she hunted swiftly, keeping her ears and eyes open for intruders. In the last few days she’d felt more changes coming over her. An owl hooted far away, miles perhaps, deep in some tree and she could hear it. She could run at a speed faster than any human and she could see in the dark, and further, as if it were day. When she caught the deer, at first it struggled, and she sent comforting thoughts so it calmed. Standing still, it let her drink. She was gentle with it and was sure under her spell it didn’t feel anything. She released the animal and it stumbled into the bushes and sprinted away. She hadn’t hurt it. Much. Only borrowed some of its blood. Oh yeah, she could handle this vampire thing. Live a life without taking lives. Control it. Easy. She loped through the woods, thrilling at the strength in her body, the sheer joy of being free in the night, the deer’s warm blood giving her a sense of euphoria the like of which she’d rarely had in her other life. She now understood how vampires grew to love their strange existence. Her night run was exhilarating. The blood tasted had been liquid chocolate and went down like the finest champagne. Who needed meat and potatoes? She stopped, her ears taking in the song of the night. In the heart of the woods, miles away, a coyote howled. Closer, a horse neighed. Stamped its hooves. Whinnied. That sounds like dad’s old horse, Black Beauty. Impossible. Black Beauty’s dead. Both horses are dead. They died years ago in the field behind the farmhouse. Slaughtered by the theater vampires as revenge, a warning, against her and Jeff’s interference. Hooves galloped somewhere in the distance. There was a flurry of snorting and pawing. They came closer, louder, and then began to move away, diminish. A familiar whinny floated on the air and was echoed by another. Her lips curved into a smile. It was Black Beauty and Lightning. Even after all this time she’d recognized their distinctive neighs. She ran in their direction. The yearning, a bittersweet reminder of the past and the people and things she’d lost, to see them again so strong she couldn’t stop. When she stumbled out of the trees into a clearing the moon showed her two ghostly horses, one darker in the shadows than the other, galloping on the far end in the moonlight. They slowed and floated to a halt; the darker one, young again, turned its majestic head and tossed its flowing mane, pawed the ground, and stared right at her. Black Beauty. It was really him. But not. She could see through the horse. The same with the other one, Lightning. Ghosts. “Hey, boy,” she shouted out to the animal. “Black Beauty, come here, boy.” The horse stopped, looked at her; reared. Its whinny was gentle horse laughter. She went towards it but, with its companion, it spun on transparent hooves and jumped into thin air. Both vanished as if they’d never been there. Damn, was seeing and hearing ghost animals another one of her new abilities? Was she going to be able to see other kinds of spirits as well? Please, not human ghosts. She couldn’t take that. She had way too many dead people in her past. Some had loved, some had hated her and some she was responsible for their demise. No way she wanted to see any of them, as much as her heart said she would; her good sense said she wouldn’t. What kind of a damn vampire was she anyway? The idea of living in a world where dead people, even those she’d loved, could just show up, upset her nearly as much as being a creature of the night. There had to be a division between life and death or she feared for the last shred of her sanity. Perhaps the ghost horses had just been in her mind? Something she’d wanted so badly she’d wished them into being. After all, she had a vivid imagination; she’d been under great stress. In the place where she’d once loved and known them, perhaps she’d imagined her father’s horses prancing around. That was it. Simple. All in her mind. The moon had inched downwards in the sky as she turned and headed towards the farmhouse. It was time to return home to her children. Awareness of the shadows stalking her, an encircling noose of entrapment, began once she entered the woods. She’d let her guard down again. So foolish of her. Before she could run, the shadows were on her. A steely hand grabbed one arm, another clamped around the other. Her instincts warned she was in real danger. These were her kind but not like her. There was this stench of malevolence around them. Strong as smoke. Don’t let them capture you. You must get away. “Ah,” a voice spoke near her ear, “you are strong. Zebulon said you were. I didn’t believe him. It’s beyond me how you’ve come to be what you are. It’s extraordinarily rare you didn’t die and then became one of us. You’ll come with us. Now.” “Who are you?” she demanded, not struggling to escape. Be smart. Wait for a chance. Think of Teddy and Sarah. You must protect them. “I go by Dante. And you?” She refused to answer. “Can’t you read my mind?” He didn’t answer for a minute. Then he replied, “It doesn’t matter. All you need to know is you belong to us. We’ll decide what to do with you. Come along.” “And if I don’t come along as you so nicely put it?” “Then,” his laugh was somehow sinister, “we’ll have no further use for you. You’ll die here and now. I’m stronger than you. We’re all stronger than you.” As afraid as she was, the words slipped out, “Did you kill my husband?” “Your husband?” As if he didn’t know what she was talking about. “Jeff Sanders. We were attacked in St. Louis beneath a bridge late one night the end of August. He died. I lived. Something, a cloud of shadows, swept in and out and left him dead.” The vampire didn’t respond at first as if he were mulling it over. “Well, did you?” “Most likely. We dispatch so many of you. You’re our nourishment. We travel all over your world.” He snapped his fingers and the crack ricocheted around them. “You can’t expect me to recall every last pitiful one and where.” The heartlessness in his voice made her instantly loathe him, as his grip tightened. “How did you find me?” “What you are called to us once your change was complete. It’s the way we knew you existed. Distance doesn’t matter.” “Are you…am I…a vampire?” “A vampire?” “A vampire,” she hissed. Another disgusted laugh. “Vampire? That’s what your kind think we are, except we’re so much more. We’re from another…place.” His free hand waved in front of her face. “A vampire is a creature you humans made up. We’re not dead or undead, nor one of your devil’s disciples or any of those ridiculous things. One day we’ll rule this planet and all you cattle on it. “I’ll give you a choice. You join us or not. It matters little to me either way. We just can’t have you out in the world running free. Alerting people to our existence before we’re ready for that to happen. It puts us in danger. If you’re not with us, you’re our enemy–and our enemies we do not allow to live.” She didn’t want to join him. Them. She wanted to scratch his eyes out and break his neck. Jeff had been more than this monster’s nourishment; his death more than a consumed Happy Meal to her, to Teddy and Sarah. Damn if she was going with them! The rage, fear and loss of the last month boiled over inside her and ignoring the words and warnings, she tore from their grasp and fled. Her body, lifting from the ground, moved faster than the wind through the night trees. Behind her she heard their curses and pursuit. She thought of the farmhouse, longing for the safety of its walls, and suddenly she was there in her kitchen. Her enemies left behind somewhere in the woods. She got away this time. How? Could they track her? Find her? She didn’t know. She held her breath, listening, for what felt like an eternity. Nothing. After a while she thought she might be safe. No one had followed her. She consciously cloaked her thoughts, her very being, and shutting her eyes, leaned against the wall so she wouldn’t sink to the floor. At night, she left on a nightlight above the sink so the kitchen was dim with shadows. They moved and terrified her. Making her believe for a heart-stopping moment that the vampire and his gang knew where she and her children lived; had found her. Her eyes stared through the window and outside. She listened. No one was in the kitchen. There was no one outside. The night, the yard, was empty. Her body began to shake and she collapsed into a chair. They mustn’t find her. If they did her children and she were dead. As if things couldn’t have gotten any worse, with her metamorphosis and all, they had. She slumped, head bent, hand across her eyes. No tears came, but the hopelessness did, sucking away part of her soul. If she still had a soul? Did whatever she was now have a soul? She didn’t know. It was merely another brick to weigh her down. Something tiny and furry bounced across the floor and launched itself into her lap, meowing the whole way, announcing its entrance. Amadeus climbed up her blue jeans and sweatshirt. As if it was hugging her, its paws slid around her neck and its tongue licked her face. A paw tickled her cheek. Its purr was louder than anything else in the night and helped to dampen her panic. And made her smile. “You don’t care that I’m a vampire or whatever the hell I am, do you, fur ball?” she groaned softly. “Or that other weird life forms–cause I don’t really know what they are, either–are chasing me and want to kill me? You just want me to feed you. Give you a dry and warm place to sleep. Love you.” It gave out a run of nearly human-sounding meows as it talked to her. “Yeah, you got it. You’ve already wrapped me around your little paws.” She stroked its skinny body. “And, for me, being hunted is a real drag. I’m going to have to be so damn careful from now on. As if I don’t have enough to worry about.” She sighed, watching out the window nearest her. “Though, you know, it’s kind of amazing being able to go anywhere speed-of-light or whisk myself from one place to another. Oh, and I feel great. I don’t get tired or feel sick. My bad ear doesn’t give me any pain anymore, or those two teeth because I think my cavities are gone. Poof. I don’t feel hot or cold. I sort of miss that, though. I liked feeling the chilly air or warm sun on my skin. Least I can still smell things. Hear things. Super human well, in fact.” She tilted her head. Nothing was outside. No one was coming for her. She’d hear it. They were safe for now. This time anyway. The kitten produced another string of inflective meows. She gathered it into her arms and stood up. The room didn’t spin. The cat went back into its bed next to the stove. It circled the towel she’d tucked in the box and lay down. One or two more faint meows and it closed its eyes and grew still. “You’re going to be a good kitty, aren’t you? None of this keeping us up all night making noise or pouncing on us?” she asked. She’d had a cat once that played all night, would jump on her head in the wee hours and wake her up. Used to scare the heck out of her. Always thought it was a burglar or something. The kitten didn’t answer. Not one whimper. It was asleep. She would have loved to shut her eyes but was afraid to. She’d discovered if she got at least four hours sleep, her strengths were renewed; otherwise she wasn’t at her peak. But what would she do if those killers found her? She’d stay up the whole night if she had to, to guard her children, her home. Yet after half the night of anxious waiting and watching her mind grew fuzzy. This time so she wouldn’t forget what had happened she wrote a detailed note to herself, about the vampire who’d captured her and what he’d said, and put it in the top drawer of her dresser, someplace she’d find it and read it. Often. Around three in the morning she succumbed to exhaustion and slept fitfully in the living room chair. When she opened her eyes, it was morning. A new day. She rubbed her face, cleaned the sleep from her eyes, and looked around. The sun shone across the carpeting. Upstairs, Teddy was yelling at Sarah about something, as they were getting ready for school. And she remembered something bad had ensued the night before in the woods. She shook her head, stretched, her mind fighting to recall what it was. She finally seized a vague memory of really tall men surrounding her in the forest; of escaping them, of extreme danger to her and the kids. Yet she wasn’t too concerned. It all seemed like a dream. Could be it had been. It was only after the children had caught the bus, when she went into her drawer for underwear, that she saw the note with her name on it in her own handwriting. Confused, she read it, and everything she needed to know flooded back, along with the terror. It hadn’t been a dream, it’d been real. An hour later, showered and dressed, wearing a lightweight jacket, cap and sunglasses; after making sure there was no one lurking around the house, she drove to the diner to see her brother. He needed to know what had happened so he could help her understand, cope. Then again, she craved company. The note had scared her that much. In the car she scrutinized images in the rearview mirror; examined the scenery as it passed. No one seemed to be following her. Not right now anyway.",

      "content": "Chapter 13 Jenny The diner was busy. Breakfast hours. She wove her way through the crowd towards an empty shadowed booth, catching snatches of conversation on the way. –That poor family. All three found dead in their car. Police won’t release how they were killed, don’t understand why. I do know one was a child, only twelve. So terrible. –Chief Donald says there are no suspects. Again. Damn, what’s going on in this town? –I’m terrified. Got my family reporting in every two hours. Staying away from those woods. Most of the bodies have been found there. –You know, these murders we’ve been having lately? Reminds me of those we had back about a decade or so ago. People disappeared then, too. Some of them were found dead later. It was about the time the Old Grand Theater burned down, remember? –I’m scared silly to even go out these days. Never at night. I wish they’d catch this serial killer. What are the police hiding anyway? She didn’t want to eavesdrop but couldn’t avoid it. Her ears were too sharp. Everyone was gossiping about the murders; trying to make sense of them. Big news in a little town. Sliding into the booth, she waited for Joey to notice her. She took off her dark glasses and studied the people around her. Chief Donald sat on a stool at the counter drinking coffee. An empty plate in front of him. She recognized him not so much from the past as from the uniform he was wearing. He met her eyes and tipped his hat. He was coming over. “Good morning, Jenny. Remember me? We were in school together about a hundred years ago.” His smile was short lived, though. “Nice to have you back in Summer Haven. Joey said you’d moved into the farmhouse. You mind if I sit here with you for a minute or two? Catching you here this morning saves me a trip out to see you. There are some questions I’d like to ask.” “I know who you are, Chief Donald.” She also put a fake smile on her face. “And I remember you from school.” She gestured at the seat across from her. “Please sit down.” He sat down. His coffee cup had come along with him and suddenly there was Joey bustling over to refill it. The chief nodded at her brother and reached for the silver container with the milk in it. “Hey, Sis.” Joey sent her a furtive look. “Can I get you something?” “Sure, a blueberry muffin and a cup of your famous coffee.” Joey stared at her and she grinned at him. She knew what he was thinking. “Oh, that stomach trouble of yours must be better, huh?” her brother remarked. “It is. I found if I take it easy and not over eat I’m fine.” The last couple days she’d learned by experimenting she could actually eat food now. In small amounts. It was comforting to sit and eat with her children, made her feel more normal, even if most of it tasted like cardboard, and some of it still came up, though that was getting better every day, too. Now some things tasted like flavored cardboard and she only threw it up half the time. And here at the diner eating made her fit in better. “Can you put butter on that muffin for me?” “Sure.” He had an empty cup in his other hand and putting it down in front of her, filled it. “I’ll see you soon as Chief Donald and I get done catching up,” she informed Joey. “I’ve got something to tell you.” Joey nodded understandingly. “I’ll be here.” He went behind the counter, grabbed a muffin and two pats of butter and with a flourish set them before her. With his lopsided grin he went to refill someone else’s empty cup. “So what can I do for you, Chief Donald?” Her brother had been right. The man had changed. There wasn’t a trace of the old roly-poly kid, the practical joker, they’d known in high school. If anything, he was humorless, gaunt, now. His hair prematurely going white and thin. His eyes were much older than his years. Then again a lot had happened in the last few weeks. Vile homicides could prematurely age a person. She never would have recognized him if she’d seen him, out of uniform, on the street. “Call me Rusty. After all we were friends once, I thought. You know me. Don’t let the badge throw you.” Under the circumstances, the badge intimidated the hell out of her. “Okay, Rusty, old friend, what can I do for you?” “I imagine you know about the random killings Summer Haven’s been in the midst of?” “I do. It’s awful. Joey’s kept me updated. This diner is the gossip center of town.” “Isn’t it, though?” He took a swig of his coffee and reclined in the booth. “The reason I wanted to see you was these murders, I feel, are similar to the ones that occurred about twelve years ago. I wasn’t an officer here yet, but I recall you were living in town at the time. If you remember anything about them, I thought you might fill me in.” “I was living here, after my divorce, and was working with my dad. Fixing up houses.” “I recollect that. I remember seeing you and your dad driving around town in that beat-up old truck of his. Saw you both working once on the outside of that old theater. Painting the Winchester’s house. Anyway, I looked up the old records and saw you and your brother Joey had been questioned over some incidents that transpired during that time.” His look was direct, his lined face serious. “Joey was assaulted by someone who was never caught, correct? He nearly died?” “Yes.” She remained calm, as she buttered the muffin. “And you and Jeff–I knew him, too, and I’m sorry for your loss–were the ones who called in the fire at the old Grand Theater; you two were there when it happened? Didn’t see anything, though. I got that right?” “Right.” She fidgeted in her seat. She hated refreshing the old memories. Too painful. Too close to the truth. “You know dead bodies were found in the theater’s basement in the ruins after the fire? Bodies that were included in the closed police reports but never reported in the newspapers. I find that more than strange, don’t you?” Oh, oh. “How did you know that?” “I told you, the classified reports. I read them. All of them. Every word. And I made some correlations to what’s going on now.” She had to give him credit. He was nothing if not thorough. “Yes, there were dead bodies found in the theater. If you’re asking me if I know anything about them, who they were or how they got there…I don’t,” she fibbed. “Jeff and I were lucky to escape from that fire, we told the officers at the time. We’d been working on the place, fixing it up, right before. To this day, I don’t know what started it or anything else about it. Sorry.” “You were miraculously lucky to get out alive.” He was waiting for her to say something more but she knew when it was time to keep her mouth shut and this was it. “So, there’s nothing else you can give me that might clear things up a little?” “I don’t know anything else about those old murders. Like most people in town I heard about them, were troubled over them, at the time, but other than that nothing.” She shrugged. “With my divorce, Dad and Mom’s estrangement and Joey’s attack, I had my own problems.” He looked at her, his left eyebrow rising slightly. She had the feeling he suspected she wasn’t telling the truth. A human lie detector. “That’s a shame. I was really hoping you’d be able to help me out. “These new murders,” he shook his head, his face unhappy, “are spooking me and the town something terrible. There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason.” He didn’t say, either, that their savagery disturbed him even more, but she caught the thought. Lately she could sometimes read peoples’ minds, especially when they were upset or scared. Chief Donald was scared. “Like I said, I can’t help you. I’m sorry.” Jenny caught Joey watching them from behind the counter, an anxious frown tugging down his face. She sent him a small smile. It’s okay. I’m handling it. Stop fretting. “Hmm. You know there’s this detective from St. Louis investigating these murders, too? Been here for days now. Hanging around. Poking his big city nose into everything. Says they remind him of some killings St. Louis has been having the last five or six years. Same MO. He says he knows you.” “He does. Detective Bradley. Nice man. He was the officer looking into that mugging on my husband and me in St. Louis. The one Jeff died during.” She didn’t have to tell the Chief about what she was referring to. Joey had filled him in. “Sorry about that. Jeff was a good man.” Chief Donald’s eyes reflected the appropriate sympathy. She nodded and continued. “The detective questioned me a few times while I was in the hospital.” “Don’t you find it unusual that he followed you here and now Summer Haven is seeing the same kind of attacks? That the murders only began after you returned?” He was good, but she had the feeling the Chief was covering his true feelings. “Of course I do. But I don’t know any more than I’ve already told you.” She gave him a steady glance with just a touch of innocence as she took a bite of muffin and a sip of coffee. She sent a thought out that she was telling the truth. It worked. “But if I think of anything else that might help your investigation or learn anything I’ll be sure to call you. I promise.” He drummed his fingers on the table, his gaze broken. “Well, thanks Jenny. Been nice talking to you again. As I said, welcome back to Summer Haven.” An easy smile to show her there were no hard feelings. “You remember anything, though, give me a call.” “I will…Rusty.” She took another bite of the muffin. He got up. Pulled a couple of dollars from his wallet, walked over to her brother behind the counter and handed them over. “Great breakfast as always, Joey.” “Thanks, Chief.” Then he bustled out the door, got in his squad car and drove away. Joey was right there. “Think he believed you?” “He believed me.” Joey sat down beside her so they could speak without yelling. The diner was still crowded. The noise level had risen with a group of retirees that filled the booths around them. Joey gave the seniors a twenty-percent daily discount for breakfast. Now they moseyed in most days to socialize over their meals with their buddies and if the diner wasn’t too busy, play cards or chess on the rear tables. “If you would have gotten here twenty minutes earlier, Jenny, you would have run into that St. Louis detective as well.” “Goody. Glad I missed him. It was enough fun lying to Chief Donald, er, Rusty.” “Well, what’s happened? I can see it on your face. Something bad, huh?” “Oh, yeah. Real bad.” In a voice somewhere above a whisper but loud enough so he could hear, she told him about the ghost horses, the voices she’d begun to hear and about her run in with the vampire and his sycophants. When she was done he didn’t utter a word; stunned, he stared off into the distance. “Joey?” She touched his hand clenched on the table. “What do you think? What should I do?” He faced her. “I don’t know. I’m not going to lie. It scares the hell out of me to know there are more vampires–or whatever they’re calling themselves–back in town; that they’re hunting for you and the kids and butchering our friends and neighbors. “God, Jenny, it’s happening all over again.” And it would scare him. After what that band of vampire-wolf fiends did to him last time. Playing with him, cutting him up for sport before they drained so much blood he about died. It’d taken him years to get over it. Physically and mentally. “I’m so sorry,” she muttered. “I’ve brought them here. It’s my fault.” His anger was quick. “No, it’s not your fault. You didn’t ask for this anymore than the last time. We’re the victims here. Again. Damn, what are we, vampire magnets?” She sighed. “I don’t know.” “We just have to find a way out of it, that’s all.” “We have to find a way to fight them and win. Again.” Without Jeff. The thought revived the sorrow of losing her husband. “Get rid of them. I’m not running away from my home, my family for the second time. They’re not going to chase me off.” “Yeah, we’re going to fight them.” His expression reflected panic. “How?” Laurie was waving at Joey from the open kitchen door. “Baby, got a mess of orders in here waiting for you to come get ’em.” The doors swung shut behind her. Her brother moaned and got to his feet. “Work calls. Better get that food out before our hungry customers go looking for it.” He smiled down at her, squeezed her shoulder. “We’ll find a way out of this, Sis, I promise. “I’m waiting on this important information from that writer up east, who claims he’s had a few run-ins with vampires and a friend who had, too. He said he had some other hush-hush sources he was conferring with.” “These entities claim they’re not vampires. They’re something different.” “I know. That’s why I think this old guy might be able to help. He swears his friend’s attackers weren’t vampires either, but beings from another universe or planet or something. Kind of like alien vampires.” Jenny perked up. “Sounds right. Could be he can help.” “I’m waiting for an answer, perhaps tonight when I check my e-mails. I’ll call you.” “God, I hope he can help.” It was something, better than nothing. Joey hurried off towards the kitchen and she was scooting out of the booth, leaving the remains of her muffin and coffee, when she bumped into someone. She looked up and, recognizing him, smiled. “Andy.” “Well, just the person I wanted to see,” he voiced cheerily. “I was going to call you after breakfast.” His pleasure at seeing her was genuine, though he looked distracted as if he had other things on his mind. Handsome in a blue suit, his hair combed, his face freshly shaved, he looked like a typical successful businessman. No one would guess he had no business to go to. “Hi Andy.” She reclaimed her seat. There was nothing waiting for her at home other than more trepidation. She was done painting walls, moving furniture around, so taking a few minutes to see how her friend was doing wouldn’t hurt her. He sat down across from her and when Joey rushed by after dropping his orders on a nearby table Andy hollered for him to bring some coffee and a couple of donuts. “You know what I like.” “Sure thing,” Joey hollered back and kept going. “You look so professional,” she complimented Andy. “You must be out job hunting?” “Getting ready to hit the pavement, yep. Soon as I get my coffee, donuts and Joey’s amiable chatter fix. My morning ritual. It gives me courage to face the job hunting rat race out there.” “So no luck yet, huh?” “Not yet.” He finally smiled at her. “But, congratulations, a little birdie told me you got that job at Ace the other day.” “Name of Joey, huh?” She smiled in return. “I did. I can’t thank you enough for the lead. It’s such a relief to know I have a job and I think I’m going to like it there. The boss, Glenn, seems like a fair but easy going guy.” “He is.” “Friend of yours, too.” “He is.” Joey brought Andy’s coffee and shot her and her half eaten muffin a sly look. She shot him one right back. “Still here, huh?” “Just talking to Andy. For a bit. You know, making new friends.” “Everyone needs friends.” Joey winked at her and left. “You have any luck finding a job? Any nibbles? Anything?” she asked the man across from her in the suit. “Not a one. Nada. But I’m going out there every day to fight the good fight. Slim pickings, though.” He drank from the steaming cup. “Whoa, that brother of yours makes the best coffee.” “Don’t worry, I know someone will hire you soon. You’ve got skills and experience. Some one’s going to be lucky to get you. I’ll keep my fingers crossed.” “Thanks.” He put the cup down. “I applied for unemployment benefits yesterday. It was an eye-opening humbling experience. I know I’m not alone. I think the whole town was there. It was still weird. “A group of us jobless, about eight who hit it off, have decided we’re going to form a sort of club. We’re going to return to one of our houses each week to swig coffee, play cards and moan and groan over our horrendous job interview experiences after every report in. Trade job openings, if we find any, with each other, and network. Had the first meeting yesterday. It helped.” “Sounds like fun.” “Unfortunately, you can’t belong. You have a job.” There was no animosity in his words, he seemed happy for her. She had no idea why she did it but she did. “How about coming over for supper tonight? I promised the kids we’d make homemade pizzas. We’ll have more than enough.” “Well, thanks. I’d love to come over and mooch a free meal off of you. After all, you’re employed,” he teased, “and I’m not.” They talked about her new job, how Teddy and Sarah were fitting in at school and how the farmhouse redecorating was coming along then they said goodbye. Andy needed to get going on his job hunt. She was restless, her stomach a tad upset at the food she’d eaten, and somehow, she thought someone was watching her. “Good luck today,” she said. “See you about seven?” “Seven is perfect. Gives me time to go home and get cleaned up.” She waved at Joey, put on her sunglasses and left the diner. Peculiar emotions beset her when she strolled past the Dollar Store. Instead, she saw the Grand Theater, in all its lavish old-fashioned beauty, the way she’d known it as a child. From inside came that melancholy cry of a haunting violin, weeping on the breeze. I’ve heard that song before. Played that way. Years ago. By a vampire, head of the undead family that had resided there; who Jeff and I later destroyed. In a bewildered trance, she walked to the front door and through it as if it’d been made of mist or memories. Into the lobby of the Grand. Inside she slowly swiveled around in a circle, dizzy, her eyes wide. The lobby appeared as it had that last night. Beautifully restored to its earlier glory. Ready for its audience. The lights twinkled softly; the carpets were plush and the hand-fashioned woodwork, smelling of polish, shone. The sweet scent of popcorn and butter, cheese and nachos hovered in the air. The glass case was full of candy boxes. Boston Baked Beans, Jujubes and chocolate covered raisins. Those flat little chocolate pills with the tiny white candy dots on top. The carpet-covered stairs curved to the balcony and for a moment she was sure she saw the vampires who’d once lived there. The five of them. Peering back at her with angry eyes, except for the one who’d pretended to be their father. His eyes, as he played the violin resting on his shoulder, were bottomless and sad. The music rose to a crescendo and filled her head. The world. He smiled, disappearing with the others into the smoke. She stumbled out of the theater. Her memories had revived the remorse. That’s why she was seeing ghosts. But Jeff and she had only done what they’d had to do. The vampires had been feeding on the townspeople. Just like now. She grabbed the door handle. The theater vanished and she was running out of the Dollar Store as if ghosts were chasing her. They were. It means something. The vampire with the violin was trying to tell her something. She just didn’t know what. She’d believed he’d been her friend, or as much a friend as a vampire could be. He’d admired her. In the end, he’d saved her life, defending her against his more bloodthirsty children, and sacrificed his existence so she could live. She couldn’t get to her car and drive away fast enough. Maybe she was going insane? That’d explain it. A breakdown. Hell, why not? She’d been through a lot the last few months. On the way home, she stopped by the grocery and bought the ingredients for the pizzas; stopped by the library and picked up the books Mrs. Willard had gotten in for her. Maybe one of them would provide the answer to what was happening to her and a way to fight the beings stalking her. She could hope, couldn’t she? *** They’d eaten the last slice of pizza and were at the table playing Scrabble, when Jenny heard the horses outside snorting and pawing. She’d eaten a bite or two herself and had been encouraged when it’d actually didn’t taste too bad. She got up under the pretext of getting more snacks and looked out the window into the night. The moon was a radiant round ball showing only yard and trees. Horses whinnied. There was nothing there but shadows. Discomfort inched across her skin. What did Black Beauty want with her? Was he trying to warn her of something, too? “Something wrong?” Andy asked as she placed a bowl of grapes on the table and sat down. The kitten was climbing up her chair trying to get to her. It’d spent the evening jumping on one or another of them, licking their faces or snuggling into their laps. It wasn’t satisfied unless it was being held. “No. Just thought I heard something outside.” She wasn’t sure if it’d help but in her mind she’d been envisioning a sort of cloak of invisibility around her, her children and her house to hide them from the vampires. She prayed it was working. “Oh.” Sarah cheered when she formed an eight-letter word with triple points. Teddy wasn’t as into it as the girls. The words he chose were adequate but short. Eventually Andy threw up his hands in surrender. “You guys, little witch and big witch, are too good for me.” He winked at Sarah and Jenny. “I’ve had enough. For tonight anyway.” “We’ve all had enough,” Jenny said. “Besides it’s the kid’s bedtime. School tomorrow.” There was a chorus of half-hearted dissent but it dwindled away as soon as Jenny gave them the mom look. “You know nine o’clock is lights out and it’s fifteen minutes to. Just enough time to get ready for bed, kiddos.” Teddy went upstairs without another word; lately he was always ready to sleep, but Sarah hung on her arm, bantering with Andy about the new Pink CD that she was crazy to have and how far she’d gotten in the new Twilight novel she’d borrowed from a friend at school. “Okay, missy, you’ve stalled enough, it’s time for bed.” With a yawn, Sarah did as she was told. When both children were tucked in Jenny returned to the living room. “For her age, your daughter’s quite the reader.” He was slouched on the sofa, arms stretched up along the edge, looking weary. The kitten was up there, too, swatting its tiny paws at Andy’s wiggling fingers; talking to him, making its funny meow sounds. Jenny could have sworn it was saying, Andy, let me on your shoulder. At least Andy was smiling. He’d spent the day being turned down for jobs. It’d depressed him. “I miss my old job. I get up in the morning and it feels strange not having one to go to. My life feels disrupted. I have no sense of purpose anymore.” She’d spent the night cheering him up. At least it’d kept her mind off her own problems. “You’re a good mother, Jenny,” he said when she reentered the room. “I don’t know how you’ve done it with all that’s happened to you. I just wanted to tell you that.” “The easiest thing I’ve ever done is be a mother. I love my kids. They’re my life.” When she repositioned herself on the couch beside him she was sure not to sit too close. She hadn’t hunted yet. “You look tired, Andy.” The kitten was biting his fingers, snarling. All five ounces of it. “I am. You’d think looking for a job wouldn’t be as tiring as working an eight-hour day, but it’s more.” “Don’t worry, you’ll find something soon. I know you will.” “Well, when I start feeling sorry for myself, I think of you, how brave you’ve been, how cheerful you always are and suddenly I have to feel better. Tell myself things aren’t that bad.” His hand reached out and lightly touched her cheek. She didn’t move. “You know I’m falling in love with you, don’t you?” he whispered. “In a way, I think, I’ve loved you since high school. Only Jeff beat me to it.” “I was afraid of that,” she replied under her breath. An image of Jeff’s loving face hovered in her memory and stabbed her heart like a thorn. “What?” Her smile was sad. “Don’t do this, Andy. Please? It’s too soon.” He had no idea what she was. Any romantic involvement would be impossible, even if she hadn’t just lost her husband. And especially not with those vampires from another place stalking her. He pulled away. “I know. I’m sorry. Couldn’t stop myself.” He surprised her and gave her an apologetic smile. “But the cat’s out of the bag, can’t put it back. Now you know. And I’m glad.” His eyes were earnest, his feelings transparent. He was a good man. The kids liked him. She didn’t want to lose him as a friend and confidant. She just wished he’d kept his romantic feelings to himself. “And I’m flattered, but can we just be friends for now? See what happens down the road?” Stall. Stall. Better than hurting his feelings when he was down and out. “Sure. Friends. If you need time, I have time. I’m a very patient man.” “It’s time to go home, Andy.” He stood and stretched. Gave her one last grin. “It was a great evening being with you and the kids. Supper was delicious. Even if the cat landed in the middle and nibbled on it before we did. The games were fun. I had a good time. Can we do it again?” “We’ll do it again.” “Soon?” “Soon.” “I hope so. Can I call you sometime tomorrow?” She nodded, walked with him to the door and before she could say anything else he leaned over and laid a kiss on her cheek then fled out into the night. “Good night, Andy,” she called out behind him and thought she saw him wave at her before he got in his car. She closed the door. When she was sure he was gone she went out the back. Her hunt that night was brief and close to home. Deer wandered into the neighborhood all the time and she found one quickly in the field behind the farmhouse. She went nowhere near the deep woods where she’d hunted before and run into the vampires. She couldn’t take the chance they’d find her again. Or, worse, follow her home. She was in bed an hour later. There was so much to do the next two days, because after the weekend her new job started. It’d been a long time since she’d worked for anyone but her husband. So it was going to be interesting. She hoped she remembered how to be a working person. When she was half asleep she felt the kitten’s furry body wiggle under the covers. It’d found its way through the dark house and gotten up the stairs. Spunky little thing. The cat purred as her fingers caressed its back and, like her, finally found asleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 14 Kyle, David and Abby Kyle agreed to meet David and Abby after school at their special place, in the woods beneath the old weeping willow by the creek. It was between their three houses and an easy gathering spot. Then maybe, if they had enough money, they’d go to Joey’s Diner, scoff up some cheeseburgers and onion rings for supper and hang out before going home to do homework and spending time with their families. Kyle had to be home by dark. He didn’t like being told what to do. Heck, he was practically fifteen but his parents, controlling adults that they were, were all worked up over the murders and wanted him locked behind their doors before night came. Stupid grownups. Nothing was going to get him. He was too fast and could run like a cheetah. Too tall. Too strong. He could take care of himself. He’d be with his friends. David was even taller than he was. Why, he was Summer Haven High’s best Quarterback and at sixteen already weighed two hundred pounds. He was a giant. Sure Abby was a little bitty thing but she was a girl, for heaven’s sake. She was on the track team, though, and could outrun all of them. He and David could protect her no problem as well as themselves. So he wasn’t scared. Not one tiny bit. He strode through the trees down an overgrown footpath, whistling and alternately singing at the top of his lungs, his ipod tucked into his ear. A storm was coming. He could smell it. Big fat mean-looking clouds had rushed in and filled up the sky. The light had run away. It could be nighttime already it was so dark. Made it hard to see the trail. But he’d grown up here and knew the woods like his own back yard. He’d been playing in them since he’d been a kid. Still he had trouble finding the willow tree. Then the bloodcurdling screams led him right to it. He could hear them through the music and yanked out his earplugs. Someone–sounded like Abby–was screaming their head off. Not far away. Scared as hell. He’d never heard her cry like that and he’d known her since they were in kindergarten. She was a plucky girl. Something was really wrong. He began to run, bumping into thin trees he could hardly see and tripping over clumps of dirt and bushes. He should have brought his pen-sized flashlight, which he usually carried in his pocket, but he hadn’t planned on the storm coming in so quickly. The screams had stopped. He ran faster, squinting in the grayish light. The sudden silence was almost worse than the shrieking. The clouds above him opened up and a ray of sun escaped through. Just enough light so when he arrived at the rendezvous place he saw all he needed to see and more than he wanted to. He hid behind a tree and rubbed his eyes twice thinking he wasn’t seeing what he was seeing. But he was. David was lying on the ground in an unnatural position. His limbs twisted and spread out like a broken chicken. Unmoving. Kyle thought he was going to throw up. He’d seen dead bodies in coffins before, his uncle’s funeral five years ago and a friend who’d died from a childhood disease last spring. David looked like them. A corpse. Oh, no. Abby was struggling with three really tall shadows–cause that’s what they looked like to him. One was asking her something. The voice, deep and eerily nothing much like a human voice, was loud. “She has long brown hair, brown eyes…anyone you know fits that description?” “There’re lots of women in town like that.” Kyle could hear the terror in Abby’s words. The shadows had mutated into huge men in leathery-looking clothes. They moved faster than ordinary humans should. Reminded him of those weird stop-go special effects he’d seen in movies and on television. This wasn’t The Vampire Diaries, though, this was real. Kyle’s brain was telling him one thing but his eyes were reflecting another. They weren’t human. “She’d be new to town. Her husband would have recently died. Do you know her?” Abby let out a cry of pain as she was lifted off her feet. Kyle would have launched himself from hiding to wrestle her attackers but he was a clever boy and knew he’d never be able to defeat all three. He had to get help. But he couldn’t leave Abby. Alone. In danger. Oh God, what was he going to do? Between sobs Abby sputtered, “There…is someone…new in town. A woman. Don’t know her name but…I heard my mom, who went to school with her, say she lives out in that old farmhouse that’s been empty for years. On Suncrest Road going west out of town. She has two kids. That’s all I know. I swear. “Now please let me go. You promised you’d let me go!” One of the shadows laughed. Kyle had seen enough horror movies to recognize a demon’s laugh. Abby’s scream was cut off. He wanted to shout out at them to leave her alone, rocket from his hiding place and slug them good for what they’d done to his friends. Instead, he covered his mouth with his hands and fought the urge to run away like a scared baby or throw up. Abby’s limp body dropped to the ground beside David’s. They’d killed both of his friends. His anger raged inside him, but he was too terrified, too smart, to know he could fight them and win. He couldn’t. He’d be lucky to get away with his own skin. He’d come to the conclusion the three weren’t really men. Something about the way they moved, the unearthly speed and the sound of their voices. They hovered and bent silently over his friends’ bodies, taking turns doing something to them he couldn’t see. They were ghouls. They were the killers the police were searching for. He’d caught them in the middle of their newest crime. If he’d arrived minutes sooner he would have been with his friends and he’d be dead as a fence post, too, lying on the ground by Abby and David. Who the hell were those creeps? Why had they killed his friends? He was holding his breath. So afraid they’d hear him. See him. Smell him. He had to get away without them being aware he was there or he’d be a goner. Somehow he knew that if he knew nothing else. His body trembled. His teeth chattered and he clamped down until his jaw hurt. Shhh. Be quiet. Be still. Wait it out. He didn’t want to die. If they could move as fast as warp drive he wouldn’t stand a chance running for it. He had to stay hidden until they were gone. They were talking silently now. He could tell by the way they behaved. Communicating without words. Looking around. He jerked back behind the tree. Squeezed his body as thin and compact as he could. Quieted his thoughts in case they could read minds. Well, hey, some demons could read minds. Some aliens, too. In the movies they usually could. Better safe than sorry. He wanted so badly to yank out his cell phone and call 911. Or his mom. Someone. But they’d hear him. Not a smart move. He snuck a quick look around the tree. The strange men were gone. Only Abby and David’s bodies were still there. So he hadn’t imagined it. It’d really happened. Kyle waited a long time, plastered up against the trunk, before he ventured out and knelt down by his friends. Touched them with shaking fingers. Tried to wake them. They were dead all right. Their flesh was cold, their faces frozen in masks of mutilated flesh. There were bite wounds above the terrible slashes that seemed to go almost all the way through their necks. Deep gashes on their face and arms. Awful, awful, awful. He cried as the first drops of rain and then the downpour came and soaked him. Lightning lit up everything. The tree. The bodies. Him. He couldn’t take the chance the demons, aliens or whatever the hell they were, were still around somewhere and would see him, or he’d stagger into them somewhere else in the woods. He was afraid to run, but he was more afraid not to. Hours must have gone by–well, maybe fifteen-twenty minutes at least–before he moved. His body shivered from the rain and what he’d seen. His fingers and face were cold. Finally screwing up the courage, staring around one last time, he took out his cell phone and called his mother. She’d know what to do. At first the phone wouldn’t work. Maybe it was the storm. He tried again. Got up and started hiking in the direction of town. The fifth time he keyed in his mom’s number it went through. The connection wasn’t good but she got the point something terrible had happened. She told him to go to Joey’s Diner, it was closer, and wait for her and the police there. So he did.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 Jenny Jenny was working her shift at the hardware store when Joey called her on her cell. It was her fourth day. Norm Johnson had purchased thirty dollars’ worth of stuff and had limped out the door. He had to be at least eighty, still fixing his own leaky water faucets, and he’d known her dad and her from way back. One summer years ago they’d painted his house. Interior. All white. People knowing her and her family or her knowing them had turned out to be one of the blessings and one of the curses of the job. She waited on old acquaintances, neighbors or friends from her childhood or the years she’d lived in town with Jeff. When she put on the Ace Hardware apron and stepped behind the counter she found she enjoyed doing the job. She got along with Shelly, who was a little scatterbrained at times but sweet and helpful. It didn’t take long for Jenny to learn the computer system or how to do price checks. Stock the shelves. Dealing with the people was somewhat harder, when she was hungry preferring to drink their blood way more than sell them hammers or boxes of nails, but it was good practice. If she wanted to live an ordinary life she’d have to have people in it. Her boss treated her like a slumming celebrity, but he was glad to have a dependable, quick learner and he made her feel welcome. He had a sense of humor. With his benign but hokey jokes and Shelly’s good nature there was laughter around the store. Working in the world again, belonging somewhere, felt good even if it was a simple job like cashier. It lessened her loneliness. She got a discount, which would come in handy because there was work left to do on the farmhouse. The hours were perfect. She left every morning after her children got on the bus and was home before or sometimes soon after they got off. And she hadn’t bit any of her customers; not that she hadn’t had the urge, especially with the overly chatty or rude ones, but she’d refrained. A real source of pride. She was amazed every day she was holding down a normal job, juggling her kids and her blood hunger. Living life as if she weren’t a monster. It was almost too easy. She kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. If only the problem with those bloodthirsty vampire/beings and the killings would go away. She kept the note she’d written to remind herself of the threat they posed but no longer forgot they were searching for her. Her mind had become so much sharper. Her powers having grown to the point she wondered when they’d stop and what she’d eventually end up as. She was as careful as she could not to call attention to herself but yet live her life; do what she had to do to support and love her family. She and Joey searched for answers where and when they could. So far nothing had come of it. No one really believed in vampires and if they did they were as nutty as almonds. Even the writer from Maine hadn’t come through for them. And when Joey made the mistake of declaring vampires were real, the man stopped answering his e-mails. Another benefit of her job was it was the second best spot in town for gossip. So she wasn’t surprised Thursday afternoon after work, as she was walking towards the exit, that she overheard a customer outside telling Glen there was a ruckus over at Joey’s Diner. “There’s been another murder. Two,” said a young man she didn’t recognize in a UPS uniform. He had a handful of packages and a bundle of mail. Crew-cut short hair and a wisp of a mustache. “Two young people from town. I don’t know who they are. They aren’t releasing the names yet, but this time there’s a witness. I was at Joey’s delivering mail when the only survivor, another teenager, staggered in. The kid was a wreck. Blathering on about super tall people in the woods who moved like ghosts. Poor kid’s obviously off his rocker. Shock, I guess.” Jenny paused outside the door. She could hear through glass and brick walls. “Who’s the witness?” her boss asked. “Boy called Kyle Richards. Sixteen or so. He’s at the diner now talking with the police. Won’t be there long. I’m sure they’ll want him to take them to the bodies.” “This is horrible,” Glen exclaimed. “More murders. Young people. Least they have a witness. Maybe they can catch these bastards now.” She didn’t wait to hear more but high-tailed it to Joey’s. Using her super speed. Much faster than her car. *** “The kid’s already gone. Just left. He took the police to where the bodies are.” Joey was in the kitchen stirring a pot of chili. That night’s dinner special. Outside the storm had passed and the day had returned, or what was left of it. The kitchen was somewhat private, only Laurie running in and out with orders and another cook, Jason, busy across the room making the fried food, so they could talk if they kept their voices down. The dinner crowd was chattering outside the doors. Most talking about the new crime. If she wanted she could zero in on any conversation and hear it as clear as if she were out there with them. “Everyone’s scared out of their minds.” Joey glanced at her. “By dark this place will be empty. It’s been bad up until now but after these killings I might as well close up after supper for all the business we’ll do after nightfall.” “That might not be a bad idea anyway,” she remarked thoughtfully. “Did you learn anything from the boy that might help us?” “Kyle Richards, you mean?” “Yes.” “I snooped best I could when Chief Donald was questioning him. The boy was so upset they had to let him calm down before they could make any sense out of what he was saying. I gave him warm cocoa and listened.” Joey repeated what he’d overheard and Jenny, sitting on a stool out of the way, nodded. “It sounds like my nemesis and his gang all right. I wasn’t a hundred percent sure they were the ones doing the killings before but now I am. It’s them.” Her brother put the spoon on the stove by the bubbling pot and wiped his hands on his apron. He faced her. “What are we going to do?” “Try to find a way to locate and destroy them.” “And how in the hell are we going to do that? We don’t even know what they are. Really. What hurts or kills them. How can we hope to defeat them if they have all your powers and more. If there’s four of them?” His face reminded her of when they were children and he’d be afraid to go in the house because mom was on one of her irrational rampages. “I’ve contacted every paranormal expert on the Internet. When I tell them the truth, what we’re up against, what’s happened so far, they think I’m certifiable. They don’t believe me. Entities from another dimension or planet or whatever who have super powers and are as malevolent as any horror film villain? Ha. Sometimes I think I am crazy just believing in such creatures. Except, there’s the past and there’s you, so I know they exist. I know how powerful they must be. How hard they’ll be to vanquish.” “And no help in those books, either,” she said. “All things supernatural is really the thing now, except there seems to be a real difference of opinion on how to kill a fictional one as opposed to a real one.” Joey made a face. “You don’t think chopping their heads off will do it? Or burning them like you and Jeff did with those in the theater?” She nearly smiled at that. “Killing them is not so much the problem as catching them. Until now I’ve been spending all my energy on avoiding them.” “These newest murders have changed things, right?” She sighed. “Right. I kept praying they’d just go away. Leave. Doesn’t look like that’s going to happen. They’re here because of me. These murders aren’t going to stop unless someone stops them. Since no one but us know what we’re truly up against and what they’re capable of, it’s either going to be us or no one.” “Damn, why does it always have to be us?” Joey filled a bowl with chili and set it on a tray for pickup. Laurie would be in to get it. “I’ve been thinking. That St. Louis detective friend of yours was in here when the Richard’s kid was blubbering out his story. He must be working with Chief Donald. They talk together a lot. The detective knows more than he’s saying.” “I thought he left town.” “Nope. He told me he’s taking a hunk of vacation time and has been hanging around sniffing out clues since that out-of-town family was killed in the woods. Interrogating everyone. He eats here all the time. We talk. Interesting guy. We’ve become quite good friends, actually. I’ve mentioned supernatural things a few times and he seems…receptive.” “You didn’t tell him anything, did you?” “No. But I have a hunch he might believe us if I did.” “What makes you think that?” “Some of the things he’s told me. The way he reacted to some things I told him. Did you know about his daughter and how she died?” “I know. Same way Jeff died.” “Jenny, I think he knows or suspects our perps aren’t human. We could ask him for help. We’re in way over our heads.” “Ask a cop for help and tell him everything?” Joey got her meaning. “No, we don’t have to tell him about you. Just that these killers are after you, want to get rid of you, because they think you know something that could tie them to Jeff’s murder. Something like that. It could make sense. “He might know something that could help us or he might help us.” “You might be right. But I’m still not sure. We’d be taking a huge risk telling him what we know. What we’re really up against. Most people don’t, can’t, believe in vampires. Because that’s what I’m calling these things for lack of a better label. Vampires.” “Well, we can decide as we go along. Get him talking to us and see where it leads. But if nothing else he could help protect you and the kids.” That warning got through to her. Her children. They were in danger, too. “I don’t know. It’s a risk. Telling Detective Bradley what we know.” “Don’t you trust him?” In the next room the noise level rose. People were impatient, wanting to get their meals and go home. Joey was falling behind on the orders. She thought about that. “You know, I do. I think he’s a good man. An intelligent one, too.” “Then why don’t we take a chance and confide in him? As much as we can, anyway.” “We could. At the worst he’ll think we’re delusional and walk away.” “At best,” Joey said, “he might know something that would help us.” “Okay.” “If I see him tonight I’ll ask him to take a ride to your house with me and we’ll give it a try. He usually comes by every night for a late cup of coffee and a snack before he goes to his motel for the night.” “Why my house? The kids will be there.” “Your house is more private. We’ll come by later when Teddy and Sarah are asleep. Before you go out, you know, for your nightly, er, run? I’ll call you first. If Bradley doesn’t show up by eight, I’ll phone him. I have his number.” For the first time Joey looked hopeful. “Okay. Call me and hopefully I’ll see you both later tonight at the farmhouse.” The clock on the wall behind her brother caught her attention. “Right now I better go. The kids stayed over at school, helping to decorate for the Halloween party this weekend. But they’ll be home soon.” “Yep, you better go.” On her way out she said hi to Laurie and had rushed out when her sister-in-law followed her to the car, grabbed her by the arm, and halted her in her tracks. “Whoa, Jenny. You got a minute?” “Maybe a minute.” She moved away from the vehicle so she could talk in the shade of the restaurant’s awning. The sun was descending into the horizon of trees and hills but she felt better in the shadows. “The kids will be home any minute. I have to be there when they do. What’s up?” “Well, I haven’t seen much of you lately so I was wondering how things were going? How you like your new job? The kids their new school? How’s the refurbishing at the farmhouse coming. Your brother’s not real forthcoming on that sort of thing. Women’s chitchat. You know him. He talks a lot but doesn’t always say much. And I’ve been too busy tied to the diner to get out to visit you yet.” “Yeah, my brother’s not real chatty about that kind of stuff.” Guilt got the best of her. She’d neglected Laurie and couldn’t remember the last time they’d talked. Of course with what was going on being a good sister-in-law had been way low on her to-do list. So she quickly caught the other woman up. “I like the job. Glen’s a sweetheart. Discount’s great. Come on by if you need something and I can give you the family markdown. “Teddy and Sarah had a little trouble at first being the new kids at school but they’ve worked it out. The farmhouse looks like a different place. Bright and homey. I still have some work to do on it but it’s coming along nicely. You have to visit soon and see what we’ve done.” Laurie bobbed her head. “I’ll do that. I’ll make time.” “Andy has dropped by to visit a couple times. The kids like him. He’s been so kind. Hinted he was sweet on me.” “I could have told you that, Jenny. He’s had a thing for you forever.” “Or so Joey has also told me.” Jenny shook her head. “I’m a mess right now. I need friends but not a boyfriend.” “I know,” Laurie spoke quietly, patting Jenny’s hand motherly-like. “It’s too soon.” “It is.” “You doing all right, though?” “As well as can be expected.” “Time is what you need. That’s all. Time.” As she spoke Jenny noticed the impatient look in Laurie’s eyes as if she were waiting to say something else. She was right. “While I have you here, Jenny, I need to ask you something.” Jenny thought their conversation had ended and was edging towards her car but those words stopped her. “Go ahead ask away. Make it quick, the kids, you know?” Laurie appeared uneasy. She fiddled with the order pad in her hands. “Uh, you been seeing anything strange lately out at the farmhouse?” “What do you mean?” Immediately alert. The sun passed behind the clouds and the parking lot was suddenly dim. Shadows flitted in the corners of her eyes making her nervous. She had a sudden premonition something somewhere wasn’t right. Laurie hesitated, biting her lip. “Well, you know I hear a lot of stories waiting on folks here every day. I overhear things. They tell me things. And–.” “And what?” “People are seeing weird things around your house. Mostly at night when they drive by. There’s this story going around. I’ve heard it so many times now I have to ask about it.” Jenny, bracing herself, lifted her head. “Shoot.” “I know you don’t believe in ghosts and stuff but Claudia, who works for State Farm down the road here, was saying this morning over breakfast she worked late the night before and on her drive home past your place she saw all these floating lights in the dark bouncing around the farmhouse. She stopped her car and watched them.” “Floating lights? She thinks they were apparitions or something?” “She didn’t know what they were. She just said they were all around your house. At the windows. Balls of light that at times morphed into tall figures. Kinda bluish.” “How many?” “Two or three but sometimes as many as five. What with these murders and then seeing eerie glowing balls outside your windows it really scared her. Have you seen them?” “No.” Not lying. She’d seen the vampire and his friends; she’d seen ghost horses and heard unusual noises, but no, no light balls. Not yet anyway. But then anything was possible. She of all people knew that. “You say you’ve heard this story more than once?” “A bunch of times lately. It varies. Some people see these mysterious figures walking around your house, some say lights. I’d be careful. Who knows what the hell they are. Could be dangerous.” “Thanks for telling me. I’ll keep a look out.” “Have you seen anything strange around the farmhouse?” Laurie had her. Now she had to evade or fib. “Nothing but memories, that’s all.” Laurie gave her a compassionate look. “Well, I had to ask. You know me, curious as a cat. By the way, Joey told me about your new family member.” “Oh, Amadeus, our kitten?” “Yes. I’ll have to stop by and meet the little critter. I love cats.” “Although you don’t have any.” “Nah, not in the apartment. No critters allowed. When we buy our house, though, Joey said I could have as many cats as I want.” Jenny had a sudden mind picture of Laurie in a woodsy cabin with twenty cats of all sizes and colors climbing around her. “That going to be anytime soon? The new house?” Anxious to be going, Jenny had opened the car door and slid into the seat, looking up at Laurie through the open door. Tapping her fingers on the steering wheel. “We almost have enough money now. It’ll be soon. I hope. I hate living in that apartment. Too cramped.” “I would, too,” Jenny commiserated. “I need a house around me. A yard.” Jenny had a thought. “How come you and Joey didn’t move into the farmhouse?” Laurie evaded Jenny’s eyes. “Uh, I’d like a ranch style with a basement. In town. Close to the diner. You know?” Oh, Jenny knew. Laurie was afraid of the lights. A revelation. She never would have figured her sister-in-law for being afraid of such things. But apparently she was. “I better let you go, Jenny. Can’t let those kids come home to an empty house, right?” “Right. Thanks for the heads up about the spooky lights. I’ll keep my eyes and ears open. You’ve got to come over and see what we’ve done to the farmhouse.” Then remembering her sister-in-law’s busy work schedule, she tagged on, “Your next day off, come on by. You know you’re welcome anytime.” “I’ll call first.” “Good idea. That way you’ll be sure to catch me at home. Bye.” With that Jenny turned the key and pulled out of the parking slot. Her earlier premonition that something was wrong somewhere had all of a sudden grown so much stronger. The car raced down the road as twilight claimed the day. She hated how early it got dark this time of year and wished they’d get rid of daylight savings time altogether. What good was it? There were only so many hours of light and dark each day so who cared if it was an hour later or earlier by the clock? It was still the same amount of each no matter what. Moving it backward or forward an hour twice a year made no sense to her. It never had. When she drove into the driveway she knew something was wrong. The front door was wide open. Sarah’s red book bag lay abandoned on the porch steps. Jenny turned off the car and ran inside calling for her children. No replies. Silence. They should be home by now. The book bag. She rushed upstairs into their rooms. Returned to the kitchen. Checked the bathroom. The house was empty. “Sarah! Teddy! Where are you!” she cried at the top of her voice. After another race through the rooms she ran outside. Maybe they were playing in the back yard. They weren’t. Her children were gone and she knew. She just knew. The vampires had them. She heard their laughter in her head, taunting her. Come to us. Now. Or we’ll kill them. Their necks are so fragile. Their fear so pure. Their blood a delicacy we cannot forgo for long. So hurry. Out in the back yard, she screamed out their names again and plunged into the woods. They couldn’t be far away. It hadn’t been that long. If she hurried she could catch up to them. Limbs slapped her face; she tripped over fragments of dead wood, but didn’t stop. The trees were merging into the coming night’s gloom, night was nearly upon her, but still she ran. Searching. Listening. Calling for Sarah and Teddy. She’d never been so scared in her life. The violence in St. Louis had been different. She hadn’t known what had hit her. The anger, sorrow and fear of losing Jeff had come afterwards. What she was feeling now was agony. Her children were all that mattered. She had to find them. Rescue them. If it meant sacrificing her own life, she would without hesitation. And if she caught up to the vampires, then what? How could she fight them? She was just one and they were many. She didn’t care. Her children couldn’t be harmed. Faster. Faster. The vampires waited for her deep in the woods in the same place where she’d first run into Zebulon. Some invisible beacon had taken her straight to them. Beneath a maple tree Dante, Zebulon and two others stood waiting for her in the darkening forest. Sarah and Teddy were imprisoned in their arms. Sarah wept, frozen with fear. Her face white and small. Teddy was bravely kicking and shouting at his captor. So futile. Zebulon knocked the boy to his knees and, putting his foot on the child’s neck, forced him to the ground and held him there. The sight of her children in the vampires’ clutches made her so angry she wanted to rush at and beat them. In the same moment she thought: They’ll kill Teddy and Sarah. Snap their necks. It’d be so easy. If I lose my children I couldn’t bear it. So be careful. Clever. Don’t react foolishly. Sarah looked up. “Mommy, help us! Who are these men? What do they want?” Teddy, writhing on the ground, said nothing. He was still struggling. Fighting. Jenny’s rage burned white-hot, she’d never been so angry in her life, but she hid it. “Let them go.” She locked eyes with Dante. “Let them go. Right. Now.” Sarah went limp in Dante’s grip. “Who are you to give me orders? I have the power. You obey me.” “How did you find us?” “A girl we met yesterday in the woods was kind enough to tell us where you live. That you have two children. It was easy to find you.” “The young girl in the woods…you killed her and her friend, didn’t you?” Dante ignored her accusation. “I must admit your cloaking these last few days was impressive. It’s been a long time since we couldn’t find anyone we sought. I’m still at a loss to how you became one of us and have the advanced powers you do. I thought it impossible. You humans are too inferior–weak willed, with low stamina and intelligence–I never believed it could ever happen. “I’ve never been wrong. Before now. You puzzle me, Jenny.” She was weary of his voice. Her mind was busy trying to figure out a way of getting Teddy and Sarah free. She moved closer. “What do you want from me?” “A trade.” Dante, as if she weighed two feathers, held Sarah up to her. A ragdoll in his grasp. The girl was unmoving and Jenny was terrified somehow he’d done something to hurt her. “You come with us without any more trouble and we’ll let your children go free.” She didn’t believe she could trust them, yet what other choice did she have? None. “If you don’t, your children will die. Now. Before your eyes.” Jenny wanted to scream. Fight. Sink her new sharper teeth into him. But it wouldn’t do any good. Her enemies had her boxed in. Ensnared. And, more importantly, she couldn’t take the chance her children would be caught in the crossfire. “All right. A trade. Them for me. I’ll go with you but I’ll take them back to the farmhouse first. Telephone someone to come get them. I won’t leave them out here in the woods in the dark. No one knows where they are and they don’t know how to get home from here.” Dante burst out laughing. “You have spunk, I’ll say that. You intrigue me, Jenny, so I’ll make a gift of them to you. You can take them home. You have one hour. Then we come for you. And if you’re not waiting for us at the edge of the woods we’ll kill them. You. Your brother and his wife. And all your friends. “Yes, I know about them and where to find them. “One hour, Jenny. Don’t cross us. Leave your cell phone, your purse, everything but what you’re wearing. One hour.” The vampires were gone. As if they’d never been there. Sarah lay curled at her feet and Teddy was coming to his, still swinging his arms as if to ward off his captor. She fell to her knees and gathered her the girl into her arms. The child whimpered, stunned, not asleep but not yet awake. Jenny wept inwardly seeing her daughter like that. She reached for Teddy and he came, finally crying like the child he still was. “Mom, I tried so hard to keep them from taking Sarah. I did. They were too strong, too fast, too big. I’m sorry.” “It’s not your place to be sorry, sweetheart,” she hushed him gently. “It’s mine.” She kissed him on his head and hugged him tightly with her other arm. “Come on, I’m taking you home.” She got to her feet, lifting Sarah in her arms. Teddy trailed along behind her. On the way home through the night woods Jenny had only two thoughts: Why hadn’t the vampires killed all of them and what was she going to do now? There was only one reason she could think of. Dante was afraid of her. She had no idea why but there must be a reason, only she couldn’t fathom what it could be. How was she going to leave her children? What did Dante want with her? And what difference did it make? She didn’t care about herself. The vampires could do what they wanted with her as long as they left her family alone. They were what mattered. But could she trust them to leave those she loved alone? Leave other humans alone? Stop their butchering? She didn’t think so. Which was the problem and left only one solution. Go with them, bide her time, and find a way to exterminate them. Simple, but not simple. Once back at the house, she telephoned Joey and told him her story. “Come and take Sarah and Teddy for me. Protect them. I know it’s asking a lot, but there’s no one else. Please? Hurry.” “You can’t go with them, Jenny,” her brother stated, desperation making his voice crack. “They’ll kill you. Wait there. I’m calling Detective Bradley and the two of us will come out. With guns. Stakes. Whatever we need. Bradley will believe me. I know it. He’ll help. Please wait for us?” “Just get out here as soon as you can. Take the kids and care for them until I return.” She hung up. Amadeus flew out from under the couch and launched itself at her. The cat scuttled up her body like a climbing post and perched on her shoulder. Its tiny tongue licked her face and its claws latched into her sweater. It didn’t want her to go, either. Jenny tenderly lifted the kitten from her shoulder and put it in Sarah’s lap. “Who were those men, Mom?” Teddy asked as he huddled beside his sister, who was crying, on the couch. “What do they want with you and why are you going out to meet them again?” She gave him one last hug. “They’re bad men, Teddy. Very bad men. If you ever see them again…run. Hide. Don’t let them get near you, you hear?” As if that would help. It wouldn’t. But she had to say it anyway. He nodded. And his eyes told her he didn’t believe it, either. “Mom, don’t go. I’m afraid for you.” Sarah looked up long enough to speak in a weak voice. Jenny sighed and got up from the couch. She looked at her son. “Stay inside. Wait for your Uncle Joey. He’ll be here soon. You and your sister are going to stay with him and Laurie for a while.” “Mom?” “Don’t question me. Do as I say.” She moved to the back door, waited until she heard Joey’s truck coming down the road; before she went out she turned and met her children’s frightened eyes. “Teddy? Never forget I love you. Sarah? You’re my special girl. Love you. I always will. Never forget.” “We won’t, Mom,” Teddy answered. “But please wait until Uncle Joey gets here. He’ll help. Don’t go yet.” Sarah was crying softly. She’d jumped up from the couch and thrown her arms around her. Teddy joined her. The two children hugging her one last time. “I have to go.” The kitten meowed plaintively, sensing the unrest. Its little face turned to her, its eyes big, as it watched them from the cushions. Tears were streaming down her son’s face as Jenny disengaged from her children’s embrace, went out the door and closed it behind her. Joey’s truck was in the driveway. It took all she had inside of her to leave them like that. She stepped out to the end of the yard and met the four waiting in the dark for her. Then the five of them vanished into the woods.",

      "content": "Chapter 16 Joey Joey frantically dialed the telephone number scrawled on the back of the card the detective had given him the week before. The cop picked up after three rings and Joey exhaled with relief. In as few words as possible Joey explained why he was calling. Most of it anyway. He asked the detective to come over as soon as he could get there and he’d tell him everything on the way to his sister’s house. “Jenny’s in danger, they all are, and every minute counts. Please hurry, Detective.” “In that case I’ll meet you at her place. It’ll be faster.” “Okay. Meet you there.” Joey shut his cell phone and ran out the diner’s door, on the way shouting to Laurie that an emergency had come up and he had to get to Jenny’s. He’d catch her up on what was going on when he could. He drove like a crazy person to the apartment and dug out his rifle, the one his father had given him the last time there’d been vampires in town. It might not help but it made him feel better having it with him. Any weapon was better than no weapon. It took him five minutes to get to his sister’s. Detective Bradley’s car pulled in behind him and they ran into the house. They found two crying kids. Sarah was talking nonsense about humongous shadow men stealing them away and how they had taken their mommy. “They can move so fast. Like blurs. Their eyes make you sleepy. They’re mean too.” “They have her now. They have Mom.” Teddy was shaking. There was dirt on his face and bloodstains on his clothes. “She went into the woods to meet them. She traded herself for us. Uncle Joey you have to save her. They’re going to kill her, I just know it!” “How long has she been gone?” Joey asked his nephew. “Not long. A couple of minutes.” The boy grabbed his hand, pleading. “You have to go now. Please.” “What’s this about?” Detective Bradley directed the question to Joey. Wearing tan slacks and a sweater, his hair mussed, his face unshaven, he didn’t look much like a cop. They didn’t have the time to waste but Joey needed the detective on his side, at his back, when they went looking for his sister so, after taking the man aside so the kids wouldn’t hear, he gave him a condensed version about his family’s history with vampires. Real vampires. Jenny, his and Jeff’s part in it twelve years past and the innocents’ murders so like those happening now. Jenny’s recent conversion into a species of vampire stemming from the attack in St. Louis and how she’d been coping with it. The whole darn sordid tale. Or as much as he knew and thought the cop could handle without wigging out. “Teddy and Sarah’s abduction is a shock to me as well as Jenny’s surrender. She was terrified of these stalkers of hers and was desperately trying to avoid them. She’d been sort of cloaking herself and the kids so they wouldn’t be found.” “Cloaking?” “Uhh, her new state-of-being includes mind powers to hide herself and the kids from these, er, shadow men. I know, I know.” He put his hands up in a stopping motion. “Hard to believe. But true.” “Well,” the cop said flatly, “they found her anyway.” “They did. These vampires, or whatever they really are, must be very strong. We already know they’re soulless killers.” Joey’s voice was still barely above a whisper. “So you’ve suspected for some time who was behind these murders? These vampires, as you call them?” “We weren’t sure.” Joey made an excuse for not coming forward sooner. “Or we would have said something. Besides these vampires are powerful. You cops wouldn’t have stood a chance unless you believed in what they are, what they can do. You’d have died like the rest who’ve gone up against them. Jenny and I didn’t know what to do, but we were working on it. Until this.” “And your sister gave herself up to save her kids?” “You believe me then? That the murderers we’re looking for are vampires or something like vampires?” The detective stood straighter, his hand sliding to the revolver strapped across his chest beneath his sweater. “Since my daughter’s death, bizarre as it once seemed to me, I’ve suspected something supernatural…yes, even vampires. Nothing else added up. The way the victims were killed. The strange wounds found on them, the near decapitations, and the total draining of blood. How the perps seem to vanish into nothingness after every kill. “For a long time I tried to talk myself out of it. Thought I was plain off my rocker believing in blood-drinking creatures of any sort. But it’s the only thing that makes sense. I’ve seen what these animals can do. Could be they’re vampires or psychopaths who believe they are. Bottom line is simply they’re cold blooded killers with superhuman strengths and we have to stop them.” “How we going to do that?” Joey couldn’t help but think the detective was in for a big surprise, vampires were real, but at the moment, even that didn’t matter. Saving Jenny did. “We go after them. Find them.” He hesitated, a strange look stealing over his stern face. “Just to be sure, I dropped every bullet I have in my gun in holy water. I have wooden stakes in my trunk. A rosary in my pocket. I don’t believe a hundred percent in all this vampire crap but I was raised Catholic. Figures if there’re angels and devils, saints and all, there might be other entities in the world.” “Like vampires?” “Like vampires.” “So, we’re going after them?” “Soon as we drop these children off somewhere safe, we are.” Joey nodded. “Right.” Joey went back to the children and pulled them into his arms. His knees were weak, but he told himself not to be a coward. His sister needed him to be brave. He had to go after her. Save her if he could. If she were still alive. “Teddy, take your sister upstairs and pack clothes and whatever else you’ll need for a few days for both of you. But hurry. I’m taking you to the diner. You’ll stay there until Laurie gets someone to cover for us and then she’ll take you someplace safe.” He’d already thought of asking Andy to take the children later, after they’d searched for Jenny, and would call him once they were at the diner. Andy’s house was large. Secluded. If they didn’t find Jenny, the kids would be safer there. Best thing was the vampires didn’t know him or where he lived. The kids could hide there. “What about Amadeus?” Sarah scooped up the kitten. “She has to come with us. She’s too little to leave alone and we can’t let those bad men get her.” “She can come. I’ll get her box and food while you two get your stuff. Go. Be quick.” He didn’t have to tell them again. The boy took his sister’s hand and went to pack. When the children were ready he took them and the cat to the restaurant, broke the news to his wife in the kitchen that Jenny had been kidnapped and he and Detective Bradley were going to look for her. He didn’t tell her kidnapped by vampires. Maybe someday, but not that day. “You need to take care of the kids for a while. We’re going to close up the diner. Lizzie will help if you ask her.” “Lizzie’s in the back, she’ll help. Maybe Andy will take the kids? I think he’d want to.” “Not Andy. Not right now anyway. He’ll be out in the woods with everyone else looking for Jenny. When we all leave, you and Lizzie close up here. Will you watch Teddy and Sarah until we get back?” “You know I will,” his wife said. Joey then called Andy on his cell phone. When he got off he said to Laurie, “Andy’s on his way. I want you to take the kids to his house soon as the dinner’s closed up. Right away. He said you could hide them there. He’ll give us the keys when he gets here. Don’t go to the apartment.” “Hide them?” Laurie’s glance was questioning. “They could be in danger, too. Those men might come back for them. Might be looking for them.” “Oh, no.” Laurie stared at the children, standing a few feet away, her eyes apprehensive. “How did Andy take the bad news?” she asked, clasping their hands and ushering the children to a booth. The cat meowed and Sarah took it from its box to hold it. “Not good. He’s really upset.” “No more than any of us. Who the hell would kidnap Jenny and why? Who would be a danger to two helpless children? What’s going on? Is it the same person or people who’ve been doing these awful murders?” Joey wanted to sit down with his wife and tell her everything. Not yet. There were too many people around with big ears and eyes. He didn’t want to scare her any more than she already was. And there wasn’t time. “I’ll tell you everything I know later, I promise. Let’s just get these kids somewhere safe. Jenny was taken over thirty minutes ago now and we can’t waste another one. We have to go after her.” “I know you do.” Laurie left the kids side and put her arms around him. Joey hugged her and took the comfort. Heaven knew he needed it. He was so worried. “I’m so sorry. About Jenny and all.” Her eyes wet with tears. “You’re going to find her, you know that, don’t you?” “I hope so.” But what he couldn’t tell her was that he had little to no hope at all of finding her. Not if the vampires had her. His worst fear was that she was already dead. The loss was like a hand crushing his heart. He’d lost so many people he’d loved already. He couldn’t lose his sister. He just couldn’t. Minutes later Andy crashed through the door. He gave Laurie the keys to his house, the address, and interrogated Joey and Detective Bradley about Jenny’s abduction. He was beyond upset, he was heart-stricken. “I’m going with you to look for her. What are we waiting for?” The diner had already been emptied and Lizzie, not one to ask questions, was ready to lock it up and go to her bed in the back when they left. Outside the windows night had fallen. Rain cascaded down the glass. The wind cried. Joey knew how precious time was now. “Okay,” he said to his wife as he, Detective Bradley, Andy and a group of people wanting to help headed for the door. “I’ll be back soon as I can. Take the children to Andy’s and settle them in. They haven’t eaten supper. Andy said they can have anything in the house. Put them in the guest room, first one on the right on the second floor. Don’t leave them alone. Lock all the doors. Wait until I call.” He kissed her and went out the door with the others. They took the cop’s car. On their way Bradley used his cell phone to contact Chief Donald, telling Joey it couldn’t hurt to get him involved. “We’re going to need more manpower. We can comb the woods faster, more thoroughly, if we have extra help.” Joey let the detective make the call even though he feared for anyone who went into the woods with them. Yet even that fear dwindled away when he thought of his sister’s plight. And behind it all, he feared searching for Jenny, no matter how many men they had, what weapons they carried or where they looked, would be useless. They weren’t going to find her or her kidnappers. If the vampires were as powerful as Jenny said they were it’d be a waste of time. They were long gone. Jenny, too. Oh, but they had to try. He had to try. There was nothing else to do. He couldn’t just sit around and wring his hands; write up the obituary. He had to do something. They gathered the search party in the farmhouse, making it their headquarters. Chief Donald and his men arrived. The news spread and more townspeople arrived to help in the search. It touched him that Jenny and he had so many people willing to help. So many friends. A crowd of them went out into the woods in the chilly October night. It rained harder and the wind whipped at them. They could barely see anything. Yet they kept up the search through the night and into the next day and the day after that. And found nothing and no one. Jenny and the vampires that’d taken her were gone.",

      "content": "Chapter 17 Jenny Jenny didn’t know why they were keeping her alive. The first night they whisked her off to a sprawling house nestled on a cliff among thick woods and put her alone in a room. They’d traveled like the wind. How far they’d gone she didn’t know but it was a long way. Maybe even out of the county or the state. She wasn’t sure. They locked the door and the windows, chained her to the bed. The links were made of iron, heavy, and circled her wrists, and the chain was spiked to the floor. She’d have to gnaw off her own hands to break her bonds. “Don’t try to escape,” Dante warned. “We know where your brother and his wife live and work. If you run we’ll kill them. Bring them here; make you watch. Your children, too.” That had settled that. She lay in the room, on the bed, fighting her growing hunger, and listening to the rain pelting the roof. She had to play for time. If Joey did what she prayed he’d do, he’d hide her kids. They’d be safe. If he were real smart he’d also hide Laurie and himself. Only then could she take the chance. Escape. Yet even as she thought of getting away, she knew it was hopeless. She, her children, her family and friends couldn’t hide forever. There was no witness protection program from vampires. Or not any that she was aware of. She had to think of another plan. The vampires left her alone, or she thought they left her alone, for a time. The house grew quiet. They were probably out hunting and slaughtering innocents. It made her sick. Here she was tied up like a Thanksgiving turkey and not doing anything to stop them. Her hunger became a torment. She gazed with longing at the windows and the woods beyond. Full of game, and blood, that she couldn’t partake of. Sleep was difficult but she dozed in and out. Waiting. What did they want from her? If they were going to kill her why not just do it? Did they have something worse planned for her? Don’t think about it. Don’t. The house became noisy again. The drapes were pulled, darkening the room, but there was a sliver of light along the bottom. It must be morning. Dante appeared by her bedside. “Why haven’t you killed me yet?” she asked. “Oh, so you are awake?” His voice was throaty, mesmerizing, for a monster. The room was full of pale light. The sun was beginning to rise and she could see him. He looked human. Unbelievably tall and muscled, silver hair worn long and shaggy. His eyes gleamed blackish silver, when he tilted his head. Empty eyes. She wondered about his teeth. He smiled and bared them. His fangs were long, sharp and, unlike hers, filled his mouth in triple rows. When his lips smiled again they were normal. “I heard your thoughts. In this respect we’re like your mythical vampires.” “Our vampires?” She didn’t want to banter with him but she couldn’t stop herself. If she was to fight them, the more she knew about them the better. “Well, what you humans think vampires are like.” “Are there real vampires, then?” “Our distant cousins, you mean? There once were many, hundreds of your centuries ago. They came from our realm during your cavemen days. They’ve died out since. Or most of them have. Survival of the fittest, you know.” Her eyes blinked. “Your kind killed them all?” She wanted so badly to say, nah, nah, nah, nah…you didn’t. I’ve seen, destroyed, some of your brethren before. They still exist here in our world. But she was too shrewd to taunt him like that. Best to keep that a secret. If she could. She shut the thought out of her head. Go away. Go away. His laughter wasn’t human. It came from behind him. She looked to see if there was someone else there, but there was only him. “We did. Most fun we ever had. You humans aren’t half as much sport, let me tell you. We out run, out think and out fight you. And because most of you don’t believe in us we get away with it.” An echo of laughter. His thin lips didn’t move. “If they were like you why did you kill them?” “Excellent question. Because they were competition. Underneath they were nothing like us. They were mindless, hungry animals that had no purpose but to drink the blood we needed to exist.” “And you and your friends do have a purpose?” “We do. But that is a discussion for another time.” She opted not to press her luck and let it drop. “So, you said you were from another planet…dimension…what?” “Another place and time actually.” It was as if she were in a weird nightmare. “You’re an alien time traveler?” He actually laughed. “Your kind would call us that.” “Why are you here?” He seemed to consider answering or not, then shrugged, and did. “Our realm has no food left. Unless we feed on each other.” “So you can’t go home?” He thought about that, too, for a moment, examining her. “Why would we want to? The food–all the blood and more–we need is here. But no. The doorway closed long ago and except for a few of us with the power to travel back and forth, we’re stranded, you might say. Then again we need the hunt as much as the blood. We’re not like you. Sheep. Lemmings. You know, gutless.” She shivered. Vile. That’s what they were. It made no difference where they came from. Evil was evil. “We kill to survive so if that makes us evil, so be it.” “Killing to survive isn’t but butchering intelligent sentient beings and reveling in it is.” “Oh you humans see everything so black and white, don’t you? It isn’t. There’re so many of you, billions, what difference if there’s a few hundred less or so?” Dante sat down on the edge of the bed and leaned over to look at her; studying her as one might study a rare captured animal. His long thin fingers traced around her eyes and down her face. He touched her hair. She cringed but the chain kept her from moving out of his reach. “So soft,” he muttered. “Are you going to kill me?” There, she’d asked. It would be better to know one way or another. If she was going to die she might as well die fighting. “We were. At first. Now you’ve piqued our curiosity. Why didn’t you die in St. Louis? What makes you the one exception in a million that our bite turned you into one of us? Why do you have some of our powers and some we don’t have?” Some we don’t have? “This blending hasn’t ever happened before?” She finally understood her allure to them. “Humans becoming one of us? Not that I know of. Not that any of us have known of. There were myths we’ve heard through the centuries, yet none of us have seen. For some reason you are one of those exceptions.” “What are you going to do with me then?” But Dante wasn’t there. The room around her was empty. Damn. She’d had more questions to ask. She hadn’t learned near enough to help or to break the hold they had over her. She’d realized one thing, the most important, though. She’d been right, escaping from these alien vampires, as she’d begun to think of them, wouldn’t be the answer. She must destroy them. There was no other way she, those she loved and their future victims would ever be safe. If they didn’t kill her first. God, she missed her children. She was worried about them. Closing her eyes she concentrated and saw them. They were some place she didn’t recognize. A cozy kitchen filled with oak cabinets and lots of wood trim, an oak table and chairs. Outside the window there were trees. So it wasn’t Joey and Laurie’s apartment. Her children were getting ready for school. Laurie was feeding them breakfast and trying her best to settle their fears over Jenny’s absence. “Your mother will be found. You’ll see. The entire town is searching. But until she returns you two have to keep hoping for the best, do what your mom would want you to do. You need to make her proud. Just don’t tell anyone where you’re staying, understand? It’s very important. Promise!” Teddy was eating raisin bran, his head down. “Okay,” he mumbled. Sarah, in jeans and a red sweater–the warm sweater Jenny had bought last week because the weather was turning chilly–was sitting at the table with her Gameboy. The one Jeff had gotten her the Christmas before. They both looked so sad and it broke Jenny’s heart. But they were okay. Alive. They had a roof over their heads, food in their stomachs, clothes on their backs and people to care for them who loved them almost as much as Jenny did. Joey and Laurie would protect them. Sarah scooted closer to her brother as if being near to him made her feel safer. “I miss Mom, don’t you?” Sarah whispered. Teddy looked at her. “Me too. But we got to have faith like Uncle Joey says. We’ll get her back. Soon.” “Wish we were still going to school.” “You know what they said. It’s safer if we don’t for a while. In case those men are looking for us. Same with us not letting people know we’re here or seeing us.” “Yeah, I know.” Sarah let out a sigh. “It’s best.” Their words and actions brought a faint smile because if she never returned she knew her brother and sister-in-law would raise her children with firmness and love. That gave Jenny some peace of mind. Voices outside her room brought her to the present. She couldn’t let her jailers hear her thoughts and consciously blanked them out. She couldn’t let them see where her children were. They were out of danger for now and that’s the way she wanted them to stay. It made what she was planning easier, knowing that. Eventually, even with the growing hunger throbbing like fire through her veins and muscles; her fears, she slipped into a restless sleep. Chained as she was, it wasn’t easy to get comfortable, but she had to conserve her strength. Had to be ready. For whatever was coming. *** They woke her as the third night seeped into the room. The one called Zebulon unlocked her chains and dragged her to her feet. She was unsteady. Weakened because she hadn’t fed in days and stiff because of her chained captivity. Her legs didn’t work at first. What was wrong with her? Then terror swallowed her. Woke her up. Was she going to die now? Was this it? “No, you’re not going to die,” Zebulon confided. “Yet.” He led her out the door and through a lavishly accessorized and decorated home. Money, she thought. On her way through she wondered what had happened to the owners. Most likely dead, stuffed in a closet somewhere or stacked up in the basement. Bloodless flattened cadavers. Outside it was a drab day. There was a blowing wind and leaves flew around her head like dark snow. “Where are we going?” she asked as Zebulon shoved her down a trail behind the house. “Dante wants you to come along on our next hunt.” At least she wasn’t going to die. Wait…oh, God. “Hunt?” “He thought it was time you fed. Learned the correct way to treat the cattle.” “You mean humans?” He sent her an exasperated look. “Of course, humans. It’s what keeps us strong.” Human blood. Oh no. She didn’t want to do that. He pushed her onward but she halted in her tracks. “Don’t make Dante wait. He isn’t happy when he has to wait for anyone or anything. And you don’t want to see him unhappy. Trust me.” She didn’t trust him but of the four vampires he seemed the most sympathetic. He acknowledged and actually, not like Dante’s sadistic goading, talked to her while the other two acted as if she weren’t there. Plodding through the woods, she lost track of time. No moon so there was no light, yet she saw what was around her clear enough as her mind furiously tried to find a way to get rid of her jailers. They joined the others outside of a dark house. Dante looked over his shoulder and smiled. “Good you’re here. We’ve got a family ripe to be picked. There are five of them and there are five of us. Two old ones, two of middle years and one young one. They’re asleep now on the second floor. “It’s time you tasted human blood. See what it can do for you. You’ll be surprised.” “I won’t kill anyone. I won’t–” Dante was at her side, his hand gripping her arm so tightly she cried out in shock. Pain wasn’t something she’d felt much of since her turning. Apparently, her captors could inflict it easily on her. She didn’t know why, but that knowledge didn’t make her happy. “You’ll do what I tell you or someone you love will die before the night is over. Your brother, perhaps? I can get there and back before you miss me. Your children have gone into hiding but he has that rat hole diner of his and is easy to find. So is his wife. Do you understand me?” There were so many things she could have said but she uttered none of them. Defying him in front of the others would only enrage him more. “Yes.” Going into that house and being a part of the family’s brutal deaths was the worst nightmare she’d ever endured. She’d been unconscious during her husband’s murder, but she was wide awake during the slaughter. And being forced to drink the blood of the old woman Dante thrust at her was the second worst. In the end, as hungry as she was, she’d been unable to kill the old lady and Zebulon, seeing her struggle, stepped in and broke the woman’s neck when Dante wasn’t looking. She’d never know if it was out of pity for her or fear of Dante that he did it. She pretended to partake but drank as little as she could get away with as Dante watched. Which was hard because she needed the blood as much as she despised murdering to get it. If she killed and drank she’d be as bad as her captors. Like them, she’d be a ghoul. Just the tiny amount of human blood trickling through her body changed her. She could feel it. She heard the thoughts of the others around her with more clarity and felt so much stronger. Dante, monster that he was, had been right about that. In her frustration as they raced through the night woods away from the house she noticed trees and limbs bending before and around her, buried rocks shook in the earth, as she passed through them. The others, busy moving through the forest, didn’t see these things and she wisely kept her new abilities to herself. She loathed the vampires for what they were and what they were making her do so much she was sure it would warp her soul. If she even had one left to warp. After they fled the house she grieved for the carnage they’d left behind and guilt overwhelmed her for not being able to stop it. She hated herself so much after the family’s massacre she couldn’t look at herself in a mirror. But that night was when her plan to destroy the other vampires took root and began to grow. They locked her in the room again that morning and the next morning and the morning after that. In between they dragged her along on their night hunts. As hard as she tried to avoid killing–Zebulon covered for her and always made the killing stroke–and drinking human blood, most nights she was forced to ingest some of it. Dante’s will, his blackmailing and the hunger continuing to grow inside like a ravenous beast did the rest. Slowly her powers increased and she hid them, biding her time. She was evolving. Her brown hair was streaked with silver, her skin as white and hard as alabaster, her eyes in the dark were diamonds. As she grew swifter and stronger the other vampires, except Dante and the one called Aloysius, almost seemed to accept her. But Dante, Zebulon said, was only seeing how far her transformation would go. An experiment for his amusement only. She feared what would happen when it went as far as it could. Or too far. Would Dante rid himself of her then? Probably so. He despised humans and thought of her as a mutant, which was barely one breath above a human. “Dante’s been bored for a long time,” Zebulon admitted once. “You’re his new pet.” “Well, some love their pets,” she’d replied with a trace of irony. “Not he. He tires of them easily.” “Then what?” “He has them for breakfast.” At first Jenny learned everything she could about her captors but Zebulon was the only one who’d actually talk to her. The others tolerated her because Dante demanded it. She was Dante’s human pet. She was lonely. Lost. She drank human blood. Sometimes she thought the only thing that still tied her to her old life, the good mortal she’d once been, was the love she had for Teddy and Sarah. She could see and hear them in her head as they lived their lives; when Laurie helped them pick out their day’s clothes or when Andy, who she finally deduced they were staying with, made them supper. They spent time with Andy, Joey or Laurie, scrambled into their beds each night, worried about, prayed over and missed her–and she could only watch. Listen. From a distance. Missing them too. As she could only watch as the townspeople’s and those she loved searched for her everywhere. The woods. The town. Nearby towns. Plastered her picture over telephone poles, the news and the Internet. They wouldn’t find her. Andy, bless his heart, helped care for her children as if they were his own and trampled through the woods and creeks, nearby hospitals and towns, searching for her day after day. Never giving up. Joey was right. The man must care for her. Poor Andy. It all broke her heart. But it kept her human. Her children and her old life haunted and beckoned her through the empty days of sleeping in locked rooms and grisly nights of spreading terror and mayhem, but she couldn’t go home. Not until she found a way to destroy those who held her. If it wasn’t already too late. She wondered if she was becoming as much a monster as Dante and his associates. But something was happening that only she knew about. Her great secret, and she was careful to hide what she could do. Pretending to be weak. Frightened at times when, instead, she was getting more powerful every day, every minute. Every second. She’d watched the others closely and seen what they were capable of, what they could do. Especially Dante. And she could do more. Soon, she began to hope, when the time was right, she’d take back her freedom. And she’d destroy them as well. Forever.",

That she did it to save them. They feel abandoned for the second time. First their father is killed and then their mother leaves. So I can’t give up.” “I know. You’re a good brother.” The kids were planted in front of the television in the living room while he and Andy talked over coffee in Andy’s kitchen. Jenny had been missing for almost a month. “We won’t give up,” Andy said. “That local television station in Stanton is airing another story on her tomorrow night. Could be it’ll generate some leads. Someone’s had to have seen her or knows something about her whereabouts. She can’t have just vanished into thin air.” “People do all the time. Vanish, I mean.” Joey said what he thought he had to say, knowing what he knew. “And last time we mostly got a lot of calls from crackpots and unbalanced nuts.” “Shame Detective Bradley had to go back to St. Louis yesterday.” “He’d used up all his vacation time. But he promised he’d check in with us regularly now that the murders have resumed. He’s following them from there; hoping his department will lend him to ours so he can continue the investigation because he’s so involved with the case.” “He’s a smart cop, I hope they let him. We need him.” Andy was finishing up the supper dishes at the sink; dried off his hands and draped the towel over the rod attached inside the lower cabinet. He was the only person Joey knew of, besides Jenny, who didn’t have a dishwasher and did them by hand. “I heard about those two men whose bodies were found thirty miles from here last weekend. That makes how many deaths since Jenny went missing?” Joey knew the number but didn’t say it. He shook his head. “Too many.” And he had little doubt the vampires who’d taken Jenny were responsible. Damn them to hell. So far he hadn’t told Andy about them. What they were really up against. He’d tried to many times but just couldn’t do it. Andy was a down-to-earth kind of guy who didn’t believe in anything that wasn’t easily explained. Joey inwardly laughed every time he thought of spilling the beans to his friend about what Jenny really was and who’d taken her. Andy would think the stress of Jenny’s abduction had just plain unhinged him. The abduction as a simple kidnapping was enough knowledge for the part Andy had to play. As far as Andy knew the same people who were killing townspeople (for whatever reason a killer kills) were the same ones who’d taken Jenny. For reasons unknown. “They took my sister and we’re worried they might return for the kids because they saw them; can identify them,” Joey had revealed that first night. “Not that they remember a thing about the abduction. The fright must have emptied their minds of it. But to be safe we need to hide them somewhere for a while.” He’d had to lie to protect the truth. “You think Jenny’s kidnapping has something to do with the attack on her and her husband in St. Louis? She saw something she shouldn’t have? Knows something she shouldn’t know?” “That’s possible.” Joey let him believe it. Basically it was true. “The kids can hide out at my place,” Andy had immediately offered that first night. “I want to help.” And the children were still there. Both he and Laurie were careful not to draw attention to where Andy lived. They came and went in secret or in the dark. Fearing the vampires would get to the children at school somehow, Joey had taken both of them out for a while. He’d told the principal it was because of the kidnapping and the fear the kidnappers might come after them as well. It was best if they went into total hiding for a time. No one had questioned it. Not yet anyway. Eventually they’ll need to return to school, but not now. The principal, under the circumstances, also had thought it was best. Joey wished Bradley were still around. It was nice having a believer to confide in, a believer to have his back. Beneath everything Joey was worried sick for his sister. A month and not a sign of her. Not a peep. If she were still alive she would have somehow found a way–a telephone call, a hastily scribbled postcard, an e-mail, something–to get in touch with him or her children. His worst fear was that she was already dead. Long dead. But, in his heart, he didn’t feel she was. But he didn’t know what to do. The search for Jenny had wound down. It wasn’t merely the time factor, after weeks people had to go on with their lives and the police on to other cases, but the weather had turned unusually chilly. Rainy. Halloween had come and gone. The holidays were coming and people tended to forget one missing woman, especially when the slayings started up again. Joey, his niece and nephew couldn’t forget. They grieved each day for their sister and their mother. Yet Joey and Laurie had the diner to tend to. With Jenny gone they had two more mouths to feed and the diner was their livelihood. Andy’s help was a godsend. Joey closed up the farmhouse. Every chance he got he went out and looked for Jenny, vowing he’d never give up. Knowing, if it were the other way around, she’d never give up looking for him. And the weeks went by.",

      "content": "Chapter 19 Sarah “How long do we have to stay here with Andy?” Sarah asked one drizzly morning, as she and her brother were getting up and dressed. She’d gotten up and heard the rain tap dancing on the roof. She told her brother it sounded like a thousand baby deer feet. Outside the window the sky was crowded with fat ugly looking clouds that took all the light away. It could have been nighttime it was so dark. Andy said a big storm was coming in. Lots of lightning and thunder. “It’s going to be a bad one,” he’d said. “We’re going to stay in the house today and hope for the best.” Sometimes, she thought, Andy was too protective. Always watching them and wanting to know where they were going. Not that they went much of anywhere since her mom left. They didn’t. But then she felt safer in the house with Andy and Teddy. She shivered in her pajamas. It was cold, too, for Florida, which her mom had said was mostly warm all the time. Andy said it was the coldest November he could recall. “I don’t know,” Teddy grumbled, down on his knees peeking under the bed looking for his lost shoe. He was always losing something. Which was weird because the room they were staying in wasn’t that big. Heck, Andy’s house wasn’t that big but it was nice. It had two bathrooms like their old house in Millstadt had had, a screened in porch and a deck behind it that overlooked a section of the woods. She liked it because it had three televisions. Almost one in every room. Staring out the window into the falling wetness, she went on, “I mean I like Andy and all. I know he and mom were friends. But I miss home. My own room.” Then in a whisper, “And mom.” She traced the letters MOM in the glass’s condensation. She drew a heart by it. Amadeus, hiding under the bed covers, was waking up. The cat meowed a good morning to them and stretched. It was still a runt (Andy believed it’d never be a big cat no matter what) even with all the food they fed it. And they fed it a lot. It loved table scraps, mostly meat, especially turkey and chicken. “Good Morning to you, too, kitty.” Sarah turned around, scooped up the kitten and, snuggling it close, moved to the window again. Her eyes were on the misty woods beyond the house. Amadeus climbed onto her shoulder, purring and talking in her ear. Its tongue licked her neck and she stroked its soft fur. Teddy came up behind her and put a hand on her other shoulder. “Ah, Sarah, don’t start crying again, okay? Your face is gonna freeze that way and you don’t want to look like that when mom comes back, do you? All sorrowful like? Eyes all bloodshot?” “No.” She sniffled and wiped the tears off her face with her fingers. “Mom wouldn’t want you to be so sad. She’s coming back. I know it. She wouldn’t leave us alone forever. She loves us.” “How can you be so sure? Dad hasn’t come back.” “Dad died,” her brother spoke somberly. “He can’t come back.” “Mom could be dead, too.” She almost hated to say the words. Words had power, she thought. If you said them they might come true. “Mom isn’t dead.” Her brother acted as if he were mad at her. His face got red, his fists clenched like he wanted to hit something or someone. “She’s just…missing. She’ll come back. I know it.” She snorted. “Yeah, when? Why is she missing? Still gone? It’s been forever. How can she stay away from us all this time, not even call us, if she loves us so much?” “Someone’s keeping her from us, that’s what. Those men. She has a reason for not coming. But give her time. She’ll find a way.” Her brother met her gaze and something crossed between them. They both knew their mother loved them. That wasn’t in doubt. It was everything else. She shrugged away from him, dropped the kitten on the bed and grabbed up the clothes she was going to wear. Comfortable clothes because they were, as usual, only going to hang around the house. She was getting tired of being in hiding as Uncle Joey put it. Danger or not. Gosh they hadn’t even gone out trick-or-treating for Halloween. All they’d done was dress up in costumes and masks and went to Joey’s diner for a special Halloween supper. They had to get out sometimes, Andy said. The night was okay. The place was all decorated up and there were lots of people there dressed as witches, werewolves and funny looking aliens. Kind of a party all evening long. People coming and going. Eating and laughing as a radio behind the counter played scary music. There’d been bowls of free candy everywhere. Uncle Joey gave her a bag of her favorite kind (Milky Ways and chocolate covered marshmallow pumpkins) to take home. In hiding. Being bored, is what she called it. She liked school. Learning. Books. Teachers. The friends she’d begun to make. She liked being able to play outside, go to the library and shop. Things they weren’t allowed to do now. All she wanted was to have things be normal again. Like that was ever going to happen. She felt like Alice down the rabbit hole, except she hadn’t gotten out of that first room Alice had found herself in. “I’m going to the bathroom downstairs and get dressed,” she said. “See you at breakfast.” “See you there.” Her brother had taken her place at the window as she left the room. She was worried about Teddy, too. He wasn’t talking much. Holding it inside. Not for the first time she wished she was older, smarter, and knew what to do for him. She could barely keep from crying all the time herself. How could she hope to help him? She hugged him a lot. Tried to make him laugh. Maybe that would help some. Tagged after him everywhere he went. He was getting a little peeved at her for that, though. She hated being a silly girl. There wasn’t anything she could do to help find her mother. They wouldn’t even let her search like the grownups were doing. They wanted her to sit in Andy’s house, watch television, videos, read books, and keep quiet. She should be looking for her mom with everyone else. Bella, the girl in the Twilight books, would have been out there looking. That girl was so brave. That girl lives in a book. She isn’t real. Her heart began to skip around like it was jumping rope. Those bad men had been real. Oh, she wasn’t afraid of the woods, no matter how dark it was. It was those men who’d stomped into their house that awful day and been so mean to Teddy and her. Hurt them. They were the ones who took her mom. Bad, bad men. They’d been creepy and hadn’t spoken much. So strong. Their skin so clammy to the touch. Their eyes had glittered strangely in the shadows beneath the trees. When they’d touched her, her mind had filled with horrible pictures and then had gone blank. She’d watched herself from far away. Maybe they’d been vampires? Yeah, sure. Only in books and movies. She had a wild imagination but she knew the difference between real and not real. Vampires were definitely not real. Like unicorns and Tinker Bell, which she used to really be into before the Twilight books came along. An unbelievable thought came to her then, What if vampires were real? And that’s what those men had been. No. No. No. That would make the unreal real and that would be way too scary. To think there were really monsters out in the world. Nah. After she was dressed she went into the kitchen. Amadeus trailed, slinking and popping out at her every now and again, behind her. She fed the cat and poured a bowl of cereal. Andy came in from the deck and, going into the refrigerator, got her milk to put in her cereal. “Good morning, Sarah.” “Good morning, Andy.” “Storm will be here any minute. I felt the first drops of rain when I was standing out there a minute ago.” She looked through the sliding glass doors. The trees were whipping back and forth and the sky was a sickly green shade. Like the sky in the beginning of the Wizard of Oz movie they’d watched a few nights ago. “Have we heard anything yet?” Andy would know what she was asking. She asked it every morning, every night. Have you heard anything about my mother? And as he did every day he shook his head. “No word yet. Nothing. I’m sorry.” He squeezed her shoulder gently and leaning down, gave her a hug. She looked up. “You think we’ll hear something tonight or tomorrow?” “We can only hope.” He sat down across from her and opened the morning newspaper he had delivered every day to the house. She knew better than to say more. Andy was sad enough. She’d seen it. He must have liked her mom a lot. He must miss her, too. Be worried about her. “When are Teddy and I going back to school?” “You know, your Uncle Joey and I were talking about that yesterday. Probably after the Thanksgiving holiday. You’ll still need to be careful but we think it’s safe.” “Yeah!” She threw her hands up in a gesture of childish happiness. It was something. At least going back to school would give her and Teddy something to do other than to sit around moping all day waiting for their mother to come home. She was sick of television and anyway there wasn’t much on during the day except those stupid soap operas and game shows. They’d already watched most of Andy’s DVD’s. In a low voice she asked, “Are those bad men gone now? Is that why we’re safe?” Teddy had wandered into the kitchen and taken the box of Pop Tarts (chocolate with white icing was his flavor of the week) out of the cabinet and dropped two into the toaster. He looked as if he’d been crying again. Her brother and Andy exchanged a look. Teddy knew everything before she did. He and Andy were like best buddies or something. Keeping secrets from her. Making hand signs and faces behind her back. Most of the time she didn’t mind. Teddy needed someone to confide in. She had Laurie and Uncle Joey. Teddy needed someone, too. “We’re not sure about those men, but they haven’t been seen or heard of since they took you and your brother. There’s been surveillance on the farmhouse and so far no one’s been seen nosing around it.” She was an intuitive child so she knew Andy was holding something back. It had to be the murders. She watched the news some nights and the woman on Channel 5 said there’d been no new ones for over a week. She figured those bad men had something to do with them. So if the murders were gone then perhaps those bad men were too. It was just a thought. “They wanted mom, that’s what they wanted. Not us. That’s why we’re safe, right?” “That’s what we think.” She smiled at Andy. “So we’re going back to school. Does that mean we’re leaving here? Where we going to live?” “For now your Uncle Joey and Aunt Laurie and I are going to share your living arrangements. They have to run the diner, I’m still not working, and since I can do most of my job applications online and on the telephone I want to keep helping, at least until I find a job. Plus, I have a furnished guest room with twin beds and, as you must remember, they don’t.” “Yeah,” Teddy groused, “those air beds are not comfortable. Too low to the ground. Too squishy for me.” “Oh, I liked them,” she interjected. “It was like floating on a cloud.” “Yeah, sure. A squishy cloud.” Andy rustled her brother’s hair and told him, as he always did, that he needed a haircut. She also knew another reason why they were staying with Andy. He was lonely. No job. Not many friends. Their being here seemed to make him happy. “Is that arrangement okay with you?” Andy asked her. “Fine with me.” She liked Andy and since her dad died and her mom had been gone it was nice to have him around as well as her aunt and uncle. They were all almost like a family. In many ways Andy was a lot like her father had been. Funny. Patient. Loved to play board and computer games. Cards. Watch movies with them on the sofa. He was pesky like their dad had been, too. Always asking questions and stuff about their day. She’d decided she liked him. The world outside suddenly lit up like fireworks and the roar of thunder boomed around them like an angry roaring animal. She got up from the table and moved to the glass doors, the bowl of cereal in her hands and Amadeus bouncing around her feet. The cat was scared of storms and whenever there was one it wouldn’t leave her alone. Had to be in her lap or under her feet. Better yet, safe in her arms. Another flash and shriek and Amadeus was scuttling up her jeans like a fast moving cockle burr; yowling like a crazy cat until it was cuddled and trembling around her neck. All three of them laughed. It felt good because it’d been a long time since they had.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 Jenny Jenny had been patiently waiting. If she wanted to defeat the vampires she’d have to discover their weakness and use it against them. She was stronger every day, learning new things, still hiding them. Soon she’d be ready. All she had to do was have an opportunity and she was working on that. For some reason, she found she couldn’t blink herself away. Couldn’t transport like the day she’d first escaped them. It’d only been the one time, though. As if being with them, or Dante, kept her tethered. She never knew if it was on purpose. If Dante knew she could do it and prevented her or if there was some other reason. If he could do it. Yet she never saw any of them transport to another place in an instant as she’d done. They could travel swiftly, but not in the blink of an eye. It was a mystery. Strange. Though almost from the beginning, after a small rebellion or two to make it look good, she mimicked their habits and tried to get them to believe she was becoming one of them. Make them think she enjoyed slaying people and drinking their blood, enjoyed basking in her new existence. They had no idea, though, how powerful she was becoming. No idea. And she fought to keep it that way. Zebulon, for a reason she couldn’t understand, was not unkind to her. He gave her clean clothes when hers became filthy and torn. He was the one who provided her with a traveling bag to put her necessities in. A brush and shampoo for her hair, a toothbrush and toothpaste. A razor and shaving cream. Things she needed. Playing along was the only way she could survive. It wasn’t easy because they were so vicious and merciless to their victims. She was becoming a pretty darn good actress. The other two, Aloysius and Balthazar, she’d come to believe, were both shadows, mindless automatons that followed Dante’s orders without question and had little, to her knowledge anyway, personality of their own. They both had the silverish hair and black glittering eyes. Both were at least seven feet tall. Staring up at them, as with Dante, she felt like a Hobbit. All three towered over her. No wonder they thought they were gods. Aloysius, when he wasn’t killing was a morosely quiet one who didn’t seem to notice she was there most of the time. All he cared about was the hunt and the blood. He hadn’t said one word to her the entire time she’d been with them, other than to snap or snarl at her. He was truly an enigma; one she didn’t ever want to get to know better. At times, she wondered if there wasn’t something else really wrong with him besides being a bloodsucking monster. Maybe Dante had driven him totally insane. Wouldn’t surprise her. Balthazar, on the other hand, was the heaviest and tallest of the three, by a few inches at least, and talked, with barely any accent at all, incessantly. Just not to her, as he let her know constantly, who was beneath him. He chatted away at his victims as he tormented and eventually killed them. He yakked away to imaginary people all the time, too. Jenny came to believe he was as crazy as Aloysius. If the creatures they were could be crazy. Maybe they were all like that in the place they came from. He played word games with his make-believe friends, as well, and he always won. He read invisible books to them. Sounded like gobbledygook to her. His eyes, unlike Dante’s, weren’t empty. Just demented. Jenny steered clear of Balthazar as much as she could. Dante, on the other hand, haunted her every move. Ceaselessly observed her. His grand experiment. His little trained pet. She was so careful around him. At times she read his mind and she overheard that he didn’t trust her. Often she’d direct a trivial thought at him like pick up that rock on the ground before him or go out that door he just came in and he’d do it without comprehending he had, and then slowly her suggestions grew more important. Then she started in on the others. Each time one of them obeyed her without knowing they had she concealed a smile. She had a plan and she was working her way towards it. For the first time in a long time she had hope. But it would take a long time, she knew that. A long time. She’d have to be patient. So patient. And the days. The weeks went by. And she grew stronger. *** The storm drove them to find shelter for the night. Dante didn’t like getting wet. The house they’d broken into was in a part of Florida she wasn’t familiar with. The southern tip on the ocean. For weeks the four of them had followed Dante further and further away from Summer Haven and she’d been relieved. The more miles between these beasts and her family and home, the better. She lived in fear that he’d go back for her children. Hurt or kill them. If only to torture her. The kitchen had grimy floors and scratched cabinets. Tattered yellow curtains hung limp over dirty glass. All and all a shabby excuse for a place where a family would eat their meals together. It made her long for her cheery kitchen with the yellow walls. There was food in the cabinets and in the refrigerator. She tried eating some when the others weren’t watching. It wouldn’t stop the blood lust she felt from morning to night but it filled her stomach and kept her moving. Some nights, out on the hunt she’d sneakily catch a rabbit or some other small animal and drink from them. She’d become so fast, she could do it without the others seeing she had. Another secret she hid from them. Between the two forms of nourishment she stayed alive. Barely. And it kept her from drinking too much human blood when she was forced to. It was the only thing keeping her sane. In the house’s kitchen was a window much like hers at home. Looking out of it into the rain she had another image of her children. So real she could have reached out and touched them. Sarah was standing before a window peering out into the rain. She was crying. Amadeus in her arms making those tiny cute sounds it always did. Teddy came up behind her and put his hand on her small shoulder to comfort her. They missed and were worried about her. Oh, and how she missed them. Her arms ached to wrap around them. Her eyes wanted so badly to see their sweet faces and their innocent smiles…her ears wanted so badly to hear their voices and laughter. She sighed. It won’t be long, my sweet ones. It won’t be long, I promise. I’ll find a way to get home to you. I’ll find a way for us to be together and safe again. “Don’t get too comfortable,” Zebulon’s voice broke into her reverie. “Dante wants to go out as soon as it gets dark.” He was behind her one moment and when she twisted her neck to say something, he was gone. He did that a lot. Letting her know what was going on but not sticking around to talk much afterwards. He was afraid of their leader. They all were. She didn’t know why Zebulon wasn’t as mean to her as the others but she was grateful. Not that they were friends or anything. If given the chance she’d dispose of him without a second thought. And, probably, he her. She didn’t fool herself. She was a prisoner. They could kill her any time they desired and never let her forget it. Behind her, deeper in the house, she heard the cries of the men who could have been brothers or friends living together, as they died. They’d barricaded themselves in a back bedroom. She couldn’t care who they were. The least she knew about them and their lives the better because she couldn’t help them. Or save them. They were doomed. Her guilt was bad enough. Thank God no children this time. She’d had her belly full of dead children. Dante liked to feed on the young ones, as he called them. Their blood was sweeter. Untainted. Oh Lord, I hate him. I hate all of them. There was a series of gunshots; the humans must have had guns tucked away in that bedroom, more screams and sudden silence. Dante’s laughter. It was always the same. “Toss the bodies out in the back yard,” she heard him say. “I don’t want to look at them. Stupid humans. That’ll teach them to think they can fight us.” More laughter. “They really thought a gun could hurt us. Ha! Nothing can. When will these sheep learn?” Her head drooped, her body tensed, and she struggled with the familiar rage as it welled up inside her. She loathed her wardens with every inch of her heart and soul. She had to find a way to get rid of them. Get away. Return home to her children whom she missed so much it was as cruel a punishment as the gnawing hunger in her blood, or being with Dante and the others. “Too bad there were just two of them,” Dante’s voice was arrogant. “Not enough for all of us. The rest of you will have to wait for supper. Leave me now.” A reprieve. She hadn’t been forced to kill or drink their blood and was relieved. Dante seemed to have more power than the other three, or so she thought because it was hard to tell…except perhaps her now? Because he was older or stronger, or for some reason she wasn’t privy to, and didn’t know. She’d asked Zebulon once how long they’d been trapped on her world and all he’d replied was, “More years than you would believe. And some of us far longer than others.” Perhaps that explained why Dante was the most bloodthirsty, cruelest, of them. Though how he’d gotten that way probably didn’t matter. He just was. She daydreamed endlessly of slitting his throat, cutting his head off, or burning him up like one of those little straw voodoo dolls until he was a pile of ashes–after she’d filled his torso with long sharp needles. Incinerating him as Jeff and her had done years ago to that first pack of vampires. But how would she do that? Hmm. Lock them someplace they couldn’t get out of and torch it? She only had to find the right place and the right time. With her mind, make them stay there until their flesh and bones turned black. And so the seed of her plan was born and began to grow. She knew she couldn’t take this life much longer. Her soul was dying. And when it was completely gone, would she become like them? A demon? The storm pounded outside for another hour and when night claimed the world Dante led them out to hunt down more food. Heaven help her. It was to be another night of violence and death. If she could have wept she would have. If she could have lay down and died, she would have. But that night changed everything. They came across three teenagers, two girls and a boy, parked on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. The rain hadn’t let up and the kids couldn’t see the road well enough to drive so they’d pulled over. The car’s windows were foggy and the rain sliced around the white Blazer as the nearby trees swayed in the heavy wind. A perfect night for evil. A bad night for innocence. As the other nights Zebulon covered for her and she drank the blood from the dead girl. But Dante caught them and went into a rage. He grabbed the boy, the last one alive, and pushed him at her. “You drink and end him. Right now. Or you die.” The others were observing with coldness hidden behind their secretive faces. Zebulon was a stone statue. He couldn’t help her. Lightning illuminated the area around the car, the surrounding woods, and the terror on the boy’s face. He looked like Teddy. About the same age or a little older. His pale hair fell across his flushed face, his brown eyes were pleading for pity. For mercy. He’d seen his sisters–because that’s what they’d turned out to be–die in front of him. His sobs tore her shriveling heart apart. “Do it now!” Dante, at her side, painfully twisted her neck, forcing her mouth towards the boy’s neck. “Or you’ll die and I’ll go back and get those mewling kids of yours and that brother, his wife and your friend. And I’ll make sure they suffer so much before they die.” At that moment Jenny wished he’d just end her existence. She couldn’t slaughter the boy. But when Dante threatened to hurt her children, those she loved, her fury, a red-hot fire in her gut, exploded. She flung her mind at him and then her fists and he went down at her feet. He went down. By her strength of will alone. Her victory was short lived. He regained control, his lethal eyes flashing, and rose from the ground to face her. The other vampires, once they’d stopped gawking in shock, grabbed and held her. “You’re getting braver, Mutant. Stronger. I underestimated you and won’t do that again. Experiment over. I don’t need the trouble you bring. I’ve learned what I wanted to know. I don’t need you. Not anymore. Perhaps it’s time for you to go.” His hands closed around her neck. She felt herself lifted into the air. Her feet swinging. This could be it, she thought. End of the road. She wondered what death would be like and closed her eyes. Through the rain and storm noises a siren screeched, coming their way. Flickering crimson lights cut through the night and beamed across the wet tree trunks. Before the teenagers had been pulled from the car, one of them had called the cops. Of course. Teenagers had cell phones. It was time to leave. Swearing, Dante dropped her, spun around and snapped the boy’s neck. The body crumpled into the muddy grass. Jenny shrieked and threw herself at Dante but Zebulon stepped between them and drug her away, his whisper a hiss, “Don’t be stupid. You can’t beat him. Think of your children.” She collapsed in his arms. He was right, and it made her feel worse. She might have been able to beat Dante, him alone, but there were the other three. Might wasn’t good enough. She had to be sure before she tried again. Prepared. She had to have her plan to wipe them out in place first and foolproof. Or her family would never be safe. She had to exterminate all of them. Yes, even Zebulon. Though he’d shown her less malice, he was still a heartless killer. The five of them sped away through the night trees. When they arrived at the house they’d procured for the night Dante locked her in the cellar as punishment. He seemed to have forgotten her death sentence. “If I can’t trust you to behave. Perhaps a few days alone in the dark without sustenance will change your mind.” He dropped the piece of wood into the slots on the outside of the door, imprisoning her. Jenny was relieved to be alone. She’d felt a new strength course through her body as she’d attacked Dante and knew soon she’d be able to defeat him. It was good Zebulon had stopped her. She could have overpowered Dante but not all four of them at once. She would have lost. And they’d still be alive to continue their killing sprees. To kill Teddy and Sarah and anyone else they wanted. She needed to be smarter than them. Think. More than anything, as she’d seen that boy die she knew she wanted, needed, to go home to her children. More than anything. To protect them always against monsters like those who’d taken her. On the other hand, she burned to be free of them and wanted them gone forever in the worst way. Huddled in a corner of the cellar, horrified at what the vampires were probably doing out beyond the moldy walls–what if they were off rounding up her children or killing them, right now–and afraid of what was going to happen to her, she suddenly knew how to do it. Zebulon had let slip the first few days she’d been with them something about the only thing that could kill them was beheading or fire. She’d paid attention. She’d remembered. Once her eyes had adjusted to the dark she looked around. She was in an old fashioned concrete-walled cellar. A large one, but still a cellar. If she could lure the four into a place like this, lock them in and torch the house above and around it…she could destroy them. Why not this cellar? The locks on the outside door were strong as were the walls. No windows. She pulled herself to her feet and explored with hands and fingers. Her sight, when she concentrated, clearing up so she could almost see everything through a red haze. A large can of gasoline was stashed in a corner. A box of rags and a pile of covers were in another. Wooden shelves lined the walls. More than enough gas. More than enough fodder to burn. She found a box of matches on a concrete ledge next to the shelves. Shelves that were chock full of junk and would go up like dry kindling if touched by fire. In fact, the cellar was a hoarders dream. It’d make a great blazing bonfire. If she could keep them from getting out of it before the flames could do their work. There was another room, again with no windows, in the rear with a heavy metal door that had a huge padlock on the outside…even better. If she could lure them into it but keep herself outside, her plan could work. Conceivably. The house was made of and shingled in wood. Just a tinder box waiting to burst into flames. Why not now? Here? Why not? She’d been perfecting her mind control over the four vampires for weeks. Each time getting more and more domination over them. She’d wanted to gain more, but now there wasn’t time. In her heart, she knew she had to strike now. She’d had a premonition that the four were planning something really terrible. Soon. The time to destroy them was now. She thought of a way to entrap them, prayed it would work, and after preparing things around her, forced herself to sleep so she’d be ready. All her strength, her guile and her new abilities would be needed to pull off her plan. Waking from the noise of the vampires’ return, she moved to the other side of her prison closer to the main exit and waited. Upstairs she heard them fighting. Yelling at each other. Scuffling. They did that often. Dissention in the ranks, she supposed. Or their hunt hadn’t gone well. Their appetite unsatisfied. They were still hungry. Which would be even better for her. When they were hungry they weren’t as vigilant. Or as cautious. This is a crazy idea, she told herself. Crazy. No way could it work. But she was going to do it anyway. She couldn’t be with them one more day, one more minute. Something horrendous was about to happen. Maybe they were going to hit a school or a crowd of people at a mall. Whatever it was, it’d be really, really bad. This must work or she would die. And she no longer cared if she did. Taking the chance of ridding the world of them was worth it. As she’d come to believe, as long as she was with them, their prisoner, her family would be in danger. They and she’d never be free. Concentrating with everything she had, she sent a silent call to Dante and the others to come downstairs. Her mind strained, lulled and tugged at theirs. Every ounce of her strength, all her desperation, was put into it. Come to the cellar…there are humans hiding in the room at the back…fresh victims…fresh blood…down here. Come. And they did. All four of them. Her cage opened. “We think someone’s hiding down here.” Dante’s voice was strangely toneless. His eyes a little glassy. He looked at her but didn’t see her as he walked past to the small room on the other side of the cellar. She faked being weak. Uncaring. Lying against the wall by the door, lethargic. No threat at all. “Yes, we heard something,” he muttered after glancing and seeing the sorry state she was in. Satisfied she wasn’t capable of causing any trouble, his back turned to her and his hand went to the handle of the metal door. “Yes, I heard it, too. I think there are children,” she closed her eyes tightly for a moment as she pushed the thoughts and the words out, “hiding in a corner of that room behind the door. Three or more. I heard them crying. If not for me they would have come out and escaped. I’ve made sure they didn’t. I’ve saved them for you.” “Children? Hiding in here?” Dante repeated. His hand was turning the handle. Opening the door. It was a black pit inside. She pushed at Dante’s and the others’ minds again. Hard. Harder. Straining every fiber of her being. Using every trace she had left of her fading humanity and her new powers. Children. Fresh blood. Go inside and look in the far corner. You’re sooo hungry. Their blood is so sweet. Zebulon and Balthazar had caught up with Dante, their faces eager, their eyes slack. Shoulders hunched. Stooping down because of their height, they crowded in behind him and peered into the dark space. Aloysius was the only one who seemed suspicious. He lagged behind the others, his inhuman eyes on her. He halted before her, glared at her, but she gave one stronger mind push and like a reluctant lemming he followed after the others. It was working. She got up from the floor, picked up the gas can and slipped the matches out of her pocket. Making sure she kept her mind as vacant as possible to what she was doing, she went on tiptoes towards the vampires. If any of them suspected, the game would be over. She’d strewn rags and blankets all around, framing the metal door. Stealthily her body edged towards the smaller room. The vampires had entered it. She moved to the door and, as quietly as she could, closed it. Turned the key she’d found on a shelf and locked it. Her heart was beating so loud she thought she was having a heart attack. Hurry now! Before they sensed her true intention. Before they awoke from her mind control. She couldn’t believe it had worked. Stay. Stay. All is well, she told them. Rest. She sprinkled gas over everything in wide swathes and wildly threw lit matches as she backed out of the cellar. The fire, a hungry beast, took hold and the room blazed into hell. There. Done! She heard nothing, not a sound from the vampires inside. She didn’t know what they were doing in there, but she didn’t care. It was time for her to go. Stay. You are tired. Sleep. Sleep. Sprinting out the cellar door, she swung around with trembling hands and dropped the thick wooden beam down into the latches, locking the main exit from the outside. There were no sounds, no thoughts she could detect in the cellar or behind the metal door. She blocked her thoughts. Theirs. And waited. There were only the shrieks of the fire and its all-consuming flames. She only then let herself imagine the vampires realizing what she’d done. How she’d trapped and beaten them. How she, their powerless little mutant, had bested them. She imagined them yelling and raging at her to let them out…and then she imagined them screaming in shock and agony as they burned to cinders. Gone forever! For the first time in months Jenny smiled. She’d done it. It’d almost been too easy. As dawn tinged the horizon on another gray day she lingered outside beneath the shade of a towering tree and watched the house burn. The cellar and the lower floors went first and then the upper floor. The accelerant helped it go quickly and completely. Inside she cheered, but also prayed that the vampires couldn’t, wouldn’t get out. And that no one called the fire department before the building was reduced to ashes. No one did. It was an isolated house. Far from a town. The structure was soon a smoldering pile of fiery embers, a sea of flattened burnt wood. One big charcoal pit. She heard nothing from inside it. No voices, no thoughts. Just blessed silence. The vampires–even Dante–were no longer there. Her back slid down against the tree trunk, the release draining everything from her, and remained there for hours. Waiting. Watching. She had to be sure none of them had survived. If any of them did they’d kill her, her whole family, probably all of Summer Haven, and that’d be the end of it. As the hours passed nothing moved beneath the destruction. The sun was high in the sky, the embers cooling, as she turned and walked away. She kept to the shade, though on such an overcast day the sun wouldn’t bother her that much. Her smile was back. She was going home. She was safe. Her family was safe. It was a great day though it had begun to rain and, suddenly, even though she was free of the vampires, she found she still couldn’t transport herself anywhere. She tried over and over, but couldn’t. It didn’t matter. Perhaps it was weariness. Lack of blood. Didn’t matter. Because she’d won. She was free. She could finally and at long last go home. Sometime later she came up to a modest brick house and knocking at the door, asked the old woman who answered if she could make a phone call. The old woman, white hair haphazardly piled on her skinny head, and dressed in a baggy housedress that had seen better days, was distrustful of strangers at first but Jenny reassured her with her thoughts and the woman let her in. Jenny called Joey and asked him to come and get her. She didn’t have to ask twice. She was going home to her children.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 Jenny She told her story to Joey on the return drive to Summer Haven. He was so choked up with joy and relief that they had her back, unharmed, there were tears in his eyes and he hadn’t stopped smiling and looking at her. “I can’t believe you’re okay,” he said over and over. “I’d begun to think the worst. We all did. We didn’t hear from you. We were all so scared.” “Oh, there were times I didn’t think I’d make it, either. I lived minute to minute. I guess fate had something else in store for me. It gave me my life back.” He caught her up on Teddy and Sarah. She’d been surprised to hear that Andy had stepped in and helped with them. Let them live with him. But she was grateful. It was awkward at first, she had the feeling Joey was unsure of her, frightened, even. “No, brother, I haven’t turned into a sadistic bloodthirsty murderer even though I was their captive for a long time. If anything, Joey,” she’d whispered and laid a hand on his arm, “I found out just how different I was from them. Never having ever been human maybe they had no scruples, compassion or pity to begin with. They wallowed in being cruel. In tormenting their victims. I’m not like that, thank God. I don’t know why, but I’m not. In some ways the experience has helped me come to terms with what I’ve become. I know now that I’m not a monster. “And in the end I was stronger than them. Or strong enough to lure them into a trap and spring it. Damn lucky, too, I’d say. Being locked in that cellar the way I was; it having no windows, that inner room and all that flammable material lying around. I saw my chance and took it.” She rocked her head gently from side to side, trying not to remember the depraved things she’d witnessed. Been a part of. She had to always remember…it’d been against her will. “You sure they’re dead?” Joey asked for the fifth time. A niggling doubt taunted her deep inside somewhere but she ignored it. “I’m sure. I doused that house with gasoline, torched it, and didn’t leave until there was nothing left but a pile of smoldering rubble. If they’d survived it I would have known. They weren’t the forgiving kind. I’d be dead instead of them. “And I didn’t hear them in my head afterwards. I don’t hear them now.” “That’s good then, huh?” He grinned widely at her again. His eyes full of relief. “It is.” “Hey, Sis, what’s with all the silver in your hair? Makes you look scary weird.” She reached up and touched the unruly strands. “My new look.” Then she grinned back at him. “I’ll dye it as soon as I get home. Don’t want to scare the kids.” “Yeah.” After Joey had picked her up and made sure she was okay he’d used his cell phone to call Andy. Told him the good news and asked him to take the children to the farmhouse. “We should be there in about four hours.” She listened to the conversation and found she could hear Andy clearly on the other end. He was ecstatic she was okay and coming home. He said he’d have pizzas waiting at the farmhouse for everyone when they got there. Of course, he didn’t know she wouldn’t be able to eat them. He, as everyone else besides Joey, still thought she’d been abducted by bad humans. Joey telephoned his wife. She was closing the diner for the day and was coming for the celebration, too. Jenny couldn’t wait to get home. The trip seemed to last forever. When finally there she couldn’t stop hugging and kissing Teddy and Sarah, so thrilled to be with them again; they so happy to have her back. Amadeus, who hadn’t grown an inch she thought, leapt into her arms and started licking her face, meowing. She could have sworn the cat was saying missed you, missed you. Everyone was crying, except her, everyone was happy. Relieved beyond measure. The nightmare was over. She’d miraculously escaped from her kidnappers and was home. Safe. Hallelujah. Being home again was a euphoric dream. In the farmhouse with its homey comforts, her family and friends around her again, the vampires and the threat that had been tormenting her gone forever, she felt herself come alive again. Hope was rekindled. She could go on with her life. She’d cherish it more because she’d been so close to losing it all. Nothing made a person appreciate what they had more than that. “Don’t ever leave us again, Mom,” Sarah cried when she first threw her small body into her arms. “I missed you so bad!” The child wept as Jenny stroked her head and held her close. It felt good to have her baby in her embrace. The world was right again. Teddy held back for a moment, as if he couldn’t believe his eyes, and then he, too, ran up and clamped his arms around her. “Mom, I thought I’d never see you again.” He tried to hide his tears but when he pulled away she saw them glistening on his cheeks. “I love you,” he breathed soft and low; red faced. It was the best present he could have given her. Andy, when he saw her, wrapped his arms around her and kissed her. On the lips. She was so startled she didn’t know what to say. There it was in the softness of his kiss. In his gaze and in the smile on his face. Joy and relief. The beginning of love. Joey was right. Andy did have deep feelings for her. His love was just another complication as far as she was concerned but she was so grateful to be home nothing else mattered. They were sitting at Jenny’s kitchen table. Jenny, Teddy, Sarah, Joey, Laurie and Andy. It was late afternoon. The day still overcast. But the light coming in the windows was a soft shade of rose. Pizza boxes littered the table. Some were empty. “I never gave up believing you were alive, Jenny,” Andy was saying. “None of us did. That you’d be home again. And here you are. Safe and sound. It’s almost unbelievable. A miracle really. Can you talk about it?” His words were hesitant. She put her hands up, glancing at the others in turn. “All of you want to know what happened to me all these weeks? What I went through? Who took me and why? How I escaped?” Andy had an expectant expression on his face. Joey had a worried one on his. She was careful with what she said next because her children, all wide eyes and sharp ears, were listening, too. “Are we still in danger?” Teddy asked in a low voice. “Are those men who took us, took you, still out there?” She shook her head. “No. And they were the same men that have been taking the people around here.” She didn’t tell her son they also killed them. He didn’t need to know that. She wasn’t about to confess what had actually happened to her so she spun out the cover lie she’d created on the ride home. “They broke into the house. I guess looking for food, money, guns or something. They knew the police were looking for them and wanted, I guess, some hostages for protection. I convinced them to take me instead of you children. They didn’t kill me. Seems one of them was a fan of my books.” She laughed softly, as if it were an inside joke. She looked at Andy now. “So I was a curiosity to them. A celebrity. Maybe they thought they could get money for me. Ha. I told them I wasn’t worth a dime. Most authors aren’t.” “At first they fought among themselves as to what to do with me. Then I persuaded them into letting me chronicle their lives and it kept me alive. Flattery works even with criminals. The chance to be famous, to be written about, is a strong bait. “I learned their habits, pretended to take notes for a book about them, waited for my chance, and when it came, a moment when their guard was down, I flew the coop. I called the cops on them. We don’t have to be afraid any longer. I know what they look like. Who they are. They’d been planning to disappear from the area, flee to Canada, I think, and when I escaped I’m sure they took off. They’re long gone.” Her story was full of holes, and she was aware of how skeptical Andy and Laurie seemed by it, but they were so thankful to have her home they didn’t challenge what she said. “Anything else, right now, I don’t want to talk about.” They accepted her reticence as a sign of trauma; her fragile state of body and mind, like her silvered hair, which only Sarah had the nerve to inquire about. Jenny told her fright had done it, but she’d fix it tomorrow. Sarah accepted that explanation with an innocence only a child could have. “Mom, they were strange men, though, weren’t they?” Sarah asked suddenly. “They were giants. They moved faster than the wind. They had sharp teeth, too.” Jenny, her heart jumping, was quick to explain. “Well, they were tall. They could run fast, too.” “They was giants,” her daughter repeated. Teddy, his eyes lowered, said nothing. Jenny wondered how much he remembered about the men who’d taken them, but the boy didn’t add anything to what his sister had said and she was glad of that. Andy was already staring at her in an odd way. “There’s more, isn’t there?” Andy whispered, sidling up beside her, when she went to pour a cup of coffee. Earlier in the day, while she’d made her way through the woods to find a telephone to call Joey, she’d fed on small animals. Good thing, or she’d be starving about now. And Andy would be looking like a good snack. “I can’t talk about it, Andy. Not yet. It’s too difficult.” And it was. But not for the reasons she was trying to convince Andy of. She hated lying. Too much had happened too fast. She needed time to let everything soak in. Needed time to organize her thoughts. Get her story straight. Recharge. Truly realize she was safe and home. “Well, I’m here when you want to talk,” Andy said in a soft voice. “Anytime. I won’t judge, either. You saved your children’s lives. In the end, saved your own life. I’m sure you did what you had to to survive. I admire you for that. In my eyes you’re a resourceful, valiant woman.” “Thank you, Andy.” She hadn’t been able to meet his eyes. “And thank you for taking care of Teddy and Sarah like you did. I don’t know how I’m going to repay you.” “I wanted to help. It was a pleasure and we became great friends. It was nice having someone other than myself to care about. Got my mind off my problems.” “You did more than most friends would have done. You put off your own life to help my kids. You’re a good man, Andy.” He gently ran his hand down the side of her face and she tried not to flinch. “I’m glad you think that. It made everything worthwhile then.” After all the catching up was finished, Joey took her aside into the living room. Amadeus followed and climbed up one leg of her jeans. She caught the kitten under its skinny belly and kissed it on its little face. “Detective Bradley’s coming over later this evening. I thought I’d warn you.” “I thought he went back to St. Louis?” “He did. Soon as I heard from you this morning I called him and let him know you were free. He said he wanted to speak to you in person and was catching the next flight out.” She groaned. “He couldn’t wait until tomorrow? I’ve had an awful time of it. I was hoping for a quiet night alone with my kids after I got rid of the company.” Her brother laughed, lounging against the wall in the front room. The sun was setting and there were shadows everywhere. “Nah, you’re not getting rid of us that quick. It’s a party. You’re lucky we haven’t alerted everyone in town yet or you’d have an enormous crowd here. We thought we’d wait until tomorrow for that. “I also called Chief Donald. I imagine he’ll be here soon. He wants to talk to you, too.” “I bet he does.” “The news media will be here as soon as they get wind of your return. I didn’t call them but I’m sure someone will leak the news sooner or later.” “Aaaah…better later,” she moaned. “Or never.” “You don’t have to talk to them. Just lock the doors and don’t answer. Give me a written statement and I’ll make it for you. No muss, no fuss.” “Thanks, Joey. I’ll probably do that.” She was tired, more of the mind than the body, but she was okay. Her nightmare was over. She was free. Home with her children. Suddenly the wonder of it all made her giddy. She didn’t even care that Chief Donald and Detective Bradley were on their way. Joey was right. It was a party. She could stay awake all night. “The detective knows about the vampires,” Joey let the cat out of the bag. “You can tell him what really happened during your abduction, but what are you going to say to Chief Donald?” “I’ve been thinking about that. I’ll figure out something. The vampires are gone, the murders will stop. The cops will fade out of the picture. All will end well. In time it’ll be yesterday’s news and the Chief’s interest will go somewhere else. I’ll just play for time.” The kids came into the room and pulled her back into the kitchen with Andy and Laurie. They didn’t want her out of their sight for long. Chief Donald knocked on the door as they were eating the last of the pizza and Joey invited him in. Sitting at the table with the rest of them, Jenny gave him the same yarn, more or less, she’d given Andy, the children and Laurie. He listened, nodding, and didn’t say anything until she was done. “So that’s your story, huh?” His face was emotionless but she thought she detected a hint of cynicism. “They butchered all their victims around here but are now no longer a threat because they’ve vamoosed up to Canada? They kidnapped you, let you live because you’re an author, and you got away from them? Unhurt?” “That’s the story.” She thought he was going to say something else but he didn’t. He looked at Joey, who was twiddling his thumbs across the table, and released a large sigh. Closed his notebook. “Is that all, Chief Donald?” she asked, yawning. Acting exhausted so he’d get the clue. “For now. I’ll send a sketch artist out tomorrow to draw up likenesses. The F.B.I. could come out eventually and question you. Now that other states, another country is involved. You sure you don’t want to visit the hospital; have them check you out? I’d feel better if you did.” Her breath caught. “No. I’ve had more than enough hospital time. Whatever happened to me during my abduction, I’m dealing with it. I just want to get some rest. Be with my family. Go back to work and resume my life. Normalcy. That’s all I need to be myself again.” “Okay. It’s your call. You look and sound sane to me.” An authentic grin graced his face and even more surprising, he got up and gave her a quick hug. “I’m real happy you’re okay. Your kids, your brother, were a basket case. Andy wasn’t much better.” He sent a sidelong glance at him. Andy nodded back, all serious. “Everyone in town was praying for you,” Chief Donald told her. He must have had a hard day, his uniform was wrinkled and there were dirt stains on his pants. “There’s going to be a lot of relieved people when they hear the good news. I’m sure by tomorrow morning it’ll be all the buzz at your brother’s diner. The entire town will know soon after. Expect lots of congratulatory telephone calls and spontaneous amiable meetings on the streets. Some may even find themselves at your door with homemade goodies for you and your family. You’ve been the talk of the town for weeks.” After she ushered the police officer from the house and closed the door she looked at Joey, who’d followed them. She could hear the others talking in the kitchen. Laurie was laughing. Sarah was singing some silly song along with Andy. “I don’t think he believed a word of what I said, but he sure seemed happy that I made it out alive. Sweet of him.” “It is. I guess with age we’re all getting nicer. Even Rusty Donald.” In the kitchen she announced, “I’m exhausted. Party’s over. Time for everyone to go home. Come back tomorrow.” They griped some but got up to leave. “Come on by for breakfast everyone,” Laurie offered. “At the diner. On the house.” “Thanks Laurie,” Jenny said. The next day was Saturday. “If I’m up to it I just might take you up on that. But not too early.” “No, not too early. For you we’ll make breakfast anytime.” “Thanks.” “I’ll drop Laurie at home and come back.” Joey was looking at her. Laurie’s attention was taken by saying goodnight to the kids. “Joey, you don’t have to stick around any longer if you’re tired. It’s after eleven. It’s been a long day for both of us. Go on home with your wife.” “You sure?” He spoke so the others couldn’t hear. “Detective Bradley is the next spirit to appear to you tonight, Scrooge.” A ghost of a chuckle. “Sure you can handle him alone?” “Oh, he’s the easy one. I can tell him the truth, mostly, and not have to lie my ass off.” “That you can.” Her brother stretched, yawned. “You know, I am bushed. Worrying for weeks and driving all day does that to me. I think I will go home with Laurie” “Then go.” She watched him and his wife drive off in his truck. Andy was the last to go. She could tell he really wanted to stay and talk more but she used her exhaustion as an excuse. “Another time, Andy. I appreciate all you’ve done. The kids and all. But right now I really need time with them and rest. My own bed. I’m so tired. Tommorow?” He accepted that and left with a gentle smile, saying, “But when you want to talk, be it anytime day or night. I’m here. Don’t forget that.” There was something in the way he looked at her that tipped her off that he suspected there was more to the story she’d given everyone and he knew it. “I won’t forget.” Then she gently closed the door behind him and rejoined her kids. The house was silent and as welcome as an old fluffy robe. The night dark and no longer filled with monsters she was afraid of. She’d defeated them. Later that night, in her children’s bedrooms she stroked their warm foreheads and brushed the hair from their sleeping faces. Laid soft kisses on their cheeks and smiled as they stirred in their sleep. Her heart was content for the first time in a long while. She didn’t care that she was a vampire, she could deal with it, but to be with her children again and to know they were alive and safe was the sweetest feeling she’d ever known. “I’m never going to leave you again. Wild horses couldn’t drag me away. I promise,” she whispered to each of them before going downstairs to wait for the detective. She drifted into a peaceful sleep on the couch with the kitten, a ball of warm fur, curled on her lap. Its purr rumbled in the quiet house until it fell asleep. Jenny had no dreams. Just heavenly guilt-free, horror-free rest. She was home. She. Was. Safe. Bradley arrived two hours later. She woke to the knocking at the door and let him in. He stepped inside and gave her a huge hug. “How was your flight?” “Bumpy. There was a storm over Missouri. But I made it. I’m here.” The cat hissed at the intruder, tiny back up and fur sticking out like a porcupine, protecting its mistress. “Amadeus, behave yourself. You remember Detective Bradley.” Jenny scooped the cat up in her hands and put it on the couch behind her where it continued to protest. Sounded more like a mouse growling. The detective looked at her. “You’re one damn lucky woman, Jenny Sanders. You lived through that attack in St. Louis and now you’ve survived captivity with the monsters who took you.” “I’m damn lucky, yes,” she responded with a wan smile. He wasn’t fooled. “What did you do? How did you beat them? Escape?” Though the detective believed in the vampires, she hoped he hadn’t guessed the truth about her being one. Though at times, she wondered if he suspected something, too. He stared intently at her, waiting for…what she didn’t know. His thoughts were unreadable. Perhaps his will was a wall she couldn’t break through. She was beginning to understand there were some people whose minds she couldn’t breach and she didn’t know why. Apparently he was sometimes one of them. “Were they the ones who killed your husband? Were they really vampires?” he asked. She nodded. “And more. You have no idea. Come on in and I’ll tell you all about it and them.” She warmed up leftover pizza and coffee for him. They had the conversation. The story, ninety-five percent truth, was different from the one she’d told everyone else but Joey. Bradley thought she’d trapped and burned the vampires utilizing just normal human cunning. And luck. The story worked or so she hoped. “So the vampires–God, I still have a hard time saying that–let you trick and lock them in a cellar and burn it down around their ears? Just like that?” “Well, yes. But as I said, I was unbelievably lucky.” “How did you get them into the cellar?” “I’d convinced them I wouldn’t betray them or run away. I couldn’t escape without knowing they were no longer a danger to my family. I told them there were humans hiding down in the cellar. That I’d heard them. Children. “They hadn’t fed yet, couldn’t wait to see for themselves and filed into the room easy as you please. I slammed the door and bolted it behind them. I couldn’t believe they fell for it. I didn’t hang around. I set the place on fire with gasoline I’d found down there. Once outside I watched the place burn down to the ground. I went to a neighboring house to call the fire department. I made sure the fire had done its damage first. Made sure the vampires were destroyed.” “Pretty clever of you. So that by the time the firefighters showed up it was all over?” “Yep.” Detective Bradley scratched his day old beard. “Not that they didn’t deserve it. I know, for you, it was the only way. But I would have liked to have captured at least one of them for interrogation. Study. Hell, just to see for myself what a vampire really looks and acts like.” “Might have gotten yourself killed and a bunch of others, too. You still want undeniable proof.” He nodded. “You got me there. I mean, I believe vampires exist but there’s a tiny part of me that’s still a skeptic. I need to be sure.” Inwardly she sighed. “I know the feeling. I’m sorry. I had no choice. Destroying them was more important than coming back with a live specimen.” Her voice fell to a whisper. “They were killing every night and were as volatile as nitroglycerin. I was terrified for my own life every second. I had to do what I did the way I did it.” His gaze returned to her and his voice was resigned. “Don’t be sorry. You did the right thing. They were monsters. Who are we fooling? I’ve seen the crime scenes. No jail cell or police force I know of could have contained them. If what I suspect was true, the powers they had, no natural way any human could have dealt with them. You did us a huge favor. “Are you sure they’re dead?” “Very. There was nothing left but ashes.” “Then it’s finally over.” Reclining in his chair, his hands gathered up his notebook and pen. There was weariness in his every move. Tonight he looked old. “Feels like I’ve been chasing these creatures forever. I can’t believe it’s over. Thank God.” Five years, she thought, since his daughter’s death. Yes, it would seem like forever. “I’ll be traveling down there to examine the burnt building. I won’t have peace of mind until I can find what’s left of them.” “Their remains?” That puzzled her. “Yes.” “Won’t be any. One of them once told me when they die they don’t leave anything behind. Not even melted flesh or bone fragments. Just ashy residue. Nothing you can connect to a once living being.” “You know that, also, do you, from the last time you crispy-crittered that gang of them in the theater?” She almost laughed, but didn’t. “I do.” “Ah. Well, I’m going down there to see for myself anyway. Can you draw me a simple map of where the house is and where the cellar was located?” “I can do that.” They talked a little longer. She drew him the map and described where the cellar’s inner room had been. “I know you’ve been through an ordeal so I’ll get out of here and leave you alone. And Jenny, if I didn’t say it before, I’ll say it now. I’m overjoyed you got away alive. So grateful those monsters are gone. I can’t thank you enough. My daughter can finally rest in peace.” “My husband and all the others that died by their hands, as well.” For the second time he wrapped her in a bear hug. Somewhere along the way they’d become friends. It was nice to have someone else on her and Joey’s side. Someone else who believed in what they knew to be true. She wished she could trust him enough to tell him she was infected. Oh well. “You driving down there right now?” “I am. Get it done. I’ll swing by here one last time and see how you’re doing before I fly back to St. Louis. I’ve already taken too many days off. I can’t afford to lose my job. Not with jobs the way they are these days.” “I know. I’m thankful my job’s waiting for me. Joey said he’d talked to my boss and I can come back any time I want. He didn’t replace me.” “Nice boss.” “He is. Like the rest of the town. They’ve been good to my children and me. Joey says there’s a party tomorrow at the diner. The whole town, no doubt, will be there.” She feigned irritation. “I suppose there’ll be plenty of questions for me to answer. Oh, boy.” “I’ll hurry back then.” He smiled as he got up from the table. “After weeks eating there most every day I’ve become addicted to your brother’s food. There going to be cake?” “Most likely.” She laughed and walked him to the door. “Good night.” “Good night, lucky lady.” Out in the dark, as his rented car puttered down the ribbon of road, it was no more than flashes that at first caught her eye, a line of small luminous orbs that skittered around the corner of the house towards the backyard so rapidly she immediately doubted she’d seen them. But she had. Her eyesight was really good these days. What were they? She ran through the house and out into the yard behind it, her eyes searching. There was nothing. Whatever they’d been they were gone. An uneasy certainty blossomed in the pit of her stomach. Ghosts. They were ghosts. She remembered what the librarian had told her. The girl at the store. She remembered the rumors about the farmhouse being haunted. The sightings. She was too sleepy to fret over it on top of all she’d been through. She’d worry tomorrow, as she’d feed tomorrow. Right before dawn before the kids got up. Vampire or not, her bed embraced her like a cloud. Her room was heaven. She fell asleep. No dreams. Not a one. And that was a good thing. She felt as if she’d been released from hell and her freedom, being with her children again, was sweeter than anything she’d ever tasted. Anything she ever would.",

      "content": "Chapter 22 The Ghost She was hunting in the murky woods the next morning before the day began, trying not to think about the radiant orbs she’d seen the night before outside the house. Her hunger made that easy. She had weeks of starving to offset. Now, she found, it was easy to hypnotize the animals and gently take only what she needed from them. It made her happy to know she’d finally mastered it. The hardest thing was resuming the animal blood after she’d had a taste of human; though because of Zebulon she’d never drank much. It didn’t matter. She looked at people now and again craved their blood. It took willpower not to give in. Last night, with all the people around her, had been difficult. Every time she felt the urge, images of her children rose in her mind and somehow she’d fought it off. It would take time to be where she’d been before she’d been abducted. It’d take work. Again it didn’t matter. When Teddy and Sarah had clomped downstairs in the morning and she gathered them in her arms, all was right in her world. She hummed an old Dylan song as she made them bacon and eggs. Just so happy to be with them again. After breakfast the doorbell rang and Sarah skipped off to answer it. “Mom, it’s Andy!” “Couldn’t stay away, huh?” Jenny teased when Sarah dragged him by the hand into the kitchen. “Nope, I couldn’t.” His eyes studied her face. There was a silly grin on his. “I just had to make sure last night wasn’t a dream, Jenny. You’re really okay. Really home. “I missed these monkeys, too.” He tousled her daughter’s hair and the girl threw him an amused look. “I got used to seeing them every day, their shenanigans. Taking care of them.” Jenny, in a long-sleeved shirt to cover her cold flesh, stood behind Teddy, her arms wrapped around his shoulders. “Oh, I understand. They grow on you.” She laid a kiss on her son’s head. “And Joey sent me over here to bring you three to the diner for breakfast.” “We already had breakfast,” Sarah piped up. “Well, then for lunch.” “It’s a welcome home party, isn’t it?” she guessed. “A big one. I just left there and there must be fifty people waiting to see you. See you’re all right. The place is packed.” “Ain’t going to get out of it, am I?” “Nope. All of you get on your glad rags and I’ll ferry you to party central.” So they did. It was a bright sunny day but with sunglasses and her usual getup she found the sunlight didn’t affect her as it once had. She didn’t need a hat at all. Her body was adapting. She had the feeling one day she would be able to walk in the sun again. The gathering at the diner wasn’t as bad as she thought it’d be. It touched her so many people were there to welcome her home though the smell of their warm blood was unnerving at first. She got over it. And there was cake. Detective Bradley never showed up and she began to worry. *** When she got home she called Bradley’s cell phone. It went to voice message, she left a few words and hung up. Six hours and three messages later she hadn’t gotten a hold of him. She called his department’s telephone number and talked to his partner, Ross Colter. “No, I haven’t heard from Ben since he flew out yesterday. That’s not like him. We keep in close contact, especially when he’s on a case. When was the last time you heard from him?” “I saw him last night. But he isn’t answering his cell phone. I’ve tried for hours.” “Well, let’s give him until tomorrow. Ben can be mysterious when he wants to be. To tell you the truth, I’ve been concerned myself about the guy since his daughter died. He hasn’t been the same. Acting secretive and all. Always running off to God knows where to do God knows what. Reading all these books on the occult.” She didn’t comment on that but finished the phone call with, “Detective Colter, if you hear from him will you please call me?” “Is this to do with a case? The one he’s working on?” It was easier to say, “It is.” “Okay. Tell you what. If I hear from him I’ll tell him you called and to please call you. Would that do?” “It would.” “And if you hear from him, Mrs. Sanders, ask him to report in or contact me, please?” “I’ll do that. Thank you, Detective Colter. It was nice talking to you.” “Same here. So delighted to know you’re back home and okay. Ben was really worried about you.” “Thank you.” She hung up, her uneasiness growing, and finished getting clothes ready for Sarah and Teddy to wear the next day to school. Now that there was no longer a threat it was time for them to go back. They’d missed enough. The rest of the evening, preparing and eating supper, spending time with her children and doing the things they used to do, was so normal it nearly lulled her into believing the last weeks hadn’t happened. But they had. Sudden jarring memories would sneak up on her and the horror of those days and nights she’d spent with the vampires would stop the blood in her veins; take her breath away. Detective Bradley had mentioned the possibility of a delayed reaction to the ordeal she’d gone through. Her mind said: This must be what he was talking about. Nightmare vignettes…during the day. As the hours went by she began to think there was something else going on. She couldn’t shake the dread that grew stronger every hour. Something still isn’t right. Something. The children went to bed. Joey phoned to check up on her. He’d been worse than a mother hen since she’d returned. She luxuriated in the joy of being home. Being alone again. Free and safe. Was this what a prisoner felt like once he’d come home from prison? Probably. When the kids were asleep and there was no chance Andy or anyone else would stop by she entered the woods. Disquiet heavy upon her she kept the farmhouse with its faint lights emanating from the windows always in her sight. It was a chilly late November night. Even in Florida, at times, it felt like Illinois to her. Then again that fall, the locals said, was unseasonably cold. No moon showed through the clouds, but she could see everything. Her speed and her strength had increased. It was as if she were changing every moment into something…else. A hybrid far superior to the original. The fox she’d caught and drank from had wobbled away into the underbrush when she was first aware someone or something was tracking her. She kept pivoting around thinking she could catch them. There was never anyone or anything there. She hurried home. When she got near the house she saw those strange illuminated orbs again bouncing and moving around it. Shaking her head, shutting her eyes for a second, they were still there when she opened them. She chased the lights around the side of the house where they evaporated before her eyes. Where they really ghosts? She didn’t know but she had no doubt they were haunting her, her home, for a reason. Trying to tell her something. But what? She went to bed, though she had a hard time sleeping, even with the gentle rain that had begun. Tap, tapping so softly on the roof. Her mind was so uneasy. Where was Detective Bradley…what were those strange lights…and why did she feel so troubled? The telephone call came in the middle of the night. It shattered not only her rest but also her new sense of security. Scared Amadeus. The cat had been snuggling under the covers beside her and had, for no reason she could see, began meowing. It wiggled from her grasp and flew off the bed, ran to the window and jumped up on the windowsill. Something outside had captured its attention. It sat frozen, staring out into the rainy night. Jenny answered the phone. “Mrs. Jenny Sanders?” “Yes?” She sat up in bed. The house was so quiet. The dark so deep. She could hear the rain on the gutters and the leaves of the trees. “I hate to wake you, but it’s important. This is Detective Colter, Ben Bradley’s partner? I talked to you earlier today, remember?” “I remember.” There was something in the man’s voice that presaged bad news. Real bad news. “What’s wrong?” “I thought you should know, Detective Bradley was involved in a car accident tonight.” “A car accident? Is he okay?” “No, I’m sorry to say, it was a fatal accident. Ben’s dead.” She heard the shocked sadness in the man’s voice. She felt it inside her. Oh no. “What happened?” Now she was wide awake. The rain was drumming harder on the house. The wind wept softly. Lightning filled the room with a brilliant sunburst. “We aren’t sure yet. I just got the news from a State Trooper, Will Smitherton, who found him. He said it seemed as if the rental car must have somehow gone off the road and into a deep culvert. Rolled. Slick country roads. The hard rain. The car was totaled. Ben was dead.” “I’m so sorry, Detective Colter. He talked about you; said you two weren’t only partners but longtime friends. You played poker every week. Liked to go to the shooting range together. I liked him.” “He was one in a million, for sure. A fine man and a good cop. The best. He had a sixth sense when it came to catching bad guys.” The man’s voice caught. He was in pain. “Anyway, I thought you should know so you stop worrying about him. He’s not going to call you now.” “Thank you. That was kind. Again, I’m so sorry.” The phone went dead. She hung up. Then buried her face in her hands. Detective Bradley was dead. Dead. She hadn’t known him that well but the loss stabbed a hole in her anyway. She had trusted him. Admired and liked him. A lot. He’d believed in vampires. He’d believed her. Now he was dead. Like Jeff. Gone forever. Of course she couldn’t shed a tear. At least she still experienced sadness and wondered if even that human emotion would someday elude her as well. She hoped not. If sadness went, would love be far behind? She didn’t know and didn’t want to. Her feeling of disquiet mingled with dread. It wasn’t just Bradley’s strange and sudden death it was…. Her eyes traveled to the window. Amadeus had stretched tiny paws up high onto the glass. Its body extended skinny and long. The cat was silent. Not a sound was coming from its furry mouth. It dropped from the sill and darted underneath the bed. Because hovering on the other side of the window’s glass, in the dark rain, was a pale figure beckoning her with ghostly hands. Come to the window. Raise it. Come. Stunned, she left the bed and moved closer. The ghost’s hand gestured in an upward motion. She opened the window. The figure somehow sparked a memory in her. The face, initially, was a swirling misty whiteness she couldn’t recognize. Then the figure, face and all, grew clear. “Jeff?” She was too astonished to utter another word. Her mind told her she was seeing things. She blinked twice, nice and slow. He was still there. Jeff. Her dead husband. Floating twelve feet off the ground. Smiling in at her. It’s me, sweetheart. I know. It’s a shock. But try to get over that because I can’t stay long. Even the afterlife has rules. “God, Jeff, I’ve missed you! The kids have, too. You won’t believe what’s happened since you’ve been gone.” There’s something I have to tell you. “Jeff. I’m a vampire. Those men who killed you, they were vampires, and they made me a vampire! It’s been so hard since you died. They kidnapped me and–” Jenny, listen! I haven’t got much time. “–Forced me to help them kill people, drink human blood. Oh, Jeff.” Her fingers reached for her husband. Seeing him again; hearing his voice, she was overcome with a crushing sense of loss. The weight of it so heavy she could barely stay upright. Jeff had been the strong one. Their protector. “They threatened our children’s lives if I didn’t go with them and do as they said. But I tricked them. I got away. I burned them to ashes like we did those vampires in the theater. Remember?” I need to warn you. “Oh, Jeff. Why does life have to be so hard? Why did you leave us?” Hush! You, Teddy and Sarah are still in danger. Listen! Her husband’s grim expression, the way his eyes bored into hers sucked the words right out of her mouth. Chastised, she whispered softly, “Tell me what you need to tell me.” I know all about the vampires, Jenny. But you were wrong. Dante wasn’t the strongest one or the leader. The quiet one, Aloysius was. He was the one with the true power; hid behind the others to conceal his position. He’s the one who can bring and will bring more of his kind into this world. And because enough years have passed, enough blood ingested, he’s acquired the power and learned the secret of bringing them here. Very soon. Many, many more like him. An army to follow him and bleed humanity dry. It’ll be an apocalypse. The world as we knew it will cease to exist. Forever. “But the vampires are dead. I destroyed them.” No. Aloysius didn’t die. He was strong enough to escape the fire. Cover his tracks. Now he wants revenge. He killed that detective friend of yours. Made it look like a car accident. It wasn’t. Aloysius tortured and killed him. Then put him in the car and crashed it. “Bradley?” She felt sick to her stomach. “No!” Yes, Detective Bradley. I’m sorry, Jenny. I know he was your friend. Aloysius is coming for Teddy and Sarah. For you. He’ll be here before dawn. You must take our children someplace else. Some place safe. Now! “Where?” Someplace Aloysius doesn’t know of. Andy’s house. “You know about Andy?” I know. He cares for you. Teddy. Sarah. He’s a good man. Go there. “But it’s the middle of the night?” Andy won’t mind. There’s not much time. Go there now. “All right. We will.” Once our kids are safe come back here and destroy Aloysius once and for all. “If I couldn’t kill him before, if he’s so strong, how can I now? Alone?” Listen and I’ll tell you. And she listened, in shocked amazement, as he told her how. She’d heard the same solution somewhere before, but she couldn’t remember where. “You sure that will work? It sounds almost too simple.” It’ll work. Trust me. I’ll be here to help you. “Jeff, I’m scared.” I know. You must do this, my love. If you want our children to live and you want to remain here with them. Aloysius will never stop until all of you are dead. He hates you. He’s afraid of you. You could ruin his plans. He knows you have great power. “I’ll try to kill him.” And Jenny? “Yes?” Tell Andy the truth about everything. He’ll be a help to you. You need to tell him anyway if this is to work. “Tell him about the vampires, past and present, everything?” She took a deep breath. “And that I’m one?” She met her husband’s unearthly eyes and all the years, the love that had once existed between them, enveloped her. The memories now tinged with a bittersweet sadness. He smiled. Everything. It’s not your fault you were turned. And you’re right, your goodness will protect you from becoming the monster you might have become. You’ll go on to fight the evil that the others are. Tell Andy. He’ll understand. He needs to know. Trust me. Trust him. You’ll need allies in the days to come. For worse is ahead. “Worse is ahead? What does that mean?” There’s no time to explain now. Go to Andy’s. Do what you have to do. Jenny, I’m afraid for you and the children. “Okay. I’ll take the kids and go to Andy’s. I’ll tell him everything.” Beneath the bed Amadeus was mewling. Hurry. Her dead husband’s ghost dissipated bit by bit. I’ll love you forever and always, my sweet Jenny. I’m proud of you. Give our children my love. I miss them so much. Tell them I’m watching over them. Always. He blinked into nothingness. The clock on the nightstand said 1:32 a.m. She called Andy. “Jenny, do you know it’s after one-thirty?” His voice a raspy whisper. “I know. I’m in trouble. Can me and the kids come over? I need your help. I’ll explain it all when I get there.” She had to give him credit. He didn’t hesitate. “Then, by all means, come over. I’ll put on a pot of coffee.” He gave her his address and she memorized it. She’d never been to his house. Tonight would be a first. “And Andy?” “Yes?” “Can I borrow that spare bow and arrow of yours? A few arrows? There also might be a few other things I’m going to need but we’ll discuss it when I get there.” He didn’t answer for a moment, then, “Why?” “Like I said I’ll tell you when I get there. We’re in a kind of hurry now. Just get the bow and arrows out for me, please?” Another pause. “Okay. I’ll get them out.” He seemed wide awake now. “Thanks Andy. See you in a few minutes. You’re saving our lives.” She didn’t give him a chance to say anything else before she hung up. Her feeling of danger had ratcheted up a thousand percent. There wasn’t much time. Danger, a devouring beast with super speed, was near and rushing at them. She telephoned Joey, woke him up, too, and told him what was going on. Where they were going and why. She left out the incident with Jeff’s ghost. The news about Bradley’s murder. What she was planning to do. There wasn’t time. He wanted to meet her at Andy’s, bless his heart, but she told him no, there was nothing he could do. Stay put. See you tomorrow. “I’ll tell you everything tomorrow. If I’m still alive.” She got the kids up and helped them quickly pack. Getting down her mother’s cardboard box tied with a shoestring from the closet shelf she dumped some of its contents into a brown paper bag and took it with her out to the car; placed it on the floor of the front passenger seat. In twenty minutes they were driving towards Andy’s and she was relieved beyond measure. Just what they absolutely needed crammed into three suitcases. Just in case. “We going to go into hiding again?” Sarah, half asleep, muttered. Amadeus was clutched in her arms. The cat wasn’t happy. It never liked being in the car. Sarah and Teddy were in their pajamas. There hadn’t been time to get them dressed. Jenny, herself, had practically jumped into a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt. Of course, she had moved really fast. “Well, duh, silly,” Teddy responded. “Hence the middle-of-the-night road trip.” “We’re going to Andy’s,” Jenny said. “Don’t ask me anything else about why. I can’t tell you.” “Yeah!” Sarah cheered. “We just left. I like being there, though. With Andy. So does kitty.” She hugged the cat until it squeaked in protest. “It’s like going to a second home.” “It wasn’t bad,” Teddy agreed. “Andy cooks better than you, Mom.” “Thanks.” She was too scared for her kids to be able to think of anything else. The further away from the farmhouse they got, the better she’d feel. The roads were washed in spectral gloom. The rain came down at a steady clip. No moonlight. The wind whipped bits of limbs and wet leaves across the car’s windshield as the wipers fought off the clingy debris. She sped into Andy’s driveway and steered the car around the curve and parked in the back of the house. The house was lit up. Andy was waiting at the front door. A confused smile on his face. “I don’t want anyone knowing we’re here. Can I put my car in your garage?” was the first thing she asked as Teddy and Sarah darted past him and into the house. “Sure. Let me grab my car keys and move it out and you can pull yours in.” After they’d done that, Andy helped settle the kids in the guest room. He’d brought out an air mattress for her and had it made, covers, pillow and all. She didn’t have the heart to tell him she might not need it. They put the children to bed and she followed him into the kitchen. “I don’t know about you,” he said, “but I could use a late night snack. All this excitement has made me hungry.” “I’m not real hungry myself. I’m too worked up. But you go ahead.” “How about a cup of hot chocolate at least?” “That I could take.” The house had fallen silent. The children, tired from the excitement and the rush over, had gone to sleep immediately. Jenny had asked Andy to turn off as many lights in the house as he could. He did it without question. In the kitchen they looked at each other. The dim fifteen-watt bulb installed above the oven spread just enough light to see what they were doing. When the cocoa was done, a sandwich made for Andy, the two of them sat face to face at the table. “Nice house,” she commented, sipping the chocolate. It actually tasted good and that pleasantly surprised her. “Like you, I renovated it myself. Put a lot of sweat and blood into it. You should have seen it before I moved in. It was a mess.” Her eyes toured the kitchen, took note of the bow and arrow in its snug leather sheath propped in the corner, and came back to him. “I really like it. So cheerfully cozy.” “That’s what I was going for.” He smiled. “Andy, I don’t know how to thank you for all of this. And everything else you’ve done since we moved here. I’m in your debt.” “Nonsense. We’re friends. We help each other if we can. Your brother taught me that years ago. In a lot of ways, I’m in your debt. I wouldn’t be the man I am now if not for Joey.” There was a softness to his words that alerted her again to the softness growing in his heart for her. His hand reached across the table to cover hers. “Now tell me what’s going on, Jenny. My curiosity’s killing me. Don’t you think you owe me a better explanation than what I’ve had so far? I know something terrible is going on in your life, besides your husband’s death and your abduction, and has been since you moved here. I’ve felt it. I’ve been patient. I’ve waited for you to tell me. But now I’d like to believe I’m a good enough friend for you to finally confide in me. I won’t judge. Just tell me.” She really hated doing what she had to do next. Her sigh was one of resignation. “You’re an exceptionally intuitive man and, yes, you deserve the truth. Finally. “First, I need these things. Time is short. I have to go back to the farmhouse, alone, for a little while. These things, along with the bow and arrows, go with me.” She slid a scrap of paper covered with words and a simple diagram towards him. “You have them? Can you do that to the arrows for me?” She’d taken the stuff out of the bag and laid them on the table. He studied the list, the drawing, and looked up at her. “Yes. And yes.” He tapped the paper with his fingers and glanced at the items on the table. “Will all this be part of the explanation I’m about to get, too?” “It will.” She met his gaze. “I’m going to give it to you right now. But I warn you…it’s going to rock your world and everything you’ve ever believed about that world. Be prepared. I don’t have a lot of time so I can’t tell you everything in detail but I’ve give you a condensed version before I leave.” “You really have to leave then?” Her shoulders slumped. “If we’re to remain safe, I do. If all goes well I’ll be back by dawn.” “Can I go with you?” “No. I’m trusting you to take care of Teddy and Sarah and if anything happens to me, protect them until Joey and Laurie can come for them.” “You’re frightening me.” “I’m sorry. Again. Time short. Shush. Here goes. All I ask is you don’t interrupt me; don’t say a word, until I’m completely finished. Okay?” He looked puzzled, his hand left hers, but he nodded his head, waiting. “Okay.” So, as they sat there in the murky kitchen with the rain falling heavily outside, she told him. Everything. Just like Jeff asked her. Or as much as she could in the small amount of time she felt she had to do it in. He took it pretty well. All things considered. Afterwards, he still tried to convince her to let him go with her, let him help, but she was adamant he didn’t. When he knew he couldn’t change her mind, he collected the objects she’d asked for, fixed what she’d wanted him to fix, and helped her load everything into his car. She drove away into the stormy night in Andy’s new Mustang a little before three and Andy, his mind almost certainly reeling from what she’d told him, a frown on his face, lingered in the doorway and watched her leave. It was strange. He’d listened to her little speech and afterwards had appeared to believe her. But she’d never forget the way he’d stared at her before she left, his gaze incredulous one second and pitying the next. Or the way he’d suddenly pulled her into his arms at the door, simply held her, begged her to be careful and told her his prayers would be with her every step of the way. Until then she’d had no idea he was religious, believed in God. Thinking about it later, it made sense. He was such a good man.",

      "content": "Chapter 23 Jenny The rain’s ferocity lessened by the time she reached home. She checked the house first. It was dark and empty. But she could feel it. Someone was out there. Watching. Waiting. She sat in the lightless car behind the house and got ready. Collecting her weapon and what else she’d need once she entered the woods. Andy had given her four arrows he’d carved from aspen wood–the tips, the strange metal arrowheads from her mother’s stash, dipped in holy water from the flask she’d also retrieved from the cardboard box. Andy had skillfully split the arrows’ shafts, slid the bases of the silver arrowheads into them, and using strong nylon line had tied them on securely. She’d sat there and watched him. He’d done an expert job. She tucked the arrows into the leather sheath and slung the pouch around her shoulders. The bow she took into her hands. She remembered the comfortable feel and smell of the wood from years ago. Remembered the exhilaration she’d once known when her aim was true and the arrow flew to the target and plunged into the center. She’d loved every aspect of archery. It was an exciting sport. Maybe after this–if she lived–she’d take it up again. It was something she’d have in common with Andy. Something they could do together. Strange how all these years later the bow and arrow might save her and her kids’ lives. The Bic lighter went into her jeans pocket. She grabbed the can of gasoline Andy had given her and slid out of the car. She prayed Jeff was right about the plan. That it would work. Of course he was a ghost and could be ghosts had some inside information living people didn’t have. The woods were dark, the wind was feral, but at least the rain had stopped. Good thing. She needed it to be gone. Moving stealthily between the trees behind the house she came to the spot Jeff had reminded her of, a huge aspen tree they’d often met at when they’d been teenagers, and waited. Leaves trembled above and around her. That was the thing about aspen, their foliage whispered and soughed in the breeze. As if they were communicating among themselves. Leaf talk. She couldn’t understand a word of it. She felt Jeff’s presence before he spoke. A shiver went up her spine and a smile arched her cold lips. She looked and saw a wispy pale shape next to her. Jeff. You ready for this, sweetheart? You have everything I told you to bring? Did what I asked you to do? “Yes. I’m ready.” Then go to the left side of the farmhouse. Aloysius is there already. Better hurry if you don’t want your home to burn. “He’s going to torch the farmhouse!” He will if you don’t stop him. You burned him and his friends in that cellar so he’s going to return the favor. He doesn’t realize yet you and the kids aren’t in there. But he’ll know soon that it’s empty. So hurry. Out of spite, he’ll burn it anyway. “Are you sure these arrows will stun him long enough for me to do what I have to do? He’s not a normal vampire, you know. Not like those we killed at the theater all those years ago.” I’m sure. He may not be the run-of-the-mill bloodsucker from this world but this will work on him. I promise. I have it from a trustworthy source. The ghost laughed softly. Sounded like Jeff. Jenny nodded as the wind whipped her clothes about her. She stood under the tree in the dry spot its leaves created and tightly held the bow close. She’d always trusted her husband and wasn’t about to stop now. And there was no other way. She didn’t have a better plan. In fact she’d had no plan. Jeff’s plan was all she had. She laid the gasoline can and the bow, the pouch of arrows, beneath the tree; hiding them behind the base of the trunk. She backtracked the way she’d come. She could feel Jeff floating along with her, keeping pace. Once or twice she caught him smiling at her. His beloved face a pale glowing oval, his eyes twinkling diamonds above his ghostly smile. Jeff, but not Jeff. Her love for him was still so strong. Yet the sharpest of the pain, the bad memories of his murder, had faded. All that was left were the good ones and…love. Eternal love. Just like the old days, huh, Jenny? The two of us fighting against the evil vampires. Remember? “I remember.” Every second, every moment. Stop daydreaming. Aloysius is at the living room window. He’s ready to throw the bottles of gasoline, light the fire. Hurry! Her legs moved faster as she raced over the ground, her shoes barely touching the wet grass. When she got to the house Jeff was no longer by her side though she could feel his presence. He was still there. Somewhere. “Get away from my house,” she screamed at the shadow hulking beneath the window. “You coward. Murderer! I destroyed your friends and I’m going to take care of you, too.” Aloysius stepped away from the deeper murk of the farmhouse, pivoted around to face her. She saw his fire ravished face. The livid, bloody scars. His once long moonlit hair was burnt wisps sticking out from his disfigured head. He didn’t make a sound. Said nothing. His eyes glowed a crimson red. She could feel his disgust; almost taste his loathing. It was as hot as the fire she’d set to burn him and the others into ashes with. How had she not seen, known, he was the one of all of them with the real power? The one who, as Jeff had said, might someday be the demise of the human race? “Because you humans, even you, an abomination half-breed mutant, never see what is right in front of you.” His voice, which she’d never truly heard before was strangely alluring. Spellbinding. “Your race is doomed. It’s always been doomed. You were only waiting for someone like me–someone like us–to arrive and exterminate you. “Oh, I think you should know. I killed that detective friend of yours. He cried like a blubbering baby. I cut him up and stuffed him in his car. Wrecked it. “And…I’m the one who killed your mate. Did you know that? I slit his throat and drank every drop of his blood and laughed as I did it. I must admit, he was plucky. Not one cry.” Aloysius’s laugh cut razor sharp through her skin as her heart bled. She wanted to throw herself at him and strangle the life from his malevolent eyes. Wanted to make him hurt as much as he’d hurt her. Her husband. Her family. Her friend. No. Not yet. Follow the plan, my love, Jeff whispered in her ear. Now. “I may be only half of what you are,” she spoke, “but humans are far stronger than you think. You’re the weak one. You’re the doomed one.” She made sure her tone was condescending. “I’m going to exterminate you as I did the others. Stupid bloodsucker.” Her words did what she’d known they would do. They infuriated him. He let out one ear-splitting yell and a burning bottle soared from his fingers towards the farmhouse’s window. Only she saw Jeff step in front of the fireball and deflect it at the last moment. It exploded, a dud, in the air inches away from the glass. Aloysius looked around, then at her. “How did you do that?” he shrieked. Laughing, she stuck out her tongue and wiggled her fingers in her ears, shouting, “Catch me if you can!” She turned and ran as fast as her new speed would allow her into the woods towards the aspen tree. The moonless night was a blanket around her. The wind, voices of the souls of the victims the vampires had taken, spurred her on. She ran. For her life. She was no longer scared. All she cared about was making sure her children, her family, her town…humanity…were safe. Making sure the monster that’d killed so many innocent victims would never do so again. She had to do this. Atonement for what she was. Jeff was with her. Invisible. Keeping pace. At her side. Like he’d always been in life. Aloysius did as Jeff predicted he would. He followed her. About caught her, too. He was so fast. She was faster and kept ahead of him by inches. But still ahead. She arrived at the tree, the one with her and Jeff’s initials carved into it, and swept up the bow, the sheath of arrows, and boomeranged around the trunk to a standstill. She wasn’t even breathing hard. You can do this, Jenny. I believe in you, Jeff’s voice encouraged in her ear. When Aloysius stopped before her, gloating, thinking he’d caught her, he was positioned with his back to the tree trunk. And, faster than a human eye could see, Jenny took the first arrow, with the special silver tip, from the pouch, notched it, lifted the bow and with all her new strength pulled back and let the arrow fly. It hit Aloysius’s chest with such force it rammed through his upper body and pinned him to the tree. He screamed. The sort of scream she’d never heard before. Unearthly. Demonic. It filled her head, the world. He writhed and kicked against the tree. His arms reached for her. He wasn’t screaming out very nice things. She slid out another arrow and sent it rocketing into his left arm, pinning it to the tree as well. Another strike. She could still hit the bull’s eye. The shrieks rose to a fevered pitch and she felt him in her mind. Tearing at her flesh. Trying to distract her, command her. Kill her. She fought it. The pain. The gut-wrenching terror of something so strong, so alien in her head. Her arms were as heavy as stone. For a terrible heartbeat, she couldn’t move. Aloysius was working the arrows out from his body. Regaining his freedom. Use your last two arrows and send them, with a prayer, in with every bit of power you have, Jeff whispered. Now. With the last and best of her strength, she tugged out and notched the final arrows and sent them into the place in the vampire’s body Jeff had told her to aim for. Pinning the right arm as well. Lastly, the place here the heart should be. They went in harder and deeper than the others. This time the vampire didn’t scream, this time the sounds coming from the thing’s mouth was more than screams. It was trapped, like a bug against the tree’s wood, and it knew it. Its struggles heightened. It was so angry. Finish it, Jeff’s voice said. The arrows won’t hold it long. She picked up the can of gasoline and drenched the creature with gas. Dropping the bow, she took the Bic lighter from her pocket, and rushing at the impaled vampire she touched the tiny flame to his coat. The body went up in a whoosh of fire and black clouds. She stood back and watched, her body shaking. The creature burned and howled and screamed. But not for long. When silence reclaimed the night and the fire burnt down there was nothing left but a skeleton, blackened bones and soot drifting on the air. Before her eyes what remained dissipated on the breeze leaving only the four burnt arrows sticking out of the tree. She sunk to the ground, exhausted. The taste of soot in her mouth. The blood hunger humming in her ears like angry bees. She’d have to feed before she went home. What she’d done had taken every ounce of her strength. She fell to the ground in a heap. You did it, Jenny. It’s dead. Forever this time. You’re safe. Our children are safe. Joey and Laurie. The town. Our world. “For sure this time?” A lone drop of water fell on her face. Then another. Lightning lit up the sky. Thunder rumbled in the distance. The storm was moving off but another was coming in. For sure. It’s over. For now anyway. Go get our kids. Live your life. Try to be happy while you can. “Wait…are you going now?” I must. I did what I had to do. It’s my time. I’m sorry. I was only here to help you. “Can’t you stay, just a little longer?” Her heart was breaking again. She put her arms out to the shifting form of pale light that was dissipating as she watched. You have others to help, others to save because, and I hate to say it but must, there are more monsters in this world. They’ll be drawn to you. It’s your destiny. Mine is to go. “Jeff?” Yes? “I love you.” And I love you. I’ll always love you, Jenny. Never forget. Tell my children I love them, too. Goodbye. I’ll see you again…one day. Jeff’s ghost flickered out and he was gone. “Goodbye my love. Goodbye.” She lay on the ground, light rain pelting her skin, until she could get up. The arrows she wrenched from the tree and replaced in the pouch, then picked up the bow where she’d dropped it. With a heavy body and heart she trekked to the farmhouse, got in the car and drove back to Andy’s. She knew she had more explaining to do.",

      "content": "Chapter 24 Christmas “God, this ham smells so good,” Joey gushed as she took it from the oven. He used a knife from the counter and sliced off a piece of the steaming meat to stuff into his mouth. “Umm, delicious. Reminds me of when we were kids, before the bad times anyway, and mom would make the holiday meals. Gosh, could she bake those sugar cookies. You know, the ones with the red and green sprinkles on them? Oh, those were heaven.” “Yeah, you and dad had it easy. You’d be out in the front room with your eyes and ears glued to the television and mom and I would be out here slaving over the hot stove. Peeling potatoes. Cutting up vegetables. Sticking those cloves in the ham; using toothpicks to hold on the round pineapple slices. Making cookies and pies from scratch. Setting the table and serving you men. Cleaning up afterwards. A lot of work.” “Yeah, those were the good old days. Now I get to peel the potatoes, cook the food, make the desserts and serve the people. Every day.” Joey smiled and she laughed. “And you love every minute of it.” “Oh, I do. But it’s nice sometimes to sit back and let someone else do it. Make the food. Serve it. Clean up after. It’s a treat.” “Well, enjoy it today because tomorrow it’ll be back to the old grind.” “Tell me about it.” He sighed. “Anything else I can do to help?” “I have it under control. Everything’s done, including the sweet potatoes and marshmallows.” She moved the ham to one of her mother’s old china platters and centered it in the middle of the table. She’d decorated it and the house so carefully. Little Christmas lights strung everywhere, silver and green tinsel on the massive tree in the living room. The family’s old ornaments hanging from the fragrant boughs. Presents piled beneath. A real Norman Rockwell Christmas. “Ooh, that does smell delicious. You even put pineapple and cherries on top of the ham like mom used to.” He filched one of the cherries and popped it in his mouth. “I know you and Teddy like it like that.” “And the table looks lovely. You gonna eat with us, Sis?” “Of course. I can actually eat a complete meal these days. Almost. Small quantities anyway. Doesn’t taste too bad, either.” She’d found the foods she’d once hated she still did and the food she’d loved, the same. Her brother hovered over the table. She could hear her children and their friends in the living room around the Christmas tree laughing and joking. Someone, sounded like Laurie, started singing Silent Night on key. A few other voices joined in. Outside the windows there was no snow. No cold weather to make it feel like Christmas, not in Florida anyway. But it felt like Christmas in her heart. She had her children in the next room. Her family. Andy. They were safe and together celebrating Christmas Eve like they used to do as children in the same house. The kitchen was full of memories. Her mother proud at the way the baked ham had turned out as she drank her wine, giggling, and her father carving the meat and making jokes so they’d all laugh. Her grandparents, too, gathered around the table passing mashed potatoes and gravy, cranberry sauce (which no one else but them liked) and everyone stuffing themselves after the meal with pumpkin and custard pie topped with the real whipped cream her father had so prided himself on whipping up every holiday. So many memories. Bad and good. Today she remembered only the good ones. Joey broke into her musing. “How are you and Andy doing?” She bumped her hip gently against her brother’s, scooted him out of the way so she could put the gravy boat beside the mashed potatoes. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” “Ah, come on. He is my best friend. He’s crazy about you, you know.” “I know.” Joey’s head bent closer to hers and he softly asked, “Is it the vampire thing?” This time she didn’t laugh. “I’m still trying to figure all that out. So is Andy.” “Oh, yeah, you telling him about it sure did blow his mind for a while, plus what happened with those vampires last month; what you did. But he’s all right with it now. He told me so.” “Did he?” “He loves you. He told me that, too, and doesn’t care what the hell you are. He knows you’re a good person no matter what. You didn’t ask to be what you are. He loves the kids. Jenny, he’s really a great guy. Don’t worry about him not having a job yet. I know Andy. He’ll find one soon. He’s got it all going for him.” “Oh, I know that. I’m lucky to have a job myself. There are lots of people out of work now. It’s not that.” “What is it, then?” If nothing else her brother was too blunt at times. She shook her head. “I’m not ready yet, Joey. Simple as that. Jeff hasn’t been dead that long.” Joey knew about Jeff’s ghost and the part he’d played in their deliverance. He still was waiting for the ghost to appear to him. So far it hadn’t. “Give me some more time. So much has happened in the last few months. I still haven’t quite come to terms with what I am these days.” She whispered, “Vampire, you know?” “Oh I understand completely. But you do feel something for the guy, don’t you?” That was an easy one. “Yes, I do. He’s my friend. Your friend. The kids love him. Perhaps someday he’ll be more. We’ll be more. We’ll see.” Her brother smiled. “Okay. I won’t pester anymore.” “Thanks.” Teddy and Sarah ran into the kitchen and hugged her at the same time. Amadeus clutched in Sarah’s arms. Her daughter drug that poor cat around everywhere like a baby. Since Jenny had come home her kids had been so affectionate and well behaved. Doing their chores and homework without complaining. She wondered how long that would last? Knowing them, not long. “Is it time to eat yet?” Sarah dropped down in a chair and Amadeus escaped, meowing, and hid beneath the table, waiting for scraps. “I’m starving.” She was dressed in her new jet-black and silver-threaded dress (back to the Twilight influence again, everything black, silver or purple, since the newest movie had come out) and looked so pretty, so grownup. Jenny had curled her long blond hair and braided the sides. The girl was going to be a knock out some day. She’d be a handful. Just like Jenny had been. Lately the child had been begging for a horse. Or two. She argued convincingly they had the room. The yard. She adored horses as Jenny had and Jenny wished she could have swung the cost. She would have loved to have horses again. They’d been one of the best things in her childhood. Can’t afford a horse right now, she’d told her daughter. Next summer maybe. “I’m starving, too.” Teddy snuck a buttered roll and crammed it into his mouth. Jenny made him sit down. “Supper’s ready,” she announced as Andy and Laurie came into the room. “And coffee’s done so help yourself. Cups on the counter with the sugar and cream. There’s soda and milk, too, in the refrigerator.” She smiled at Andy and he smiled back. A special smile. There’d been a lot of those lately. Secrets shared. Trust firm and growing. He’d accepted her vampire state so much easier than she’d thought he would and he was helping her deal with it. If the sun were too bright he’d run an errand for her. Pick up the kids from school. Do whatever she asked. Whatever she needed. He was aiding Joey with the vampire research because Jenny still hadn’t given up on finding a cure. She still had hope. “Everyone sit down and we’ll eat.” “It all looks fantastic,” Andy complimented as he settled into a chair beside her. “Thank you so much for having me over.” “You’re family now,” Jenny answered gently and when he took her hand she let him hold it for a moment, in front of everyone, before she picked up her fork. “It should taste fantastic, too,” Laurie stated. “Jenny and I have been working hard enough on it all day.” Laurie had made the pies and some of the side dishes. She’d help with the dishes afterwards. She was a good sister-in-law. The six of them sat around the table in the same kitchen Jenny and Joey had eaten in all their young lives and everyone talked and laughed. Ate the food. A family. Although, there were more than six people there. At times Jenny could have sworn her mother and father and Jeff were sitting there with them, too. They were ghosts that listened and smiled, said nothing, but were happy everyone was together. Safe and sound. She could have also sworn she heard horses whinnying outside in the fields behind the house, their hooves clomping in the hard dirt as they ran, and she smiled to herself. All that was missing was the haunting violin music. That usually came late at night wafting on the night breezes outside Joey’s restaurant, close to where the old theater had once stood. She often went there and listened. Remembered. Everything. She was so grateful everyone she loved was home. Finally.",

I began writing novels at 21, over forty years ago now, and have had sixteen (nine romantic horror, two romantic SF horror, one romantic suspense, one romantic time travel, one historical romance and two murder mysteries) previous novels, two novellas and twelve short stories published from Zebra Books, Leisure Books, Avalon Books, The Wild Rose Press, Damnation Books and Eternal Press. I’ve been married to Russell for thirty-four years; have a son, James, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Caitlyn, and I live in a small quaint town in Illinois called Columbia, which is right across the JB Bridge from St. Louis, Mo. We have three quirky cats, ghost cat Sasha, live cats Cleo and Sasha (Too), and the five of us live happily in an old house in the heart of town. Though I’ve been an artist, and a folk singer in my youth with my brother Jim, writing has always been my greatest passion, my butterfly stage, and I’ll probably write stories until the day I die…or until my memory goes.

      "content": "Prologue St. Louis, Missouri…a sultry night in August “You’re as beautiful as the day I met you.” Her husband lifted his wineglass, toasting her, as they were having dinner. His eyes were tender in the flickering candlelight; the restaurant elegant with its high-priced menu and attentive waiters. “All those many years ago?” Jenny teased, lifting her glass to touch his. The touching tinkled musically around the room, an intimate soundtrack to the snow-white tablecloths and sparkling table settings. Jeff had insisted on the most expensive eatery in St. Louis to celebrate their twelfth anniversary; though it wasn’t actually their twelfth, to be exact, because of the divorce after their first marriage. It was a sort of joke between them that if they’d remained married the first time they’d be celebrating twenty-two years instead of twelve. Jenny didn’t care. All that mattered was they’d found each other again, had two children they adored, Sarah and Teddy, and had moved to Illinois to begin a new life far from the old one in Florida. “Yes, as beautiful as when you were fifteen and I was sixteen.” “Ah,” she sighed, “we were such babies, weren’t we?” He took her hands and brought them to his lips. “Yes, we were. But I knew then what I know now…that you are the love of my life and we’ll be together for the rest of our days and beyond, if there is a beyond.” “The rest of our days,” she echoed. He leaned across the table and their lips met. There was a smile on hers as the waiter moved up and asked if there was anything else they needed. They’d had their salads, their generous plates of Tutta Mare, the crusty bread and a glass of red wine each. She was content. No more hard times or tears for them. They’d already had enough of both in their lives. The construction company Jeff had formed and nurtured when they’d moved to the small town of Millstadt a decade before had grown into a profitable enterprise. He employed fifteen men and women and the company made them a solid living. The carpentry skills he’d learned during their first separation had served him well. Jeff’s Construction had gained a reputation for being one of the best homebuilders of middle-income family dwellings in the area. It’d taken years, but now they were finally reaping the rewards. For the first time in their lives they had more money than they knew what to do with. Jenny was proud of him. She’d kept the business’s accounts and helped answer the phones from home during the early years. Three years ago they’d opened an office in downtown Millstadt and hired a secretary so Jenny could resume being a full-time mother and writer. Her life was full. She had her children and loved them dearly. Being a mother was more important than anything that had come before, but somehow, with Jeff’s encouragement, she’d also found the desire to return to her writing. She’d written three more books to go with the three she’d written during the years of their first marriage; one of them, a tale about a band of vicious vampires using a refurbished theater as a base to lure in their victims, had sold quite well. Few people ever knew it’d been based on a real experience. The last novel, a ghost story set on an isolated island, hadn’t done as well. The publisher had gone bankrupt right after the release, leaving her book in limbo. Her agent said not to worry. It was the deplorable economy. It’d even seeped into the publishing industry; publishers were slashing costs and employees like dying trees shed leaves. The next book, her agent said, would do better. Of course, that would be when she got around to writing another one. Lately she’d been too busy raising her family. Enjoying life. Writing was no longer as important as Jeff, Sarah and Teddy. They always came first. And she’d never been happier. “This was a great idea,” she whispered after kissing him, “getting away from our everyday lives and the kids for a night of fine dining and a hotel suite…just the two of us. It’s been a wonderful night. You’re a good husband.” “I know. Now, what do you say we order dessert? It’s getting late and that hotel room with the luxurious bed, big screen TV, room service and no kids is calling.” His hand beneath the table caressed her bare leg. She’d worn the sexiest dress she had and laughed softly when his hand moved upwards to brush her inner thigh. His touch still sent shivers through her. “Sure. You know what I want,” she replied coyly. “A big bed and room service.” She chuckled. She was looking forward to their night alone. Having an eight and a twelve year old was a blessing in many ways, but private time, just the two of them, was almost impossible to come by and they never wasted it when they had it. He ordered them dessert with a gentle eagerness in his eyes. Gazing through the window framed in velvet curtains, she thought how pretty the city looked in the fading summer light. Everything bathed in a rosy glow. The sidewalks and streets seemed speckled with gleaming diamond chips. The people hurrying home from work or to personal appointments were muted blurs. Everyone smiling. Talking. Laughing. Living their lives on a hot summer night. When the sun went down the shadows and breeze would cool things off. Then it’d be perfect. By the time they’d finished their dessert, paid the tab and strolled hand-in-hand from the restaurant, dark had claimed the city. Deep purple shadows pulsed and the air hummed with the sounds of the night. The gloom was a warm, heavy cloak around them. There wasn’t a breeze stirring anywhere. The crowds had thinned. In the shade of the building Jeff stole a moment to kiss her. A long slow kiss that made her remember why she’d never stopped loving him. When he pulled away she reached out and slid her fingers along the side of his face. “I love you, husband. Forever and always.” “And I love you more.” He kissed her one last time. “Let’s get our car and drive it to the hotel, instead of walking. I don’t like where we’re parked. Since it’s later there’s bound to be a better parking space somewhere else,” she told him and he agreed. Lost in their conversation and each other, they strolled along the street by the river to the parking lot. They’d left their car in an isolated spot, a pool of soot, beneath a concrete viaduct. Not the safest of parking spaces. Usually, they’d never put themselves in danger like that because they, of all people, knew any place that secluded and shadowy could hide something unexpected. Because, in the world, monsters did exist. But they weren’t thinking about that. They were only thinking about the moment. The years of their safe normal lives had lulled them into a false sense of security. Under the overpass it was as silent as a tomb. No one else around, or so they thought. Jeff unlocked the car at a distance with the click of his key control and had his hand on the passenger side door handle when she glanced up. A capricious breeze drifted across her face where there shouldn’t have been any moving air. Her skin shivered as she caught a faint whiff of something she hadn’t smelled in a very long time. The scent was fresh dirt, ash and something…long dead. “Jeff, get in the car now!” Across the vehicle’s roof a large shadow enveloped her husband and he screamed. It was the last thing she saw and heard before something invisible grabbed her, slammed her to the ground and plunged something sharp into her neck. The excruciating pain lasted a millisecond, an eternity, before the blackness took her.",

      "content": "Prologue St. Louis, Missouri…a sultry night in August “You’re as beautiful as the day I met you.” Her husband lifted his wineglass, toasting her, as they were having dinner. His eyes were tender in the flickering candlelight; the restaurant elegant with its high-priced menu and attentive waiters. “All those many years ago?” Jenny teased, lifting her glass to touch his. The touching tinkled musically around the room, an intimate soundtrack to the snow-white tablecloths and sparkling table settings. Jeff had insisted on the most expensive eatery in St. Louis to celebrate their twelfth anniversary; though it wasn’t actually their twelfth, to be exact, because of the divorce after their first marriage. It was a sort of joke between them that if they’d remained married the first time they’d be celebrating twenty-two years instead of twelve. Jenny didn’t care. All that mattered was they’d found each other again, had two children they adored, Sarah and Teddy, and had moved to Illinois to begin a new life far from the old one in Florida. “Yes, as beautiful as when you were fifteen and I was sixteen.” “Ah,” she sighed, “we were such babies, weren’t we?” He took her hands and brought them to his lips. “Yes, we were.

      "content": "Chapter 1 Two Weeks Later Jenny She awoke in the hospital. A weak kitten with a fuzzy wandering mind. A nurse informed her she’d been in a coma for two weeks. Two weeks. Her waking up was nothing short of a miracle, especially after the amount of blood she’d lost. It’d take time for her to regain her bearings, her strength. She had to be patient. Her memories would come back. In the beginning the nurses turned away and wouldn’t answer when she asked about Jeff. They pretended as if they hadn’t heard or would mumble under their breath. Oh, they’d speak about her children, being cared for by Jeff’s older sister, Lulu, back in Millstadt. They’d tell her the children were doing fine, they missed her and couldn’t wait until she was well enough to return home…but they didn’t say anything about Jeff. One morning, when her mind was clearer than the days before, she demanded, “What happened to my husband? Is he here in the hospital? Is he okay?” Why hasn’t he come to see me? She was afraid of the answers, but more afraid not to know. The nurse patted her hand. “Dr. Lester’s coming in this morning to talk to you about it, my dear. I’ll let him answer your questions.” And off she scurried. What weren’t they telling her? When the doctor came she found out. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Sanders, your husband is dead,” Dr. Lester told her with a compassionate expression and a gentle hand on her shoulder. “It happened the night you were attacked and they don’t know who did it.” “They don’t have any leads?” “Unfortunately, no. Not yet. The police officer said your purse and your husband’s wallet weren’t taken. There didn’t seem to be any apparent motives for the assault.” According to the police, her husband’s cause of death was as suspicious as Jenny’s injuries and as mysterious as her eventual recovery had been, even to the doctors and nurses who’d treated her. She’d fallen into a coma, most likely from a concussion, when she’d been knocked to the ground. Then there’d been her substantial loss of blood, the same thing her husband had died of. The doctor was vague about most of it and Jenny assumed her husband had bled out from his wounds, wounds she’d never seen because before she’d awakened he’d been put in the coffin and into the ground. Jeff’s family wasn’t sure when she’d come out of her coma, if ever, so they’d held his funeral and buried him in the plot beside his mother and father. His parents were actually the reason they’d moved to Millstadt in the first place. They’d been elderly and needed help, but, in the last two years, both had passed away. His father succumbed after a lengthy bout of cancer, and his mother soon afterwards of a heart attack. It was ironic that now their son was sleeping in the family plot with them. Way too soon. “St. Louis police Detective Benjamin Bradley, has been in to see you once or twice, and wanted to be advised when you came out of the coma. He has been,” the doctor stated. “Your brother, Joey, was also here the first week. He reluctantly returned home when you didn’t regain consciousness by the second week.” Ah, so Joey had come all the way from Summer Haven, Florida, leaving his restaurant and family to be with her. His concern touched her. “Your brother knows you’re awake now and said he’d fly up this weekend to see you.” Joey. Oh, she wanted to see him so badly. Have him hold her. Cry on his shoulder. Be with someone who knew and loved her. Someone she could talk to who would understand, as no one else could, what losing Jeff was doing to her. Her own injuries meant nothing. All that mattered was that Jeff was…gone. After her doctor left, she cried until she slipped into an exhausted sleep. When she was able, a nurse helped her telephone her children and again she wept as she spoke to them. It was sweet to hear their voices, as sad as the conversation was. They knew their father was dead. They’d attended the funeral service. They’d wanted to visit her, but their aunt asked them to wait until she was out of the coma and feeling well enough. They were coming the next day and she was desperate to see them. They were all she had left, and she couldn’t wait until she could cradle them in her arms again; plant kisses on their cheeks and brows. Cuddle them and never let them go. Jeff might be gone forever but she still had his children, their children. Thank God for that. She had something to live for. She kept her mind on them from then on because she couldn’t bear to think of what had happened that night beneath the viaduct. To dwell on it filled her with panic, not only because of Jeff’s murder but because she had absolutely no memory of any of it. It was a total blank. The questions there were no answers to gave her a cold sweat. Who’d mugged them? Why? Was she still in danger? Did they believe she’d seen them? Would they track her down and try to kill her to keep their identities hid? Yes. Her fears were rampant. No. The attack had been random. They’d only been a bunch of homicidal hooligans out on a rampage. They didn’t care if she’d lived. They weren’t looking for her. She was safe now. Her family was safe. Oh, please God, let it be so. *** Detective Benjamin Bradley, an even-tempered man of medium height with quick but sad eyes, questioned her before she was released. She told him, to the best of her ability, what had happened the night of the attack. What she could remember. Which wasn’t much. “So you saw nothing? Heard nothing?” He pressed for at least the third time. “I told you. No. My memory’s just one big black hole. That’s all. I was knocked out before I could see or hear anything. I’m sorry.” She wished she could remember. She really did. Ever since the assault she’d had this oppressive sense of dread, of danger close by; that what she didn’t know might hurt her. Inexplicable really. Not much else could hurt worse than the death of her husband and a couple weeks in a coma. As grief stricken, weak, as she was, she still asked the detective before he left, “Do you have any leads? Any suspects yet? Do you know who killed my husband and why?” “I’m sorry, Mrs. Sanders. No leads so far. No motives that we can see, either. It wasn’t robbery. Nothing was stolen. Your husband’s death, the way he died, is bizarre enough. The coroner doesn’t know what to make of it.” The detective paused and she had the feeling there was something he wasn’t telling her, wasn’t asking her. Yet. Perhaps it was her loss or because she could barely stay awake that kept him from a more intense interrogation–or telling her more of what he knew. “There was no evidence left behind. Nothing to point us in the right direction. Is there anything else, no matter how trivial, you’ve recalled that might help us?” She’d hardly been able to reply, a sudden dizziness and bone-weary fatigue had overwhelmed her. “No…so…tired. Sorry.” She’d closed her eyes and when she’d opened them again the detective was gone and another night had come. It seemed the longer she was in bed the worse she felt. Every bone and muscle in her body ached and her throat was sandpaper. But she threw up everything she drank or ate. Her doctor explained it was most likely stress or delayed trauma. Her sleep was haunted with nightmarish dreams. In cemeteries and mist-covered night fields she chased Jeff but could never catch him. She cried out but he’d hide behind a tombstone or in a mausoleum, and she’d wake with tears trickling down her cheeks. Other nights she’d spy him running through a town, it looked like the town they’d grown up in, and she’d pursue him through one empty house or building after another…but again would never catch up to him. He was always just ahead of her. Out of reach. His wretched face white and his body skeleton thin. He never spoke. Just ran from her. It wrenched at her heart. The police had no suspects to track down and question. No one had seen anything. No one heard anything. Before she’d slid into sleep and Detective Bradley had left, she recalled seeing an odd look on his face. He probably wondered why she was alive and her husband was dead. What she was holding back. She bit her bottom lip until it bled and gently touched the healing marks on her neck. Truth was, she was uneasy talking too much about that night or thinking on it too long. If she could even remember it. She’d tried so hard. She couldn’t. It was like reliving a nightmare and her mind railed against it. She had the strangest thought: Your nightmare has just begun. And the thought wouldn’t go away.",

If she could even remember it. She’d tried so hard. She couldn’t. It was like reliving a nightmare and her mind railed against it. She had the strangest thought: Your nightmare has just begun. And the thought wouldn’t go away.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 A month later That last week in the hospital had been torture. Instead of feeling better each day, she felt weaker, more befuddled. Her broken heart so strong a pain she could barely breathe. She’d left the bed long before her doctor thought she should, but in the end, her insurance wouldn’t approve her staying any longer and she ached to return to her children. Knowing it was the only thing that would make her feel better. She’d gone home to Millstadt. Still feeling sick. Off kilter. At least, she was reunited with Sarah and Teddy. But things didn’t get better. Her health didn’t improve. The bills piled up and without her husband’s income she had a difficult time paying them. Without Jeff, the business was folding. She couldn’t design or build the houses, run or supervise the crews. All she’d been good for was the office work. There was no one else experienced enough to step into his shoes. The mortgage on the new house and everyday expenses were too much for her to handle alone. And her dwindling royalty checks (jokes really) were in no way sufficient to support the three of them. They couldn’t have supported a mouse. It didn’t take long to realize their lives would have to change drastically. Jeff had had an insurance policy, but the money wouldn’t last six months with their bills. She hadn’t worked on a new book in two years. Her agent had suggested she write another vampire novel but she’d wanted to try something different. Life and the demands it made with Jeff and the kids had gotten in the way and kept her from it. Tomorrow, she’d constantly told herself, she’d begin a new book. Tomorrow. Yet a tomorrow with free time had never seemed to come. Now her agent wasn’t sure, in the troubled publishing climate, if she could even sell another one of her books. Not when publishers were downsizing, laying people off, and buying works by more famous authors they knew were a sure thing. The other problem was, she could begin a new novel that very day yet it’d be six, seven months before she’d be ready to show it to an agent or an editor and months after that to tie up a contract. And royalties? That could take another year. They needed money sooner than that. She had to find a real job, but she was in the same boat as millions of out-of-work people because of the lousy economy. So many people she knew were laid off. Worst she’d ever seen. According to the news, and everything she was seeing and hearing around her, there weren’t any jobs to be had and it wasn’t going to get better any time soon. Something she could attest to now firsthand. She’d sent out dozens of resumes and hadn’t heard a word. Not even a reply email. That’s when Joey came to visit her and suggested she and the kids move back to Summer Haven to their parents’ vacant farmhouse. For some reason he’d kept the old place. Hadn’t sold it. Over the years, with her busy life, she’d all but forgotten about it. Joey hadn’t. He’d tended to it and paid the yearly taxes. Waiting. “Why did you keep it anyway?” she asked. “I gave it to you. You could have sold it anytime. It wasn’t as if you couldn’t use the money.” Joey seemed to need money all the time. His restaurant had gone through fat and lean times and he was always lending money to someone or other. That was her brother Joey, big heart and small pockets. “Because I always had hopes you and Jeff would return someday. Live in Summer Haven again with Laurie and me and I wanted to be sure you had a home to come back to. Family should be together, you know.” And, she thought, if she and her children moved hundreds of miles away to Florida…if someone were looking for her wanting to finish what they’d begun in the attack…if someone meant her or her children harm…hiding in another state might be safer for all of them. She’d smiled at him in the soft light of her kitchen. He was a good brother. She could count on him to be there for her. He always had been. “Huh. But it’s been awhile. I bet the weeds and fauna have taken the old place over, right?” He hesitated for just a moment. “No, they haven’t. In fact, the house is in fairly good shape. A little run down. Still full of mom and dad’s stuff, though. We’d have to clean it out. That’d be no problem. They didn’t have much to begin with. “Best thing is the rent would be free. We’d fix it up. I’d help. Sis, come on, you belong in Summer Haven with us now that Jeff and his parents are gone. You can write anywhere. Raise the kids anywhere. Be better if it was with family. There’s nothing to keep you in Millstadt anymore, is there?” “No, there isn’t.” The kitchen surrounding her that Jeff and she had decorated together was roomy and exquisite. The walls were a pearly pink color. A curio cabinet, filled with gifts he’d bought her through the years, was tucked in one corner. There were roses in pale muted colors wallpapered on two walls. Dried roses in the middle of the table in a brightly colored bowl. They’d worked so hard making it the home of their dreams. Now it was a reminder of what she no longer had. Tears caught in her throat. If she sold the house, in this depressed market, she’d be lucky to get what they owed for it. Oh, well. It was better than losing it to the bank. She went to the windows and lowered the blinds. Since she’d been freed from the hospital it seemed the sun was too bright. Too big. Her eyes, like her body, hurt all the time. Her mind refused to think of the things it needed to think about. She had no appetite. Even her kids had noticed how much weight she’d lost. She was skin and bones. What was wrong with her? It could be unwanted residuals from the attack, as her doctors believe, the physical trauma her body endured. But she knew better. It’s a broken heart, missing Jeff, that’s what it is. Missing her husband. Grief. Her brother was still talking. “Then sell this house. Better yet, let the real estate people sell it and you and the kids drive back with me. I can stay a few more days while you make arrangements and pack. We’ll take turns driving your car. Heck, if you’re still feeling poorly I’ll drive all the way. It’d save me an airplane ticket. It’ll be fun. Like a road trip vacation. The kind we used to have in the summers with mom and dad, remember? Oh, she remembered. Joey and her awkwardly quiet in the back seat as mom and dad fought up front about not having enough money. The cheap restaurants they’d eaten at and the cut-rate motels, dives really, they’d stayed in. Bugs in the beds. Grease in the food. Best thing about those trips were they hadn’t gone on many of them. She kept her negative feelings to herself. How could her brother recall those unpleasant vacations with fondness? She’d spent years forgetting them. “We can stop along the way and eat at truck stops and interesting roadside diners. Steal their specials of the day for my own place.” Joey chortled sneakily, rubbing his hands together, knowing he’d convince her. He knew her well. So they’d packed up the few belongings she and the kids couldn’t do without, left the remainder for the movers, and took the long trip home to Florida. She in a cap and sunglasses to shade her sensitive eyes and a purse full of aspirins she quickly depleted. The minute they’d hit the city limits of Summer Haven she was sure she’d made the right decision. She was–they were–home. “The town hasn’t changed much,” she remarked as they drove down Main Street. Small town quaintness emanated from every stone storefront and tree-shaded sidewalk. The good old Summer Haven Town Market was perched on the corner of Third Street, as it had been forever, with its canopied windows crowded with the weekly sales items: cans of coffee, loaves of bread, shaving cream and the last of the season’s plump, striped watermelons. “No, it hasn’t. I like that about it,” Joey admitted, his hands firm on the wheel. “No matter how crazy life gets everywhere else, Summer Haven remains a sleepy little hamlet full of nice friendly people. A sanctuary from the big bad world.” Jenny gazed around, overwhelmed with nostalgia for the days of her childhood when she and her brother had run the streets and fields wild and free. Her mother and father both alive. Before all the troubles. When they’d lived in the little yellow farmhouse by the creek. The memories made her shaky. So many regrets. So many lost moments she’d never reclaim again. Her hand moved to the window’s glass and fingers traced the outline of the trees going by on the other side. Things will be better now. They have to be. My heart and body will heal here. Sure, Jeff and I fled this place years ago after what happened; escaped the horrible memories of the vampire family that butchered my mother and father and almost killed us before we defeated them…but time has passed. The wounds have mended. Summer Haven is home; the town I was born in and once loved. The place I’d first met and loved Jeff. A place my children and I can now feel safe in. And what’s left of my family is here. “Mom,” Teddy, asked from the back seat, “is this where you grew up?” “Yep. Your Uncle Joey, too. See that gazebo there in the center of the park?” Her finger pointed to the left. “Yeah.” Teddy’s brown eyes looked where she directed. Smiling, he brushed the blondish hair from them so he could see better. It was the first smile to grace his face in a long time, and it encouraged her. “Your Uncle Joey and I used to play hide-and-go-seek around it and in the park when we were your age. We’d hide behind the trees and bushes.” “At night we ran through the yards and streets of the town like wild Indians, didn’t we, Sis?” Joey chuckled as he maneuvered the car past the Century 21 Real Estate office. Someone, a man in red shorts and white T-shirt, waved at Joey as they passed. Joey waved back. Many people noticed them and waved or shouted hellos. Joey was well known and liked. So different than when they’d been kids. “Yes, we loved the night,” she whispered. “Once.” When they were children. Long ago when they hadn’t know evil mystical creatures existed and hadn’t feared darkness. Joey threw her a strange look but didn’t comment on what she’d said. He’d gone on to reminiscence about his favorite subject. Food. “Remember that little confectionary we used to get penny candy and ice cream cones at in the summer? Wasn’t it called John’s?” “I think so.” “Remember how we used to roam the shoulders along the roads, sidewalks and streets looking for empty bottles and lost money so we could buy that penny candy?” Joey laughed. “What scroungers we were.” “I remember.” And she did. They’d been poor, deprived, and even penny candy or sharing a package of cupcakes was a treat. “You two,” Teddy groaned, “were pathetic.” “No, we were kids.” Joey’s face broke into a grin. “Hungry kids. We were always on the lookout for free food.” “Pitiful,” Teddy snickered. Jenny took in the familiar buildings and streets as they rambled through town. She should be happy. Home. She should be feeling better then she was. All she could feel was her growing lethargy, as if everything was too much to bother with. She told herself it was because of all that had happened and Jeff’s death; the unexpected but nagging financial problems. Now the move. That’s all. She was depressed. What did she expect? Time, Joey adamantly believed, and being home, would help her out of her funk. Yeah, a century maybe. Oh, Lord, she missed Jeff. He would have made this move easy. He would have made her life easy as he always had. But he was gone. Get used to it. She was on her own now. The kids and her. “Mom,” Sarah, her youngest at eight, piped up from the rear seat where she was reading one of those Twilight books. She had the same coloring, eyes and hair as her brother. They could have been twins, except she was four years younger. The more animated, friendlier of the two, she was the one most like Jeff in temperament. Loved to read and draw. Such a kind-hearted child she’d cry at any little thing. Loved animals. “I’m really hungry. My stomach’s talking to me. No, it’s squawking loudly. Can we get something to eat?” Joey replied before Jenny could. “Already thought of that, sweetie. I called Laurie on my cell as we came into town. She’s got fried chicken–your favorite Teddy–with all the fixings waiting for us at the diner. It’s the special for today.” He glanced at his sister. “That okay with you…a warm meal before we head to the apartment?” She and the kids were staying with Joey and Laurie until they could get the farmhouse cleaned out and their furniture arrived in a day or two. “I know we’ve been on the road since morning and you’re probably tired. But you gotta be hungry, too. I know I am.” “Ha, you’re always hungry. But food sounds good. We could use something to eat. I could use some coffee myself.” She didn’t know why she’d said what she said about the food. They’d been on the road for days and she was exhausted, but not hungry. She hadn’t been hungry for weeks. The pit of her stomach burned. Her throat was sore. Her blood was a fire running through her veins. Again, she thought it was because of the distress she’d been under, the grieving. A body reacts in strange ways to heartache. Hers was trying to starve itself. Her brother parked in front of Joey’s Diner. “Well,” Jenny said, “this place sure has changed. For the better.” Her eyes scanned the family restaurant Joey was so proud of. The front window had been widened and heightened into a beautiful rounded bay window filled with plants and flowers, either silk or real ones, so lifelike she couldn’t tell. The business next door was gone. It’d become part of the diner. “Wow, you added on just like you said you would years ago. It looks fantastic. I love the window treatment. So classy. I see Laurie’s artistic touch in it.” “You got it. Laurie did the decorating. They’re not real plants, but hey, pretty anyway, aren’t they? I took over that empty gift shop next door, what, six years ago now, and expanded. We remodeled and practically doubled our space. We can fit more than fifty people in if we cram.” Her brother grinned. “You like it?” “I do. I can’t wait to see the inside.” The kids were already out of the car and at the restaurant’s front door. Jenny got out, tipping her hat to further cover her face, and followed behind at a slower pace. Her eyes fell on the Dollar Store that now stood where the exquisite movie house, the Grand Theater, once had. The theater she and her father, when he’d been alive, had renovated. The theater she and Jeff later burnt to the ground. A shiver numbed her spine and she thrust the bad memories away. Now her father, mother and Jeff were all in their graves. She and Joey were the only ones left who knew what had happened that night at the theater when they’d destroyed the vampires. Best not to think of those times. Not now. Inside her brother’s café she was met with subtle lighting and welcoming smiles. Laurie rushed to embrace her after hugging Sarah and Teddy. “Gosh, it’s so good to see you, Jenny. And the kids.” Jenny caught the troubled expression as it flittered across the other woman’s face, one quickly veiled. Laurie was barely taller than Teddy and hadn’t changed much in the years since Jenny had last seen her. She’d gained more weight; her hair was short and a softer shade of blond, yet her eyes were still intriguingly green like a cat’s and full of life. That’s one thing Jenny admired about her sister-in-law, she had a zest for living and people–plus she unconditionally loved Joey. “I have your supper ready to bring out.” Laurie smiled. “You all must be tired, so find a place to sit and I’ll be back in a jiffy with everything.” She bustled toward the kitchen. “And I’ll just go help her.” Joey trailed off behind his wife. Probably wanted a few moments alone with her, Jenny mused. Be glad you have her, brother. Your wife. Alive. Your lives all around and ahead of you. Pain stabbed her heart as she watched the two shove through the swinging doors. Before they closed, framed in the space, Joey caught up to his wife and surprised her with a passionate hug. A kiss. Their laughter was tender, subdued. There weren’t many people in the diner. A young couple tucked away to the side munching on hamburgers and fries. One snowy-haired guy at the counter drinking a shake. It was three o’clock in the afternoon. Too early for supper and too late for lunch. Joey claimed they got busy with the supper crowd around five. Teddy slid into a booth in front of the bay window and Sarah and Jenny scooted in after him. Jenny leaned against the padded leather, weary to the bone, and took her surroundings in. The diner had changed a lot. Once it’d been dim and run-down, now it was bright and shiny like new coins. The color scheme was every hue of yellow that existed or close to it. Pale lemon walls, mustard stool tops and cantaloupe hued table tops. It seemed like an unlikely combination, but somehow it worked. The dazzling colors made the place look cheery. There were hanging plants cascading from the ceiling and stunning paintings, originals she noted, spiced up the walls. Joey was friends with some of the local artists and did everything he could to help them, including buying their work, apparently. The paintings made the diner seem richer, more elegant and added splashes of color. Everywhere she saw Laurie’s delicate hand, her sense of style. Like in the menu. These days instead of greasy hamburgers and fatty Salisbury Steaks, a customer could get a delicious garden salad, a thick juicy steak with locally grown vegetables and one of five varieties of pie or cobbler, the best in the county. There were so many loving touches: metal that gleamed, leather soft as marshmallow, shiny counter and tabletops and artfully arranged flowers. She was impressed. The restaurant was thriving, even in the bad economy, her brother had bragged on their trip out. Joey brought her a steaming mug of coffee and chocolate milkshakes for the kids and set them down on the table. “Your suppers are on their way. Won’t be long.” “Thanks.” She grinned weakly up at him. “But hold my supper. I don’t feel like eating right now.” And concern flashed across his face. “Sis, you’ve hardly eaten a thing since we left Illinois. You have to eat. Keep up your strength. No matter how distraught you are.” Slipping in beside her, he laid his hand over hers and held her gaze until she looked away. His hazel brown eyes, so similar to hers, were full of pity. Lately she’d had too much of that and shied away from more. They’d had this discussion before. He was worried about her lack of appetite. She felt bad about it but there was nothing she could do. She just wasn’t hungry. A soft sigh escaped her lips, looking at her children looking at her as they slurped down their shakes. “Okay, bring me out a smaller portion, a child’s meal, and I’ll try to eat some of it.” “Good.” He patted her hand and returned to the kitchen. The chicken must have been good because her kids gobbled it down along with the rest of the food but she was barely able to eat a third of it. Then when Joey and Laurie weren’t watching, she snuck to the women’s restroom and threw every bite up in the toilet, flushed it and rejoined her kids in the booth. She’d never done that before. She was worried too. What was wrong with her? Why couldn’t she keep food down? And why were her eyes hurting so much? Her head? Could grief truly do this to a person? She lowered her head into her hands, listening to Sarah and Teddy debating what to have for dessert. Bottomless pits, both of them. They were her world now. They were everything. All that mattered. If it weren’t for them she couldn’t have gone on. Wouldn’t want to go on. She raised her head and gently smiled as they huddled over the menu. God, she loved them so much. “Mom, what are you having for dessert?” Teddy wanted to know. Sarah was crowding him, taunting him with funny faces. He kept pushing her away. “Stop it! Stop bugging me,” he snapped at her, “or I’ll dump the rest of your shake on your silly head.” Jenny chuckled. “Now you two behave, hear me? There’ll be no shakes dumped on anyone’s head. Not today. Teddy, be nice to your sister. She’s the only one you have.” Both small faces swung toward her, and seeing, sensing, her melancholy, they instantly calmed down. Teddy put an arm around his sister and gave her a half-hearted hug and a swift peck on the cheek. Sarah giggled and pinched him on his arm. “Hey! That hurt. Mom!” A common frustration played across her son’s face. Jenny knew, as only a mother could, that deep down the two loved each other. But sometimes siblings had a funny way of showing it. The age gap, as well as the difference in gender, didn’t help. Teddy was on the verge of adulthood, and since his father’s death was trying to grow up as fast as he could. Sarah was a child in his eyes. But he’d do anything for her, and if anyone or anything tried to hurt her, Jenny knew, he’d be the first there to protect her. Just like Joey and her. Laurie was standing above them, trying hard not to laugh at the children’s antics. “You know what you want for dessert, kiddos?” “I’ll have chocolate pie with whipped cream on top,” Teddy ordered in his best adult voice. “The biggest piece you have.” He spread his hands apart almost two feet. Like her, her son was a chocoholic. He was tall already for a boy his age. Strong willed, but with a sensitive side that unfortunately reminded Jenny of herself when she was twelve. Her son was a dreamer who woke up one fateful morning and decided he had to take more responsibility onto his small shoulders. Grow up quick. Also like her. With her it’d been an alcoholic mother and a father who the world had beaten down until he’d been unrecognizable. She’d had no choice but to step up and take things into her own youthful hands. Someone had to. Sometimes childhood wasn’t all sugar and spice. She studied his fresh face and her heart melted. So young. In many other ways he was so like his father. Courageous. Smart. She’d never wanted an unhappy childhood for him, or her daughter, but now was apprehensive she couldn’t give them anything else. They loved her but they’d adored their father. Her fingers went to swipe the tears from her cheek, but there were none. She hadn’t been able to cry, not once, since she’d left the hospital. “Yeah, me, too. A big piece of chocolate pie,” her daughter seconded as she jumped up and skipped to the nearest empty stool, climbed up and started spinning. “Nothing for me, thank you,” Jenny muttered. She pretended to be busy sipping her coffee. For some reason coffee didn’t taste good to her lately. Again she wondered what was wrong, but at the moment she was too tired to question it. The look of anxiety in Laurie’s eyes was the same response she’d been getting all week from Joey, but the woman didn’t say a word. Instead she glanced at the kids. “Where do you two put all this food?” She clucked, and then walked away to get what they’d asked for. “In our stomachs, of course,” Sarah bantered back as she twirled around. Her thin little legs moved up and down like one of those carnival rides. Her yellow hair floated around her head. “Nah. No human has stomachs that big,” her sister-in-law tossed over her shoulder as she disappeared into the kitchen. “Must go right down into your legs.” Laurie. Soon after the incident at the Grand Theater all those years ago, the vicious attack where Joey almost died, he’d had a change of heart and had declared his undying love to his long time live-in and had married her. Half the town hadn’t given the new marriage an icicle’s chance in a hot oven. Laurie had always been flighty, a little off kilter in a creative artsy way. But they’d been wrong. The union had flourished like the restaurant. Twelve years now. Laurie was happy. Joey was happy. Until Laurie, Joey had been rudderless, a drifter side-stepping through life. One woman, one job after another. Laurie and the diner had anchored him. So Jenny was happy for both of them. The couple’s only regret was they had no children. Something they’d desperately wanted. Joey said they hadn’t given up. Not yet. Until then, the diner was their child and they nurtured and loved it as if it were the only one. And it showed. Laurie brought out the pie and sat down across from Jenny. “You sure you’re all right?” she inquired caringly, head bent. “You’re looking kind of pale, girl. Your eyes have this…funny glint.” The woman laid a hand on Jenny’s arm and Jenny slid backwards slightly, just enough so the contact broke. “I’m as good as can be what with my husband being murdered, losing my home, being nearly flat-busted broke and all.” She shrugged and did her best to look healthy. Sat up straighter. Opened her heavy eyes wider. “My eyes look funny?” “Yeah, they’re glittering like tiny stars. Weird. That is when you look up, which you haven’t done much since you came in. Something’s wrong, isn’t it, besides the chaos that’s come from Jeff’s death? I thought we were friends? Spill it.” “The eyes? It’s the bright lights in here. After the attack, my long hospital stay and all the crying. They’re irritated. That’s all,” Jenny snapped, then felt badly she’d lost her temper when Laurie was only trying to be kind. “Sorry. I’m just…exhausted.” Inside her guts were churning and her mind was spinning. Why couldn’t she tell Joey and Laurie the truth? That she felt like hell, truly strange, and had since the night Jeff had died. For some reason she couldn’t. Don’t tell anyone. Wait. See. She’d feel better tomorrow. No sense in worrying them. Not yet. She’d never been a complainer and she wasn’t about to start now. No one liked a whiner. It was bad enough she’d come home practically penniless, homeless. Husbandless. That was needy enough. She couldn’t be sick, too. “I can see that. Perhaps now you’re here, and after you get some sleep, you’ll feel better. I hope so. Just remember if you need to talk to someone anytime, you can talk to me. Joey and I are here for you.” “Thank you, but I’ll be fine.” She flashed a faint smile. “Like you said, now that we’re here I’ll be myself again.” No. Never again. Not with Jeff in his grave and her life shattered to hell. But how could Jenny tell her that when she couldn’t even believe it herself? Even now she expected to see Jeff walk through the door, saunter up and kiss her hello, especially here in Summer Haven, their old stomping grounds. No, he’ll never walk in anywhere ever again. He’s dead. Stifling a sob, she forced her attention to the present. Laurie was giving her that look again. Jenny was relieved when the meal and the visit were over. The sun was going down and it flooded the world outside with twilight in delicate shades of amethyst. The air had cooled. The breeze diminished. The children were yawning, their eyes welcoming sleep. It was time to get them settled for the night and in bed. The diner was filling up with the supper crowd. Way too many people. With Joey’s help, she packed up the kids, who, with the stressful day behind them and their bellies full, curled in the rear seat of the car and fell asleep. Joey drove to the apartment across from the town square where Laurie and he had been living the last nine years. “It isn’t a fancy or big place,” Joey made excuses as she followed him into the living room, “but it’s close to the diner, close enough to walk to and from if we need to, and suits us well enough. “We thought we’d put you three in the spare room for as long as you’re here.” He deposited a sleeping Teddy on one of the knee-high airbeds he’d bought the week before. “Sorry about the makeshift beds, but Laurie and I figured you wouldn’t be here long.” The room was cramped with the beds on the floor and two scuffed but ample-sized dressers flat against the wall. Her brother had made the accommodations as nice as he could, but their money was tight just as hers was. The dressers were used; the beds were clearance items from Wal-Mart. He was real proud of his thriftiness. In that way they both took after their father who’d always known how to pinch a penny until it became two. “You’re right, we won’t be here long, and the room’s great just the way it is. You and Laurie have been so kind already and now this. Thanks, Joey.” “Hey, you don’t have to thank me. I’m your brother. I’m supposed to be helpful and kind. You going to leave the kids dressed?” She laid Sarah on the bed in the far corner by the window, covered her up and turned to Joey. “They’ve been through so much and the trip here was long. No good reason to wake them. I usually don’t do this, but they can sleep in their clothes tonight. Won’t hurt.” And she was bone weary; it’d been all she could do to get Sarah into bed without falling over. Between the difficulties of the last month and the tedious journey to Summer Haven, Jenny could barely muster the energy to drag herself out of the bedroom. A bewildering and all-encompassing weariness had suddenly overtaken her mind and her body. Even her thoughts were incoherent. It was like her mind was minutes behind reality and couldn’t catch up. Again she wondered what was wrong with her. After Joey deposited the suitcases in their room he joined her on the living room couch before a giant screened television set. “They’re both still sleeping,” he reported Her eyes went to the television. “Gosh, brother, that’s the biggest damn T.V. I’ve ever seen. But couldn’t you have found a larger one?” She chuckled. Joey loved television, had since he’d been a kid. When he wasn’t at the diner, Laurie had spilled the beans, he was in front of the set. There was a stack of DVDs piled against each side. And he always recorded his missed programs while working to watch later on his days off. “Fifty-two inch.” He flopped down beside her. “It was my birthday present last year from my lovely wife.” “She knows how to please you all right.” “That she does. “Well,” he put his arm around her shoulders, “you’re here. Finally back home. How does it feel?” Reclining into the over-stuffed sofa, she closed her eyes, conscious that his arms around her made her feel uncomfortable. She scooted over so they fell away. “Good.” She smiled, opened her eyes to stare out the window. “Though odd. I never thought I’d be living here again. Especially without Jeff.” He leveled sympathetic eyes at her. “I miss him, too.” Then he was silent for a moment before adding, “I know I’ve said this before, Sis, but I’m so sorry about what’s happened to you. The assault. Jeff gone. The coma. Your money problems. All of it. It’s awful. I’m only grateful you’re alive and you and the kids have moved back here. You belong with family now. And I’m tickled to have you.” He hadn’t been able to say the word dead, not once. Jeff was gone. Just…gone. She understood. She might have been married to Jeff, given him children, loved him most of her life, but Joey had grown up with Jeff, too, and since childhood they’d been best friends. They’d both lost someone who could never be replaced. “Yeah, what’s left of us.” “We have each other, the children. Laurie. We’re still a family.” “I know that.” What else could she say? Nothing. It’d all been said. She was sick of the condolences and empty words from people. Words didn’t help. They didn’t fill the empty void in her life, didn’t fix the ache in her heart. Gone was gone. Dead was dead. Joey stood up. “I hate to run out on you but I promised Laurie I’d help her close the diner. She’s had her hands full the last week, running it alone and all. I owe her. Will you be okay here by yourself for a while?” “Of course.” Another half-hearted smile. “The kids are out for the night and looks like I’ll be right behind them. I’m pooped. You go on. I’ll be fine.” At the door, gazing back at her, he casually brought up, “Laurie mentioned you didn’t eat much for supper. Just so you know, there’s hamburger in the refrigerator. The frying pans are in the lower cabinet by the oven and the utensils are in the drawer to its left. If you get hungry fry yourself up a burger or two. Cheese and condiments in the fridge. Buns are in the breadbox on the counter.” “Thanks. If I get hungry I will.” She yawned. “But right now all I want is a bed under me and covers over me. See you tomorrow morning.” “Laurie and I will try to be quiet when we come home later tonight so as not to wake you or the kids.” “Don’t worry. The way I’m feeling, an earthquake wouldn’t wake me. And the kids sleep like the dead.” She realized what she’d said soon as she said it and a sensation of despair washed over her. Dead. Like Jeff. She sighed and didn’t know she had. “So I’ll see you tomorrow.” “That you will.” After her brother went out the door, drained of every ounce of energy she’d ever had, she reclined her head and shut her eyes again. She’d slipped into sleep when something–a noise or a smell–woke her. The clock on the wall showed it was eight twenty-five. She’d been asleep an hour. She was no longer tired. In fact, sitting up, she felt invigorated. Restless. And for the first time in weeks she was actually hungry. She wandered into the kitchen. The windows around the room were ebony squares. A faint breeze sung through the trees, a song of endless nights. She opened the refrigerator and saw the fat package of raw hamburger. She reached in, pulled it out and carried it to the sink. Tearing open the skin-tight plastic wrap, she brought the meat to her lips and drank the loose blood that had collected along the edges. When she’d slurped up the last drop she dropped the package to the counter and stared at it. Why had she done that? Drink hamburger blood? Ech. Ech. Ech. Damn. Grief did do strange things to a person. “You’re supposed to make patties and fry it up,” she grumbled, “put it on a bun with mustard and catsup, for God’s sake. Onions. Yum. Yum.” But that didn’t appeal to her at all. Not one bit. The hamburger was rewrapped and stuffed back in the refrigerator. Maybe she’d eat something later. She went to the door, opened it slightly and listened, thinking she heard something on the evening air. Violin music. The melody was soft and haunting and wafted across her memories like an old friend. Hadn’t she’d heard that song before? That violin with the sweet sound? Years ago? Here in Summer Haven. Impossible. Her ears strained to hold on to the music but it floated away. Whoever had been playing stopped or the wind had shifted and sent the notes in another direction. It must have been her imagination. Too many memories here. Way too many. Many good. Many bad. Shaking her head she walked through the open door into the dark. Joey and Laurie’s apartment was in the heart of town, across from the gazebo she’d pointed out to her children as they’d driven in. This was the place she’d grown up in and had run away from. Twice. Home. How come she always found herself back here? She didn’t know. For a late September evening in Florida it was chilly. She strolled, shivering, across the park grass and climbed up into the gazebo. It was one of those old-fashioned wooden structures that had been lovingly built by hand in an earlier time where that sort of craftsmanship mattered. It hadn’t changed in all these years. Still lovely. Sturdy. A little peeling paint, a creak or two was new, but otherwise, like the park and the town, it was as she remembered it. Sitting down, she inhaled the scents of the surrounding darkness. The pungent leaves, the fresh smelling grass and the gritty dirt. Somewhere above her an owl took flight. She could hear its call as its wings took it high into the sky. Hear its wings beating the air. The night soothed her; heightened her senses. Everything seemed unreal. As if she was in a dream. Each sound and sight, a kaleidoscope, folded into the next. Her heart raced as if it were someone else’s. Her skin no longer felt chilled. She felt nothing. Her eyes scanned the landscape around her. The park. The shadowed streets and the squeezed in buildings that even at this late hour were full of customers coming and going. Soon the businesses would close for the night and the people would go home. She’d grown up here; her family had lived and died here. The memories flooded into her and sent her riding on a wave of nostalgia. Joey and her, barefoot children, sprinting down Main Street on a July morning, heading to John’s Confectionary to buy penny candy; playing hide-and-seek on a sweltering evening among the fireflies in the park where she now sat. Racing each other on their battered bicycles down the back country roads. Faster. Faster. Picking wild strawberries and blackberries and gobbling them down, juice trickling down their chins, because as children it seemed they were always starving. Never enough food in the pantry, the refrigerator, the cabinets. Bill collectors banging at the door and peering in the windows. Mom, Joey and her hiding in one of the rooms with the shades drawn and the lights off. Jeff and her as teenagers so hungry for each other they found hiding places all over town…in the velvet dark…to be alone. To kiss. Fondle. Love each other. She could still hear their teenage laughter haunting the night air. So much later. After their bitter divorce when her world had grown so bleak. Her father and her painting houses and scrapping for living money in the scorching summer sun; slaving away together in the Grand Theater to recreate its old glory only then, within weeks, to see it incinerate into ashes. There she was bumping into her boozed up mother in the small supermarket down the street, and reliving the humiliation as she watched her mother run out the front door after stealing a bottle of booze…that she then had to pay for. She remembered the trailer behind the farmhouse, a tiny confined set of rooms she lived in after coming home again the first time. She could still hear the neighing of her father’s two old horses in the field behind it. A prick of sadness remained when she thought of their senseless deaths at the demons’ hands. She’d loved those old nags. Then the disappearances. The slaughter. Her heart wrenching sorrow at her father’s untimely death at the vampires’ hands. Her panicked terror at the cruel attack on Joey in his diner when he almost died. Jeff and her running through the woods knowing they didn’t have much time. Finding the basement of the theater filled with half-alive and dead victims in cages. The fight to the death with the vampires. The fire. Ah, memories. Why was she recalling the unhappy ones more than the happy? She didn’t know. It could be her frame of mind. A lot had happened to her since the days she’d last lived here, and until recently they’d been mainly happy things. Now she was back where she’d begun. At the beginning. Square one. She couldn’t do it all over again. Alone. She just couldn’t. A breeze fluttered the hair around her face. She should have tied it in a ponytail, out of the way. The night chattered around her and she listened. She could hear people moving about and whispering in the houses lining the fringe of the park. A couple was fighting on the next street over about who was going to use the car that night. A baby was crying somewhere. A cat meowed, a series of low-throated vibrations, crying out to the night and another cat answered. Probably locked out of their houses and wanting in. It was as if her ears were catching every minuscule noise. Weird. The night wind must be doing funny things with sound. A cloying smell permeated the air, a perfume of bloody raw meat juices, and almost certainly it came from the steak restaurant across the street. She had the nearly uncontrollable urge to jump up, run over there and find the source of the delicious aroma. Crazy. She forced herself to remain sitting. Her eyes that had been giving her so many problems seemed perfectly clear now. She could see everything in the dark in precise detail. The branches and leaves on the trees were sharply defined against the lighter sky and for a time she stared at the tree line and imagined there were animal or human shapes hiding among them. A game she’d played since a child, sometimes in clouds, floor tiles or among patterns or night trees. There was a prancing horse…a man reaching for the stratosphere…a monster with wide-open mouth and razor sharp teeth. She fidgeted uneasily as a man and woman, holding hands and laughing, walked by. Without warning she was so hungry nothing else in the world mattered. Coming to her feet her head tilted up to smell the air. That sweet scent was all around her. What was it? Blood. Her eyes traveled to the man and woman moving away. Her mouth watered. Oh, my God, what’s happening to me? Spinning around, she fled as if the devil and his pitchfork were behind her. She’d fry up that hamburger and stuff it down her throat if she had to. She was just a little mad from grief, very sad, exhausted and…hungry. A nice fat cheeseburger with all the trimmings would make her feel better. There were homemade brownies on the counter. She’d have a few of those, too. What chocoholic wouldn’t want brownies? But later when she lay down beside her children the hamburger was still waiting in the refrigerator, the brownies untouched on the plate. Her stomach growled. Her veins throbbed. She’d feel like eating, she promised herself desperately, tomorrow. Tomorrow she’d wake up and be okay. Please God.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 A month later That last week in the hospital had been torture. Instead of feeling better each day, she felt weaker, more befuddled. Her broken heart so strong a pain she could barely breathe. She’d left the bed long before her doctor thought she should, but in the end, her insurance wouldn’t approve her staying any longer and she ached to return to her children. Knowing it was the only thing that would make her feel better. She’d gone home to Millstadt. Still feeling sick. Off kilter. At least, she was reunited with Sarah and Teddy. But things didn’t get better. Her health didn’t improve. The bills piled up and without her husband’s income she had a difficult time paying them. Without Jeff, the business was folding. She couldn’t design or build the houses, run or supervise the crews. All she’d been good for was the office work. There was no one else experienced enough to step into his shoes. The mortgage on the new house and everyday expenses were too much for her to handle alone. And her dwindling royalty checks (jokes really) were in no way sufficient to support the three of them. They couldn’t have supported a mouse. It didn’t take long to realize their lives would have to change drastically. Jeff had had an insurance policy, but the money wouldn’t last six months with their bills. She hadn’t worked on a new book in two years. Her agent had suggested she write another vampire novel but she’d wanted to try something different. Life and the demands it made with Jeff and the kids had gotten in the way and kept her from it. Tomorrow, she’d constantly told herself, she’d begin a new book. Tomorrow. Yet a tomorrow with free time had never seemed to come. Now her agent wasn’t sure, in the troubled publishing climate, if she could even sell another one of her books. Not when publishers were downsizing, laying people off, and buying works by more famous authors they knew were a sure thing. The other problem was, she could begin a new novel that very day yet it’d be six, seven months before she’d be ready to show it to an agent or an editor and months after that to tie up a contract. And royalties? That could take another year. They needed money sooner than that. She had to find a real job, but she was in the same boat as millions of out-of-work people because of the lousy economy. So many people she knew were laid off. Worst she’d ever seen. According to the news, and everything she was seeing and hearing around her, there weren’t any jobs to be had and it wasn’t going to get better any time soon. Something she could attest to now firsthand. She’d sent out dozens of resumes and hadn’t heard a word. Not even a reply email. That’s when Joey came to visit her and suggested she and the kids move back to Summer Haven to their parents’ vacant farmhouse. For some reason he’d kept the old place. Hadn’t sold it. Over the years, with her busy life, she’d all but forgotten about it. Joey hadn’t. He’d tended to it and paid the yearly taxes. Waiting. “Why did you keep it anyway?” she asked. “I gave it to you. You could have sold it anytime. It wasn’t as if you couldn’t use the money.” Joey seemed to need money all the time. His restaurant had gone through fat and lean times and he was always lending money to someone or other. That was her brother Joey, big heart and small pockets. “Because I always had hopes you and Jeff would return someday. Live in Summer Haven again with Laurie and me and I wanted to be sure you had a home to come back to. Family should be together, you know.” And, she thought, if she and her children moved hundreds of miles away to Florida…if someone were looking for her wanting to finish what they’d begun in the attack…if someone meant her or her children harm…hiding in another state might be safer for all of them. She’d smiled at him in the soft light of her kitchen. He was a good brother. She could count on him to be there for her. He always had been. “Huh. But it’s been awhile. I bet the weeds and fauna have taken the old place over, right?” He hesitated for just a moment. “No, they haven’t. In fact, the house is in fairly good shape. A little run down. Still full of mom and dad’s stuff, though. We’d have to clean it out. That’d be no problem. They didn’t have much to begin with. “Best thing is the rent would be free. We’d fix it up. I’d help. Sis, come on, you belong in Summer Haven with us now that Jeff and his parents are gone. You can write anywhere. Raise the kids anywhere. Be better if it was with family. There’s nothing to keep you in Millstadt anymore, is there?” “No, there isn’t.” The kitchen surrounding her that Jeff and she had decorated together was roomy and exquisite. The walls were a pearly pink color. A curio cabinet, filled with gifts he’d bought her through the years, was tucked in one corner. There were roses in pale muted colors wallpapered on two walls. Dried roses in the middle of the table in a brightly colored bowl. They’d worked so hard making it the home of their dreams. Now it was a reminder of what she no longer had. Tears caught in her throat. If she sold the house, in this depressed market, she’d be lucky to get what they owed for it. Oh, well. It was better than losing it to the bank. She went to the windows and lowered the blinds. Since she’d been freed from the hospital it seemed the sun was too bright. Too big. Her eyes, like her body, hurt all the time. Her mind refused to think of the things it needed to think about. She had no appetite. Even her kids had noticed how much weight she’d lost. She was skin and bones. What was wrong with her? It could be unwanted residuals from the attack, as her doctors believe, the physical trauma her body endured. But she knew better. It’s a broken heart, missing Jeff, that’s what it is. Missing her husband. Grief. Her brother was still talking. “Then sell this house. Better yet, let the real estate people sell it and you and the kids drive back with me. I can stay a few more days while you make arrangements and pack. We’ll take turns driving your car. Heck, if you’re still feeling poorly I’ll drive all the way. It’d save me an airplane ticket. It’ll be fun. Like a road trip vacation. The kind we used to have in the summers with mom and dad, remember? Oh, she remembered. Joey and her awkwardly quiet in the back seat as mom and dad fought up front about not having enough money. The cheap restaurants they’d eaten at and the cut-rate motels, dives really, they’d stayed in. Bugs in the beds. Grease in the food. Best thing about those trips were they hadn’t gone on many of them. She kept her negative feelings to herself. How could her brother recall those unpleasant vacations with fondness? She’d spent years forgetting them. “We can stop along the way and eat at truck stops and interesting roadside diners. Steal their specials of the day for my own place.” Joey chortled sneakily, rubbing his hands together, knowing he’d convince her. He knew her well. So they’d packed up the few belongings she and the kids couldn’t do without, left the remainder for the movers, and took the long trip home to Florida. She in a cap and sunglasses to shade her sensitive eyes and a purse full of aspirins she quickly depleted. The minute they’d hit the city limits of Summer Haven she was sure she’d made the right decision. She was–they were–home. “The town hasn’t changed much,” she remarked as they drove down Main Street. Small town quaintness emanated from every stone storefront and tree-shaded sidewalk. The good old Summer Haven Town Market was perched on the corner of Third Street, as it had been forever, with its canopied windows crowded with the weekly sales items: cans of coffee, loaves of bread, shaving cream and the last of the season’s plump, striped watermelons. “No, it hasn’t. I like that about it,” Joey admitted, his hands firm on the wheel. “No matter how crazy life gets everywhere else, Summer Haven remains a sleepy little hamlet full of nice friendly people. A sanctuary from the big bad world.” Jenny gazed around, overwhelmed with nostalgia for the days of her childhood when she and her brother had run the streets and fields wild and free. Her mother and father both alive. Before all the troubles. When they’d lived in the little yellow farmhouse by the creek. The memories made her shaky. So many regrets. So many lost moments she’d never reclaim again. Her hand moved to the window’s glass and fingers traced the outline of the trees going by on the other side. Things will be better now. They have to be. My heart and body will heal here. Sure, Jeff and I fled this place years ago after what happened; escaped the horrible memories of the vampire family that butchered my mother and father and almost killed us before we defeated them…but time has passed. The wounds have mended. Summer Haven is home; the town I was born in and once loved. The place I’d first met and loved Jeff. A place my children and I can now feel safe in. And what’s left of my family is here. “Mom,” Teddy, asked from the back seat, “is this where you grew up?” “Yep. Your Uncle Joey, too. See that gazebo there in the center of the park?” Her finger pointed to the left. “Yeah.” Teddy’s brown eyes looked where she directed. Smiling, he brushed the blondish hair from them so he could see better. It was the first smile to grace his face in a long time, and it encouraged her. “Your Uncle Joey and I used to play hide-and-go-seek around it and in the park when we were your age. We’d hide behind the trees and bushes.” “At night we ran through the yards and streets of the town like wild Indians, didn’t we, Sis?” Joey chuckled as he maneuvered the car past the Century 21 Real Estate office. Someone, a man in red shorts and white T-shirt, waved at Joey as they passed. Joey waved back. Many people noticed them and waved or shouted hellos. Joey was well known and liked. So different than when they’d been kids. “Yes, we loved the night,” she whispered. “Once.” When they were children. Long ago when they hadn’t know evil mystical creatures existed and hadn’t feared darkness. Joey threw her a strange look but didn’t comment on what she’d said. He’d gone on to reminiscence about his favorite subject. Food. “Remember that little confectionary we used to get penny candy and ice cream cones at in the summer? Wasn’t it called John’s?” “I think so.” “Remember how we used to roam the shoulders along the roads, sidewalks and streets looking for empty bottles and lost money so we could buy that penny candy?” Joey laughed. “What scroungers we were.” “I remember.” And she did. They’d been poor, deprived, and even penny candy or sharing a package of cupcakes was a treat. “You two,” Teddy groaned, “were pathetic.” “No, we were kids.” Joey’s face broke into a grin. “Hungry kids. We were always on the lookout for free food.” “Pitiful,” Teddy snickered. Jenny took in the familiar buildings and streets as they rambled through town. She should be happy. Home. She should be feeling better then she was. All she could feel was her growing lethargy, as if everything was too much to bother with. She told herself it was because of all that had happened and Jeff’s death; the unexpected but nagging financial problems. Now the move. That’s all. She was depressed. What did she expect? Time, Joey adamantly believed, and being home, would help her out of her funk. Yeah, a century maybe. Oh, Lord, she missed Jeff. He would have made this move easy. He would have made her life easy as he always had. But he was gone. Get used to it. She was on her own now. The kids and her. “Mom,” Sarah, her youngest at eight, piped up from the rear seat where she was reading one of those Twilight books. She had the same coloring, eyes and hair as her brother. They could have been twins, except she was four years younger. The more animated, friendlier of the two, she was the one most like Jeff in temperament. Loved to read and draw. Such a kind-hearted child she’d cry at any little thing. Loved animals. “I’m really hungry. My stomach’s talking to me. No, it’s squawking loudly. Can we get something to eat?” Joey replied before Jenny could. “Already thought of that, sweetie. I called Laurie on my cell as we came into town. She’s got fried chicken–your favorite Teddy–with all the fixings waiting for us at the diner. It’s the special for today.” He glanced at his sister. “That okay with you…a warm meal before we head to the apartment?” She and the kids were staying with Joey and Laurie until they could get the farmhouse cleaned out and their furniture arrived in a day or two. “I know we’ve been on the road since morning and you’re probably tired. But you gotta be hungry, too. I know I am.” “Ha, you’re always hungry. But food sounds good. We could use something to eat. I could use some coffee myself.” She didn’t know why she’d said what she said about the food. They’d been on the road for days and she was exhausted, but not hungry. She hadn’t been hungry for weeks. The pit of her stomach burned. Her throat was sore. Her blood was a fire running through her veins. Again, she thought it was because of the distress she’d been under, the grieving. A body reacts in strange ways to heartache. Hers was trying to starve itself. Her brother parked in front of Joey’s Diner. “Well,” Jenny said, “this place sure has changed. For the better.” Her eyes scanned the family restaurant Joey was so proud of. The front window had been widened and heightened into a beautiful rounded bay window filled with plants and flowers, either silk or real ones, so lifelike she couldn’t tell. The business next door was gone. It’d become part of the diner. “Wow, you added on just like you said you would years ago. It looks fantastic. I love the window treatment. So classy. I see Laurie’s artistic touch in it.” “You got it. Laurie did the decorating. They’re not real plants, but hey, pretty anyway, aren’t they? I took over that empty gift shop next door, what, six years ago now, and expanded. We remodeled and practically doubled our space. We can fit more than fifty people in if we cram.” Her brother grinned. “You like it?” “I do. I can’t wait to see the inside.” The kids were already out of the car and at the restaurant’s front door. Jenny got out, tipping her hat to further cover her face, and followed behind at a slower pace. Her eyes fell on the Dollar Store that now stood where the exquisite movie house, the Grand Theater, once had. The theater she and her father, when he’d been alive, had renovated. The theater she and Jeff later burnt to the ground. A shiver numbed her spine and she thrust the bad memories away. Now her father, mother and Jeff were all in their graves. She and Joey were the only ones left who knew what had happened that night at the theater when they’d destroyed the vampires. Best not to think of those times. Not now. Inside her brother’s café she was met with subtle lighting and welcoming smiles. Laurie rushed to embrace her after hugging Sarah and Teddy. “Gosh, it’s so good to see you, Jenny. And the kids.” Jenny caught the troubled expression as it flittered across the other woman’s face, one quickly veiled. Laurie was barely taller than Teddy and hadn’t changed much in the years since Jenny had last seen her. She’d gained more weight; her hair was short and a softer shade of blond, yet her eyes were still intriguingly green like a cat’s and full of life. That’s one thing Jenny admired about her sister-in-law, she had a zest for living and people–plus she unconditionally loved Joey. “I have your supper ready to bring out.” Laurie smiled. “You all must be tired, so find a place to sit and I’ll be back in a jiffy with everything.” She bustled toward the kitchen. “And I’ll just go help her.” Joey trailed off behind his wife. Probably wanted a few moments alone with her, Jenny mused. Be glad you have her, brother. Your wife. Alive. Your lives all around and ahead of you. Pain stabbed her heart as she watched the two shove through the swinging doors. Before they closed, framed in the space, Joey caught up to his wife and surprised her with a passionate hug. A kiss. Their laughter was tender, subdued. There weren’t many people in the diner. A young couple tucked away to the side munching on hamburgers and fries. One snowy-haired guy at the counter drinking a shake. It was three o’clock in the afternoon. Too early for supper and too late for lunch. Joey claimed they got busy with the supper crowd around five. Teddy slid into a booth in front of the bay window and Sarah and Jenny scooted in after him. Jenny leaned against the padded leather, weary to the bone, and took her surroundings in. The diner had changed a lot. Once it’d been dim and run-down, now it was bright and shiny like new coins. The color scheme was every hue of yellow that existed or close to it. Pale lemon walls, mustard stool tops and cantaloupe hued table tops. It seemed like an unlikely combination, but somehow it worked. The dazzling colors made the place look cheery. There were hanging plants cascading from the ceiling and stunning paintings, originals she noted, spiced up the walls. Joey was friends with some of the local artists and did everything he could to help them, including buying their work, apparently. The paintings made the diner seem richer, more elegant and added splashes of color. Everywhere she saw Laurie’s delicate hand, her sense of style. Like in the menu. These days instead of greasy hamburgers and fatty Salisbury Steaks, a customer could get a delicious garden salad, a thick juicy steak with locally grown vegetables and one of five varieties of pie or cobbler, the best in the county. There were so many loving touches: metal that gleamed, leather soft as marshmallow, shiny counter and tabletops and artfully arranged flowers. She was impressed. The restaurant was thriving, even in the bad economy, her brother had bragged on their trip out. Joey brought her a steaming mug of coffee and chocolate milkshakes for the kids and set them down on the table. “Your suppers are on their way. Won’t be long.” “Thanks.” She grinned weakly up at him. “But hold my supper. I don’t feel like eating right now.” And concern flashed across his face. “Sis, you’ve hardly eaten a thing since we left Illinois. You have to eat. Keep up your strength. No matter how distraught you are.” Slipping in beside her, he laid his hand over hers and held her gaze until she looked away. His hazel brown eyes, so similar to hers, were full of pity. Lately she’d had too much of that and shied away from more. They’d had this discussion before. He was worried about her lack of appetite. She felt bad about it but there was nothing she could do. She just wasn’t hungry. A soft sigh escaped her lips, looking at her children looking at her as they slurped down their shakes. “Okay, bring me out a smaller portion, a child’s meal, and I’ll try to eat some of it.” “Good.” He patted her hand and returned to the kitchen. The chicken must have been good because her kids gobbled it down along with the rest of the food but she was barely able to eat a third of it. Then when Joey and Laurie weren’t watching, she snuck to the women’s restroom and threw every bite up in the toilet, flushed it and rejoined her kids in the booth. She’d never done that before. She was worried too. What was wrong with her? Why couldn’t she keep food down? And why were her eyes hurting so much? Her head? Could grief truly do this to a person? She lowered her head into her hands, listening to Sarah and Teddy debating what to have for dessert. Bottomless pits, both of them. They were her world now. They were everything. All that mattered. If it weren’t for them she couldn’t have gone on. Wouldn’t want to go on. She raised her head and gently smiled as they huddled over the menu. God, she loved them so much. “Mom, what are you having for dessert?” Teddy wanted to know. Sarah was crowding him, taunting him with funny faces. He kept pushing her away. “Stop it! Stop bugging me,” he snapped at her, “or I’ll dump the rest of your shake on your silly head.” Jenny chuckled. “Now you two behave, hear me? There’ll be no shakes dumped on anyone’s head. Not today. Teddy, be nice to your sister. She’s the only one you have.” Both small faces swung toward her, and seeing, sensing, her melancholy, they instantly calmed down. Teddy put an arm around his sister and gave her a half-hearted hug and a swift peck on the cheek. Sarah giggled and pinched him on his arm. “Hey! That hurt. Mom!” A common frustration played across her son’s face. Jenny knew, as only a mother could, that deep down the two loved each other. But sometimes siblings had a funny way of showing it. The age gap, as well as the difference in gender, didn’t help. Teddy was on the verge of adulthood, and since his father’s death was trying to grow up as fast as he could. Sarah was a child in his eyes. But he’d do anything for her, and if anyone or anything tried to hurt her, Jenny knew, he’d be the first there to protect her. Just like Joey and her. Laurie was standing above them, trying hard not to laugh at the children’s antics. “You know what you want for dessert, kiddos?” “I’ll have chocolate pie with whipped cream on top,” Teddy ordered in his best adult voice. “The biggest piece you have.” He spread his hands apart almost two feet. Like her, her son was a chocoholic. He was tall already for a boy his age. Strong willed, but with a sensitive side that unfortunately reminded Jenny of herself when she was twelve. Her son was a dreamer who woke up one fateful morning and decided he had to take more responsibility onto his small shoulders. Grow up quick. Also like her. With her it’d been an alcoholic mother and a father who the world had beaten down until he’d been unrecognizable. She’d had no choice but to step up and take things into her own youthful hands. Someone had to. Sometimes childhood wasn’t all sugar and spice. She studied his fresh face and her heart melted. So young. In many other ways he was so like his father. Courageous. Smart. She’d never wanted an unhappy childhood for him, or her daughter, but now was apprehensive she couldn’t give them anything else. They loved her but they’d adored their father. Her fingers went to swipe the tears from her cheek, but there were none. She hadn’t been able to cry, not once, since she’d left the hospital. “Yeah, me, too. A big piece of chocolate pie,” her daughter seconded as she jumped up and skipped to the nearest empty stool, climbed up and started spinning. “Nothing for me, thank you,” Jenny muttered. She pretended to be busy sipping her coffee. For some reason coffee didn’t taste good to her lately. Again she wondered what was wrong, but at the moment she was too tired to question it. The look of anxiety in Laurie’s eyes was the same response she’d been getting all week from Joey, but the woman didn’t say a word. Instead she glanced at the kids. “Where do you two put all this food?” She clucked, and then walked away to get what they’d asked for. “In our stomachs, of course,” Sarah bantered back as she twirled around. Her thin little legs moved up and down like one of those carnival rides. Her yellow hair floated around her head. “Nah. No human has stomachs that big,” her sister-in-law tossed over her shoulder as she disappeared into the kitchen. “Must go right down into your legs.” Laurie. Soon after the incident at the Grand Theater all those years ago, the vicious attack where Joey almost died, he’d had a change of heart and had declared his undying love to his long time live-in and had married her. Half the town hadn’t given the new marriage an icicle’s chance in a hot oven. Laurie had always been flighty, a little off kilter in a creative artsy way. But they’d been wrong. The union had flourished like the restaurant. Twelve years now. Laurie was happy. Joey was happy. Until Laurie, Joey had been rudderless, a drifter side-stepping through life. One woman, one job after another. Laurie and the diner had anchored him. So Jenny was happy for both of them. The couple’s only regret was they had no children. Something they’d desperately wanted. Joey said they hadn’t given up. Not yet. Until then, the diner was their child and they nurtured and loved it as if it were the only one. And it showed. Laurie brought out the pie and sat down across from Jenny. “You sure you’re all right?” she inquired caringly, head bent. “You’re looking kind of pale, girl. Your eyes have this…funny glint.” The woman laid a hand on Jenny’s arm and Jenny slid backwards slightly, just enough so the contact broke. “I’m as good as can be what with my husband being murdered, losing my home, being nearly flat-busted broke and all.” She shrugged and did her best to look healthy. Sat up straighter. Opened her heavy eyes wider. “My eyes look funny?” “Yeah, they’re glittering like tiny stars. Weird. That is when you look up, which you haven’t done much since you came in. Something’s wrong, isn’t it, besides the chaos that’s come from Jeff’s death? I thought we were friends? Spill it.” “The eyes? It’s the bright lights in here. After the attack, my long hospital stay and all the crying. They’re irritated. That’s all,” Jenny snapped, then felt badly she’d lost her temper when Laurie was only trying to be kind. “Sorry. I’m just…exhausted.” Inside her guts were churning and her mind was spinning. Why couldn’t she tell Joey and Laurie the truth? That she felt like hell, truly strange, and had since the night Jeff had died. For some reason she couldn’t. Don’t tell anyone. Wait. See. She’d feel better tomorrow. No sense in worrying them. Not yet. She’d never been a complainer and she wasn’t about to start now. No one liked a whiner. It was bad enough she’d come home practically penniless, homeless. Husbandless. That was needy enough. She couldn’t be sick, too. “I can see that. Perhaps now you’re here, and after you get some sleep, you’ll feel better. I hope so. Just remember if you need to talk to someone anytime, you can talk to me. Joey and I are here for you.” “Thank you, but I’ll be fine.” She flashed a faint smile. “Like you said, now that we’re here I’ll be myself again.” No. Never again. Not with Jeff in his grave and her life shattered to hell. But how could Jenny tell her that when she couldn’t even believe it herself? Even now she expected to see Jeff walk through the door, saunter up and kiss her hello, especially here in Summer Haven, their old stomping grounds. No, he’ll never walk in anywhere ever again. He’s dead. Stifling a sob, she forced her attention to the present. Laurie was giving her that look again. Jenny was relieved when the meal and the visit were over. The sun was going down and it flooded the world outside with twilight in delicate shades of amethyst. The air had cooled. The breeze diminished. The children were yawning, their eyes welcoming sleep. It was time to get them settled for the night and in bed. The diner was filling up with the supper crowd. Way too many people. With Joey’s help, she packed up the kids, who, with the stressful day behind them and their bellies full, curled in the rear seat of the car and fell asleep. Joey drove to the apartment across from the town square where Laurie and he had been living the last nine years. “It isn’t a fancy or big place,” Joey made excuses as she followed him into the living room, “but it’s close to the diner, close enough to walk to and from if we need to, and suits us well enough. “We thought we’d put you three in the spare room for as long as you’re here.” He deposited a sleeping Teddy on one of the knee-high airbeds he’d bought the week before. “Sorry about the makeshift beds, but Laurie and I figured you wouldn’t be here long.” The room was cramped with the beds on the floor and two scuffed but ample-sized dressers flat against the wall. Her brother had made the accommodations as nice as he could, but their money was tight just as hers was. The dressers were used; the beds were clearance items from Wal-Mart. He was real proud of his thriftiness. In that way they both took after their father who’d always known how to pinch a penny until it became two. “You’re right, we won’t be here long, and the room’s great just the way it is. You and Laurie have been so kind already and now this. Thanks, Joey.” “Hey, you don’t have to thank me. I’m your brother. I’m supposed to be helpful and kind. You going to leave the kids dressed?” She laid Sarah on the bed in the far corner by the window, covered her up and turned to Joey. “They’ve been through so much and the trip here was long. No good reason to wake them. I usually don’t do this, but they can sleep in their clothes tonight. Won’t hurt.” And she was bone weary; it’d been all she could do to get Sarah into bed without falling over. Between the difficulties of the last month and the tedious journey to Summer Haven, Jenny could barely muster the energy to drag herself out of the bedroom. A bewildering and all-encompassing weariness had suddenly overtaken her mind and her body. Even her thoughts were incoherent. It was like her mind was minutes behind reality and couldn’t catch up. Again she wondered what was wrong with her. After Joey deposited the suitcases in their room he joined her on the living room couch before a giant screened television set. “They’re both still sleeping,” he reported Her eyes went to the television. “Gosh, brother, that’s the biggest damn T.V. I’ve ever seen. But couldn’t you have found a larger one?” She chuckled. Joey loved television, had since he’d been a kid. When he wasn’t at the diner, Laurie had spilled the beans, he was in front of the set. There was a stack of DVDs piled against each side. And he always recorded his missed programs while working to watch later on his days off. “Fifty-two inch.” He flopped down beside her. “It was my birthday present last year from my lovely wife.” “She knows how to please you all right.” “That she does. “Well,” he put his arm around her shoulders, “you’re here. Finally back home. How does it feel?” Reclining into the over-stuffed sofa, she closed her eyes, conscious that his arms around her made her feel uncomfortable. She scooted over so they fell away. “Good.” She smiled, opened her eyes to stare out the window. “Though odd. I never thought I’d be living here again. Especially without Jeff.” He leveled sympathetic eyes at her. “I miss him, too.” Then he was silent for a moment before adding, “I know I’ve said this before, Sis, but I’m so sorry about what’s happened to you. The assault. Jeff gone. The coma. Your money problems. All of it. It’s awful. I’m only grateful you’re alive and you and the kids have moved back here. You belong with family now. And I’m tickled to have you.” He hadn’t been able to say the word dead, not once. Jeff was gone. Just…gone. She understood. She might have been married to Jeff, given him children, loved him most of her life, but Joey had grown up with Jeff, too, and since childhood they’d been best friends. They’d both lost someone who could never be replaced. “Yeah, what’s left of us.” “We have each other, the children. Laurie. We’re still a family.” “I know that.” What else could she say? Nothing. It’d all been said. She was sick of the condolences and empty words from people. Words didn’t help. They didn’t fill the empty void in her life, didn’t fix the ache in her heart. Gone was gone. Dead was dead. Joey stood up. “I hate to run out on you but I promised Laurie I’d help her close the diner. She’s had her hands full the last week, running it alone and all. I owe her. Will you be okay here by yourself for a while?” “Of course.” Another half-hearted smile. “The kids are out for the night and looks like I’ll be right behind them. I’m pooped. You go on. I’ll be fine.” At the door, gazing back at her, he casually brought up, “Laurie mentioned you didn’t eat much for supper. Just so you know, there’s hamburger in the refrigerator. The frying pans are in the lower cabinet by the oven and the utensils are in the drawer to its left. If you get hungry fry yourself up a burger or two. Cheese and condiments in the fridge. Buns are in the breadbox on the counter.” “Thanks. If I get hungry I will.” She yawned. “But right now all I want is a bed under me and covers over me. See you tomorrow morning.” “Laurie and I will try to be quiet when we come home later tonight so as not to wake you or the kids.” “Don’t worry. The way I’m feeling, an earthquake wouldn’t wake me. And the kids sleep like the dead.” She realized what she’d said soon as she said it and a sensation of despair washed over her. Dead. Like Jeff. She sighed and didn’t know she had. “So I’ll see you tomorrow.” “That you will.” After her brother went out the door, drained of every ounce of energy she’d ever had, she reclined her head and shut her eyes again. She’d slipped into sleep when something–a noise or a smell–woke her. The clock on the wall showed it was eight twenty-five. She’d been asleep an hour. She was no longer tired. In fact, sitting up, she felt invigorated. Restless. And for the first time in weeks she was actually hungry. She wandered into the kitchen. The windows around the room were ebony squares. A faint breeze sung through the trees, a song of endless nights. She opened the refrigerator and saw the fat package of raw hamburger. She reached in, pulled it out and carried it to the sink. Tearing open the skin-tight plastic wrap, she brought the meat to her lips and drank the loose blood that had collected along the edges. When she’d slurped up the last drop she dropped the package to the counter and stared at it. Why had she done that? Drink hamburger blood? Ech. Ech. Ech. Damn. Grief did do strange things to a person. “You’re supposed to make patties and fry it up,” she grumbled, “put it on a bun with mustard and catsup, for God’s sake. Onions. Yum. Yum.” But that didn’t appeal to her at all. Not one bit. The hamburger was rewrapped and stuffed back in the refrigerator. Maybe she’d eat something later. She went to the door, opened it slightly and listened, thinking she heard something on the evening air. Violin music. The melody was soft and haunting and wafted across her memories like an old friend. Hadn’t she’d heard that song before? That violin with the sweet sound? Years ago? Here in Summer Haven. Impossible. Her ears strained to hold on to the music but it floated away. Whoever had been playing stopped or the wind had shifted and sent the notes in another direction. It must have been her imagination. Too many memories here. Way too many. Many good. Many bad. Shaking her head she walked through the open door into the dark. Joey and Laurie’s apartment was in the heart of town, across from the gazebo she’d pointed out to her children as they’d driven in. This was the place she’d grown up in and had run away from. Twice. Home. How come she always found herself back here? She didn’t know. For a late September evening in Florida it was chilly. She strolled, shivering, across the park grass and climbed up into the gazebo. It was one of those old-fashioned wooden structures that had been lovingly built by hand in an earlier time where that sort of craftsmanship mattered. It hadn’t changed in all these years. Still lovely. Sturdy. A little peeling paint, a creak or two was new, but otherwise, like the park and the town, it was as she remembered it. Sitting down, she inhaled the scents of the surrounding darkness. The pungent leaves, the fresh smelling grass and the gritty dirt. Somewhere above her an owl took flight. She could hear its call as its wings took it high into the sky. Hear its wings beating the air. The night soothed her; heightened her senses. Everything seemed unreal. As if she was in a dream. Each sound and sight, a kaleidoscope, folded into the next. Her heart raced as if it were someone else’s. Her skin no longer felt chilled. She felt nothing. Her eyes scanned the landscape around her. The park. The shadowed streets and the squeezed in buildings that even at this late hour were full of customers coming and going. Soon the businesses would close for the night and the people would go home. She’d grown up here; her family had lived and died here. The memories flooded into her and sent her riding on a wave of nostalgia. Joey and her, barefoot children, sprinting down Main Street on a July morning, heading to John’s Confectionary to buy penny candy; playing hide-and-seek on a sweltering evening among the fireflies in the park where she now sat. Racing each other on their battered bicycles down the back country roads. Faster. Faster. Picking wild strawberries and blackberries and gobbling them down, juice trickling down their chins, because as children it seemed they were always starving. Never enough food in the pantry, the refrigerator, the cabinets. Bill collectors banging at the door and peering in the windows. Mom, Joey and her hiding in one of the rooms with the shades drawn and the lights off. Jeff and her as teenagers so hungry for each other they found hiding places all over town…in the velvet dark…to be alone. To kiss. Fondle. Love each other. She could still hear their teenage laughter haunting the night air. So much later. After their bitter divorce when her world had grown so bleak. Her father and her painting houses and scrapping for living money in the scorching summer sun; slaving away together in the Grand Theater to recreate its old glory only then, within weeks, to see it incinerate into ashes. There she was bumping into her boozed up mother in the small supermarket down the street, and reliving the humiliation as she watched her mother run out the front door after stealing a bottle of booze…that she then had to pay for. She remembered the trailer behind the farmhouse, a tiny confined set of rooms she lived in after coming home again the first time. She could still hear the neighing of her father’s two old horses in the field behind it. A prick of sadness remained when she thought of their senseless deaths at the demons’ hands. She’d loved those old nags. Then the disappearances. The slaughter. Her heart wrenching sorrow at her father’s untimely death at the vampires’ hands. Her panicked terror at the cruel attack on Joey in his diner when he almost died. Jeff and her running through the woods knowing they didn’t have much time. Finding the basement of the theater filled with half-alive and dead victims in cages. The fight to the death with the vampires. The fire. Ah, memories. Why was she recalling the unhappy ones more than the happy? She didn’t know. It could be her frame of mind. A lot had happened to her since the days she’d last lived here, and until recently they’d been mainly happy things. Now she was back where she’d begun. At the beginning. Square one. She couldn’t do it all over again. Alone. She just couldn’t. A breeze fluttered the hair around her face. She should have tied it in a ponytail, out of the way. The night chattered around her and she listened. She could hear people moving about and whispering in the houses lining the fringe of the park. A couple was fighting on the next street over about who was going to use the car that night. A baby was crying somewhere. A cat meowed, a series of low-throated vibrations, crying out to the night and another cat answered. Probably locked out of their houses and wanting in. It was as if her ears were catching every minuscule noise. Weird. The night wind must be doing funny things with sound. A cloying smell permeated the air, a perfume of bloody raw meat juices, and almost certainly it came from the steak restaurant across the street. She had the nearly uncontrollable urge to jump up, run over there and find the source of the delicious aroma. Crazy. She forced herself to remain sitting. Her eyes that had been giving her so many problems seemed perfectly clear now. She could see everything in the dark in precise detail. The branches and leaves on the trees were sharply defined against the lighter sky and for a time she stared at the tree line and imagined there were animal or human shapes hiding among them. A game she’d played since a child, sometimes in clouds, floor tiles or among patterns or night trees. There was a prancing horse…a man reaching for the stratosphere…a monster with wide-open mouth and razor sharp teeth. She fidgeted uneasily as a man and woman, holding hands and laughing, walked by. Without warning she was so hungry nothing else in the world mattered. Coming to her feet her head tilted up to smell the air. That sweet scent was all around her. What was it? Blood. Her eyes traveled to the man and woman moving away. Her mouth watered. Oh, my God, what’s happening to me? Spinning around, she fled as if the devil and his pitchfork were behind her. She’d fry up that hamburger and stuff it down her throat if she had to. She was just a little mad from grief, very sad, exhausted and…hungry. A nice fat cheeseburger with all the trimmings would make her feel better. There were homemade brownies on the counter. She’d have a few of those, too. What chocoholic wouldn’t want brownies? But later when she lay down beside her children the hamburger was still waiting in the refrigerator, the brownies untouched on the plate. Her stomach growled. Her veins throbbed. She’d feel like eating, she promised herself desperately, tomorrow. Tomorrow she’d wake up and be okay. Please God.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 A month later That last week in the hospital had been torture. Instead of feeling better each day, she felt weaker, more befuddled. Her broken heart so strong a pain she could barely breathe. She’d left the bed long before her doctor thought she should, but in the end, her insurance wouldn’t approve her staying any longer and she ached to return to her children. Knowing it was the only thing that would make her feel better. She’d gone home to Millstadt. Still feeling sick. Off kilter. At least, she was reunited with Sarah and Teddy. But things didn’t get better. Her health didn’t improve. The bills piled up and without her husband’s income she had a difficult time paying them. Without Jeff, the business was folding. She couldn’t design or build the houses, run or supervise the crews. All she’d been good for was the office work. There was no one else experienced enough to step into his shoes. The mortgage on the new house and everyday expenses were too much for her to handle alone. And her dwindling royalty checks (jokes really) were in no way sufficient to support the three of them. They couldn’t have supported a mouse. It didn’t take long to realize their lives would have to change drastically. Jeff had had an insurance policy, but the money wouldn’t last six months with their bills. She hadn’t worked on a new book in two years. Her agent had suggested she write another vampire novel but she’d wanted to try something different. Life and the demands it made with Jeff and the kids had gotten in the way and kept her from it. Tomorrow, she’d constantly told herself, she’d begin a new book. Tomorrow. Yet a tomorrow with free time had never seemed to come. Now her agent wasn’t sure, in the troubled publishing climate, if she could even sell another one of her books. Not when publishers were downsizing, laying people off, and buying works by more famous authors they knew were a sure thing. The other problem was, she could begin a new novel that very day yet it’d be six, seven months before she’d be ready to show it to an agent or an editor and months after that to tie up a contract. And royalties? That could take another year. They needed money sooner than that. She had to find a real job, but she was in the same boat as millions of out-of-work people because of the lousy economy. So many people she knew were laid off. Worst she’d ever seen. According to the news, and everything she was seeing and hearing around her, there weren’t any jobs to be had and it wasn’t going to get better any time soon. Something she could attest to now firsthand. She’d sent out dozens of resumes and hadn’t heard a word. Not even a reply email. That’s when Joey came to visit her and suggested she and the kids move back to Summer Haven to their parents’ vacant farmhouse. For some reason he’d kept the old place. Hadn’t sold it. Over the years, with her busy life, she’d all but forgotten about it. Joey hadn’t. He’d tended to it and paid the yearly taxes. Waiting. “Why did you keep it anyway?” she asked. “I gave it to you. You could have sold it anytime. It wasn’t as if you couldn’t use the money.” Joey seemed to need money all the time. His restaurant had gone through fat and lean times and he was always lending money to someone or other. That was her brother Joey, big heart and small pockets. “Because I always had hopes you and Jeff would return someday. Live in Summer Haven again with Laurie and me and I wanted to be sure you had a home to come back to. Family should be together, you know.” And, she thought, if she and her children moved hundreds of miles away to Florida…if someone were looking for her wanting to finish what they’d begun in the attack…if someone meant her or her children harm…hiding in another state might be safer for all of them. She’d smiled at him in the soft light of her kitchen. He was a good brother. She could count on him to be there for her. He always had been. “Huh. But it’s been awhile. I bet the weeds and fauna have taken the old place over, right?” He hesitated for just a moment. “No, they haven’t. In fact, the house is in fairly good shape. A little run down. Still full of mom and dad’s stuff, though. We’d have to clean it out. That’d be no problem. They didn’t have much to begin with. “Best thing is the rent would be free. We’d fix it up. I’d help. Sis, come on, you belong in Summer Haven with us now that Jeff and his parents are gone. You can write anywhere. Raise the kids anywhere. Be better if it was with family. There’s nothing to keep you in Millstadt anymore, is there?” “No, there isn’t.” The kitchen surrounding her that Jeff and she had decorated together was roomy and exquisite. The walls were a pearly pink color. A curio cabinet, filled with gifts he’d bought her through the years, was tucked in one corner. There were roses in pale muted colors wallpapered on two walls. Dried roses in the middle of the table in a brightly colored bowl. They’d worked so hard making it the home of their dreams. Now it was a reminder of what she no longer had. Tears caught in her throat. If she sold the house, in this depressed market, she’d be lucky to get what they owed for it. Oh, well. It was better than losing it to the bank. She went to the windows and lowered the blinds. Since she’d been freed from the hospital it seemed the sun was too bright. Too big. Her eyes, like her body, hurt all the time. Her mind refused to think of the things it needed to think about. She had no appetite. Even her kids had noticed how much weight she’d lost. She was skin and bones. What was wrong with her? It could be unwanted residuals from the attack, as her doctors believe, the physical trauma her body endured. But she knew better. It’s a broken heart, missing Jeff, that’s what it is. Missing her husband. Grief. Her brother was still talking. “Then sell this house. Better yet, let the real estate people sell it and you and the kids drive back with me. I can stay a few more days while you make arrangements and pack. We’ll take turns driving your car. Heck, if you’re still feeling poorly I’ll drive all the way. It’d save me an airplane ticket. It’ll be fun. Like a road trip vacation. The kind we used to have in the summers with mom and dad, remember? Oh, she remembered. Joey and her awkwardly quiet in the back seat as mom and dad fought up front about not having enough money. The cheap restaurants they’d eaten at and the cut-rate motels, dives really, they’d stayed in. Bugs in the beds. Grease in the food. Best thing about those trips were they hadn’t gone on many of them. She kept her negative feelings to herself. How could her brother recall those unpleasant vacations with fondness? She’d spent years forgetting them. “We can stop along the way and eat at truck stops and interesting roadside diners. Steal their specials of the day for my own place.” Joey chortled sneakily, rubbing his hands together, knowing he’d convince her. He knew her well. So they’d packed up the few belongings she and the kids couldn’t do without, left the remainder for the movers, and took the long trip home to Florida. She in a cap and sunglasses to shade her sensitive eyes and a purse full of aspirins she quickly depleted. The minute they’d hit the city limits of Summer Haven she was sure she’d made the right decision. She was–they were–home. “The town hasn’t changed much,” she remarked as they drove down Main Street. Small town quaintness emanated from every stone storefront and tree-shaded sidewalk. The good old Summer Haven Town Market was perched on the corner of Third Street, as it had been forever, with its canopied windows crowded with the weekly sales items: cans of coffee, loaves of bread, shaving cream and the last of the season’s plump, striped watermelons. “No, it hasn’t. I like that about it,” Joey admitted, his hands firm on the wheel. “No matter how crazy life gets everywhere else, Summer Haven remains a sleepy little hamlet full of nice friendly people. A sanctuary from the big bad world.” Jenny gazed around, overwhelmed with nostalgia for the days of her childhood when she and her brother had run the streets and fields wild and free. Her mother and father both alive. Before all the troubles. When they’d lived in the little yellow farmhouse by the creek. The memories made her shaky. So many regrets. So many lost moments she’d never reclaim again. Her hand moved to the window’s glass and fingers traced the outline of the trees going by on the other side. Things will be better now. They have to be. My heart and body will heal here. Sure, Jeff and I fled this place years ago after what happened; escaped the horrible memories of the vampire family that butchered my mother and father and almost killed us before we defeated them…but time has passed. The wounds have mended. Summer Haven is home; the town I was born in and once loved. The place I’d first met and loved Jeff. A place my children and I can now feel safe in. And what’s left of my family is here. “Mom,” Teddy, asked from the back seat, “is this where you grew up?” “Yep. Your Uncle Joey, too. See that gazebo there in the center of the park?” Her finger pointed to the left. “Yeah.” Teddy’s brown eyes looked where she directed. Smiling, he brushed the blondish hair from them so he could see better. It was the first smile to grace his face in a long time, and it encouraged her. “Your Uncle Joey and I used to play hide-and-go-seek around it and in the park when we were your age. We’d hide behind the trees and bushes.” “At night we ran through the yards and streets of the town like wild Indians, didn’t we, Sis?” Joey chuckled as he maneuvered the car past the Century 21 Real Estate office. Someone, a man in red shorts and white T-shirt, waved at Joey as they passed. Joey waved back. Many people noticed them and waved or shouted hellos. Joey was well known and liked. So different than when they’d been kids. “Yes, we loved the night,” she whispered. “Once.” When they were children. Long ago when they hadn’t know evil mystical creatures existed and hadn’t feared darkness. Joey threw her a strange look but didn’t comment on what she’d said. He’d gone on to reminiscence about his favorite subject. Food. “Remember that little confectionary we used to get penny candy and ice cream cones at in the summer? Wasn’t it called John’s?” “I think so.” “Remember how we used to roam the shoulders along the roads, sidewalks and streets looking for empty bottles and lost money so we could buy that penny candy?” Joey laughed. “What scroungers we were.” “I remember.” And she did. They’d been poor, deprived, and even penny candy or sharing a package of cupcakes was a treat. “You two,” Teddy groaned, “were pathetic.” “No, we were kids.” Joey’s face broke into a grin. “Hungry kids. We were always on the lookout for free food.” “Pitiful,” Teddy snickered. Jenny took in the familiar buildings and streets as they rambled through town. She should be happy. Home. She should be feeling better then she was. All she could feel was her growing lethargy, as if everything was too much to bother with. She told herself it was because of all that had happened and Jeff’s death; the unexpected but nagging financial problems. Now the move. That’s all. She was depressed. What did she expect? Time, Joey adamantly believed, and being home, would help her out of her funk. Yeah, a century maybe. Oh, Lord, she missed Jeff. He would have made this move easy. He would have made her life easy as he always had. But he was gone. Get used to it. She was on her own now. The kids and her. “Mom,” Sarah, her youngest at eight, piped up from the rear seat where she was reading one of those Twilight books. She had the same coloring, eyes and hair as her brother. They could have been twins, except she was four years younger. The more animated, friendlier of the two, she was the one most like Jeff in temperament. Loved to read and draw. Such a kind-hearted child she’d cry at any little thing. Loved animals. “I’m really hungry. My stomach’s talking to me. No, it’s squawking loudly. Can we get something to eat?” Joey replied before Jenny could. “Already thought of that, sweetie. I called Laurie on my cell as we came into town. She’s got fried chicken–your favorite Teddy–with all the fixings waiting for us at the diner. It’s the special for today.” He glanced at his sister. “That okay with you…a warm meal before we head to the apartment?” She and the kids were staying with Joey and Laurie until they could get the farmhouse cleaned out and their furniture arrived in a day or two. “I know we’ve been on the road since morning and you’re probably tired. But you gotta be hungry, too. I know I am.” “Ha, you’re always hungry. But food sounds good. We could use something to eat. I could use some coffee myself.” She didn’t know why she’d said what she said about the food. They’d been on the road for days and she was exhausted, but not hungry. She hadn’t been hungry for weeks. The pit of her stomach burned. Her throat was sore. Her blood was a fire running through her veins. Again, she thought it was because of the distress she’d been under, the grieving. A body reacts in strange ways to heartache. Hers was trying to starve itself. Her brother parked in front of Joey’s Diner. “Well,” Jenny said, “this place sure has changed. For the better.” Her eyes scanned the family restaurant Joey was so proud of. The front window had been widened and heightened into a beautiful rounded bay window filled with plants and flowers, either silk or real ones, so lifelike she couldn’t tell. The business next door was gone. It’d become part of the diner. “Wow, you added on just like you said you would years ago. It looks fantastic. I love the window treatment. So classy. I see Laurie’s artistic touch in it.” “You got it. Laurie did the decorating. They’re not real plants, but hey, pretty anyway, aren’t they? I took over that empty gift shop next door, what, six years ago now, and expanded. We remodeled and practically doubled our space. We can fit more than fifty people in if we cram.” Her brother grinned. “You like it?” “I do. I can’t wait to see the inside.” The kids were already out of the car and at the restaurant’s front door. Jenny got out, tipping her hat to further cover her face, and followed behind at a slower pace. Her eyes fell on the Dollar Store that now stood where the exquisite movie house, the Grand Theater, once had. The theater she and her father, when he’d been alive, had renovated. The theater she and Jeff later burnt to the ground. A shiver numbed her spine and she thrust the bad memories away. Now her father, mother and Jeff were all in their graves. She and Joey were the only ones left who knew what had happened that night at the theater when they’d destroyed the vampires. Best not to think of those times. Not now. Inside her brother’s café she was met with subtle lighting and welcoming smiles. Laurie rushed to embrace her after hugging Sarah and Teddy. “Gosh, it’s so good to see you, Jenny. And the kids.” Jenny caught the troubled expression as it flittered across the other woman’s face, one quickly veiled. Laurie was barely taller than Teddy and hadn’t changed much in the years since Jenny had last seen her. She’d gained more weight; her hair was short and a softer shade of blond, yet her eyes were still intriguingly green like a cat’s and full of life. That’s one thing Jenny admired about her sister-in-law, she had a zest for living and people–plus she unconditionally loved Joey. “I have your supper ready to bring out.” Laurie smiled. “You all must be tired, so find a place to sit and I’ll be back in a jiffy with everything.” She bustled toward the kitchen. “And I’ll just go help her.” Joey trailed off behind his wife. Probably wanted a few moments alone with her, Jenny mused. Be glad you have her, brother. Your wife. Alive. Your lives all around and ahead of you. Pain stabbed her heart as she watched the two shove through the swinging doors. Before they closed, framed in the space, Joey caught up to his wife and surprised her with a passionate hug. A kiss. Their laughter was tender, subdued. There weren’t many people in the diner. A young couple tucked away to the side munching on hamburgers and fries. One snowy-haired guy at the counter drinking a shake. It was three o’clock in the afternoon. Too early for supper and too late for lunch. Joey claimed they got busy with the supper crowd around five. Teddy slid into a booth in front of the bay window and Sarah and Jenny scooted in after him. Jenny leaned against the padded leather, weary to the bone, and took her surroundings in. The diner had changed a lot. Once it’d been dim and run-down, now it was bright and shiny like new coins. The color scheme was every hue of yellow that existed or close to it. Pale lemon walls, mustard stool tops and cantaloupe hued table tops. It seemed like an unlikely combination, but somehow it worked. The dazzling colors made the place look cheery. There were hanging plants cascading from the ceiling and stunning paintings, originals she noted, spiced up the walls. Joey was friends with some of the local artists and did everything he could to help them, including buying their work, apparently. The paintings made the diner seem richer, more elegant and added splashes of color. Everywhere she saw Laurie’s delicate hand, her sense of style. Like in the menu. These days instead of greasy hamburgers and fatty Salisbury Steaks, a customer could get a delicious garden salad, a thick juicy steak with locally grown vegetables and one of five varieties of pie or cobbler, the best in the county. There were so many loving touches: metal that gleamed, leather soft as marshmallow, shiny counter and tabletops and artfully arranged flowers. She was impressed. The restaurant was thriving, even in the bad economy, her brother had bragged on their trip out. Joey brought her a steaming mug of coffee and chocolate milkshakes for the kids and set them down on the table. “Your suppers are on their way. Won’t be long.” “Thanks.” She grinned weakly up at him. “But hold my supper. I don’t feel like eating right now.” And concern flashed across his face. “Sis, you’ve hardly eaten a thing since we left Illinois. You have to eat. Keep up your strength. No matter how distraught you are.” Slipping in beside her, he laid his hand over hers and held her gaze until she looked away. His hazel brown eyes, so similar to hers, were full of pity. Lately she’d had too much of that and shied away from more. They’d had this discussion before. He was worried about her lack of appetite. She felt bad about it but there was nothing she could do. She just wasn’t hungry. A soft sigh escaped her lips, looking at her children looking at her as they slurped down their shakes. “Okay, bring me out a smaller portion, a child’s meal, and I’ll try to eat some of it.” “Good.” He patted her hand and returned to the kitchen. The chicken must have been good because her kids gobbled it down along with the rest of the food but she was barely able to eat a third of it. Then when Joey and Laurie weren’t watching, she snuck to the women’s restroom and threw every bite up in the toilet, flushed it and rejoined her kids in the booth. She’d never done that before. She was worried too. What was wrong with her? Why couldn’t she keep food down? And why were her eyes hurting so much? Her head? Could grief truly do this to a person? She lowered her head into her hands, listening to Sarah and Teddy debating what to have for dessert. Bottomless pits, both of them. They were her world now. They were everything. All that mattered. If it weren’t for them she couldn’t have gone on. Wouldn’t want to go on. She raised her head and gently smiled as they huddled over the menu. God, she loved them so much. “Mom, what are you having for dessert?” Teddy wanted to know. Sarah was crowding him, taunting him with funny faces. He kept pushing her away. “Stop it! Stop bugging me,” he snapped at her, “or I’ll dump the rest of your shake on your silly head.” Jenny chuckled. “Now you two behave, hear me? There’ll be no shakes dumped on anyone’s head. Not today. Teddy, be nice to your sister. She’s the only one you have.” Both small faces swung toward her, and seeing, sensing, her melancholy, they instantly calmed down. Teddy put an arm around his sister and gave her a half-hearted hug and a swift peck on the cheek. Sarah giggled and pinched him on his arm. “Hey! That hurt. Mom!” A common frustration played across her son’s face. Jenny knew, as only a mother could, that deep down the two loved each other. But sometimes siblings had a funny way of showing it. The age gap, as well as the difference in gender, didn’t help. Teddy was on the verge of adulthood, and since his father’s death was trying to grow up as fast as he could. Sarah was a child in his eyes. But he’d do anything for her, and if anyone or anything tried to hurt her, Jenny knew, he’d be the first there to protect her. Just like Joey and her. Laurie was standing above them, trying hard not to laugh at the children’s antics. “You know what you want for dessert, kiddos?” “I’ll have chocolate pie with whipped cream on top,” Teddy ordered in his best adult voice. “The biggest piece you have.” He spread his hands apart almost two feet. Like her, her son was a chocoholic. He was tall already for a boy his age. Strong willed, but with a sensitive side that unfortunately reminded Jenny of herself when she was twelve. Her son was a dreamer who woke up one fateful morning and decided he had to take more responsibility onto his small shoulders. Grow up quick. Also like her. With her it’d been an alcoholic mother and a father who the world had beaten down until he’d been unrecognizable. She’d had no choice but to step up and take things into her own youthful hands. Someone had to. Sometimes childhood wasn’t all sugar and spice. She studied his fresh face and her heart melted. So young. In many other ways he was so like his father. Courageous. Smart. She’d never wanted an unhappy childhood for him, or her daughter, but now was apprehensive she couldn’t give them anything else. They loved her but they’d adored their father. Her fingers went to swipe the tears from her cheek, but there were none. She hadn’t been able to cry, not once, since she’d left the hospital. “Yeah, me, too. A big piece of chocolate pie,” her daughter seconded as she jumped up and skipped to the nearest empty stool, climbed up and started spinning. “Nothing for me, thank you,” Jenny muttered. She pretended to be busy sipping her coffee. For some reason coffee didn’t taste good to her lately. Again she wondered what was wrong, but at the moment she was too tired to question it. The look of anxiety in Laurie’s eyes was the same response she’d been getting all week from Joey, but the woman didn’t say a word. Instead she glanced at the kids. “Where do you two put all this food?” She clucked, and then walked away to get what they’d asked for. “In our stomachs, of course,” Sarah bantered back as she twirled around. Her thin little legs moved up and down like one of those carnival rides. Her yellow hair floated around her head. “Nah. No human has stomachs that big,” her sister-in-law tossed over her shoulder as she disappeared into the kitchen. “Must go right down into your legs.” Laurie. Soon after the incident at the Grand Theater all those years ago, the vicious attack where Joey almost died, he’d had a change of heart and had declared his undying love to his long time live-in and had married her. Half the town hadn’t given the new marriage an icicle’s chance in a hot oven. Laurie had always been flighty, a little off kilter in a creative artsy way. But they’d been wrong. The union had flourished like the restaurant. Twelve years now. Laurie was happy. Joey was happy. Until Laurie, Joey had been rudderless, a drifter side-stepping through life. One woman, one job after another. Laurie and the diner had anchored him. So Jenny was happy for both of them. The couple’s only regret was they had no children. Something they’d desperately wanted. Joey said they hadn’t given up. Not yet. Until then, the diner was their child and they nurtured and loved it as if it were the only one. And it showed. Laurie brought out the pie and sat down across from Jenny. “You sure you’re all right?” she inquired caringly, head bent. “You’re looking kind of pale, girl. Your eyes have this…funny glint.” The woman laid a hand on Jenny’s arm and Jenny slid backwards slightly, just enough so the contact broke. “I’m as good as can be what with my husband being murdered, losing my home, being nearly flat-busted broke and all.” She shrugged and did her best to look healthy. Sat up straighter. Opened her heavy eyes wider. “My eyes look funny?” “Yeah, they’re glittering like tiny stars. Weird. That is when you look up, which you haven’t done much since you came in. Something’s wrong, isn’t it, besides the chaos that’s come from Jeff’s death? I thought we were friends? Spill it.” “The eyes? It’s the bright lights in here. After the attack, my long hospital stay and all the crying. They’re irritated. That’s all,” Jenny snapped, then felt badly she’d lost her temper when Laurie was only trying to be kind. “Sorry. I’m just…exhausted.” Inside her guts were churning and her mind was spinning. Why couldn’t she tell Joey and Laurie the truth? That she felt like hell, truly strange, and had since the night Jeff had died. For some reason she couldn’t. Don’t tell anyone. Wait. See. She’d feel better tomorrow. No sense in worrying them. Not yet. She’d never been a complainer and she wasn’t about to start now. No one liked a whiner. It was bad enough she’d come home practically penniless, homeless. Husbandless. That was needy enough. She couldn’t be sick, too. “I can see that. Perhaps now you’re here, and after you get some sleep, you’ll feel better. I hope so. Just remember if you need to talk to someone anytime, you can talk to me. Joey and I are here for you.” “Thank you, but I’ll be fine.” She flashed a faint smile. “Like you said, now that we’re here I’ll be myself again.” No. Never again. Not with Jeff in his grave and her life shattered to hell. But how could Jenny tell her that when she couldn’t even believe it herself? Even now she expected to see Jeff walk through the door, saunter up and kiss her hello, especially here in Summer Haven, their old stomping grounds. No, he’ll never walk in anywhere ever again. He’s dead. Stifling a sob, she forced her attention to the present. Laurie was giving her that look again. Jenny was relieved when the meal and the visit were over. The sun was going down and it flooded the world outside with twilight in delicate shades of amethyst. The air had cooled. The breeze diminished. The children were yawning, their eyes welcoming sleep. It was time to get them settled for the night and in bed. The diner was filling up with the supper crowd. Way too many people. With Joey’s help, she packed up the kids, who, with the stressful day behind them and their bellies full, curled in the rear seat of the car and fell asleep. Joey drove to the apartment across from the town square where Laurie and he had been living the last nine years. “It isn’t a fancy or big place,” Joey made excuses as she followed him into the living room, “but it’s close to the diner, close enough to walk to and from if we need to, and suits us well enough. “We thought we’d put you three in the spare room for as long as you’re here.” He deposited a sleeping Teddy on one of the knee-high airbeds he’d bought the week before. “Sorry about the makeshift beds, but Laurie and I figured you wouldn’t be here long.” The room was cramped with the beds on the floor and two scuffed but ample-sized dressers flat against the wall. Her brother had made the accommodations as nice as he could, but their money was tight just as hers was. The dressers were used; the beds were clearance items from Wal-Mart. He was real proud of his thriftiness. In that way they both took after their father who’d always known how to pinch a penny until it became two. “You’re right, we won’t be here long, and the room’s great just the way it is. You and Laurie have been so kind already and now this. Thanks, Joey.” “Hey, you don’t have to thank me. I’m your brother. I’m supposed to be helpful and kind. You going to leave the kids dressed?” She laid Sarah on the bed in the far corner by the window, covered her up and turned to Joey. “They’ve been through so much and the trip here was long. No good reason to wake them. I usually don’t do this, but they can sleep in their clothes tonight. Won’t hurt.” And she was bone weary; it’d been all she could do to get Sarah into bed without falling over. Between the difficulties of the last month and the tedious journey to Summer Haven, Jenny could barely muster the energy to drag herself out of the bedroom. A bewildering and all-encompassing weariness had suddenly overtaken her mind and her body. Even her thoughts were incoherent. It was like her mind was minutes behind reality and couldn’t catch up. Again she wondered what was wrong with her. After Joey deposited the suitcases in their room he joined her on the living room couch before a giant screened television set. “They’re both still sleeping,” he reported Her eyes went to the television. “Gosh, brother, that’s the biggest damn T.V. I’ve ever seen. But couldn’t you have found a larger one?” She chuckled. Joey loved television, had since he’d been a kid. When he wasn’t at the diner, Laurie had spilled the beans, he was in front of the set. There was a stack of DVDs piled against each side. And he always recorded his missed programs while working to watch later on his days off. “Fifty-two inch.” He flopped down beside her. “It was my birthday present last year from my lovely wife.” “She knows how to please you all right.” “That she does. “Well,” he put his arm around her shoulders, “you’re here. Finally back home. How does it feel?” Reclining into the over-stuffed sofa, she closed her eyes, conscious that his arms around her made her feel uncomfortable. She scooted over so they fell away. “Good.” She smiled, opened her eyes to stare out the window. “Though odd. I never thought I’d be living here again. Especially without Jeff.” He leveled sympathetic eyes at her. “I miss him, too.” Then he was silent for a moment before adding, “I know I’ve said this before, Sis, but I’m so sorry about what’s happened to you. The assault. Jeff gone. The coma. Your money problems. All of it. It’s awful. I’m only grateful you’re alive and you and the kids have moved back here. You belong with family now. And I’m tickled to have you.” He hadn’t been able to say the word dead, not once. Jeff was gone. Just…gone. She understood. She might have been married to Jeff, given him children, loved him most of her life, but Joey had grown up with Jeff, too, and since childhood they’d been best friends. They’d both lost someone who could never be replaced. “Yeah, what’s left of us.” “We have each other, the children. Laurie. We’re still a family.” “I know that.” What else could she say? Nothing. It’d all been said. She was sick of the condolences and empty words from people. Words didn’t help. They didn’t fill the empty void in her life, didn’t fix the ache in her heart. Gone was gone. Dead was dead. Joey stood up. “I hate to run out on you but I promised Laurie I’d help her close the diner. She’s had her hands full the last week, running it alone and all. I owe her. Will you be okay here by yourself for a while?” “Of course.” Another half-hearted smile. “The kids are out for the night and looks like I’ll be right behind them. I’m pooped. You go on. I’ll be fine.” At the door, gazing back at her, he casually brought up, “Laurie mentioned you didn’t eat much for supper. Just so you know, there’s hamburger in the refrigerator. The frying pans are in the lower cabinet by the oven and the utensils are in the drawer to its left. If you get hungry fry yourself up a burger or two. Cheese and condiments in the fridge. Buns are in the breadbox on the counter.” “Thanks. If I get hungry I will.” She yawned. “But right now all I want is a bed under me and covers over me. See you tomorrow morning.” “Laurie and I will try to be quiet when we come home later tonight so as not to wake you or the kids.” “Don’t worry. The way I’m feeling, an earthquake wouldn’t wake me. And the kids sleep like the dead.” She realized what she’d said soon as she said it and a sensation of despair washed over her. Dead. Like Jeff. She sighed and didn’t know she had. “So I’ll see you tomorrow.” “That you will.” After her brother went out the door, drained of every ounce of energy she’d ever had, she reclined her head and shut her eyes again. She’d slipped into sleep when something–a noise or a smell–woke her. The clock on the wall showed it was eight twenty-five. She’d been asleep an hour. She was no longer tired. In fact, sitting up, she felt invigorated. Restless. And for the first time in weeks she was actually hungry. She wandered into the kitchen. The windows around the room were ebony squares. A faint breeze sung through the trees, a song of endless nights. She opened the refrigerator and saw the fat package of raw hamburger. She reached in, pulled it out and carried it to the sink. Tearing open the skin-tight plastic wrap, she brought the meat to her lips and drank the loose blood that had collected along the edges. When she’d slurped up the last drop she dropped the package to the counter and stared at it. Why had she done that? Drink hamburger blood? Ech. Ech. Ech. Damn. Grief did do strange things to a person. “You’re supposed to make patties and fry it up,” she grumbled, “put it on a bun with mustard and catsup, for God’s sake. Onions. Yum. Yum.” But that didn’t appeal to her at all. Not one bit. The hamburger was rewrapped and stuffed back in the refrigerator. Maybe she’d eat something later. She went to the door, opened it slightly and listened, thinking she heard something on the evening air. Violin music. The melody was soft and haunting and wafted across her memories like an old friend. Hadn’t she’d heard that song before? That violin with the sweet sound? Years ago? Here in Summer Haven. Impossible. Her ears strained to hold on to the music but it floated away. Whoever had been playing stopped or the wind had shifted and sent the notes in another direction. It must have been her imagination. Too many memories here. Way too many. Many good. Many bad. Shaking her head she walked through the open door into the dark. Joey and Laurie’s apartment was in the heart of town, across from the gazebo she’d pointed out to her children as they’d driven in. This was the place she’d grown up in and had run away from. Twice. Home. How come she always found herself back here? She didn’t know. For a late September evening in Florida it was chilly. She strolled, shivering, across the park grass and climbed up into the gazebo. It was one of those old-fashioned wooden structures that had been lovingly built by hand in an earlier time where that sort of craftsmanship mattered. It hadn’t changed in all these years. Still lovely. Sturdy. A little peeling paint, a creak or two was new, but otherwise, like the park and the town, it was as she remembered it. Sitting down, she inhaled the scents of the surrounding darkness. The pungent leaves, the fresh smelling grass and the gritty dirt. Somewhere above her an owl took flight. She could hear its call as its wings took it high into the sky. Hear its wings beating the air. The night soothed her; heightened her senses. Everything seemed unreal. As if she was in a dream. Each sound and sight, a kaleidoscope, folded into the next. Her heart raced as if it were someone else’s. Her skin no longer felt chilled. She felt nothing. Her eyes scanned the landscape around her. The park. The shadowed streets and the squeezed in buildings that even at this late hour were full of customers coming and going. Soon the businesses would close for the night and the people would go home. She’d grown up here; her family had lived and died here. The memories flooded into her and sent her riding on a wave of nostalgia. Joey and her, barefoot children, sprinting down Main Street on a July morning, heading to John’s Confectionary to buy penny candy; playing hide-and-seek on a sweltering evening among the fireflies in the park where she now sat. Racing each other on their battered bicycles down the back country roads. Faster. Faster. Picking wild strawberries and blackberries and gobbling them down, juice trickling down their chins, because as children it seemed they were always starving. Never enough food in the pantry, the refrigerator, the cabinets. Bill collectors banging at the door and peering in the windows. Mom, Joey and her hiding in one of the rooms with the shades drawn and the lights off. Jeff and her as teenagers so hungry for each other they found hiding places all over town…in the velvet dark…to be alone. To kiss. Fondle. Love each other. She could still hear their teenage laughter haunting the night air. So much later. After their bitter divorce when her world had grown so bleak. Her father and her painting houses and scrapping for living money in the scorching summer sun; slaving away together in the Grand Theater to recreate its old glory only then, within weeks, to see it incinerate into ashes. There she was bumping into her boozed up mother in the small supermarket down the street, and reliving the humiliation as she watched her mother run out the front door after stealing a bottle of booze…that she then had to pay for. She remembered the trailer behind the farmhouse, a tiny confined set of rooms she lived in after coming home again the first time. She could still hear the neighing of her father’s two old horses in the field behind it. A prick of sadness remained when she thought of their senseless deaths at the demons’ hands. She’d loved those old nags. Then the disappearances. The slaughter. Her heart wrenching sorrow at her father’s untimely death at the vampires’ hands. Her panicked terror at the cruel attack on Joey in his diner when he almost died. Jeff and her running through the woods knowing they didn’t have much time. Finding the basement of the theater filled with half-alive and dead victims in cages. The fight to the death with the vampires. The fire. Ah, memories. Why was she recalling the unhappy ones more than the happy? She didn’t know. It could be her frame of mind. A lot had happened to her since the days she’d last lived here, and until recently they’d been mainly happy things. Now she was back where she’d begun. At the beginning. Square one. She couldn’t do it all over again. Alone. She just couldn’t. A breeze fluttered the hair around her face. She should have tied it in a ponytail, out of the way. The night chattered around her and she listened. She could hear people moving about and whispering in the houses lining the fringe of the park. A couple was fighting on the next street over about who was going to use the car that night. A baby was crying somewhere. A cat meowed, a series of low-throated vibrations, crying out to the night and another cat answered. Probably locked out of their houses and wanting in. It was as if her ears were catching every minuscule noise. Weird. The night wind must be doing funny things with sound. A cloying smell permeated the air, a perfume of bloody raw meat juices, and almost certainly it came from the steak restaurant across the street. She had the nearly uncontrollable urge to jump up, run over there and find the source of the delicious aroma. Crazy. She forced herself to remain sitting. Her eyes that had been giving her so many problems seemed perfectly clear now. She could see everything in the dark in precise detail. The branches and leaves on the trees were sharply defined against the lighter sky and for a time she stared at the tree line and imagined there were animal or human shapes hiding among them. A game she’d played since a child, sometimes in clouds, floor tiles or among patterns or night trees. There was a prancing horse…a man reaching for the stratosphere…a monster with wide-open mouth and razor sharp teeth. She fidgeted uneasily as a man and woman, holding hands and laughing, walked by. Without warning she was so hungry nothing else in the world mattered. Coming to her feet her head tilted up to smell the air. That sweet scent was all around her. What was it? Blood. Her eyes traveled to the man and woman moving away. Her mouth watered. Oh, my God, what’s happening to me? Spinning around, she fled as if the devil and his pitchfork were behind her. She’d fry up that hamburger and stuff it down her throat if she had to. She was just a little mad from grief, very sad, exhausted and…hungry. A nice fat cheeseburger with all the trimmings would make her feel better. There were homemade brownies on the counter. She’d have a few of those, too. What chocoholic wouldn’t want brownies? But later when she lay down beside her children the hamburger was still waiting in the refrigerator, the brownies untouched on the plate. Her stomach growled. Her veins throbbed. She’d feel like eating, she promised herself desperately, tomorrow. Tomorrow she’d wake up and be okay. Please God.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 The Next Day A cool breeze danced around them and balanced out the warm sun. That morning the weather person had forecast rain and storms coming, but for now the sun ruled firm and steady. Indian summer in Summer Haven. The long twisting driveway was full of potholes and a little gravel. In the winter the holes would fill with water, mud, and tires would have a hard time getting through or around them. There’d be endless puddles to soak her shoes if she didn’t put her feet in just the right spots. Many a day coming home from school she’d slogged that driveway to the front door skip hopping all the way. The memories jumped in the car with her and made her smile. When she’d been young she’d loved coming home to fresh baked cookies and a cold glass of milk in the kitchen. When she was older, after things began to fall apart between her mother and father, not so much. The farmhouse was a decrepit, filthy mess. The wood siding had buckled and the paint was sun faded. The windows were swatches of grime and marbled cracks. It’d been empty for a long time, and before that her parents hadn’t taken good care of it anyway. But it was the house she’d grown up in. It was home once and it would be home again. But only with a whole lot of work. She exhaled loudly and plopped down on the porch steps. “Mom,” Sarah whined as she twirled around one of the posts that barely held up the front porch. “Do we really have to live here? It’s old. Dirty, too. Look, that window’s broke. There’s a hole in it. When the rain comes it’ll let all the water in. I don’t want to be a human fish.” She caught and gave her daughter a spontaneous hug, though the girl’s warmth made her ill at ease. She couldn’t start treating her children differently because she was feeling unwell. They’d been through enough the way it was. “You won’t be. It’ll be fixed long before the rainy times come, honey. It’s just September.” The top porch step was hard and Jenny shifted her weight around until she got comfortable; she pulled the girl into her lap. She was relieved Sarah had stopped asking questions about why they’d had to sell and leave their old house. Every day for weeks that’d been all she’d spoken of. Why did they have to move? Couldn’t they stay there? Her friends were there. Her school. She liked it there. It’d been difficult to convince her they were only doing what they had to do. “Sweetie, the house will look so much better when we get through with it.” Jenny was too conscious of her daughter’s sweat, the channeling of blood beneath the girl’s thin skin. She moved her face away. “After we clear it out and clean it up. You’ll see how a fresh coat of paint inside and out, our comfy furniture and pretty things inside, will make the difference.” “There’s furniture in there already. Old dusty stuff.” Sarah sulked. “I peeked in the window and saw it.” “I know.” Jenny stood up and held out her hand to the girl. She felt the need to get out of the sun. It was time to enter their new home and see how bad it was inside. “Don’t worry about it. Your Uncle Joey and some friends of his are coming out this afternoon to cart most of it away. So let’s go inside, see what has to go and what stays.” She turned her head and shouted, “Teddy, get back here. We’re going in.” Her son galloped around the yard, an untamed colt, exploring the grounds. She’d always liked where the house sat, merely four miles from town but still in the middle of rolling hills and fields. Secluded. Tranquil. Huge leafy oaks stood sentry around it and provided it with shade and cooler air in the summer. The house wasn’t much to look at, but the location was peaceful…if you enjoyed the country. She did. Always had. The symphony of frogs and crickets in the nearby trees calmed her and evoked the sweeter reminiscences of her childhood: the way she’d lay on her second floor bed and listen to the night creatures and the murmuring wind; stare through the windows at the ever changing heavens, the stars and clouds as they raced above her; plan and daydream about the future. They were some of the best times. “I’m here, Mom.” Teddy stomped up the porch steps with his clumsy big feet. Someday he was going to be as tall as or taller than his father. “Let’s see what the inside looks like. I get dibs on one of the upstairs bedrooms. The one in the back by the humongous tree.” “No fair.” Sarah’s voice was petulant. “I wanted that room!” “Hold on you two,” she informed them. “All the bedrooms are upstairs and there are three. We’ll all get one.” Well, one of the rooms was as small as a large closet. That had been Joey’s when they’d been kids. Sarah wouldn’t like it but it was going to be hers. She braced herself for the resistance she’d have to face but knew enticing the girl with fresh paint and new Twilight posters would help ease the disappointment. Sarah was easy to bribe. Whereas Teddy liked money. He’d begun to notice girls and that they noticed him…if he had the coolest clothes and had cash in his pockets. Ah, those were the innocently simple days. When all one cared about was how one appeared to others and what others thought of them. The key Joey had given her that morning stuck in the lock and it took a few tries to pry the door open. He’d said he’d been out there recently, but as she shoved in the door and went inside she couldn’t imagine when that would have been. A year ago? There was an inch of dust and mice leavings sprinkled over everything. Spider webs. The furniture, vintage nineteen sixties or earlier, looked it. After her parent’s death, the house had been abandoned. Nothing had been moved or taken out. Joey wasn’t the sort to ask for extra work if he could avoid it. So now it’d be left to her and the kids to do the bulk of it. Where to start? She meandered through the rooms taking stock. There wasn’t much trash. She had to give her brother some credit, he’d kept it fairly uncluttered; though there were old dishes, canned food in the cabinets and utensils in the drawers that would have to be disposed of. Most of the sparse furniture was junk. It hadn’t been that great when new and now most of it was rotting wood, loose nails and split seams. She opened the old fridge. It was empty but seemed to be working. Joey had had the electric and water reconnected the week before. The stove, too, looked worthy to stay. Good, that’d give her time to buy better appliances because they’d had to leave theirs in their last house. The real estate agent said it’d help its sale. In the living room she yanked open the curtains. The light blinded her, made her skin feel crawly, and she retreated into the shadows. With her children’s eyes on her, she recovered quickly. “All this stuff is going to the dump, except the fridge and the oven. The rest of it’s not worth keeping. We need the space anyway if our furniture’s going to fit.” “I can help you move the heavy things outside,” Teddy offered. “I’m strong.” He wrote TRASH on the television set’s dirty screen with his finger. She remembered the television. It was really old. “That not a bad idea, son. Joey won’t be here for hours but we can get started on things and clear this mess out so we can sweep and mop.” They had the cleaning supplies in the trunk of the car. They’d come prepared. She sent Sarah out for the brooms and mops as she and Teddy moved furniture onto the front porch or into the yard. The heaviest pieces would have to wait for Joey’s arrival; what they could move they did. There was more than enough to keep them busy. They emptied drawers, closets and cubbyholes. The trash bags filled up quickly. Jenny forced herself to work hard, not to think about the way she was feeling. She was no longer tired or weak, but she felt even stranger than the night before. As if she was in a trance. Every noise was too loud. Smells were too strong. Her mind kept going off track, distracting her with disturbing thoughts that didn’t seem to be hers. She didn’t dare close her eyes, not even for a second, or the images came. Running wildly through wet night woods. Chasing something. Something chasing her. Drinking something that filled her belly and made her feel so…good. Flying from one place to another as if she had wings, but she didn’t. So confusing. She couldn’t fly. Not for the first time she feared something was horribly wrong with her; something much more virulent, life altering, than a normal physical ailment. Maybe a brain tumor from the concussion. Or an aftermath of the coma. She should call the doctor she’d had in the hospital, but a badgering voice in her head warned her not to. What could she say? She was feeling odd…couldn’t sleep…couldn’t keep real food down…and that all her senses had gone into overdrive? She was dreaming of, craving…human blood? Smelling it everywhere? Her doctor would either say it was the backlash of her heartache and trauma, give herself a little more time, or he’d insist she check herself into a hospital for immediate observation and more tests. Yikes, more tests? Oh no. She couldn’t do that. Not now. Besides she had too much too do. Her children needed her. She needed them. She had to find a job and bring in some money. Most of all, she was frightened. Because in the deep recesses of her mind there was a possible explanation to the way she was feeling and she couldn’t face it. Couldn’t bear to even think about it. No, no, no. That morning she’d forced herself to eat a bowl of Raisin Bran with bananas, her usual breakfast, but minutes later she’d rushed to the bathroom and threw it up. The face in the mirror glared at her with fevered eyes and skin paler than she’d ever seen it. Why hadn’t she been able to keep the food down when she was so very hungry? She didn’t know. Scared as she was, she didn’t dare say anything to anyone. That tiny insistent inner voice again. Shut up. Ignore it. It’ll go away. You’ll feel better tomorrow. Ha. By the time Joey and his friends drove up in the rented truck in the late afternoon, she and the kids had half the house cleaned out. Somehow it seemed smaller than she remembered. An old-fashioned kitchen, an ample living room and modest bath on the first floor and three bedrooms, one tiny, on the second. It’d be just right for the three of them. She smiled when she discovered her mom’s hidey nooks throughout the house, stashed with rosaries, crucifixes and different size bottles of holy water. A religious woman, until the booze took over, her mother, at all times eccentric, had felt the need to hide these important items. Besides the religious stuff, Jenny found seven dollars in folded cash. Some sharp silvery-looking arrow shaped things she couldn’t identify but reminded her of the metal points some archers used on their arrow shafts. When she was younger she’d taken a year of archery and had been exceptionally good at it. Her teacher had wanted her to try out for the statewide Olympic archery team. Which, at the time, she hadn’t but years afterwards wished she would have. Jenny packed her mother’s strange items in a cardboard box, tied it with a shoestring, and placed it on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, not having the heart to throw them away. “Wow, you’ve been busy, haven’t you? Good job,” Joey praised her as he came in the front door trailed by a short guy with glasses and longish hair, and a blond-headed taller man who looked somehow familiar. “Keeping busy helps.” Joey nodded understandingly. “You want to keep anything?” “Nah. Everything goes, except the refrigerator, the stove, a few odds and ends, and some mementoes I’ve set aside.” She grinned at the two men behind Joey. “Works out great because there’s hardly enough room for the furniture that’s coming. I’d forgotten how small this place was.” “Easier to clean though, hey?” Joey looked around at what she’d done so far. “It will be that.” “It’s nice you and the kids got so much done already. Less work for us.” “You would think of it that way.” Joey tapped the shoulder of the guy with the glasses. “This is a friend of mine, Oscar Schmidt. He’s a manager at the Town Market. “And you remember Andy Sullivan, don’t you? He went to high school with us.” “Oh, I remember you,” she tilted her head at the man as he smiled and put out a hand to shake. It was the briefest shake in history. She barely touched his hand. “Graduated a year or two behind me, right? You used to come over and you and Joey flew those motorized airplanes out in the back field?” Andy’s airplanes. They were too expensive for Joey to have had one. Their father hadn’t believed in buying expensive toys when the fields and trees were around to play in free. Oh, she remembered Andy all right. The boy who’d lived in a sprawling fancy house and whose parents had money. The boy who’d had the brand name clothes and a pocketful of cash for ice cream in his pockets. She’d never understood what Joey saw in him. Andy had been spoiled, selfish, and never missed a chance to rub his wealth in their noses. She hoped he’d changed. He might have if he were helping them. So she’d give him the benefit of the doubt. For now. Andy bobbed his head, his smile wider. “Yep. That was me. I remember you, too. I used to be jealous of you in archery class. You hit so many damn bull’s eyes.” “You remember that?” She laughed. “I haven’t drawn a bow since I was sixteen.” “You were astonishingly good. The Annie Oakley of the bow and arrow. I fell in love with the sport that year myself partly because of you. You made it look so easy. Now it’s one of my passions. I hunt with bow and arrow whenever I can; even make my own bows and arrows out of the aspen wood that’s so prevalent on my dad’s property. He has a hundred acres of wooded land about fifty miles from here. I go there to hunt.” Hadn’t she read somewhere Aspen was the wood vampires despised because used as a stake it could pierce their skin? Kill them? A peculiar thought to have. “Wow, you make your own bows and arrows? The man has hidden talents,” she said. “You might want to come with me some day to my dad’s place and I’ll let you use one of the bows. I have a spare. See if you can still hit that bull’s eye.” “Thanks. I’ll consider that kind offer. But right now I’m a little busy. Moving in. Two fatherless kids, a dilapidated farmhouse to refurbish and a job to find. I’ll get back to you,” she said with a noncommittal expression, “later.” “Anytime.” His manner, his smile seemed sincere. Perhaps he had changed. People did. All the time. She should have been self-conscious with two almost strangers staring at her. Her clothes were grimy; her face was dirt smudged and her hair was tugged into an unflattering ponytail. She wasn’t. She didn’t care. These days her appearance was the last thing on her mind. “You look almost the same,” Andy told her. “Not a day older then when I last saw you. How do you do that?” Her shoulders rose slightly then fell. She didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. Her mirror said different, lately. “Everyone ages. Maybe you need your eyes checked?” She smiled sweetly. He was helping her so she didn’t want to be too unsociable. “I’ve read your books, you know. I liked them. Immensely. The one about the vampires in the theater…wow that was something. And I loved that last ghost story. So eerie.” “You and about ten other people. But thank you.” “Where do you come up with those ideas?” “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.” “Well, wherever you get your ideas, don’t stop. I, for one, appreciate your books. Can’t wait for the next one.” She brushed the compliments off, a disquiet she couldn’t understand crowding in. She didn’t care one way or another what he thought of her. He was a friend of Joey’s, that’s all. Nothing more. The remarks about her books should have pleased her, but now her writing career felt so long ago and frivolous. Another person. Another life. If you couldn’t make a living at it what good was it? “Thank you for coming today and helping.” “You’re welcome. Here in Summer Haven we help our neighbors. It’s the small town friendly thing to do, you know?” “I know. I lived here. So things haven’t changed much?” She posed the question to Joey but her eyes were on Andy. “Not much,” Joey replied. Andy nodded agreeably. “So let’s get to work.” Between the four of them and the kids the house was empty and clean by dusk. “Whew, glad that’s done.” Joey groaned, leaning against the truck filled with the remnants of their childhood home. The faint radiance from the house’s lights spilled out into the yard. She could see everyone clearly, even in the weak light. “The guys and I are going to take this load to the dump and head back to town,” Joey said. “After we drop off the truck at the rental place we’ll meet at the diner. I promised the guys, as payment for their help, that supper’s on me.” She felt her brother glance at her in the dim light. He’d been watching her a lot during the afternoon. She knew why. She never took the sunglasses off. Direct light hurt her eyes. In the mirror that morning even she’d noticed how pale she was, how colorless her irises behind the glasses. She knew she was behaving strangely, even for her circumstances, but couldn’t help herself. Now, she could tell, he was even more anxious about her. “You and the kids are invited, too. Laurie’s cooked up pot roast for the special tonight. And, trust me, it’s delicious.” Her first reaction was to say no. The thought of food made her stomach hurt, but her children were looking expectantly at her with their hungry eyes so, instead, she muttered, “That sounds fine, Joey. We’ll meet you there. I have a few things I need to wrap up here first. A couple things to check. Just call me when you’ve unloaded this stuff, dropped off the truck and you’re on your way to the diner.” “I’ll do that.” She turned to Oscar and Andy. “Thank you both for helping us today.” She stood apart from them. The smell of their warm blood pumping below their flesh was too strong, too intoxicating. She couldn’t bear to be close. The smells, the strange feelings she was having, were too disturbing. Skin could tear so easily. Andy nodded, making a dismissive gesture with his hand. “It was nothing. Jenny, it’s been great seeing you again. I’m sure I’ll be running into you around town–and at Joey’s diner tonight. See you there.” He got in the truck’s cab, but his eyes never left her. Oscar echoed, “And it’s been nice meeting you, Jenny.” He tagged on at the last second, “Sorry for your loss. If there’s anything you or the kids need and I can help, don’t hesitate to call. I’m at the Town Market most every week day and some evenings. Come on by and I’ll give you a coupon book for the weekly specials.” A friendly smile. Joey had mentioned Oscar had a wife who worked at the nearby K-Mart, five kids of his own and knew what it was like to take care of a family. He had a generous heart. A churchgoer, his church also helped anyone who needed it. “Thank you, Oscar. I’ll remember that if we need anything.” She wouldn’t but she didn’t feel like saying anything more. The day had used her up. Emotionally, it’d been difficult. Cleaning out her parent’s house brought back so many bittersweet memories. Like the town, the house had a long history for her and in the dust she’d recalled so many forgotten things. “Uncle Joey,” Teddy spoke up. “Can I ride with you to the dump? Can I?” He was standing by the truck’s passenger door, his hand already on the handle. “Please?” “Me too!” Sarah was bouncing up and down beside her brother. Her excitement exhausting. “I want to go to the dump, too!” Joey looked to Jenny for permission. “If your mom says it’s okay, you both can come.” “Is there room for them with three of you men in the cab?” She was too tired to fight. After spending the day with a sullen, strange behaving mother, the children wanted a break. She didn’t blame them. She wanted a break. Joey was more fun. “Sure,” her brother replied. “We’ll make room. Sarah can sit on my lap.” “That’s against the law, isn’t it?” Jenny asked. “She should be in a car seat.” “I know. But just this once? It’s such a short distance away. Besides, I know all the local cops by their first name and feed every one of them most days. Worse they’d do is give me a warning.” Joey laughed. “Don’t worry, Sis. I’ll drive slow. Be careful. With all this crap in the back, I have to.” “Mom, please?” Teddy begged again and she couldn’t turn him down. There’d been so little pleasure in his life, in either of her children’s lives, lately. A short ride couldn’t hurt them. “Okay. Just don’t be too big of pests, you hear? Listen to your Uncle Joey.” “Thanks Mom,” Teddy scrambled into the truck, Sarah right behind him. Jenny was surprised. They did all fit. She waved as the truck maneuvered out of the driveway and took off down the highway into the dark. She stood there, thinking, bathed in the light from the doors and windows, then sighed and walked into the house. Turning off the lights as she made her way through the rooms she ended up in the upstairs bedroom, the one that had been hers as a child and young adult, and, in the dark, stared out the windows overlooking the back yard. The homestead hadn’t changed much. The oak tree filling the windows was now a massive tangle of branches and leaves rising to the sky. She and Joey used to climb out of this very window in the wee hours when their parents were asleep, down the tree’s trunk, and escape into the night fields to play. Later as a teenager, she’d scuttle down it to dash out and meet Jeff. The memories brought a smile to her lips. Running wild and free as a child as a fair weather moon looked on. Playing tag with Joey. Eavesdropping through windows at their neighbors. Making mischief around town. Good times. The house had been full of love in those early years. Her life, too. Her night vision, sharper than ever before, focused in on other things. There was the old shed, crumbling from age and termites, at the end of the yard. Beside it, the wobbly swing set was now a rusted skeleton against the darkening sky. Lumps of discarded metal and plastic littered the rest of the yard. Old washing machines. Discarded televisions. Rusted parts of junked cars. Her dad could never get rid of anything. Might need a part or something, he’d say. Best to keep it for a bit. Problem was the bit went on into years. The leftovers never left. It’d have to be cleared out and the trash taken away. Eventually. She didn’t want to think about it now. The night was beckoning her. Locking the house, she went outside and began the well-remembered trek across the yard into the backfield. Early fall had arrived with a wisp of cool air her skin couldn’t register. She’d loved the fall in Illinois. She’d feel the air kissing her skin as the trees swayed in the breeze, and it’d make her shiver. Florida’s autumn was a mild shadow of the Midwest’s season so there’d be no frigid cold. No snow. But if she were in Millstadt now she had the suspicion her skin wouldn’t feel the chill there, either. The moon had risen and provided light to see where she was going. Though with her keen sight and her memory she didn’t need it. She would have known the way no matter what. She vaulted over a rickety wooden fence. Amazed at the ease with which she sprang into the air and landed nimbly on her feet. The debilitating fatigue she’d been experiencing the last few weeks had subsided. She felt stronger than she ever had. Stronger than she had the right to feel. The trailer where she’d lived that long ago summer after her divorce was no longer there. For an instant her eyes saw it again. Hiding in the weeds. A long metal shape, dented and shabby. Her home for a short while as she’d tried to sort out her life. At the end of that summer, after she’d reunited with Jeff and moved out, her father had had the trailer, with her approval, taken away. She wondered sometimes where it had gone and to whom. Was someone still living in it somewhere? She didn’t know. On the wind and among the distant trees a ghostly neighing and whinnying swirled as if her two old friends were still out there somewhere; still remembered and loved her. Ah, she missed them too. Black Beauty. Lightning. She hoped they were both happy wherever they were; that the grass was green and the oats were plentiful and they ran free and strong in endless pastures. They’d been such good friends to Dad and her. Rest in peace. And damn forever the vampires that had slain them. They’re surely in hell now. Just where Jeff and she sent them the night they burnt the theater down. She wandered along the fence and enjoyed the night. Animals were skittering through the underbrush, climbing in the trees or flying above her. Their wings flapping. Their eyes blinking. She could almost hear their hearts. Beating. Beating. The blood pumping through their tiny bodies. God, she was so hungry. The hunger was entirely another entity apart from her, with a will of its own. She was so lost in it, that when the fox darted out in front of her and, seeing or sensing her, scampered into the surrounding woods, she didn’t think twice before she chased it. It was quick, but she was quicker. In less than a second she had it in her hands, rung its furry neck and brought it to her lips. She plunged her teeth, which somehow felt longer and sharper, into its flesh and drank until there wasn’t anything left to drink. Then realizing what she’d done, she screamed and collapsed to the ground, her body racked with shock. Revulsion. She touched her teeth with shaking hands. They were like daggers. Why did she do that? What was she becoming? She suspected. She feared. Yet doubt was nearly gone and nothing would ever be the same again. Her life, her future, forfeited. Her world crumbled around her like sand castles buffeted by waves. She cried, dry sobs, because there were no real tears. It was as if she’d lost the ability to weep as well as to feel…human. And in that moment she knew. She knew who had attacked her and Jeff that night under the viaduct; murdering him, and putting her into a coma she wasn’t supposed to have come out of. Vampires. “They’ve made me a monster like them. A monster.” She ranted and railed at her fate until her throat was raw. Sprinting through the woods, she ran to forget, ran to escape the inescapable truth. What about her children? Joey and Laurie? Was she a threat to them? Should she find a way to kill herself or should she just dissolve from their lives? She’d already lost Jeff. How could she leave her children? The thought of losing them was so unbearable her heart wouldn’t accept it. Running blindly, her panic-stricken mind couldn’t come up with the answers. What should she do? There was no cure for vampirism and so she was a danger to them. What should she do? Later, when she’d calmed down and dropped to her knees in the grass beneath her bedroom window, her heart answered. She could never leave Teddy and Sarah. After losing her husband, she cherished, loved them more than life itself. She couldn’t live, didn’t want to live, without them. And they needed her. If she abandoned them, it’d break what was left of their hearts. Destroy them completely. Joey, too. Then again, they might need her to protect them from the monsters who’d done this. They could be in danger. She knew better than most people vampires didn’t like to leave loose ends; would do anything to protect their secret lives, their existence. They didn’t allow witnesses to live and she had. Survived. She knew of them and they wouldn’t take the chance she’d keep quiet. So if she left her children alone they might not be safe. As she lay on the ground, her nose filling with the pungent smell of dirt, a raging instinct for survival took over and it was stronger than all her doubts and fears or her uptight morality. She didn’t want to leave those she loved. She didn’t want to be alone. There had to be a way to exist as a vampire but to do no harm to others and she had to find it. She’d killed the fox and drank its blood. And felt all right. Not great, but she could live with it. At least, the intense hunger had dissipated. Who said she had to prey on humans to live when animals would do? No one. Later she’d question if it was because of what she’d become, or because of the love she had for her family and her own life, that she made the decision she did. She’d never know. Because by the time she’d moved to the front yard and dropped onto the top step of the porch, her breathing steady but heart pounding, she had only one thought in her mind as she gazed around her childhood home. She was going to find a way to raise and love her children. Protect them from her…and from harm. Live her life without being a monster. Somehow. And if there wasn’t a way? No. Then she’d damn well find one. Because she would never, never, never leave her children. *** She wanted to call Joey and beg off for late supper at the diner but he was worried enough and she didn’t want to give him more cause. The fox’s blood had done the trick and as she peered into the bathroom mirror she had to admit she looked healthier than she had since before the attack. Her eyes shone, her skin was flushed and her mind was clear. She was cognizant of everything around her. Every little thing. After rinsing most of the blood from her sweater and blue jeans she stuffed the wet clothes, and the towel she’d gotten from the car, into a plastic bag and hid them in the closet of the room upstairs that would be hers. She’d clean them as soon as her washer and dryer arrived and hoped the blood would come out. She telephoned the movers and they promised the furniture would be at the house the following afternoon. That’d give her and the kids half the day tomorrow to finish getting the place ready. If she started early it could be done. If she worked real hard she might avoid thinking about her situation. Then she drove into town. All she knew, as she parked in front of the restaurant, was she felt better than she had in weeks. It was such a huge relief even the guilt at killing the fox and at what she now knew she was becoming couldn’t dampen it. It was a high that kept the growing revulsion away. It wasn’t normal, any of it, but she didn’t care. Self-survival had kicked in. She got out of the car and went into the diner. She didn’t look at the Dollar General; didn’t think about the theater that had once been there. Didn’t think about the irony of what Jeff and she had done all those years ago and now her own situation. There’d be time enough for that later once she and her children were situated in their new home. At the moment, she had other more important things to tend to. Inside, the bright lights didn’t hurt her eyes as much as they had earlier. Her smile came easily as her daughter ran up and burrowed into her embrace. “Mom, where were you? We tried to wait but we were hungry.” “That’s all right, honey. You should have eaten. I didn’t mean to take so long but…something came up and I had to deal with it.” She gazed down at the girl, gently brushed the hair from her eyes. Time for another haircut. Sarah’s hair grew faster than weeds. It was halfway down her back. Tomorrow morning she’d have to braid it. She needed to start being a better mom. She’d let so much go the past few weeks. “That’s good cause we’re done. You’ll have to eat alone. Sorry Mom.” “That’s okay. I ate snacks I had in the car so I’m not hungry. I’ll just have coffee.” Joey stood beside her. “Not going to eat? Again?” That look of puzzlement she’d come to know too well shadowing his face. “Sis, you’re skin and bones. Snacks won’t do it. You sure you don’t want something more substantial? Like real food? A roast beef sandwich maybe? You always liked roast beef as I recall.” “No thanks.” She tried a different tact. “I think I ate a moldy cupcake or something. My stomach’s upset. I promise I’ll eat something later. I’m an adult remember? Stop bugging me.” Joey’s expression was skeptical but he didn’t nag her further. He’d stopped telling her what to do years ago and she’d stopped listening. Growing up and moving far away could do that. Teddy came up behind her and slipped his hand into hers. “We’re over there in the corner with the others, Mom.” He led her to the booth where Andy, Oscar and Laurie were talking and laughing over what remained of their meals, Laurie having taken a break to eat with everyone. Jenny and the kids joined them as Joey waited on an older couple at the counter. He kept an eye on Jenny, though, his lips in a slight downturn. She didn’t stay long, using an early morning get-up and sleepy children as an excuse. Not even Andy’s pleading for her to stay and talk a little couldn’t tempt her. “Thanks but another time. We’re just all tired. The kids need to get to bed.” “We have another two hours before the diner closes,” Joey said before they departed. “Afterwards we’ll be home. Call me or Laurie if you or the kids need anything, ya hear?” “I hear. But we’ll be fine.” She said goodnight to everyone, packed up Sarah and Teddy and returned to the apartment. “One more night,” she told the kids, “and we’ll be sleeping in our own place again.” When they were asleep she restlessly roamed the apartment and didn’t know why. The hunger had returned. Not as strong as before but it gnawed, a tiny voracious animal in the pit of her stomach, reminding her sooner or later she’d have to hunt again. To even think she’d become what she’d once reviled, galled her. Just knowing she’d have to hunt and kill again was making her physically ill. So she put it out of her mind, or tried to. She couldn’t sleep and spent the time making lists of what she had to do the following morning at the house and brooding about her dilemma. Was there some way to reverse what was happening to her? Was there someone somewhere who could help her? Perhaps there could be salvation for her yet. All she had to do was search for and find it. Or–maybe she was wrong about everything…and it was really just a medical condition? Maybe it’s all in her head? That grief, trauma thing again? Yes, that’s what it was. When Laurie and Joey drove up she snuck quietly into her room. Let Joey think she was sleeping. She wasn’t ready to tell him what was happening and if he saw her alone he’d weasel it out of her. She lay on the air mattress and closed her eyes. When she opened them again it was daylight and the hunger was now a growing fire in her belly. She’d have to put up with it until the night came and she was in her own house with the woods around her. Then she’d tend to it. She rose, dressed, and woke her children. The scent of their blood, so sweet and warm, filling their bodies made her hungrier. Their skin seemed to glow. She looked at them and for the briefest of moments they were no longer her beloved children, her flesh and blood, and her future but…breakfast. It would have been so easy to lay her lips against their baby soft necks and–Stop! What the hell was she thinking? Horrified, she moved away and began furiously packing up their clothes. Would there come a time when she wouldn’t be able to resist the call of their blood? Would she turn into a monster like the ones she’d once fought? God please no. “Come on,” she gently urged. “Let’s get you both something to eat and get out to the house. It’s going to be a busy day.” “Moving day, huh, Mommy?” Sarah’s eyes sparkled, she was so excited. Like her mother she wasn’t happy unless she had a place to nest, a roof over her head and her own bed in her own room. All the things she loved, her clothes, her stuffed animals, her collection of horse statues, her tiny bracelets and necklaces, her feather-soft bed with the Twilight themed comforter on it, were on a truck moving closer to the house that by nightfall would be their new home. “Yep, moving day.” “I’m glad. I miss my stuff.” The child smiled as she slipped into a clean yellow shirt and a pair of worn blue jeans. “My horses. I know they’re not real horses. They’re just little bitty plastic and wooden ones but I still love them and I’ve missed them. I can’t wait until they’re home with me, too.” “I know.” For a while, at around Sarah’s age, or until her parents no longer could afford to keep them, Jenny had had real horses, two of them, and had loved them dearly. The true joy of her childhood. She wanted the same for her daughter, but she had to have an income first. Horses cost money to keep, care for and feed. A lot of money. “Now that we live in the country we might try to get you a real horse someday. Not an expensive thoroughbred or anything like that but a sturdy quarter horse we can all ride.” “Could we really?” Sarah’s hand, so small and trusting, grabbed hers and her smile was like the sun. A sun Jenny hadn’t seen much of lately. “Yes, really. Probably. One day.” “I don’t care much for horses, Mom, you know that,” Teddy chimed in sullenly. “But I would sure like a new bike. My old one’s too small. I’m bigger now. Living out of town like we’ll be doing I’ll need one.” He seemed to mull over something and quickly added, “A used one would be okay. I know we’re short on cash and all.” Her frown came and went quickly. She’d never wanted her kids to endure the poverty she had when she’d been growing up. The truth was it wasn’t going to be easy doing it alone. Jobs, these days, were hard to find and even harder to keep. And she had no idea what she could do for a living. Writing novels was out of the question. It wasn’t dependable. “I think we can swing that. Soon as we’re settled in the farmhouse I’ll look for one for you.” “That would be great.” Teddy smiled, too. Another sun. “Now let’s get our butts moving and get out of here. Day’s a wasting.” She followed them into the kitchen and as her stomach protested she made them breakfast. Bowls of cereal with bananas. They were in a hurry. When she walked past the windows and the sunlight hit her skin, it burned. Left red patches. Oh, oh. When she went outside she’d have to wear long sleeves. Blue jeans. No shorts. Sunglasses again and a hat. Thank goodness it was fall. No one would question her choice of clothes. Joey and Laurie had gotten up earlier and were at the diner making breakfast for their customers. Good thing. She couldn’t face Joey. Not yet. Not until she had more time to work out what she was going to say and how she was going to say it. He’d see right through her evasions. He always did. And she’d have to confess everything. Since she had no idea, not a glimmer, of what she was going to do about her problem, she had no idea what she was going to say. Not yet, anyway.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 The Next Day A cool breeze danced around them and balanced out the warm sun. That morning the weather person had forecast rain and storms coming, but for now the sun ruled firm and steady. Indian summer in Summer Haven. The long twisting driveway was full of potholes and a little gravel. In the winter the holes would fill with water, mud, and tires would have a hard time getting through or around them. There’d be endless puddles to soak her shoes if she didn’t put her feet in just the right spots. Many a day coming home from school she’d slogged that driveway to the front door skip hopping all the way. The memories jumped in the car with her and made her smile. When she’d been young she’d loved coming home to fresh baked cookies and a cold glass of milk in the kitchen. When she was older, after things began to fall apart between her mother and father, not so much. The farmhouse was a decrepit, filthy mess. The wood siding had buckled and the paint was sun faded. The windows were swatches of grime and marbled cracks. It’d been empty for a long time, and before that her parents hadn’t taken good care of it anyway. But it was the house she’d grown up in. It was home once and it would be home again. But only with a whole lot of work. She exhaled loudly and plopped down on the porch steps. “Mom,” Sarah whined as she twirled around one of the posts that barely held up the front porch. “Do we really have to live here? It’s old. Dirty, too. Look, that window’s broke. There’s a hole in it. When the rain comes it’ll let all the water in. I don’t want to be a human fish.” She caught and gave her daughter a spontaneous hug, though the girl’s warmth made her ill at ease. She couldn’t start treating her children differently because she was feeling unwell. They’d been through enough the way it was. “You won’t be. It’ll be fixed long before the rainy times come, honey. It’s just September.” The top porch step was hard and Jenny shifted her weight around until she got comfortable; she pulled the girl into her lap. She was relieved Sarah had stopped asking questions about why they’d had to sell and leave their old house. Every day for weeks that’d been all she’d spoken of. Why did they have to move? Couldn’t they stay there? Her friends were there. Her school. She liked it there. It’d been difficult to convince her they were only doing what they had to do. “Sweetie, the house will look so much better when we get through with it.” Jenny was too conscious of her daughter’s sweat, the channeling of blood beneath the girl’s thin skin. She moved her face away. “After we clear it out and clean it up. You’ll see how a fresh coat of paint inside and out, our comfy furniture and pretty things inside, will make the difference.” “There’s furniture in there already. Old dusty stuff.” Sarah sulked. “I peeked in the window and saw it.” “I know.” Jenny stood up and held out her hand to the girl. She felt the need to get out of the sun. It was time to enter their new home and see how bad it was inside. “Don’t worry about it. Your Uncle Joey and some friends of his are coming out this afternoon to cart most of it away. So let’s go inside, see what has to go and what stays.” She turned her head and shouted, “Teddy, get back here. We’re going in.” Her son galloped around the yard, an untamed colt, exploring the grounds. She’d always liked where the house sat, merely four miles from town but still in the middle of rolling hills and fields. Secluded. Tranquil. Huge leafy oaks stood sentry around it and provided it with shade and cooler air in the summer. The house wasn’t much to look at, but the location was peaceful…if you enjoyed the country. She did. Always had. The symphony of frogs and crickets in the nearby trees calmed her and evoked the sweeter reminiscences of her childhood: the way she’d lay on her second floor bed and listen to the night creatures and the murmuring wind; stare through the windows at the ever changing heavens, the stars and clouds as they raced above her; plan and daydream about the future. They were some of the best times. “I’m here, Mom.” Teddy stomped up the porch steps with his clumsy big feet. Someday he was going to be as tall as or taller than his father. “Let’s see what the inside looks like. I get dibs on one of the upstairs bedrooms. The one in the back by the humongous tree.” “No fair.” Sarah’s voice was petulant. “I wanted that room!” “Hold on you two,” she informed them. “All the bedrooms are upstairs and there are three. We’ll all get one.” Well, one of the rooms was as small as a large closet. That had been Joey’s when they’d been kids. Sarah wouldn’t like it but it was going to be hers. She braced herself for the resistance she’d have to face but knew enticing the girl with fresh paint and new Twilight posters would help ease the disappointment. Sarah was easy to bribe. Whereas Teddy liked money. He’d begun to notice girls and that they noticed him…if he had the coolest clothes and had cash in his pockets. Ah, those were the innocently simple days. When all one cared about was how one appeared to others and what others thought of them. The key Joey had given her that morning stuck in the lock and it took a few tries to pry the door open. He’d said he’d been out there recently, but as she shoved in the door and went inside she couldn’t imagine when that would have been. A year ago? There was an inch of dust and mice leavings sprinkled over everything. Spider webs. The furniture, vintage nineteen sixties or earlier, looked it. After her parent’s death, the house had been abandoned. Nothing had been moved or taken out. Joey wasn’t the sort to ask for extra work if he could avoid it. So now it’d be left to her and the kids to do the bulk of it. Where to start? She meandered through the rooms taking stock. There wasn’t much trash. She had to give her brother some credit, he’d kept it fairly uncluttered; though there were old dishes, canned food in the cabinets and utensils in the drawers that would have to be disposed of. Most of the sparse furniture was junk. It hadn’t been that great when new and now most of it was rotting wood, loose nails and split seams. She opened the old fridge. It was empty but seemed to be working. Joey had had the electric and water reconnected the week before. The stove, too, looked worthy to stay. Good, that’d give her time to buy better appliances because they’d had to leave theirs in their last house. The real estate agent said it’d help its sale. In the living room she yanked open the curtains. The light blinded her, made her skin feel crawly, and she retreated into the shadows. With her children’s eyes on her, she recovered quickly. “All this stuff is going to the dump, except the fridge and the oven. The rest of it’s not worth keeping. We need the space anyway if our furniture’s going to fit.” “I can help you move the heavy things outside,” Teddy offered. “I’m strong.” He wrote TRASH on the television set’s dirty screen with his finger. She remembered the television. It was really old. “That not a bad idea, son. Joey won’t be here for hours but we can get started on things and clear this mess out so we can sweep and mop.” They had the cleaning supplies in the trunk of the car. They’d come prepared. She sent Sarah out for the brooms and mops as she and Teddy moved furniture onto the front porch or into the yard. The heaviest pieces would have to wait for Joey’s arrival; what they could move they did. There was more than enough to keep them busy. They emptied drawers, closets and cubbyholes. The trash bags filled up quickly. Jenny forced herself to work hard, not to think about the way she was feeling. She was no longer tired or weak, but she felt even stranger than the night before. As if she was in a trance. Every noise was too loud. Smells were too strong. Her mind kept going off track, distracting her with disturbing thoughts that didn’t seem to be hers. She didn’t dare close her eyes, not even for a second, or the images came. Running wildly through wet night woods. Chasing something. Something chasing her. Drinking something that filled her belly and made her feel so…good. Flying from one place to another as if she had wings, but she didn’t. So confusing. She couldn’t fly. Not for the first time she feared something was horribly wrong with her; something much more virulent, life altering, than a normal physical ailment. Maybe a brain tumor from the concussion. Or an aftermath of the coma. She should call the doctor she’d had in the hospital, but a badgering voice in her head warned her not to. What could she say? She was feeling odd…couldn’t sleep…couldn’t keep real food down…and that all her senses had gone into overdrive? She was dreaming of, craving…human blood? Smelling it everywhere? Her doctor would either say it was the backlash of her heartache and trauma, give herself a little more time, or he’d insist she check herself into a hospital for immediate observation and more tests. Yikes, more tests? Oh no. She couldn’t do that. Not now. Besides she had too much too do. Her children needed her. She needed them. She had to find a job and bring in some money. Most of all, she was frightened. Because in the deep recesses of her mind there was a possible explanation to the way she was feeling and she couldn’t face it. Couldn’t bear to even think about it. No, no, no. That morning she’d forced herself to eat a bowl of Raisin Bran with bananas, her usual breakfast, but minutes later she’d rushed to the bathroom and threw it up. The face in the mirror glared at her with fevered eyes and skin paler than she’d ever seen it. Why hadn’t she been able to keep the food down when she was so very hungry? She didn’t know. Scared as she was, she didn’t dare say anything to anyone. That tiny insistent inner voice again. Shut up. Ignore it. It’ll go away. You’ll feel better tomorrow. Ha. By the time Joey and his friends drove up in the rented truck in the late afternoon, she and the kids had half the house cleaned out. Somehow it seemed smaller than she remembered. An old-fashioned kitchen, an ample living room and modest bath on the first floor and three bedrooms, one tiny, on the second. It’d be just right for the three of them. She smiled when she discovered her mom’s hidey nooks throughout the house, stashed with rosaries, crucifixes and different size bottles of holy water. A religious woman, until the booze took over, her mother, at all times eccentric, had felt the need to hide these important items. Besides the religious stuff, Jenny found seven dollars in folded cash. Some sharp silvery-looking arrow shaped things she couldn’t identify but reminded her of the metal points some archers used on their arrow shafts. When she was younger she’d taken a year of archery and had been exceptionally good at it. Her teacher had wanted her to try out for the statewide Olympic archery team. Which, at the time, she hadn’t but years afterwards wished she would have. Jenny packed her mother’s strange items in a cardboard box, tied it with a shoestring, and placed it on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, not having the heart to throw them away. “Wow, you’ve been busy, haven’t you? Good job,” Joey praised her as he came in the front door trailed by a short guy with glasses and longish hair, and a blond-headed taller man who looked somehow familiar. “Keeping busy helps.” Joey nodded understandingly. “You want to keep anything?” “Nah. Everything goes, except the refrigerator, the stove, a few odds and ends, and some mementoes I’ve set aside.” She grinned at the two men behind Joey. “Works out great because there’s hardly enough room for the furniture that’s coming. I’d forgotten how small this place was.” “Easier to clean though, hey?” Joey looked around at what she’d done so far. “It will be that.” “It’s nice you and the kids got so much done already. Less work for us.” “You would think of it that way.” Joey tapped the shoulder of the guy with the glasses. “This is a friend of mine, Oscar Schmidt. He’s a manager at the Town Market. “And you remember Andy Sullivan, don’t you? He went to high school with us.” “Oh, I remember you,” she tilted her head at the man as he smiled and put out a hand to shake. It was the briefest shake in history. She barely touched his hand. “Graduated a year or two behind me, right? You used to come over and you and Joey flew those motorized airplanes out in the back field?” Andy’s airplanes. They were too expensive for Joey to have had one. Their father hadn’t believed in buying expensive toys when the fields and trees were around to play in free. Oh, she remembered Andy all right. The boy who’d lived in a sprawling fancy house and whose parents had money. The boy who’d had the brand name clothes and a pocketful of cash for ice cream in his pockets. She’d never understood what Joey saw in him. Andy had been spoiled, selfish, and never missed a chance to rub his wealth in their noses. She hoped he’d changed. He might have if he were helping them. So she’d give him the benefit of the doubt. For now. Andy bobbed his head, his smile wider. “Yep. That was me. I remember you, too. I used to be jealous of you in archery class. You hit so many damn bull’s eyes.” “You remember that?” She laughed. “I haven’t drawn a bow since I was sixteen.” “You were astonishingly good. The Annie Oakley of the bow and arrow. I fell in love with the sport that year myself partly because of you. You made it look so easy. Now it’s one of my passions. I hunt with bow and arrow whenever I can; even make my own bows and arrows out of the aspen wood that’s so prevalent on my dad’s property. He has a hundred acres of wooded land about fifty miles from here. I go there to hunt.” Hadn’t she read somewhere Aspen was the wood vampires despised because used as a stake it could pierce their skin? Kill them? A peculiar thought to have. “Wow, you make your own bows and arrows? The man has hidden talents,” she said. “You might want to come with me some day to my dad’s place and I’ll let you use one of the bows. I have a spare. See if you can still hit that bull’s eye.” “Thanks. I’ll consider that kind offer. But right now I’m a little busy. Moving in. Two fatherless kids, a dilapidated farmhouse to refurbish and a job to find. I’ll get back to you,” she said with a noncommittal expression, “later.” “Anytime.” His manner, his smile seemed sincere. Perhaps he had changed. People did. All the time. She should have been self-conscious with two almost strangers staring at her. Her clothes were grimy; her face was dirt smudged and her hair was tugged into an unflattering ponytail. She wasn’t. She didn’t care. These days her appearance was the last thing on her mind. “You look almost the same,” Andy told her. “Not a day older then when I last saw you. How do you do that?” Her shoulders rose slightly then fell. She didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. Her mirror said different, lately. “Everyone ages. Maybe you need your eyes checked?” She smiled sweetly. He was helping her so she didn’t want to be too unsociable. “I’ve read your books, you know. I liked them. Immensely. The one about the vampires in the theater…wow that was something. And I loved that last ghost story. So eerie.” “You and about ten other people. But thank you.” “Where do you come up with those ideas?” “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.” “Well, wherever you get your ideas, don’t stop. I, for one, appreciate your books. Can’t wait for the next one.” She brushed the compliments off, a disquiet she couldn’t understand crowding in. She didn’t care one way or another what he thought of her. He was a friend of Joey’s, that’s all. Nothing more. The remarks about her books should have pleased her, but now her writing career felt so long ago and frivolous. Another person. Another life. If you couldn’t make a living at it what good was it? “Thank you for coming today and helping.” “You’re welcome. Here in Summer Haven we help our neighbors. It’s the small town friendly thing to do, you know?” “I know. I lived here. So things haven’t changed much?” She posed the question to Joey but her eyes were on Andy. “Not much,” Joey replied. Andy nodded agreeably. “So let’s get to work.” Between the four of them and the kids the house was empty and clean by dusk. “Whew, glad that’s done.” Joey groaned, leaning against the truck filled with the remnants of their childhood home. The faint radiance from the house’s lights spilled out into the yard. She could see everyone clearly, even in the weak light. “The guys and I are going to take this load to the dump and head back to town,” Joey said. “After we drop off the truck at the rental place we’ll meet at the diner. I promised the guys, as payment for their help, that supper’s on me.” She felt her brother glance at her in the dim light. He’d been watching her a lot during the afternoon. She knew why. She never took the sunglasses off. Direct light hurt her eyes. In the mirror that morning even she’d noticed how pale she was, how colorless her irises behind the glasses. She knew she was behaving strangely, even for her circumstances, but couldn’t help herself. Now, she could tell, he was even more anxious about her. “You and the kids are invited, too. Laurie’s cooked up pot roast for the special tonight. And, trust me, it’s delicious.” Her first reaction was to say no. The thought of food made her stomach hurt, but her children were looking expectantly at her with their hungry eyes so, instead, she muttered, “That sounds fine, Joey. We’ll meet you there. I have a few things I need to wrap up here first. A couple things to check. Just call me when you’ve unloaded this stuff, dropped off the truck and you’re on your way to the diner.” “I’ll do that.” She turned to Oscar and Andy. “Thank you both for helping us today.” She stood apart from them. The smell of their warm blood pumping below their flesh was too strong, too intoxicating. She couldn’t bear to be close. The smells, the strange feelings she was having, were too disturbing. Skin could tear so easily. Andy nodded, making a dismissive gesture with his hand. “It was nothing. Jenny, it’s been great seeing you again. I’m sure I’ll be running into you around town–and at Joey’s diner tonight. See you there.” He got in the truck’s cab, but his eyes never left her. Oscar echoed, “And it’s been nice meeting you, Jenny.” He tagged on at the last second, “Sorry for your loss. If there’s anything you or the kids need and I can help, don’t hesitate to call. I’m at the Town Market most every week day and some evenings. Come on by and I’ll give you a coupon book for the weekly specials.” A friendly smile. Joey had mentioned Oscar had a wife who worked at the nearby K-Mart, five kids of his own and knew what it was like to take care of a family. He had a generous heart. A churchgoer, his church also helped anyone who needed it. “Thank you, Oscar. I’ll remember that if we need anything.” She wouldn’t but she didn’t feel like saying anything more. The day had used her up. Emotionally, it’d been difficult. Cleaning out her parent’s house brought back so many bittersweet memories. Like the town, the house had a long history for her and in the dust she’d recalled so many forgotten things. “Uncle Joey,” Teddy spoke up. “Can I ride with you to the dump? Can I?” He was standing by the truck’s passenger door, his hand already on the handle. “Please?” “Me too!” Sarah was bouncing up and down beside her brother. Her excitement exhausting. “I want to go to the dump, too!” Joey looked to Jenny for permission. “If your mom says it’s okay, you both can come.” “Is there room for them with three of you men in the cab?” She was too tired to fight. After spending the day with a sullen, strange behaving mother, the children wanted a break. She didn’t blame them. She wanted a break. Joey was more fun. “Sure,” her brother replied. “We’ll make room. Sarah can sit on my lap.” “That’s against the law, isn’t it?” Jenny asked. “She should be in a car seat.” “I know. But just this once? It’s such a short distance away. Besides, I know all the local cops by their first name and feed every one of them most days. Worse they’d do is give me a warning.” Joey laughed. “Don’t worry, Sis. I’ll drive slow. Be careful. With all this crap in the back, I have to.” “Mom, please?” Teddy begged again and she couldn’t turn him down. There’d been so little pleasure in his life, in either of her children’s lives, lately. A short ride couldn’t hurt them. “Okay. Just don’t be too big of pests, you hear? Listen to your Uncle Joey.” “Thanks Mom,” Teddy scrambled into the truck, Sarah right behind him. Jenny was surprised. They did all fit. She waved as the truck maneuvered out of the driveway and took off down the highway into the dark. She stood there, thinking, bathed in the light from the doors and windows, then sighed and walked into the house. Turning off the lights as she made her way through the rooms she ended up in the upstairs bedroom, the one that had been hers as a child and young adult, and, in the dark, stared out the windows overlooking the back yard. The homestead hadn’t changed much. The oak tree filling the windows was now a massive tangle of branches and leaves rising to the sky. She and Joey used to climb out of this very window in the wee hours when their parents were asleep, down the tree’s trunk, and escape into the night fields to play. Later as a teenager, she’d scuttle down it to dash out and meet Jeff. The memories brought a smile to her lips. Running wild and free as a child as a fair weather moon looked on. Playing tag with Joey. Eavesdropping through windows at their neighbors. Making mischief around town. Good times. The house had been full of love in those early years. Her life, too. Her night vision, sharper than ever before, focused in on other things. There was the old shed, crumbling from age and termites, at the end of the yard. Beside it, the wobbly swing set was now a rusted skeleton against the darkening sky. Lumps of discarded metal and plastic littered the rest of the yard. Old washing machines. Discarded televisions. Rusted parts of junked cars. Her dad could never get rid of anything. Might need a part or something, he’d say. Best to keep it for a bit. Problem was the bit went on into years. The leftovers never left. It’d have to be cleared out and the trash taken away. Eventually. She didn’t want to think about it now. The night was beckoning her. Locking the house, she went outside and began the well-remembered trek across the yard into the backfield. Early fall had arrived with a wisp of cool air her skin couldn’t register. She’d loved the fall in Illinois. She’d feel the air kissing her skin as the trees swayed in the breeze, and it’d make her shiver. Florida’s autumn was a mild shadow of the Midwest’s season so there’d be no frigid cold. No snow. But if she were in Millstadt now she had the suspicion her skin wouldn’t feel the chill there, either. The moon had risen and provided light to see where she was going. Though with her keen sight and her memory she didn’t need it. She would have known the way no matter what. She vaulted over a rickety wooden fence. Amazed at the ease with which she sprang into the air and landed nimbly on her feet. The debilitating fatigue she’d been experiencing the last few weeks had subsided. She felt stronger than she ever had. Stronger than she had the right to feel. The trailer where she’d lived that long ago summer after her divorce was no longer there. For an instant her eyes saw it again. Hiding in the weeds. A long metal shape, dented and shabby. Her home for a short while as she’d tried to sort out her life. At the end of that summer, after she’d reunited with Jeff and moved out, her father had had the trailer, with her approval, taken away. She wondered sometimes where it had gone and to whom. Was someone still living in it somewhere? She didn’t know. On the wind and among the distant trees a ghostly neighing and whinnying swirled as if her two old friends were still out there somewhere; still remembered and loved her. Ah, she missed them too. Black Beauty. Lightning. She hoped they were both happy wherever they were; that the grass was green and the oats were plentiful and they ran free and strong in endless pastures. They’d been such good friends to Dad and her. Rest in peace. And damn forever the vampires that had slain them. They’re surely in hell now. Just where Jeff and she sent them the night they burnt the theater down. She wandered along the fence and enjoyed the night. Animals were skittering through the underbrush, climbing in the trees or flying above her. Their wings flapping. Their eyes blinking. She could almost hear their hearts. Beating. Beating. The blood pumping through their tiny bodies. God, she was so hungry. The hunger was entirely another entity apart from her, with a will of its own. She was so lost in it, that when the fox darted out in front of her and, seeing or sensing her, scampered into the surrounding woods, she didn’t think twice before she chased it. It was quick, but she was quicker. In less than a second she had it in her hands, rung its furry neck and brought it to her lips. She plunged her teeth, which somehow felt longer and sharper, into its flesh and drank until there wasn’t anything left to drink. Then realizing what she’d done, she screamed and collapsed to the ground, her body racked with shock. Revulsion. She touched her teeth with shaking hands. They were like daggers. Why did she do that? What was she becoming? She suspected. She feared. Yet doubt was nearly gone and nothing would ever be the same again. Her life, her future, forfeited. Her world crumbled around her like sand castles buffeted by waves. She cried, dry sobs, because there were no real tears. It was as if she’d lost the ability to weep as well as to feel…human. And in that moment she knew. She knew who had attacked her and Jeff that night under the viaduct; murdering him, and putting her into a coma she wasn’t supposed to have come out of. Vampires. “They’ve made me a monster like them. A monster.” She ranted and railed at her fate until her throat was raw. Sprinting through the woods, she ran to forget, ran to escape the inescapable truth. What about her children? Joey and Laurie? Was she a threat to them? Should she find a way to kill herself or should she just dissolve from their lives? She’d already lost Jeff. How could she leave her children? The thought of losing them was so unbearable her heart wouldn’t accept it. Running blindly, her panic-stricken mind couldn’t come up with the answers. What should she do? There was no cure for vampirism and so she was a danger to them. What should she do? Later, when she’d calmed down and dropped to her knees in the grass beneath her bedroom window, her heart answered. She could never leave Teddy and Sarah. After losing her husband, she cherished, loved them more than life itself. She couldn’t live, didn’t want to live, without them. And they needed her. If she abandoned them, it’d break what was left of their hearts. Destroy them completely. Joey, too. Then again, they might need her to protect them from the monsters who’d done this. They could be in danger. She knew better than most people vampires didn’t like to leave loose ends; would do anything to protect their secret lives, their existence. They didn’t allow witnesses to live and she had. Survived. She knew of them and they wouldn’t take the chance she’d keep quiet. So if she left her children alone they might not be safe. As she lay on the ground, her nose filling with the pungent smell of dirt, a raging instinct for survival took over and it was stronger than all her doubts and fears or her uptight morality. She didn’t want to leave those she loved. She didn’t want to be alone. There had to be a way to exist as a vampire but to do no harm to others and she had to find it. She’d killed the fox and drank its blood. And felt all right. Not great, but she could live with it. At least, the intense hunger had dissipated. Who said she had to prey on humans to live when animals would do? No one. Later she’d question if it was because of what she’d become, or because of the love she had for her family and her own life, that she made the decision she did. She’d never know. Because by the time she’d moved to the front yard and dropped onto the top step of the porch, her breathing steady but heart pounding, she had only one thought in her mind as she gazed around her childhood home. She was going to find a way to raise and love her children. Protect them from her…and from harm. Live her life without being a monster. Somehow. And if there wasn’t a way? No. Then she’d damn well find one. Because she would never, never, never leave her children. *** She wanted to call Joey and beg off for late supper at the diner but he was worried enough and she didn’t want to give him more cause. The fox’s blood had done the trick and as she peered into the bathroom mirror she had to admit she looked healthier than she had since before the attack. Her eyes shone, her skin was flushed and her mind was clear. She was cognizant of everything around her. Every little thing. After rinsing most of the blood from her sweater and blue jeans she stuffed the wet clothes, and the towel she’d gotten from the car, into a plastic bag and hid them in the closet of the room upstairs that would be hers. She’d clean them as soon as her washer and dryer arrived and hoped the blood would come out. She telephoned the movers and they promised the furniture would be at the house the following afternoon. That’d give her and the kids half the day tomorrow to finish getting the place ready. If she started early it could be done. If she worked real hard she might avoid thinking about her situation. Then she drove into town. All she knew, as she parked in front of the restaurant, was she felt better than she had in weeks. It was such a huge relief even the guilt at killing the fox and at what she now knew she was becoming couldn’t dampen it. It was a high that kept the growing revulsion away. It wasn’t normal, any of it, but she didn’t care. Self-survival had kicked in. She got out of the car and went into the diner. She didn’t look at the Dollar General; didn’t think about the theater that had once been there. Didn’t think about the irony of what Jeff and she had done all those years ago and now her own situation. There’d be time enough for that later once she and her children were situated in their new home. At the moment, she had other more important things to tend to. Inside, the bright lights didn’t hurt her eyes as much as they had earlier. Her smile came easily as her daughter ran up and burrowed into her embrace. “Mom, where were you? We tried to wait but we were hungry.” “That’s all right, honey. You should have eaten. I didn’t mean to take so long but…something came up and I had to deal with it.” She gazed down at the girl, gently brushed the hair from her eyes. Time for another haircut. Sarah’s hair grew faster than weeds. It was halfway down her back. Tomorrow morning she’d have to braid it. She needed to start being a better mom. She’d let so much go the past few weeks. “That’s good cause we’re done. You’ll have to eat alone. Sorry Mom.” “That’s okay. I ate snacks I had in the car so I’m not hungry. I’ll just have coffee.” Joey stood beside her. “Not going to eat? Again?” That look of puzzlement she’d come to know too well shadowing his face. “Sis, you’re skin and bones. Snacks won’t do it. You sure you don’t want something more substantial? Like real food? A roast beef sandwich maybe? You always liked roast beef as I recall.” “No thanks.” She tried a different tact. “I think I ate a moldy cupcake or something. My stomach’s upset. I promise I’ll eat something later. I’m an adult remember? Stop bugging me.” Joey’s expression was skeptical but he didn’t nag her further. He’d stopped telling her what to do years ago and she’d stopped listening. Growing up and moving far away could do that. Teddy came up behind her and slipped his hand into hers. “We’re over there in the corner with the others, Mom.” He led her to the booth where Andy, Oscar and Laurie were talking and laughing over what remained of their meals, Laurie having taken a break to eat with everyone. Jenny and the kids joined them as Joey waited on an older couple at the counter. He kept an eye on Jenny, though, his lips in a slight downturn. She didn’t stay long, using an early morning get-up and sleepy children as an excuse. Not even Andy’s pleading for her to stay and talk a little couldn’t tempt her. “Thanks but another time. We’re just all tired. The kids need to get to bed.” “We have another two hours before the diner closes,” Joey said before they departed. “Afterwards we’ll be home. Call me or Laurie if you or the kids need anything, ya hear?” “I hear. But we’ll be fine.” She said goodnight to everyone, packed up Sarah and Teddy and returned to the apartment. “One more night,” she told the kids, “and we’ll be sleeping in our own place again.” When they were asleep she restlessly roamed the apartment and didn’t know why. The hunger had returned. Not as strong as before but it gnawed, a tiny voracious animal in the pit of her stomach, reminding her sooner or later she’d have to hunt again. To even think she’d become what she’d once reviled, galled her. Just knowing she’d have to hunt and kill again was making her physically ill. So she put it out of her mind, or tried to. She couldn’t sleep and spent the time making lists of what she had to do the following morning at the house and brooding about her dilemma. Was there some way to reverse what was happening to her? Was there someone somewhere who could help her? Perhaps there could be salvation for her yet. All she had to do was search for and find it. Or–maybe she was wrong about everything…and it was really just a medical condition? Maybe it’s all in her head? That grief, trauma thing again? Yes, that’s what it was. When Laurie and Joey drove up she snuck quietly into her room. Let Joey think she was sleeping. She wasn’t ready to tell him what was happening and if he saw her alone he’d weasel it out of her. She lay on the air mattress and closed her eyes. When she opened them again it was daylight and the hunger was now a growing fire in her belly. She’d have to put up with it until the night came and she was in her own house with the woods around her. Then she’d tend to it. She rose, dressed, and woke her children. The scent of their blood, so sweet and warm, filling their bodies made her hungrier. Their skin seemed to glow. She looked at them and for the briefest of moments they were no longer her beloved children, her flesh and blood, and her future but…breakfast. It would have been so easy to lay her lips against their baby soft necks and–Stop! What the hell was she thinking? Horrified, she moved away and began furiously packing up their clothes. Would there come a time when she wouldn’t be able to resist the call of their blood? Would she turn into a monster like the ones she’d once fought? God please no. “Come on,” she gently urged. “Let’s get you both something to eat and get out to the house. It’s going to be a busy day.” “Moving day, huh, Mommy?” Sarah’s eyes sparkled, she was so excited. Like her mother she wasn’t happy unless she had a place to nest, a roof over her head and her own bed in her own room. All the things she loved, her clothes, her stuffed animals, her collection of horse statues, her tiny bracelets and necklaces, her feather-soft bed with the Twilight themed comforter on it, were on a truck moving closer to the house that by nightfall would be their new home. “Yep, moving day.” “I’m glad. I miss my stuff.” The child smiled as she slipped into a clean yellow shirt and a pair of worn blue jeans. “My horses. I know they’re not real horses. They’re just little bitty plastic and wooden ones but I still love them and I’ve missed them. I can’t wait until they’re home with me, too.” “I know.” For a while, at around Sarah’s age, or until her parents no longer could afford to keep them, Jenny had had real horses, two of them, and had loved them dearly. The true joy of her childhood. She wanted the same for her daughter, but she had to have an income first. Horses cost money to keep, care for and feed. A lot of money. “Now that we live in the country we might try to get you a real horse someday. Not an expensive thoroughbred or anything like that but a sturdy quarter horse we can all ride.” “Could we really?” Sarah’s hand, so small and trusting, grabbed hers and her smile was like the sun. A sun Jenny hadn’t seen much of lately. “Yes, really. Probably. One day.” “I don’t care much for horses, Mom, you know that,” Teddy chimed in sullenly. “But I would sure like a new bike. My old one’s too small. I’m bigger now. Living out of town like we’ll be doing I’ll need one.” He seemed to mull over something and quickly added, “A used one would be okay. I know we’re short on cash and all.” Her frown came and went quickly. She’d never wanted her kids to endure the poverty she had when she’d been growing up. The truth was it wasn’t going to be easy doing it alone. Jobs, these days, were hard to find and even harder to keep. And she had no idea what she could do for a living. Writing novels was out of the question. It wasn’t dependable. “I think we can swing that. Soon as we’re settled in the farmhouse I’ll look for one for you.” “That would be great.” Teddy smiled, too. Another sun. “Now let’s get our butts moving and get out of here. Day’s a wasting.” She followed them into the kitchen and as her stomach protested she made them breakfast. Bowls of cereal with bananas. They were in a hurry. When she walked past the windows and the sunlight hit her skin, it burned. Left red patches. Oh, oh. When she went outside she’d have to wear long sleeves. Blue jeans. No shorts. Sunglasses again and a hat. Thank goodness it was fall. No one would question her choice of clothes. Joey and Laurie had gotten up earlier and were at the diner making breakfast for their customers. Good thing. She couldn’t face Joey. Not yet. Not until she had more time to work out what she was going to say and how she was going to say it. He’d see right through her evasions. He always did. And she’d have to confess everything. Since she had no idea, not a glimmer, of what she was going to do about her problem, she had no idea what she was going to say. Not yet, anyway.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 The Next Day A cool breeze danced around them and balanced out the warm sun. That morning the weather person had forecast rain and storms coming, but for now the sun ruled firm and steady. Indian summer in Summer Haven. The long twisting driveway was full of potholes and a little gravel. In the winter the holes would fill with water, mud, and tires would have a hard time getting through or around them. There’d be endless puddles to soak her shoes if she didn’t put her feet in just the right spots. Many a day coming home from school she’d slogged that driveway to the front door skip hopping all the way. The memories jumped in the car with her and made her smile. When she’d been young she’d loved coming home to fresh baked cookies and a cold glass of milk in the kitchen. When she was older, after things began to fall apart between her mother and father, not so much. The farmhouse was a decrepit, filthy mess. The wood siding had buckled and the paint was sun faded. The windows were swatches of grime and marbled cracks. It’d been empty for a long time, and before that her parents hadn’t taken good care of it anyway. But it was the house she’d grown up in. It was home once and it would be home again. But only with a whole lot of work. She exhaled loudly and plopped down on the porch steps. “Mom,” Sarah whined as she twirled around one of the posts that barely held up the front porch. “Do we really have to live here? It’s old. Dirty, too. Look, that window’s broke. There’s a hole in it. When the rain comes it’ll let all the water in. I don’t want to be a human fish.” She caught and gave her daughter a spontaneous hug, though the girl’s warmth made her ill at ease. She couldn’t start treating her children differently because she was feeling unwell. They’d been through enough the way it was. “You won’t be. It’ll be fixed long before the rainy times come, honey. It’s just September.” The top porch step was hard and Jenny shifted her weight around until she got comfortable; she pulled the girl into her lap. She was relieved Sarah had stopped asking questions about why they’d had to sell and leave their old house. Every day for weeks that’d been all she’d spoken of. Why did they have to move? Couldn’t they stay there? Her friends were there. Her school. She liked it there. It’d been difficult to convince her they were only doing what they had to do. “Sweetie, the house will look so much better when we get through with it.” Jenny was too conscious of her daughter’s sweat, the channeling of blood beneath the girl’s thin skin. She moved her face away. “After we clear it out and clean it up. You’ll see how a fresh coat of paint inside and out, our comfy furniture and pretty things inside, will make the difference.” “There’s furniture in there already. Old dusty stuff.” Sarah sulked. “I peeked in the window and saw it.” “I know.” Jenny stood up and held out her hand to the girl. She felt the need to get out of the sun. It was time to enter their new home and see how bad it was inside. “Don’t worry about it. Your Uncle Joey and some friends of his are coming out this afternoon to cart most of it away. So let’s go inside, see what has to go and what stays.” She turned her head and shouted, “Teddy, get back here. We’re going in.” Her son galloped around the yard, an untamed colt, exploring the grounds. She’d always liked where the house sat, merely four miles from town but still in the middle of rolling hills and fields. Secluded. Tranquil. Huge leafy oaks stood sentry around it and provided it with shade and cooler air in the summer. The house wasn’t much to look at, but the location was peaceful…if you enjoyed the country. She did. Always had. The symphony of frogs and crickets in the nearby trees calmed her and evoked the sweeter reminiscences of her childhood: the way she’d lay on her second floor bed and listen to the night creatures and the murmuring wind; stare through the windows at the ever changing heavens, the stars and clouds as they raced above her; plan and daydream about the future. They were some of the best times. “I’m here, Mom.” Teddy stomped up the porch steps with his clumsy big feet. Someday he was going to be as tall as or taller than his father. “Let’s see what the inside looks like. I get dibs on one of the upstairs bedrooms. The one in the back by the humongous tree.” “No fair.” Sarah’s voice was petulant. “I wanted that room!” “Hold on you two,” she informed them. “All the bedrooms are upstairs and there are three. We’ll all get one.” Well, one of the rooms was as small as a large closet. That had been Joey’s when they’d been kids. Sarah wouldn’t like it but it was going to be hers. She braced herself for the resistance she’d have to face but knew enticing the girl with fresh paint and new Twilight posters would help ease the disappointment. Sarah was easy to bribe. Whereas Teddy liked money. He’d begun to notice girls and that they noticed him…if he had the coolest clothes and had cash in his pockets. Ah, those were the innocently simple days. When all one cared about was how one appeared to others and what others thought of them. The key Joey had given her that morning stuck in the lock and it took a few tries to pry the door open. He’d said he’d been out there recently, but as she shoved in the door and went inside she couldn’t imagine when that would have been. A year ago? There was an inch of dust and mice leavings sprinkled over everything. Spider webs. The furniture, vintage nineteen sixties or earlier, looked it. After her parent’s death, the house had been abandoned. Nothing had been moved or taken out. Joey wasn’t the sort to ask for extra work if he could avoid it. So now it’d be left to her and the kids to do the bulk of it. Where to start? She meandered through the rooms taking stock. There wasn’t much trash. She had to give her brother some credit, he’d kept it fairly uncluttered; though there were old dishes, canned food in the cabinets and utensils in the drawers that would have to be disposed of. Most of the sparse furniture was junk. It hadn’t been that great when new and now most of it was rotting wood, loose nails and split seams. She opened the old fridge. It was empty but seemed to be working. Joey had had the electric and water reconnected the week before. The stove, too, looked worthy to stay. Good, that’d give her time to buy better appliances because they’d had to leave theirs in their last house. The real estate agent said it’d help its sale. In the living room she yanked open the curtains. The light blinded her, made her skin feel crawly, and she retreated into the shadows. With her children’s eyes on her, she recovered quickly. “All this stuff is going to the dump, except the fridge and the oven. The rest of it’s not worth keeping. We need the space anyway if our furniture’s going to fit.” “I can help you move the heavy things outside,” Teddy offered. “I’m strong.” He wrote TRASH on the television set’s dirty screen with his finger. She remembered the television. It was really old. “That not a bad idea, son. Joey won’t be here for hours but we can get started on things and clear this mess out so we can sweep and mop.” They had the cleaning supplies in the trunk of the car. They’d come prepared. She sent Sarah out for the brooms and mops as she and Teddy moved furniture onto the front porch or into the yard. The heaviest pieces would have to wait for Joey’s arrival; what they could move they did. There was more than enough to keep them busy. They emptied drawers, closets and cubbyholes. The trash bags filled up quickly. Jenny forced herself to work hard, not to think about the way she was feeling. She was no longer tired or weak, but she felt even stranger than the night before. As if she was in a trance. Every noise was too loud. Smells were too strong. Her mind kept going off track, distracting her with disturbing thoughts that didn’t seem to be hers. She didn’t dare close her eyes, not even for a second, or the images came. Running wildly through wet night woods. Chasing something. Something chasing her. Drinking something that filled her belly and made her feel so…good. Flying from one place to another as if she had wings, but she didn’t. So confusing. She couldn’t fly. Not for the first time she feared something was horribly wrong with her; something much more virulent, life altering, than a normal physical ailment. Maybe a brain tumor from the concussion. Or an aftermath of the coma. She should call the doctor she’d had in the hospital, but a badgering voice in her head warned her not to. What could she say? She was feeling odd…couldn’t sleep…couldn’t keep real food down…and that all her senses had gone into overdrive? She was dreaming of, craving…human blood? Smelling it everywhere? Her doctor would either say it was the backlash of her heartache and trauma, give herself a little more time, or he’d insist she check herself into a hospital for immediate observation and more tests. Yikes, more tests? Oh no. She couldn’t do that. Not now. Besides she had too much too do. Her children needed her. She needed them. She had to find a job and bring in some money. Most of all, she was frightened. Because in the deep recesses of her mind there was a possible explanation to the way she was feeling and she couldn’t face it. Couldn’t bear to even think about it. No, no, no. That morning she’d forced herself to eat a bowl of Raisin Bran with bananas, her usual breakfast, but minutes later she’d rushed to the bathroom and threw it up. The face in the mirror glared at her with fevered eyes and skin paler than she’d ever seen it. Why hadn’t she been able to keep the food down when she was so very hungry? She didn’t know. Scared as she was, she didn’t dare say anything to anyone. That tiny insistent inner voice again. Shut up. Ignore it. It’ll go away. You’ll feel better tomorrow. Ha. By the time Joey and his friends drove up in the rented truck in the late afternoon, she and the kids had half the house cleaned out. Somehow it seemed smaller than she remembered. An old-fashioned kitchen, an ample living room and modest bath on the first floor and three bedrooms, one tiny, on the second. It’d be just right for the three of them. She smiled when she discovered her mom’s hidey nooks throughout the house, stashed with rosaries, crucifixes and different size bottles of holy water. A religious woman, until the booze took over, her mother, at all times eccentric, had felt the need to hide these important items. Besides the religious stuff, Jenny found seven dollars in folded cash. Some sharp silvery-looking arrow shaped things she couldn’t identify but reminded her of the metal points some archers used on their arrow shafts. When she was younger she’d taken a year of archery and had been exceptionally good at it. Her teacher had wanted her to try out for the statewide Olympic archery team. Which, at the time, she hadn’t but years afterwards wished she would have. Jenny packed her mother’s strange items in a cardboard box, tied it with a shoestring, and placed it on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, not having the heart to throw them away. “Wow, you’ve been busy, haven’t you? Good job,” Joey praised her as he came in the front door trailed by a short guy with glasses and longish hair, and a blond-headed taller man who looked somehow familiar. “Keeping busy helps.” Joey nodded understandingly. “You want to keep anything?” “Nah. Everything goes, except the refrigerator, the stove, a few odds and ends, and some mementoes I’ve set aside.” She grinned at the two men behind Joey. “Works out great because there’s hardly enough room for the furniture that’s coming. I’d forgotten how small this place was.” “Easier to clean though, hey?” Joey looked around at what she’d done so far. “It will be that.” “It’s nice you and the kids got so much done already. Less work for us.” “You would think of it that way.” Joey tapped the shoulder of the guy with the glasses. “This is a friend of mine, Oscar Schmidt. He’s a manager at the Town Market. “And you remember Andy Sullivan, don’t you? He went to high school with us.” “Oh, I remember you,” she tilted her head at the man as he smiled and put out a hand to shake. It was the briefest shake in history. She barely touched his hand. “Graduated a year or two behind me, right? You used to come over and you and Joey flew those motorized airplanes out in the back field?” Andy’s airplanes. They were too expensive for Joey to have had one. Their father hadn’t believed in buying expensive toys when the fields and trees were around to play in free. Oh, she remembered Andy all right. The boy who’d lived in a sprawling fancy house and whose parents had money. The boy who’d had the brand name clothes and a pocketful of cash for ice cream in his pockets. She’d never understood what Joey saw in him. Andy had been spoiled, selfish, and never missed a chance to rub his wealth in their noses. She hoped he’d changed. He might have if he were helping them. So she’d give him the benefit of the doubt. For now. Andy bobbed his head, his smile wider. “Yep. That was me. I remember you, too. I used to be jealous of you in archery class. You hit so many damn bull’s eyes.” “You remember that?” She laughed. “I haven’t drawn a bow since I was sixteen.” “You were astonishingly good. The Annie Oakley of the bow and arrow. I fell in love with the sport that year myself partly because of you. You made it look so easy. Now it’s one of my passions. I hunt with bow and arrow whenever I can; even make my own bows and arrows out of the aspen wood that’s so prevalent on my dad’s property. He has a hundred acres of wooded land about fifty miles from here. I go there to hunt.” Hadn’t she read somewhere Aspen was the wood vampires despised because used as a stake it could pierce their skin? Kill them? A peculiar thought to have. “Wow, you make your own bows and arrows? The man has hidden talents,” she said. “You might want to come with me some day to my dad’s place and I’ll let you use one of the bows. I have a spare. See if you can still hit that bull’s eye.” “Thanks. I’ll consider that kind offer. But right now I’m a little busy. Moving in. Two fatherless kids, a dilapidated farmhouse to refurbish and a job to find. I’ll get back to you,” she said with a noncommittal expression, “later.” “Anytime.” His manner, his smile seemed sincere. Perhaps he had changed. People did. All the time. She should have been self-conscious with two almost strangers staring at her. Her clothes were grimy; her face was dirt smudged and her hair was tugged into an unflattering ponytail. She wasn’t. She didn’t care. These days her appearance was the last thing on her mind. “You look almost the same,” Andy told her. “Not a day older then when I last saw you. How do you do that?” Her shoulders rose slightly then fell. She didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. Her mirror said different, lately. “Everyone ages. Maybe you need your eyes checked?” She smiled sweetly. He was helping her so she didn’t want to be too unsociable. “I’ve read your books, you know. I liked them. Immensely. The one about the vampires in the theater…wow that was something. And I loved that last ghost story. So eerie.” “You and about ten other people. But thank you.” “Where do you come up with those ideas?” “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.” “Well, wherever you get your ideas, don’t stop. I, for one, appreciate your books. Can’t wait for the next one.” She brushed the compliments off, a disquiet she couldn’t understand crowding in. She didn’t care one way or another what he thought of her. He was a friend of Joey’s, that’s all. Nothing more. The remarks about her books should have pleased her, but now her writing career felt so long ago and frivolous. Another person. Another life. If you couldn’t make a living at it what good was it? “Thank you for coming today and helping.” “You’re welcome. Here in Summer Haven we help our neighbors. It’s the small town friendly thing to do, you know?” “I know. I lived here. So things haven’t changed much?” She posed the question to Joey but her eyes were on Andy. “Not much,” Joey replied. Andy nodded agreeably. “So let’s get to work.” Between the four of them and the kids the house was empty and clean by dusk. “Whew, glad that’s done.” Joey groaned, leaning against the truck filled with the remnants of their childhood home. The faint radiance from the house’s lights spilled out into the yard. She could see everyone clearly, even in the weak light. “The guys and I are going to take this load to the dump and head back to town,” Joey said. “After we drop off the truck at the rental place we’ll meet at the diner. I promised the guys, as payment for their help, that supper’s on me.” She felt her brother glance at her in the dim light. He’d been watching her a lot during the afternoon. She knew why. She never took the sunglasses off. Direct light hurt her eyes. In the mirror that morning even she’d noticed how pale she was, how colorless her irises behind the glasses. She knew she was behaving strangely, even for her circumstances, but couldn’t help herself. Now, she could tell, he was even more anxious about her. “You and the kids are invited, too. Laurie’s cooked up pot roast for the special tonight. And, trust me, it’s delicious.” Her first reaction was to say no. The thought of food made her stomach hurt, but her children were looking expectantly at her with their hungry eyes so, instead, she muttered, “That sounds fine, Joey. We’ll meet you there. I have a few things I need to wrap up here first. A couple things to check. Just call me when you’ve unloaded this stuff, dropped off the truck and you’re on your way to the diner.” “I’ll do that.” She turned to Oscar and Andy. “Thank you both for helping us today.” She stood apart from them. The smell of their warm blood pumping below their flesh was too strong, too intoxicating. She couldn’t bear to be close. The smells, the strange feelings she was having, were too disturbing. Skin could tear so easily. Andy nodded, making a dismissive gesture with his hand. “It was nothing. Jenny, it’s been great seeing you again. I’m sure I’ll be running into you around town–and at Joey’s diner tonight. See you there.” He got in the truck’s cab, but his eyes never left her. Oscar echoed, “And it’s been nice meeting you, Jenny.” He tagged on at the last second, “Sorry for your loss. If there’s anything you or the kids need and I can help, don’t hesitate to call. I’m at the Town Market most every week day and some evenings. Come on by and I’ll give you a coupon book for the weekly specials.” A friendly smile. Joey had mentioned Oscar had a wife who worked at the nearby K-Mart, five kids of his own and knew what it was like to take care of a family. He had a generous heart. A churchgoer, his church also helped anyone who needed it. “Thank you, Oscar. I’ll remember that if we need anything.” She wouldn’t but she didn’t feel like saying anything more. The day had used her up. Emotionally, it’d been difficult. Cleaning out her parent’s house brought back so many bittersweet memories. Like the town, the house had a long history for her and in the dust she’d recalled so many forgotten things. “Uncle Joey,” Teddy spoke up. “Can I ride with you to the dump? Can I?” He was standing by the truck’s passenger door, his hand already on the handle. “Please?” “Me too!” Sarah was bouncing up and down beside her brother. Her excitement exhausting. “I want to go to the dump, too!” Joey looked to Jenny for permission. “If your mom says it’s okay, you both can come.” “Is there room for them with three of you men in the cab?” She was too tired to fight. After spending the day with a sullen, strange behaving mother, the children wanted a break. She didn’t blame them. She wanted a break. Joey was more fun. “Sure,” her brother replied. “We’ll make room. Sarah can sit on my lap.” “That’s against the law, isn’t it?” Jenny asked. “She should be in a car seat.” “I know. But just this once? It’s such a short distance away. Besides, I know all the local cops by their first name and feed every one of them most days. Worse they’d do is give me a warning.” Joey laughed. “Don’t worry, Sis. I’ll drive slow. Be careful. With all this crap in the back, I have to.” “Mom, please?” Teddy begged again and she couldn’t turn him down. There’d been so little pleasure in his life, in either of her children’s lives, lately. A short ride couldn’t hurt them. “Okay. Just don’t be too big of pests, you hear? Listen to your Uncle Joey.” “Thanks Mom,” Teddy scrambled into the truck, Sarah right behind him. Jenny was surprised. They did all fit. She waved as the truck maneuvered out of the driveway and took off down the highway into the dark. She stood there, thinking, bathed in the light from the doors and windows, then sighed and walked into the house. Turning off the lights as she made her way through the rooms she ended up in the upstairs bedroom, the one that had been hers as a child and young adult, and, in the dark, stared out the windows overlooking the back yard. The homestead hadn’t changed much. The oak tree filling the windows was now a massive tangle of branches and leaves rising to the sky. She and Joey used to climb out of this very window in the wee hours when their parents were asleep, down the tree’s trunk, and escape into the night fields to play. Later as a teenager, she’d scuttle down it to dash out and meet Jeff. The memories brought a smile to her lips. Running wild and free as a child as a fair weather moon looked on. Playing tag with Joey. Eavesdropping through windows at their neighbors. Making mischief around town. Good times. The house had been full of love in those early years. Her life, too. Her night vision, sharper than ever before, focused in on other things. There was the old shed, crumbling from age and termites, at the end of the yard. Beside it, the wobbly swing set was now a rusted skeleton against the darkening sky. Lumps of discarded metal and plastic littered the rest of the yard. Old washing machines. Discarded televisions. Rusted parts of junked cars. Her dad could never get rid of anything. Might need a part or something, he’d say. Best to keep it for a bit. Problem was the bit went on into years. The leftovers never left. It’d have to be cleared out and the trash taken away. Eventually. She didn’t want to think about it now. The night was beckoning her. Locking the house, she went outside and began the well-remembered trek across the yard into the backfield. Early fall had arrived with a wisp of cool air her skin couldn’t register. She’d loved the fall in Illinois. She’d feel the air kissing her skin as the trees swayed in the breeze, and it’d make her shiver. Florida’s autumn was a mild shadow of the Midwest’s season so there’d be no frigid cold. No snow. But if she were in Millstadt now she had the suspicion her skin wouldn’t feel the chill there, either. The moon had risen and provided light to see where she was going. Though with her keen sight and her memory she didn’t need it. She would have known the way no matter what. She vaulted over a rickety wooden fence. Amazed at the ease with which she sprang into the air and landed nimbly on her feet. The debilitating fatigue she’d been experiencing the last few weeks had subsided. She felt stronger than she ever had. Stronger than she had the right to feel. The trailer where she’d lived that long ago summer after her divorce was no longer there. For an instant her eyes saw it again. Hiding in the weeds. A long metal shape, dented and shabby. Her home for a short while as she’d tried to sort out her life. At the end of that summer, after she’d reunited with Jeff and moved out, her father had had the trailer, with her approval, taken away. She wondered sometimes where it had gone and to whom. Was someone still living in it somewhere? She didn’t know. On the wind and among the distant trees a ghostly neighing and whinnying swirled as if her two old friends were still out there somewhere; still remembered and loved her. Ah, she missed them too. Black Beauty. Lightning. She hoped they were both happy wherever they were; that the grass was green and the oats were plentiful and they ran free and strong in endless pastures. They’d been such good friends to Dad and her. Rest in peace. And damn forever the vampires that had slain them. They’re surely in hell now. Just where Jeff and she sent them the night they burnt the theater down. She wandered along the fence and enjoyed the night. Animals were skittering through the underbrush, climbing in the trees or flying above her. Their wings flapping. Their eyes blinking. She could almost hear their hearts. Beating. Beating. The blood pumping through their tiny bodies. God, she was so hungry. The hunger was entirely another entity apart from her, with a will of its own. She was so lost in it, that when the fox darted out in front of her and, seeing or sensing her, scampered into the surrounding woods, she didn’t think twice before she chased it. It was quick, but she was quicker. In less than a second she had it in her hands, rung its furry neck and brought it to her lips. She plunged her teeth, which somehow felt longer and sharper, into its flesh and drank until there wasn’t anything left to drink. Then realizing what she’d done, she screamed and collapsed to the ground, her body racked with shock. Revulsion. She touched her teeth with shaking hands. They were like daggers. Why did she do that? What was she becoming? She suspected. She feared. Yet doubt was nearly gone and nothing would ever be the same again. Her life, her future, forfeited. Her world crumbled around her like sand castles buffeted by waves. She cried, dry sobs, because there were no real tears. It was as if she’d lost the ability to weep as well as to feel…human. And in that moment she knew. She knew who had attacked her and Jeff that night under the viaduct; murdering him, and putting her into a coma she wasn’t supposed to have come out of. Vampires. “They’ve made me a monster like them. A monster.” She ranted and railed at her fate until her throat was raw. Sprinting through the woods, she ran to forget, ran to escape the inescapable truth. What about her children? Joey and Laurie? Was she a threat to them? Should she find a way to kill herself or should she just dissolve from their lives? She’d already lost Jeff. How could she leave her children? The thought of losing them was so unbearable her heart wouldn’t accept it. Running blindly, her panic-stricken mind couldn’t come up with the answers. What should she do? There was no cure for vampirism and so she was a danger to them. What should she do? Later, when she’d calmed down and dropped to her knees in the grass beneath her bedroom window, her heart answered. She could never leave Teddy and Sarah. After losing her husband, she cherished, loved them more than life itself. She couldn’t live, didn’t want to live, without them. And they needed her. If she abandoned them, it’d break what was left of their hearts. Destroy them completely. Joey, too. Then again, they might need her to protect them from the monsters who’d done this. They could be in danger. She knew better than most people vampires didn’t like to leave loose ends; would do anything to protect their secret lives, their existence. They didn’t allow witnesses to live and she had. Survived. She knew of them and they wouldn’t take the chance she’d keep quiet. So if she left her children alone they might not be safe. As she lay on the ground, her nose filling with the pungent smell of dirt, a raging instinct for survival took over and it was stronger than all her doubts and fears or her uptight morality. She didn’t want to leave those she loved. She didn’t want to be alone. There had to be a way to exist as a vampire but to do no harm to others and she had to find it. She’d killed the fox and drank its blood. And felt all right. Not great, but she could live with it. At least, the intense hunger had dissipated. Who said she had to prey on humans to live when animals would do? No one. Later she’d question if it was because of what she’d become, or because of the love she had for her family and her own life, that she made the decision she did. She’d never know. Because by the time she’d moved to the front yard and dropped onto the top step of the porch, her breathing steady but heart pounding, she had only one thought in her mind as she gazed around her childhood home. She was going to find a way to raise and love her children. Protect them from her…and from harm. Live her life without being a monster. Somehow. And if there wasn’t a way? No. Then she’d damn well find one. Because she would never, never, never leave her children. *** She wanted to call Joey and beg off for late supper at the diner but he was worried enough and she didn’t want to give him more cause. The fox’s blood had done the trick and as she peered into the bathroom mirror she had to admit she looked healthier than she had since before the attack. Her eyes shone, her skin was flushed and her mind was clear. She was cognizant of everything around her. Every little thing. After rinsing most of the blood from her sweater and blue jeans she stuffed the wet clothes, and the towel she’d gotten from the car, into a plastic bag and hid them in the closet of the room upstairs that would be hers. She’d clean them as soon as her washer and dryer arrived and hoped the blood would come out. She telephoned the movers and they promised the furniture would be at the house the following afternoon. That’d give her and the kids half the day tomorrow to finish getting the place ready. If she started early it could be done. If she worked real hard she might avoid thinking about her situation. Then she drove into town. All she knew, as she parked in front of the restaurant, was she felt better than she had in weeks. It was such a huge relief even the guilt at killing the fox and at what she now knew she was becoming couldn’t dampen it. It was a high that kept the growing revulsion away. It wasn’t normal, any of it, but she didn’t care. Self-survival had kicked in. She got out of the car and went into the diner. She didn’t look at the Dollar General; didn’t think about the theater that had once been there. Didn’t think about the irony of what Jeff and she had done all those years ago and now her own situation. There’d be time enough for that later once she and her children were situated in their new home. At the moment, she had other more important things to tend to. Inside, the bright lights didn’t hurt her eyes as much as they had earlier. Her smile came easily as her daughter ran up and burrowed into her embrace. “Mom, where were you? We tried to wait but we were hungry.” “That’s all right, honey. You should have eaten. I didn’t mean to take so long but…something came up and I had to deal with it.” She gazed down at the girl, gently brushed the hair from her eyes. Time for another haircut. Sarah’s hair grew faster than weeds. It was halfway down her back. Tomorrow morning she’d have to braid it. She needed to start being a better mom. She’d let so much go the past few weeks. “That’s good cause we’re done. You’ll have to eat alone. Sorry Mom.” “That’s okay. I ate snacks I had in the car so I’m not hungry. I’ll just have coffee.” Joey stood beside her. “Not going to eat? Again?” That look of puzzlement she’d come to know too well shadowing his face. “Sis, you’re skin and bones. Snacks won’t do it. You sure you don’t want something more substantial? Like real food? A roast beef sandwich maybe? You always liked roast beef as I recall.” “No thanks.” She tried a different tact. “I think I ate a moldy cupcake or something. My stomach’s upset. I promise I’ll eat something later. I’m an adult remember? Stop bugging me.” Joey’s expression was skeptical but he didn’t nag her further. He’d stopped telling her what to do years ago and she’d stopped listening. Growing up and moving far away could do that. Teddy came up behind her and slipped his hand into hers. “We’re over there in the corner with the others, Mom.” He led her to the booth where Andy, Oscar and Laurie were talking and laughing over what remained of their meals, Laurie having taken a break to eat with everyone. Jenny and the kids joined them as Joey waited on an older couple at the counter. He kept an eye on Jenny, though, his lips in a slight downturn. She didn’t stay long, using an early morning get-up and sleepy children as an excuse. Not even Andy’s pleading for her to stay and talk a little couldn’t tempt her. “Thanks but another time. We’re just all tired. The kids need to get to bed.” “We have another two hours before the diner closes,” Joey said before they departed. “Afterwards we’ll be home. Call me or Laurie if you or the kids need anything, ya hear?” “I hear. But we’ll be fine.” She said goodnight to everyone, packed up Sarah and Teddy and returned to the apartment. “One more night,” she told the kids, “and we’ll be sleeping in our own place again.” When they were asleep she restlessly roamed the apartment and didn’t know why. The hunger had returned. Not as strong as before but it gnawed, a tiny voracious animal in the pit of her stomach, reminding her sooner or later she’d have to hunt again. To even think she’d become what she’d once reviled, galled her. Just knowing she’d have to hunt and kill again was making her physically ill. So she put it out of her mind, or tried to. She couldn’t sleep and spent the time making lists of what she had to do the following morning at the house and brooding about her dilemma. Was there some way to reverse what was happening to her? Was there someone somewhere who could help her? Perhaps there could be salvation for her yet. All she had to do was search for and find it. Or–maybe she was wrong about everything…and it was really just a medical condition? Maybe it’s all in her head? That grief, trauma thing again? Yes, that’s what it was. When Laurie and Joey drove up she snuck quietly into her room. Let Joey think she was sleeping. She wasn’t ready to tell him what was happening and if he saw her alone he’d weasel it out of her. She lay on the air mattress and closed her eyes. When she opened them again it was daylight and the hunger was now a growing fire in her belly. She’d have to put up with it until the night came and she was in her own house with the woods around her. Then she’d tend to it. She rose, dressed, and woke her children. The scent of their blood, so sweet and warm, filling their bodies made her hungrier. Their skin seemed to glow. She looked at them and for the briefest of moments they were no longer her beloved children, her flesh and blood, and her future but…breakfast. It would have been so easy to lay her lips against their baby soft necks and–Stop! What the hell was she thinking? Horrified, she moved away and began furiously packing up their clothes. Would there come a time when she wouldn’t be able to resist the call of their blood? Would she turn into a monster like the ones she’d once fought? God please no. “Come on,” she gently urged. “Let’s get you both something to eat and get out to the house. It’s going to be a busy day.” “Moving day, huh, Mommy?” Sarah’s eyes sparkled, she was so excited. Like her mother she wasn’t happy unless she had a place to nest, a roof over her head and her own bed in her own room. All the things she loved, her clothes, her stuffed animals, her collection of horse statues, her tiny bracelets and necklaces, her feather-soft bed with the Twilight themed comforter on it, were on a truck moving closer to the house that by nightfall would be their new home. “Yep, moving day.” “I’m glad. I miss my stuff.” The child smiled as she slipped into a clean yellow shirt and a pair of worn blue jeans. “My horses. I know they’re not real horses. They’re just little bitty plastic and wooden ones but I still love them and I’ve missed them. I can’t wait until they’re home with me, too.” “I know.” For a while, at around Sarah’s age, or until her parents no longer could afford to keep them, Jenny had had real horses, two of them, and had loved them dearly. The true joy of her childhood. She wanted the same for her daughter, but she had to have an income first. Horses cost money to keep, care for and feed. A lot of money. “Now that we live in the country we might try to get you a real horse someday. Not an expensive thoroughbred or anything like that but a sturdy quarter horse we can all ride.” “Could we really?” Sarah’s hand, so small and trusting, grabbed hers and her smile was like the sun. A sun Jenny hadn’t seen much of lately. “Yes, really. Probably. One day.” “I don’t care much for horses, Mom, you know that,” Teddy chimed in sullenly. “But I would sure like a new bike. My old one’s too small. I’m bigger now. Living out of town like we’ll be doing I’ll need one.” He seemed to mull over something and quickly added, “A used one would be okay. I know we’re short on cash and all.” Her frown came and went quickly. She’d never wanted her kids to endure the poverty she had when she’d been growing up. The truth was it wasn’t going to be easy doing it alone. Jobs, these days, were hard to find and even harder to keep. And she had no idea what she could do for a living. Writing novels was out of the question. It wasn’t dependable. “I think we can swing that. Soon as we’re settled in the farmhouse I’ll look for one for you.” “That would be great.” Teddy smiled, too. Another sun. “Now let’s get our butts moving and get out of here. Day’s a wasting.” She followed them into the kitchen and as her stomach protested she made them breakfast. Bowls of cereal with bananas. They were in a hurry. When she walked past the windows and the sunlight hit her skin, it burned. Left red patches. Oh, oh. When she went outside she’d have to wear long sleeves. Blue jeans. No shorts. Sunglasses again and a hat. Thank goodness it was fall. No one would question her choice of clothes. Joey and Laurie had gotten up earlier and were at the diner making breakfast for their customers. Good thing. She couldn’t face Joey. Not yet. Not until she had more time to work out what she was going to say and how she was going to say it. He’d see right through her evasions. He always did. And she’d have to confess everything. Since she had no idea, not a glimmer, of what she was going to do about her problem, she had no idea what she was going to say. Not yet, anyway.",

      "content": "Chapter 4 Jenny The farmhouse was bare and scrubbed when the big truck rumbled into the driveway. The sun was directly above. The two men, heavy-set and muscled, dispatched from the moving company unloaded everything and kindly placed them in the exact spots Jenny directed them to. Family men themselves, they knew she was a widow, a mother, and couldn’t do enough. One of them, Leonard, joked and spent time with Teddy as they worked, talked about cars and bicycles. Teddy lapped up the attention seemed happy the entire time. Besides evil in the world there were good people as well. A shame she was no longer one of them. Through the excruciatingly long hours of the day as the sun beat down she had the hardest time keeping herself together. Her stomach was crying for food. The sun was way too bright. Her mind was crowded with strange yearnings and bloody vignettes of what she believed were someone else’s thoughts. She was fairly sure of that. In them she was on the hunt in thick gloomy woods, but the quarry was human. There were screaming faces with terror-filled eyes as the life was drained from them and their existence came to an end. Nightmares she couldn’t stop. They made her sick to her stomach…and made her heart race. Whoever or whatever was in her mind was brutally strong, relentless. She shuddered but didn’t think it, whatever it was, knew she was eavesdropping…yet. Over and over she chased the intruder from her mind but as her hunger grew each hour she thought she was going crazy. All she wanted was to flee into the shadowed forest behind the house and hunt anything that was warm and full of blood, rip its throat open and drink. Of course, busy moving into their house and mothering the children she loved and who needed her, she couldn’t. She worked harder. Faster. By dusk her clothes and skin were dirty yet she wasn’t sweating. Sarah and Teddy were tired and sat on the front porch taking a break, lightly bickering back and forth, the stress and the move having finally gotten to them. She was about to give up working for the day when Joey and Andy drove up. “We thought we’d drop by and help you put the beds together,” her brother explained with a smile when he found her in the kitchen stacking dishes in the cabinet. She turned to look at him and was only aware of the enticing aroma of the blood which pumped through his body. It formed a churning mist around him and made her mouth water. It took every ounce of her will to not run over and bite him or Andy. “Thanks,” she muttered, sending her eyes away from the two so they wouldn’t see the hunger burning in them. “That’s sweet of you. Both of you.” “Well,” Joey went on. “You three have to have something to sleep in tonight. I assume you’re staying here?” “You assume right.” “Jenny?” Her brother touched her arm. “Are you okay?” Oh, why could she never hide anything from him? “Sure.” She glanced up. Sighed. “Tired that’s all. Everything’s catching up with me. Guess I’ve over done it the last few days.” “Guess so. Remember only a couple weeks ago you were in a coma. You’re supposed to take it easy. Your doctor warned it’d be awhile before you’d be yourself again.” She almost laughed. If he only knew. Instead she decided to play the weak patient card and sat down at the kitchen table, hung her face in her hands and moaned. “I am really beat.” A tired smile. “I’m so glad you two are here to help. I had thought about the beds needing to be put together but figured we’d just drop the mattresses on the floor and sleep on them that way. Wouldn’t hurt for a night or two.” “Well, now you won’t have to. Andy and I will just tramp upstairs and put them together for you. We brought tools and everything.” Andy waved at her from behind him. “You have become the resourceful one, haven’t you?” she kidded her brother. “I try to be. These days. Everyone has to grow up, right?” His smile, as if he had a secret no one else knew, was the same one she remembered from their childhood. He liked being a hero. “Right.” Joey laid a bulky plastic bag on the table next to her. “Laurie also sent you guys some supper. Hamburgers. Onion rings. Chocolate malts. A pumpkin pie for dessert. There’s a large cup of coffee in there for you. Laurie thought you’d be too tired or busy to bother making something tonight to eat.” She was touched by their thoughtfulness. “Thank you, Brother. And thank Laurie for me when you get back. You two think of everything.” “We try.” “Can you do Sarah’s bed first? I’m pretty sure she won’t be staying up much longer. Last time I saw her she was getting cranky. A sure sign her bedtime’s not far off.” “Will do.” When the two men were upstairs banging at things and cussing she opened the container of coffee and after one sip dumped it down the drain. But it sent her in search of the coffee maker hidden in a cardboard box in a kitchen corner. Once she’d located it she cleaned it out and started a fresh pot of coffee for the guys. They’d probably need a few cups after their tasks were done. Even the smell of percolating coffee roiled her stomach. She called the kids in to eat and, poised by the window, fought the increasing summons of the night as hard as she could. Once she found herself at the door, her hand reaching for the knob to go outside. She froze. “Mom,” Teddy drug her back to reality. “I’m done eating. I’m going outside.” He ran past her, opened the door, and burst out into the yard, singing off key at the top of his lungs. The enticing elixir of what raced below his skin lingered in her nose and tore at her senses. She forgot he was a child…forgot he was her son. All she cared about was bringing him down like a stampeding deer and taking what she so urgently needed. No, no, no. Her moment of insanity was abruptly over and the room began to spin. By the door she leaned against the wall and laughed nervously to cover her shock. It was getting worse. She was losing herself. If Teddy hadn’t bumped into her as he ran out and snapped her out of it she would have been gone. Out the door, too. Into the dark. Doing God knows what to God knows whom. Possibly even to her son. Oh, God. Sarah was slumped in a chair, picking at her food. Jenny walked over and laid a trembling hand on her daughter’s shoulder. “Honey, it’s been a long day. You’re sleepy aren’t you?” “Nah.” The girl yawned, her eyelids drifting downward. Jenny knew her child. In another minute she’d been asleep in the chair. “Well, a little.” A second yawn. “Soon as your uncle’s done putting your bed together we’ll tuck you in. Okay?” “Sure Mommy.” Sarah took another sip of her malt and another bite of hamburger. Jenny couldn’t bear to stand near the child and resumed putting glasses and cups away. Outside she could hear Teddy playing around the house, climbing the tree in the backyard and humming to himself. Part of her wanted to go out and join him. Kick her heels up like an innocent child, ignorant of the bad things that could come out of the dark. Her soul shivered. To be in her childhood home again was strange. She’d always loved the farmhouse, the towering shade trees, and the rolling land, fields and lush woods veined with flowing creeks and dotted with shady ponds, surrounding it. A peaceful setting of beauty, it’d been her Walden’s Pond during her growing up years through the good times and her refuge during the bad. Their furniture from the other house was all around her, blending the old life with the new. So it was home, a different home, but it felt comfortable. Tomorrow morning she’d begin painting the rooms until the whole house was done. Fresh and cheerful. It would have been easier if the place had been empty a little longer but that hadn’t been the way it’d worked out. She’d cover things with plastic and move them around, until her task was finished. Then she’d lay the rugs the movers had rolled up and stashed in the downstairs hallway. And the farmhouse would become a lovely home for her children. But even paint and better furniture couldn’t cancel the past. The room around her was filled with bygone angst. There were unhappy memories here, as well. Going hungry too many nights because her father had no handyman jobs or hadn’t been paid. Her mother, Estelle, didn’t work outside the home. At night she’d listen, trembling, in her cold bed to her parents arguing over money. Then years later, her father had lived here alone, broken-hearted and fragile, after her mother had escaped to a barren apartment in town so she could drink herself to death in peace. Only, in the end, she hadn’t died of alcohol. No, she hadn’t. She’d been taken by vampires. Jenny hung her head, shook away the clinging memories. All houses had ghosts of one kind or another. Right now it was more of a concern to her that the wiring and plumbing weren’t up to code and probably unsafe. Ghosts she could handle. Broken pipes and house fires she couldn’t. Sarah was snoozing in the chair and Jenny tried to wake her. She couldn’t. When the child was asleep not much could rouse her. Jenny marveled at how light the girl seemed in her arms as she carried her up the stairs. In the doorway to Teddy’s room, she stood, holding her child. “Joey, is Sarah’s bed ready?” “Yep.” Her brother stepped away from the bed. “Got both kid’s beds together. Now we’ll go work on yours.” He took Sarah from her arms and laid her on Teddy’s mattress. “She’ll be okay here while you make up her bed in the other room.” “Good idea. Why didn’t I think of that?” she said with a touch of sarcasm. “There’s fresh coffee downstairs if either one of you want some. I left cups and sugar on the counter. Creamer’s in the fridge.” She moved into the other room. Gathering the sheet and covers, she made Sarah’s bed, and fetched her. Andy insisted on carrying the girl from Teddy’s room and laid her on her bed. Jenny tucked the child beneath the covers. Sarah hadn’t quivered an eyelid. “She’s really out of it, isn’t she?” Andy spoke softly. “Well, she’s had a hard day in a really hard month.” Jenny stepped away so she wasn’t in close proximity to him. After feeling Sarah in her arms, her flesh soft against hers, she had little tolerance left for being close to anyone else. “You’ve all had a hard time.” Andy looked at her in the pale light from the hallway. She’d switched the dresser’s lamp off once Sarah was under the blankets. “I didn’t say anything yesterday, but I heard about your husband. I’m so sorry for your loss.” “Thank you.” She had no tears left to shed, even if she could have. She waited for the inevitable conclusion to his pity. Ah, here it was. “And if there’s anything I can do to help you or the kids, don’t hesitate to ask.” He must have heard her choked breath because he gently touched her arm. “Jenny, I know how you’re feeling. I do. I lost my wife four years ago in a car accident. I know words won’t change a thing. They don’t ease the sorrow. Stop the pain. Only time will.” His smile was hesitant, poignantly sad. He was still hurting. She could see it. “Then I’m sorry for your loss. You have any children?” “No. Oh, we wanted some. God just never saw fit to grant us our wish.” “I’m sorry for that as well.” She fell silent and the moment was over. She found herself staring at his neck and had to drag her eyes, her body, away. Get a grip. “Excuse me, I need to get Teddy’s bed ready. He’s outside playing but I bet here real soon he’ll want his bed, too.” “I know,” Andy finished for her, “it’s been a hard day.” For the first time, a small smile crept out. “Yes, it has. But we accomplished a lot. We’re moved in. Thanks to the help of family and friends. Thank you, Andy.” “You’re welcome. I’m glad you think of me as a friend. I realize back in the day I was your brother’s friend, and you and I weren’t close, but I hope now you consider me one of yours.” “I will.” “You know,” he kept talking, trailing her to the room Joey had just left. “I did know Jeff, your husband.” Surprised, she swung around and met his eyes. Well, Jeff had been born and raised in Summer Haven after all. Many people knew him. “You did?” “Oh, he was a year ahead of me in school but we played together in the school band for two years and we were sort of friends. He used to call me his little brother because I tagged along after him so much. It’s how I first met Joey actually, once you and Jeff started dating all those years ago, through Jeff. We grew apart, out of touch, when Jeff left town the first time, though. When he returned the second time he wasn’t here long enough for us to renew that friendship. But I never forgot him.” “You and my husband were really friends, huh?” “Yeah, really. I have fond memories of our high school years. He was a good guy. The best. He could make me laugh when no one else could. You know? With those tasteless but endearing jokes of his?” Jenny didn’t know what to say. Just thinking of her husband sent a splinter through her heart. She would have given anything to have him there to talk over what was happening to her. Anything. Joey called him from the other room. “Hey, Andy, come and help me with Jenny’s bed, would you?” “I’m on my way, buddy.” He disappeared into her room and Jenny made up her son’s bed, the whole time fighting the compulsion to scramble out the window and down the branches of the oak tree and flee into the night. To find food. To feed. Not yet. Soon. When everyone left and she was alone. The children sleeping. Soon. Not soon enough. A half hour later her company hadn’t left. She couldn’t be rude to someone who’d helped her and had to suffer through the socializing. The three of them sat in the kitchen having coffee, Joey and Andy having leftover pie, and chatting about how the town had changed. Teddy, finally worn out from the day, slept upstairs in his room. Deep night had fallen outside. Jenny kept her eyes off the windows; fearful the siren call of the night would bewitch and drag her from the light. She drummed her fingers on the table, pushed down the intense thirst and beneath the droning of conversation she kept telling herself to wait. Soon. Soon. Joey and Andy wouldn’t stay forever. And the night would still be out there. She was terrified at the changes she’d been experiencing in her body and her mind. Her physical strength was growing, her senses were more acute and her thought patterns, her very way of viewing the world, were changing. She couldn’t stop them and, though she didn’t want to admit it, she liked them and that upset her, too. Before the attack under the viaduct she would have only seen the evil side of what she was morphing into…but now she saw her evolving in endless shades of gray. Funny how, in the end, raw survival took over. Somewhere along the way she’d ceased thinking of herself as a monster. Now she was just a widow, mother of two children who really needed her, who had to find a way to manage something horrible that had happened to her. Sort of like a handicap. Like paralysis, missing limbs or a scarred body. Didn’t people adapt and learn to live with them all the time? They did. It hadn’t been her fault. She hadn’t asked for it. Now all she wanted was to live and shield those she loved because they might need her to do so. Yet self-control was the first issue she had to address. If she couldn’t keep from draining her loved ones of all their blood then she was in big trouble. She focused on the discussion they were having. It took a lot of focus. “Yeah, Summer Haven isn’t the same town you vacated a decade ago,” Andy was saying and she concentrated to understand his words. “This bad economy has thinned the business base around here, particularly downtown. Did you see how many shops and businesses were closed up, shuttered and empty?” A plate in front of him held a remnant of pumpkin pie, his second piece. He’d had three cups of coffee and she had no doubt he’d be having a fourth. He was hungry. Like her. She felt bad she didn’t have something else to give the guy besides leftover pie. A sandwich or something. But her refrigerator was empty until she went shopping. There she was…thinking like a puny caregiving human. Ech. Old habits were hard to break. “Nah, I guess I was too busy soaking in the nostalgia.” And worrying about what the hell was happening to her. “It’s that bad?” She tried not to stare at the vein throbbing in his temple. She licked her lips. “Well, at least half the shops lining Main Street have shut their doors in the last two years. Not to mention the residential foreclosures and job losses. Last summer the biggest employer in the area, the Golden Stove Factory out on Fifth Street, shut down and laid off two thirds of the town. People are really hurting now.” “Working at the bank I imagine you’ve seen it all.” “Unfortunately, I have. I’ve watched friends and neighbors apply for loans we can’t give them. Seen people deplete their savings and bank accounts just to pay their monthly bills. Many of my friends have lost their houses and are living with relatives. It’s hurt the bank, too. If we can’t loan money and our customers are leaving then we also feel it. There’s been rumors of layoffs where I work.” He shook his head. “Difficult times.” Joey agreed. “Running a diner I’ve seen and heard all the hard luck stories. Laurie and I have steadily lowered prices this last year to help people out. I even give free meals to some I know are hungry. “There’s this one old gal, Lizzie Davenport, who’s been out of work for a very long time. She had a job at the stove foundry for twenty-five years, no pension cause the place went belly up, yet since she’s over sixty she can’t find another job no matter how hard she tries. Used up her retirement savings. Lost her car and then her house. I really feel for her because I’ve known her since we were kids. I help her as much as I can.” He glanced at her. “Remember her, Jenny? She had that brick house on Rose Street. In the winter we used to shovel the snow off her driveway and sidewalks and afterwards, along with the money, she’d give us homemade brownies and milk?” “I remember Lizzie and those brownies. Though anything tastes great when you’re starving.” Everyone in town knew Lizzie, a sweet woman who’d do anything for anyone. In her time she’d helped many people so it was only fair people helped her now. “Lizzie spells us now sometimes at the restaurant,” Joey said. “Not much of a waitress but she’s a pretty fair cook. We don’t pay her much but we give her free room and board in a tiny bedroom we fixed up for her behind the diner. Once we added on there was this cubby space in the rear we at first used for extra storage. Walk-in closet size. Now it has a bed and a few things squeezed in. At least she has a place to sleep and keep her belongings. Until things get better for her anyway. She’s been saving her money.” “You have a good heart, Brother.” “I try. There’s so much sorrow in the world. I do what I can.” He stood up, stretched; and sent a nod towards Andy, who was stuffing the last piece of pie into his mouth. “I think it’s time for us to go, buddy. Knowing my sister, she can’t wait to get back to cleaning and pushing furniture around.” His eyes skimmed the kitchen and peered into the living room. “It looks good already. Homey. Your furniture dresses up the old place mucho. You have excellent taste.” “Wait until I get the walls painted and add the final decorating touches. It won’t look like the same house.” “Heck, it doesn’t look like the same house now. After you’re done I won’t recognize it. I’m sorry I never got in here and fixed it up.” Joey was inching towards the door. She wanted to help move him along but held herself in check. “I honestly didn’t know what to do with it for the longest time and then I started the renovations on the diner and kind of forgot about it.” “At least you remembered to pay the yearly taxes. I have to thank you for that. Otherwise I’d be homeless now because I can’t afford squat.” “You’re welcome.” Her brother came over and hugged her. His flesh was so warm. His skin so thin. So breakable. She could hear his heart beating loudly in his chest. Cymbals clanging to a mystifying symphony. “I always knew I’d need this old house somewhere down the road. For you or someone. Had a premonition. Almost let Lizzie move in last year but she didn’t want the hassle of caring for a house and she didn’t have a car anyway to get back and forth to work. She walks everywhere so she needed to stay in town.” “I’m happy to have it.” Her eyes went to Andy as he got up from his chair. “Again, thanks for your help yesterday and today, Andy.” “You’re more than welcome. Remember if you need anything–” “I know, call you. But ask my brother, I can take care of myself.” “That she can.” Joey nodded. “See ya later, Sis. I’ll call tomorrow to see how you’re doing. Phone me if you need me before that, okay?” She gave her brother a mock salute. “I will. Now goodnight both of you.” The two men trudged out the door. Their feet crunched in the gravel. Joey’s truck revved up and drove away. Free at last. Shutting her eyes, she lingered at the door and listened to the night animals beyond the glass. They were frolicking out there in the autumn murkiness among the crispy leaves and cool dirt covered ground. Little creatures, with nocturne eyes and speedy feet, full of hot blood. The mother in her fretted over leaving her children alone in the house but the hunger overpowered the mother and she snuck outside into the darkness. She told herself they’d be fine. She’d be back shortly. That she should reward herself for her self-restraint all day. She hadn’t attacked one living person. Hadn’t gone crazy or hung from the rafters by her feet. She’d done well. She told herself that killing innocent little animals wasn’t all that creepy, wasn’t all that bad, considering the alternative. It didn’t work. She loved animals and hated having to kill them at all for any reason. Or had. But, she had to keep reminding herself, animals died every minute of the day to fill humans’ stomachs. Right? Was what she did any worse than that? All she wanted was their blood. It was her food. She felt guilty only until she captured the large fox, humanely snapped its neck to drink the blood (which tasted better than anything she’d ever drank or eaten) and then was too exhilarated to think of anything but further feeding her hunger; not even that she could run faster than she ever had, could see like an owl through the darkness, smell her prey miles away and that her teeth were changing. When she stuck her finger into her mouth she could feel the points. Oh, great. Little fangs. Oh, Lord, could this get any weirder? She thought about those horror movies she’d seen over the years where some unlucky human had been bitten and was slowly turning into god-knows-what and couldn’t believe or accept it. Was in shock. Now she knew exactly how they’d felt. Though, in the end, she did feel regret for killing the poor fox and the one the night before. But, yes, it was better than feeding off homo sapiens. Damn straight it was. After ingesting the blood she felt as if there was nothing she couldn’t deal with. No problem she couldn’t solve, no disaster she couldn’t avert. She was superwoman. This wasn’t so bad, was it? It’d occurred to her perhaps if a good person became a vampire that might be the key. Good person equals good vampire? Bad person equals bad vampire? She could only pray that was the case. Oh, it could be worse. She could lust after human blood and not be able to resist. Now that would be a deal breaker. She absorbed the night poised beside a towering tree, its limbs shifting in the wind; inhaled the dizzying perfumes of the forest. Her lips on the verge of smiling. She felt better than she had since she’d come out of the coma weeks ago. Her new world revolved around her in slow motion. The night birds cooed in their nests. The air danced among the dying leaves. Insects skittered between limbs and under bushes. On the breeze there were aromatic wisps of brewing coffee and chocolate (cake she thought), fresh baking bread and as always now, blood. Animal blood in the small bustling creatures hiding out all around her and in the distance the cloying scent of human blood. Her children asleep in their beds. Amazing. God, the night was beautiful. That’s when she saw the pale figure hiding between the trees to her left. A tall man dressed in drab clothes watched her. She merged deeper into the woods among the thicker underbrush but when she looked back, he was still on the fringe observing. Waves of uneasiness rippled through her and the vertigo was unbalancing. This man stalking her wasn’t her friend. This man was dangerous. If he was a man. She ran all the way home at a speed she never would have imagined a human capable of. More like flying really. Her feet barely touched the ground, her night eyes so keen she never once collided with a tree or stumbled over a rock. Within seconds she was inside the farmhouse peeking out the windows; the mysterious stranger nowhere in sight. Thank God. Had she really seen him? Or had it been a trick of her imagination, her eyes seeing strange things in the darkness? Maybe it’d been a pale hued limb split and broken besides a darker trunk? Since the attack she was paranoid, that’s all. Seeing things that weren’t there. Minutes later she’d nearly forgotten the man and the gut-wrenching fear. She continued cleaning and rearranging furniture, no longer tired. She worked through the night and didn’t look out the windows again. By morning she’d forgotten the man in the woods. Almost. There was so much to do before the children woke.",

      "content": "Chapter 4 Jenny The farmhouse was bare and scrubbed when the big truck rumbled into the driveway. The sun was directly above. The two men, heavy-set and muscled, dispatched from the moving company unloaded everything and kindly placed them in the exact spots Jenny directed them to. Family men themselves, they knew she was a widow, a mother, and couldn’t do enough. One of them, Leonard, joked and spent time with Teddy as they worked, talked about cars and bicycles. Teddy lapped up the attention seemed happy the entire time. Besides evil in the world there were good people as well. A shame she was no longer one of them. Through the excruciatingly long hours of the day as the sun beat down she had the hardest time keeping herself together. Her stomach was crying for food. The sun was way too bright. Her mind was crowded with strange yearnings and bloody vignettes of what she believed were someone else’s thoughts. She was fairly sure of that. In them she was on the hunt in thick gloomy woods, but the quarry was human. There were screaming faces with terror-filled eyes as the life was drained from them and their existence came to an end. Nightmares she couldn’t stop. They made her sick to her stomach…and made her heart race. Whoever or whatever was in her mind was brutally strong, relentless. She shuddered but didn’t think it, whatever it was, knew she was eavesdropping…yet. Over and over she chased the intruder from her mind but as her hunger grew each hour she thought she was going crazy. All she wanted was to flee into the shadowed forest behind the house and hunt anything that was warm and full of blood, rip its throat open and drink. Of course, busy moving into their house and mothering the children she loved and who needed her, she couldn’t. She worked harder. Faster. By dusk her clothes and skin were dirty yet she wasn’t sweating. Sarah and Teddy were tired and sat on the front porch taking a break, lightly bickering back and forth, the stress and the move having finally gotten to them. She was about to give up working for the day when Joey and Andy drove up. “We thought we’d drop by and help you put the beds together,” her brother explained with a smile when he found her in the kitchen stacking dishes in the cabinet. She turned to look at him and was only aware of the enticing aroma of the blood which pumped through his body. It formed a churning mist around him and made her mouth water. It took every ounce of her will to not run over and bite him or Andy. “Thanks,” she muttered, sending her eyes away from the two so they wouldn’t see the hunger burning in them. “That’s sweet of you. Both of you.” “Well,” Joey went on. “You three have to have something to sleep in tonight. I assume you’re staying here?” “You assume right.” “Jenny?” Her brother touched her arm. “Are you okay?” Oh, why could she never hide anything from him? “Sure.” She glanced up. Sighed. “Tired that’s all. Everything’s catching up with me. Guess I’ve over done it the last few days.” “Guess so. Remember only a couple weeks ago you were in a coma. You’re supposed to take it easy. Your doctor warned it’d be awhile before you’d be yourself again.” She almost laughed. If he only knew. Instead she decided to play the weak patient card and sat down at the kitchen table, hung her face in her hands and moaned. “I am really beat.” A tired smile. “I’m so glad you two are here to help. I had thought about the beds needing to be put together but figured we’d just drop the mattresses on the floor and sleep on them that way. Wouldn’t hurt for a night or two.” “Well, now you won’t have to. Andy and I will just tramp upstairs and put them together for you. We brought tools and everything.” Andy waved at her from behind him. “You have become the resourceful one, haven’t you?” she kidded her brother. “I try to be. These days. Everyone has to grow up, right?” His smile, as if he had a secret no one else knew, was the same one she remembered from their childhood. He liked being a hero. “Right.” Joey laid a bulky plastic bag on the table next to her. “Laurie also sent you guys some supper. Hamburgers. Onion rings. Chocolate malts. A pumpkin pie for dessert. There’s a large cup of coffee in there for you. Laurie thought you’d be too tired or busy to bother making something tonight to eat.” She was touched by their thoughtfulness. “Thank you, Brother. And thank Laurie for me when you get back. You two think of everything.” “We try.” “Can you do Sarah’s bed first? I’m pretty sure she won’t be staying up much longer. Last time I saw her she was getting cranky. A sure sign her bedtime’s not far off.” “Will do.” When the two men were upstairs banging at things and cussing she opened the container of coffee and after one sip dumped it down the drain. But it sent her in search of the coffee maker hidden in a cardboard box in a kitchen corner. Once she’d located it she cleaned it out and started a fresh pot of coffee for the guys. They’d probably need a few cups after their tasks were done. Even the smell of percolating coffee roiled her stomach. She called the kids in to eat and, poised by the window, fought the increasing summons of the night as hard as she could. Once she found herself at the door, her hand reaching for the knob to go outside. She froze. “Mom,” Teddy drug her back to reality. “I’m done eating. I’m going outside.” He ran past her, opened the door, and burst out into the yard, singing off key at the top of his lungs. The enticing elixir of what raced below his skin lingered in her nose and tore at her senses. She forgot he was a child…forgot he was her son. All she cared about was bringing him down like a stampeding deer and taking what she so urgently needed. No, no, no. Her moment of insanity was abruptly over and the room began to spin. By the door she leaned against the wall and laughed nervously to cover her shock. It was getting worse. She was losing herself. If Teddy hadn’t bumped into her as he ran out and snapped her out of it she would have been gone. Out the door, too. Into the dark. Doing God knows what to God knows whom. Possibly even to her son. Oh, God. Sarah was slumped in a chair, picking at her food. Jenny walked over and laid a trembling hand on her daughter’s shoulder. “Honey, it’s been a long day. You’re sleepy aren’t you?” “Nah.” The girl yawned, her eyelids drifting downward. Jenny knew her child. In another minute she’d been asleep in the chair. “Well, a little.” A second yawn. “Soon as your uncle’s done putting your bed together we’ll tuck you in. Okay?” “Sure Mommy.” Sarah took another sip of her malt and another bite of hamburger. Jenny couldn’t bear to stand near the child and resumed putting glasses and cups away. Outside she could hear Teddy playing around the house, climbing the tree in the backyard and humming to himself. Part of her wanted to go out and join him. Kick her heels up like an innocent child, ignorant of the bad things that could come out of the dark. Her soul shivered. To be in her childhood home again was strange. She’d always loved the farmhouse, the towering shade trees, and the rolling land, fields and lush woods veined with flowing creeks and dotted with shady ponds, surrounding it. A peaceful setting of beauty, it’d been her Walden’s Pond during her growing up years through the good times and her refuge during the bad. Their furniture from the other house was all around her, blending the old life with the new. So it was home, a different home, but it felt comfortable. Tomorrow morning she’d begin painting the rooms until the whole house was done. Fresh and cheerful. It would have been easier if the place had been empty a little longer but that hadn’t been the way it’d worked out. She’d cover things with plastic and move them around, until her task was finished. Then she’d lay the rugs the movers had rolled up and stashed in the downstairs hallway. And the farmhouse would become a lovely home for her children. But even paint and better furniture couldn’t cancel the past. The room around her was filled with bygone angst. There were unhappy memories here, as well. Going hungry too many nights because her father had no handyman jobs or hadn’t been paid. Her mother, Estelle, didn’t work outside the home. At night she’d listen, trembling, in her cold bed to her parents arguing over money. Then years later, her father had lived here alone, broken-hearted and fragile, after her mother had escaped to a barren apartment in town so she could drink herself to death in peace. Only, in the end, she hadn’t died of alcohol. No, she hadn’t. She’d been taken by vampires. Jenny hung her head, shook away the clinging memories. All houses had ghosts of one kind or another. Right now it was more of a concern to her that the wiring and plumbing weren’t up to code and probably unsafe. Ghosts she could handle. Broken pipes and house fires she couldn’t. Sarah was snoozing in the chair and Jenny tried to wake her. She couldn’t. When the child was asleep not much could rouse her. Jenny marveled at how light the girl seemed in her arms as she carried her up the stairs. In the doorway to Teddy’s room, she stood, holding her child. “Joey, is Sarah’s bed ready?” “Yep.” Her brother stepped away from the bed. “Got both kid’s beds together. Now we’ll go work on yours.” He took Sarah from her arms and laid her on Teddy’s mattress. “She’ll be okay here while you make up her bed in the other room.” “Good idea. Why didn’t I think of that?” she said with a touch of sarcasm. “There’s fresh coffee downstairs if either one of you want some. I left cups and sugar on the counter. Creamer’s in the fridge.” She moved into the other room. Gathering the sheet and covers, she made Sarah’s bed, and fetched her. Andy insisted on carrying the girl from Teddy’s room and laid her on her bed. Jenny tucked the child beneath the covers. Sarah hadn’t quivered an eyelid. “She’s really out of it, isn’t she?” Andy spoke softly. “Well, she’s had a hard day in a really hard month.” Jenny stepped away so she wasn’t in close proximity to him. After feeling Sarah in her arms, her flesh soft against hers, she had little tolerance left for being close to anyone else. “You’ve all had a hard time.” Andy looked at her in the pale light from the hallway. She’d switched the dresser’s lamp off once Sarah was under the blankets. “I didn’t say anything yesterday, but I heard about your husband. I’m so sorry for your loss.” “Thank you.” She had no tears left to shed, even if she could have. She waited for the inevitable conclusion to his pity. Ah, here it was. “And if there’s anything I can do to help you or the kids, don’t hesitate to ask.” He must have heard her choked breath because he gently touched her arm. “Jenny, I know how you’re feeling. I do. I lost my wife four years ago in a car accident. I know words won’t change a thing. They don’t ease the sorrow. Stop the pain. Only time will.” His smile was hesitant, poignantly sad. He was still hurting. She could see it. “Then I’m sorry for your loss. You have any children?” “No. Oh, we wanted some. God just never saw fit to grant us our wish.” “I’m sorry for that as well.” She fell silent and the moment was over. She found herself staring at his neck and had to drag her eyes, her body, away. Get a grip. “Excuse me, I need to get Teddy’s bed ready. He’s outside playing but I bet here real soon he’ll want his bed, too.” “I know,” Andy finished for her, “it’s been a hard day.” For the first time, a small smile crept out. “Yes, it has. But we accomplished a lot. We’re moved in. Thanks to the help of family and friends. Thank you, Andy.” “You’re welcome. I’m glad you think of me as a friend. I realize back in the day I was your brother’s friend, and you and I weren’t close, but I hope now you consider me one of yours.” “I will.” “You know,” he kept talking, trailing her to the room Joey had just left. “I did know Jeff, your husband.” Surprised, she swung around and met his eyes. Well, Jeff had been born and raised in Summer Haven after all. Many people knew him. “You did?” “Oh, he was a year ahead of me in school but we played together in the school band for two years and we were sort of friends. He used to call me his little brother because I tagged along after him so much. It’s how I first met Joey actually, once you and Jeff started dating all those years ago, through Jeff. We grew apart, out of touch, when Jeff left town the first time, though. When he returned the second time he wasn’t here long enough for us to renew that friendship. But I never forgot him.” “You and my husband were really friends, huh?” “Yeah, really. I have fond memories of our high school years. He was a good guy. The best. He could make me laugh when no one else could. You know? With those tasteless but endearing jokes of his?” Jenny didn’t know what to say. Just thinking of her husband sent a splinter through her heart. She would have given anything to have him there to talk over what was happening to her. Anything. Joey called him from the other room. “Hey, Andy, come and help me with Jenny’s bed, would you?” “I’m on my way, buddy.” He disappeared into her room and Jenny made up her son’s bed, the whole time fighting the compulsion to scramble out the window and down the branches of the oak tree and flee into the night. To find food. To feed. Not yet. Soon. When everyone left and she was alone. The children sleeping. Soon. Not soon enough. A half hour later her company hadn’t left. She couldn’t be rude to someone who’d helped her and had to suffer through the socializing. The three of them sat in the kitchen having coffee, Joey and Andy having leftover pie, and chatting about how the town had changed. Teddy, finally worn out from the day, slept upstairs in his room. Deep night had fallen outside. Jenny kept her eyes off the windows; fearful the siren call of the night would bewitch and drag her from the light. She drummed her fingers on the table, pushed down the intense thirst and beneath the droning of conversation she kept telling herself to wait. Soon. Soon. Joey and Andy wouldn’t stay forever. And the night would still be out there. She was terrified at the changes she’d been experiencing in her body and her mind. Her physical strength was growing, her senses were more acute and her thought patterns, her very way of viewing the world, were changing. She couldn’t stop them and, though she didn’t want to admit it, she liked them and that upset her, too. Before the attack under the viaduct she would have only seen the evil side of what she was morphing into…but now she saw her evolving in endless shades of gray. Funny how, in the end, raw survival took over. Somewhere along the way she’d ceased thinking of herself as a monster. Now she was just a widow, mother of two children who really needed her, who had to find a way to manage something horrible that had happened to her. Sort of like a handicap. Like paralysis, missing limbs or a scarred body. Didn’t people adapt and learn to live with them all the time? They did. It hadn’t been her fault. She hadn’t asked for it. Now all she wanted was to live and shield those she loved because they might need her to do so. Yet self-control was the first issue she had to address. If she couldn’t keep from draining her loved ones of all their blood then she was in big trouble. She focused on the discussion they were having. It took a lot of focus. “Yeah, Summer Haven isn’t the same town you vacated a decade ago,” Andy was saying and she concentrated to understand his words. “This bad economy has thinned the business base around here, particularly downtown. Did you see how many shops and businesses were closed up, shuttered and empty?” A plate in front of him held a remnant of pumpkin pie, his second piece. He’d had three cups of coffee and she had no doubt he’d be having a fourth. He was hungry. Like her. She felt bad she didn’t have something else to give the guy besides leftover pie. A sandwich or something. But her refrigerator was empty until she went shopping. There she was…thinking like a puny caregiving human. Ech. Old habits were hard to break. “Nah, I guess I was too busy soaking in the nostalgia.” And worrying about what the hell was happening to her. “It’s that bad?” She tried not to stare at the vein throbbing in his temple. She licked her lips. “Well, at least half the shops lining Main Street have shut their doors in the last two years. Not to mention the residential foreclosures and job losses.

Once we added on there was this cubby space in the rear we at first used for extra storage. Walk-in closet size. Now it has a bed and a few things squeezed in. At least she has a place to sleep and keep her belongings. Until things get better for her anyway. She’s been saving her money.” “You have a good heart, Brother.” “I try. There’s so much sorrow in the world. I do what I can.” He stood up, stretched; and sent a nod towards Andy, who was stuffing the last piece of pie into his mouth. “I think it’s time for us to go, buddy.

Your furniture dresses up the old place mucho. You have excellent taste.” “Wait until I get the walls painted and add the final decorating touches. It won’t look like the same house.” “Heck, it doesn’t look like the same house now. After you’re done I won’t recognize it.

She wanted to help move him along but held herself in check. “I honestly didn’t know what to do with it for the longest time and then I started the renovations on the diner and kind of forgot about it.” “At least you remembered to pay the yearly taxes. I have to thank you for that. Otherwise I’d be homeless now because I can’t afford squat.” “You’re welcome.” Her brother came over and hugged her. His flesh was so warm. His skin so thin. So breakable. She could hear his heart beating loudly in his chest. Cymbals clanging to a mystifying symphony. “I always knew I’d need this old house somewhere down the road. For you or someone. Had a premonition. Almost let Lizzie move in last year but she didn’t want the hassle of caring for a house and she didn’t have a car anyway to get back and forth to work. She walks everywhere so she needed to stay in town.” “I’m happy to have it.” Her eyes went to Andy as he got up from his chair. “Again, thanks for your help yesterday and today, Andy.” “You’re more than welcome. Remember if you need anything–” “I know, call you. But ask my brother, I can take care of myself.” “That she can.” Joey nodded. “See ya later, Sis. I’ll call tomorrow to see how you’re doing. Phone me if you need me before that, okay?” She gave her brother a mock salute. “I will. Now goodnight both of you.” The two men trudged out the door. Their feet crunched in the gravel. Joey’s truck revved up and drove away. Free at last. Shutting her eyes, she lingered at the door and listened to the night animals beyond the glass. They were frolicking out there in the autumn murkiness among the crispy leaves and cool dirt covered ground. Little creatures, with nocturne eyes and speedy feet, full of hot blood. The mother in her fretted over leaving her children alone in the house but the hunger overpowered the mother and she snuck outside into the darkness. She told herself they’d be fine. She’d be back shortly. That she should reward herself for her self-restraint all day. She hadn’t attacked one living person. Hadn’t gone crazy or hung from the rafters by her feet. She’d done well. She told herself that killing innocent little animals wasn’t all that creepy, wasn’t all that bad, considering the alternative. It didn’t work. She loved animals and hated having to kill them at all for any reason. Or had. But, she had to keep reminding herself, animals died every minute of the day to fill humans’ stomachs. Right? Was what she did any worse than that? All she wanted was their blood. It was her food. She felt guilty only until she captured the large fox, humanely snapped its neck to drink the blood (which tasted better than anything she’d ever drank or eaten) and then was too exhilarated to think of anything but further feeding her hunger; not even that she could run faster than she ever had, could see like an owl through the darkness, smell her prey miles away and that her teeth were changing. When she stuck her finger into her mouth she could feel the points. Oh, great. Little fangs. Oh, Lord, could this get any weirder? She thought about those horror movies she’d seen over the years where some unlucky human had been bitten and was slowly turning into god-knows-what and couldn’t believe or accept it. Was in shock. Now she knew exactly how they’d felt. Though, in the end, she did feel regret for killing the poor fox and the one the night before. But, yes, it was better than feeding off homo sapiens. Damn straight it was. After ingesting the blood she felt as if there was nothing she couldn’t deal with. No problem she couldn’t solve, no disaster she couldn’t avert. She was superwoman. This wasn’t so bad, was it? It’d occurred to her perhaps if a good person became a vampire that might be the key. Good person equals good vampire? Bad person equals bad vampire? She could only pray that was the case. Oh, it could be worse. She could lust after human blood and not be able to resist. Now that would be a deal breaker. She absorbed the night poised beside a towering tree, its limbs shifting in the wind; inhaled the dizzying perfumes of the forest. Her lips on the verge of smiling. She felt better than she had since she’d come out of the coma weeks ago. Her new world revolved around her in slow motion. The night birds cooed in their nests. The air danced among the dying leaves. Insects skittered between limbs and under bushes. On the breeze there were aromatic wisps of brewing coffee and chocolate (cake she thought), fresh baking bread and as always now, blood. Animal blood in the small bustling creatures hiding out all around her and in the distance the cloying scent of human blood. Her children asleep in their beds. Amazing. God, the night was beautiful. That’s when she saw the pale figure hiding between the trees to her left. A tall man dressed in drab clothes watched her. She merged deeper into the woods among the thicker underbrush but when she looked back, he was still on the fringe observing. Waves of uneasiness rippled through her and the vertigo was unbalancing. This man stalking her wasn’t her friend. This man was dangerous. If he was a man. She ran all the way home at a speed she never would have imagined a human capable of. More like flying really. Her feet barely touched the ground, her night eyes so keen she never once collided with a tree or stumbled over a rock. Within seconds she was inside the farmhouse peeking out the windows; the mysterious stranger nowhere in sight. Thank God. Had she really seen him? Or had it been a trick of her imagination, her eyes seeing strange things in the darkness? Maybe it’d been a pale hued limb split and broken besides a darker trunk? Since the attack she was paranoid, that’s all. Seeing things that weren’t there. Minutes later she’d nearly forgotten the man and the gut-wrenching fear. She continued cleaning and rearranging furniture, no longer tired. She worked through the night and didn’t look out the windows again. By morning she’d forgotten the man in the woods. Almost. There was so much to do before the children woke.",

Well, we don’t have anything really. How are we going to eat breakfast?” “Pop Tarts. There’s a box in the cabinet above you. Strawberry iced. You like strawberry. Water to drink.” A twinge of guilt bit her. What kind of a mother was she…no food in the house, no milk? Terrible. But she’d had other things on her mind. “Positively, we’ll go to the store today. First thing.” “We haven’t unpacked the toaster yet.” Sarah pointed out. “I’ll find it.” Teddy volunteered. “It’ll be in a box marked kitchen appliances, right?” “It should be.” Jenny was wiping down the doors of the cabinets with furniture polish, erasing a thin film of grime that covered everything. An empty house collected a lot of dusty gunk. Outside the sun was hiding behind clouds. Rain was coming. She could smell it as she could smell the blood in the animals frolicking in the forest behind the house. Rabbits. The kids had been up for fifteen minutes and were in their pajamas. Tired from the move, they’d slept late. Jenny had never gone to bed. Too much to do. She looked at her daughter. “Soon as you eat and get dressed we’ll go shopping. You’re right, we need food. Supplies.” “Can I come, too?” Teddy shouted from the other room where he was rummaging around in the boxes. “Of course. You’re the man of the house. You can load up and bring the groceries in.” “Thanks. I always wanted to be a pack mule,” he shouted back. “And you’d make a fine one, too.” Jenny snickered. “With those big strong shoulders of yours.” “Mom,” her son’s voice irritated as only a pre-teen’s could be. “Please.” When he put the toaster on the counter she gave him a hug. He was getting so tall. Every day he reminded her more and more of his father. An uncannily smart kid. Hard working and dependable. “Thanks for finding the toaster, son.” “Wasn’t hard. You wrote on the side of the boxes what was inside each one. Makes it pretty easy–if you can read that scribble of yours. Mom, you got to write clearer.” “I’ll remember that next time we move.” She’d forgotten she’d listed the items on each box. Just another thing she’d forgotten. She wondered what was happening to her memory then that thought, too, escaped from her mind. She couldn’t hold on to them anymore. Sarah was beside her, tugging at her hand. “I like my room. It’s not real big, but that’s okay. It won’t take too long to paint. I won’t have as much to keep clean, either. Can I get new curtains today for the windows? Black ones to keep out the light, just like a vampire would want, and a purple rug to put on the floor? Oh, maybe black paint for the walls, too?” Jenny’s breath caught in her throat. “Black curtains and paint? Why would you want that?” “It’s the Twilight influence,” Teddy sing-songed, rolling his eyes. “You know, vampires, like in the books? They like the dark, and black and purple are their colors.” “Oh.” Jenny gazed at her daughter, inwardly relieved. “Sarah, sorry, no black curtains. No black walls. I draw the line at that. Black walls would make that room look like a mouse’s closet. Pick lighter colors please.” “Mom.” “No argument on this, Sarah. You’ll thank me later.” When she grows out of this Twilight stage and into the next. “Fat chance,” her daughter grumbled sarcastically under her breath but when she saw the warning look Jenny sent her, she shut up. A sulky expression covered her face instead. A minute later the girl’s moodiness was gone. “Can I still have new curtains and stuff?” Sarah wanted to make the room her daughter’s, make it pretty. A new start deserved a new room. Paint, curtains and a rug couldn’t cost that much, could they? She’d try not to let her money worries spoil their shopping expedition. They’d check out the Dollar Store next to Joey’s Diner. It’d be their third stop after the grocery and the paint store. Though she didn’t relish going in there; treading on the hallowed ground where once the old theater had stood. She didn’t want to wake up the ghosts. But a bargain was a bargain and right now money was tight. “Sure, honey. We’ll get paint for the rooms today. It’ll be our first project.” Her eyes traveled around the dingy kitchen. “How about yellow for the kitchen and warm beige for the living room?” “I like yellow.” Sarah was putting Pop Tarts in the toaster Teddy had plugged in. She watched them eat Pop Tarts, still feeling bad for not providing a more wholesome breakfast, and paid attention as they talked about the house, their rooms, what they wanted for lunch and supper. If they were going to like living in Summer Haven. If there’d be any cool kids in such a hick town. If there was a mall close by. For a few moments, bathed in the normalcy of her children’s lives she nearly forgot the abnormality of hers. “Don’t you want one?” Sarah offered her a warm Pop Tart wrapped in a napkin. “No thanks. I’m not hungry. I’ll have one later. Right now you two go get showers, get dressed and we’ll drive into town. We have a full day ahead of us.” “I’m first in the bathroom,” Sarah called. “You got it. There’re clean towels, wash cloths and soap in there for you.” “Thanks, Mom.” “Teddy you’re next.” “Only one bathroom in this place, jeez,” Teddy bemoaned. “How did you and Uncle Joey stand it?” “We had no choice. This is an old house built by your great grandfather, Jeremiah Lacey. Conveniences like more than one bathroom were luxuries in those days. Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it. We all will.” Their last house had had two full and one three-quarter bathrooms. One bathroom would take some getting used to. After breakfast they rushed off to do as she’d asked. They were good kids and rarely gave her trouble. Well, not real trouble anyway. Jeff had had a hand in that. He’d been a loving but firm father; he’d taught them to be independent and resourceful. And they’d both taught them right from wrong. Now what would she be able to teach them? Their journey into town and their visit to the Summer Haven Town Market was a trip down memory lane. Nothing had changed much. Oh, the market was modernized in many ways, rearranged and brightened up more than when she’d run around it as a child stealing pieces of chocolate from cellophane bags when no one was looking. Even now, after all these years, she felt bad about that. Stealing candy. She and Joey made their own spending money when they’d gotten older but when they’d been small and hungry there’d been times they’d snatched things to eat from stores. Stray pieces of fruit. Cupcakes. Candy. They’d both had a sweet tooth. Oh well, that was then and this was now. Her childhood was long behind her and her stealing phase was part of that. Over the years she’d made amends for those petty sins by being kind and giving to others. Lately, after all that had happened to her, she wondered if it’d been enough. She was being punished for something. When in the store she’d looked for Oscar but didn’t see him. At the checkout she’d asked and was told he worked the evening shift that day and wouldn’t be in until three. She’d have to catch him another time. Outside it was overcast, a solid murky sky, but she found she still needed a hat and sunglasses. Light hurt her eyes, though now she understood why. The outing went well. The grocery store had everything she needed and at fair prices. There was a modest hardware store down the road where she got the paint and supplies at sale prices and stayed within her budget. She made a brief stop at the library, and leaving the kids in the car so they wouldn’t see the books she was checking out, she walked in and on a temporary library card took out three scholarly looking books on vampires. She could Google the subject on the Internet but a creature of old habits she figured a hardcopy backup couldn’t hurt. Besides she didn’t have the Internet yet. Another thing to put on her list of to do’s. There was one last place to shop and she dreaded it. The Dollar General that stood where the Grand Theater once had; where she and Jeff had destroyed the vampire family who’d been culling the town’s people–and burned it to the ground. She parked in front of the dollar store as far away from Joey’s Diner as she could get, hoping he wouldn’t see her car. No such luck. Her hawk-eyed brother saw her and the kids through the diner’s window and waved. She motioned she was going next door and kept walking. “Can we go in for something to eat first before we go to the Dollar Store?” Sarah begged. “Since breakfast was so skimpy.” Her black sweatshirt brought out the gold in her brown eyes and blond hair. Jenny had braided it and the braid hung halfway down her daughter’s back. The girl had grown inches since spring. People thought she was at least ten years old because of how tall she was. “I second that.” Teddy was halfway to the diner. “I’m starving, too. That Pop Tart didn’t do the trick for me. I’m a growing boy.” “You know,” Sarah ended in a timorous voice, “Uncle Joey will give us free food.” Jenny felt a tug to her heart. Her children’s sensitivity to their financial situation was touching. For their sake she kept her tone light. “All righty, food first. We’ll go in and play the family card. Joey can’t resist starving people any way. He’ll feed us. Free we can afford.” And they did. Joey filled their bellies and their ears with town gossip as he filled her cup with coffee. “Police Chief Donald was in early this morning for breakfast. You remember Rusty Donald, don’t you? Little fat kid who used to invite us to his house to swim in his gigantic swimming pool and lorded it over us like a tyrant?” “I remember him. Vaguely.” Another rich kid from their poor youth. There’d been many. However, she remembered him differently than her brother. Rusty had been a little over bearing but she’d seen through his lack of self-confidence to the lonely child beneath. Joey had made fun of him but she’d liked him. They’d become friends, sort of, in her junior and senior year. They were both honor roll and loved to read. Unlike what Joey believed, Rusty had been highly intelligent, merely socially backward. Then. “He still as fat?” “Naw, he’s tall and slim now. A couple years ago he found out he had a minor heart problem and dropped about a hundred pounds. Though he was a pain in the butt as a kid he’s turned into a mighty fine law officer, educated, professional and thorough–and a good friend. “Anyway, Rusty told me Nellie and Sammy Jameson have up and gone missing. Their kids called up worried saying they had Sunday dinner with their folks every week at their house but when they went out there day before yesterday the old couple were nowhere to be seen. Not a trace. No dinner. Nothing. “No sign, in fact, they’d been there since the night before. Dirty plates were found in the sink from a late night snack and that was about it. And the car, their keys and cell phones, Nellie’s purse, were still there.” Jenny didn’t recall the Jamesons but the knowledge they were missing bothered her. Déjà vu. Missing people. That’s how the vampire trouble began all those years ago. “That’s mysterious. I don’t know them but I hope they find them soon.” “Me, too. The town is getting spooked, more so since Graham Lintoner, a night guard at the vacant stove factory, was attacked last night. The rumor is by some animal or something. He was bitten up pretty bad. He’s only alive because he was able to get to his gun, shoot, and hit, he says, whatever tackled him. It got away. But he’s in the hospital.” “That’s horrible.” Her thoughts weren’t on the wounded security guard, it was on what she feared might have done the wounding. Animal, her butt. Ha. Was it her? Did she steal out in the night and do these horrible things unaware she was doing them? Was she truly as in control as she believed or was she in reality a feral bloodsucker now, too? Was she fooling herself? For a second an image of a ghostly man hiding behind night trees flashed in her mind but when she attempted to capture it, it melted away, a snowflake in her fingers, leaving behind only a nagging guilt that somehow she was to blame. She couldn’t shake it. Sarah then toppled off one of the barstools she was spinning on and attending to her swept everything else from Jenny’s mind. A small bump and hurt pride was the result. Teddy teased his sister until she forgot about both of them as Laurie brought out ice for it. Afterwards Jenny hurried the kids through lunch. “We have a lot left to do today, rooms to paint and rugs to put down, and we should get going. So eat up kiddos. Chop, chop.” This time to avoid her brother’s prying she ate a part of her lunch but later, in the restroom threw it up. Her ploy worked. No one suspected what she’d done. The hunger had returned and was torturing her. Everywhere she looked she smelled and saw walking bags of blood. Her stomach began to ache. Her reason to skew. Every bone in her body began to melt, or at least it felt that way. In the Dollar General they quickly picked up the remainder of the items they needed. Jenny wasn’t sure how much longer she could last. The whole time she was jumpy knowing what had once stood there and had happened there when it’d been the movie theater. Terror and pain clung to the site in the form of misty phantoms. Remnants of the tormented humans that had been kept in basement cages and of the torture, psychological and physical, and the ultimate deaths of the vampires’ victims. They were beneath the bricks and wood of the new store. Screaming at her. And because of her condition she was more attuned to it than most people would have been. Well that and because she and Jeff had been responsible for the freeing of those souls. She couldn’t stand being there. She hurried her kids through the store and drove home as if something awful was following her. In a way it was. The past. Returning to Summer Haven had revived the memories time had diluted and hidden deep in her psyche. Now the ghosts were closer and their voices louder. For the first time she questioned if returning had been a smart move. Too late now, she thought, as she drove up to the farmhouse. For better or worse, this was where they were and this was where they had to stay. If there were…problems…she’d have to deal with them as best she could. It was her children she was anxious for. Because this time she had so much more to lose. As they entered the house the rain began, changing the afternoon into a premature evening. It sang through the air above them and left spots on the house’s old wooden siding. When the door closed, she could hear it slapping against the outside walls. For as long as she could recall rain had soothed her. The music, the fragrance of it, above all at night when it filled the world and made her feel snug behind the strong walls of home. Tonight the rain just made her restless. It was outside. Not locked in as she was. She had a longing to escape and race the raindrops, but she had things to do. She had children to take care of. There were endless chores. The basic pieces of furniture were in place but there was so much more to do. Painting came first. Of all the things that could instantly beautify a home, that was at the top of the list. They painted the living room first. Her plan was to do one room a day. It shouldn’t be hard. She’d been the resident painter in the family since she’d been a child. If something needed to be painted, she did it. It was one of the reasons she’d teamed up with her father years ago to paint houses. Painting, like writing, was in her blood. Sarah was like her. Good with the paintbrush. Neat. Precise. She loved to paint and draw, she was really good at it, and it didn’t matter how big the canvas was. Putting color on anything made her happy. She hummed a string of songs from the Twilight soundtrack as she worked. The girl wanted to become a singer or an artist one day. She had that creative soul. Poor thing. Teddy not so much. He picked up the roller and being nearly as tall as Jenny he was given the job of the higher places. He did it with a grimace on his lips and a grouchy look on his face, but he did it. She’d bribed him. His room would be painted next. He’d wanted an electric purple with neon orange stripes but she talked him into a medium blue splattered with white stars on the ceiling instead. “You like astronomy, so wouldn’t that be neat? A room of stars? I’ll cut out a star stencil and that’ll make it easy.” Anything would be better than a room striped like a toy racing car. Purple and orange, ugh. “I guess.” He mumbled something under his breath he thought she couldn’t hear but she did. “Yeah, I liked staring at the damn stars when I was like five. Jeez.” “Teddy!” she admonished. “Watch your language.” His stare tipped her off he couldn’t believe she’d heard what he’d said. He mouthed something else, no voice, just mouth, which she could still hear. She ignored it. Shaking her head, she kept pushing the brush around the trim on the door. Using all her self-control she kept the hunger at bay. Seven more hours. Six more. Five. She silently counted down the time before the children went to bed and she could venture out into the rainy night to find what she needed. What she had to have. “The room looks so good, Momma,” Sarah gushed after they’d finished the first coat. It was after seven and the wet afternoon had evolved into a wet evening. “It makes the room look brand new. I like it.” The girl was sitting on the couch, her legs motionless for once because she was worn out. There were paint splotches on her cheeks, hands and old clothes she’d put on when they’d returned from shopping. Teddy’s painting outfit had no splotches on them. Not a one. “Yeah, it looks good. Real good. I’m proud of us. “Now what’s for supper?” Supper. The thought of food made her want to gag. “I stuck frozen lasagna in the oven forty-five minutes ago. It’ll be ready to eat about the time you two are clean and changed.” She didn’t have to tell them twice. While they were washing up she made their salads and popped rolls in beside the lasagna. She was surprised the ancient stove still worked. The food was on the table by the time Sarah and Teddy wandered into the kitchen with droopy shoulders and sleepy eyes. The day had worn them out. They ate in weary silence, the rain as a backdrop. Jenny pushed her lasagna around on the plate but didn’t eat much. That happened when she was too tired. Usually before they’d go to bed they’d watch television or play on the computer (which hadn’t been set up and connected yet) but that night by the time their stomachs were full they kissed her goodnight and drug themselves to bed without a peep of dissent. Fine with her. She waited for fifteen minutes and tiptoed up to their rooms to check them. Both were sleeping. Good. She bolted into the evening drizzle. No raincoat. Nothing on her head. Just her in her old jeans and T-Shirt and the cool night. Her skin had changed. It was whiter. Firmer. The chilly wind and raindrops didn’t affect her. She wasn’t cold. She wasn’t anything. Earlier, while she’d been prying a lid off a paint can, she’d gouged her hand, but it hadn’t bled and the cut healed before her eyes. She hid it from the kids. She was learning that being different had beneficial side effects. Were they enough to outweigh the unpleasant realities of being what she’d become? She’d probably find that out sooner or later. By the time she’d gotten to the place where her trailer had once stood the light rain had changed into a downpour and lightning was slashing through the night behind the ebony silhouetted trees. Thunder boomed above her head. She didn’t care. She was one with the night and her new abilities alerted her nourishment was near. She could smell it. Hear it. As she stood there, the raindrops cascading off her face and down her body, she saw it. A deer was making its way painfully through the tangled underbrush. It was old and sick. She sensed soon it would die. She didn’t hesitate but came up behind the creature and took its life, drank its blood. She thought the bigger the animal she drank from the longer it’d stave off her hunger. It seemed to make sense. If she didn’t want to end up feeding on her children. She thought someone was following her long before they made their move. She wasn’t afraid. Her strength had grown and she no longer felt so vulnerable. Fast as the wind, she believed she could outrun them. Or hide from them by climbing a tree. A bolt of lightning hit the ground not far away, shuddering the earth and blinding her. When the earth stopped shaking and her eyesight returned she was looking into the face of a man. But a strange man. He was so tall, freakishly taller than her, dressed in somber clothes that merged into the blackness; with long silverish hair, a sharp predatory face and unsmiling lips. Then she remembered. The other night. The other man she’d seen from a distance. She wasn’t sure it was the same one but she believed he was. She could have run, but emboldened by her new strengths, she stood her ground. “Who are you and what do you want from me?” She glared at him through the heavy rain. He didn’t move. “I’m Zebulon. Servant to our leader. He’s sent me to fetch you.” The man had a heavy accent, yet she couldn’t place it. European perhaps. “Fetch me?” What was she, some prey to be bagged; a trophy to be gathered? His smile struck her as sinister. “No trophy, Jenny. One of us and we’ve come to collect you.” The fear was strong and bitter in her mouth. Heart stopping. My children. “What if I don’t want to come? I don’t know you or this…leader of yours.” Her voice cracked as she said the name. Her mind was seeking a way for her to escape, as she sensed great danger from this stranger. “You haven’t got a choice. He’s sent for you and you must come, leave this human world you know behind. Forever. You’re not one of them anymore. You know that. You’re one of us. Come. Now! Or you’ll make our leader angry and you wouldn’t want to see him angry, believe me.” The curve of his lips was another threat. He’d somehow drawn closer without her seeing it. No more than five feet away. His eyes glittered through the rainfall as a sky of lightning erupted behind him. He put his hand out and she was filled with the almost overpowering urge to give him hers. Go with him. Do anything and everything he asked of her. No! She rocked her head back and forth. She couldn’t leave her children. Joey. The farmhouse that was becoming her home. “I don’t know you and I sure as hell don’t know this leader of yours. Leave me alone. Tell him I’m sorry, I decline the offer.” She didn’t dare speak of her children alone in the farmhouse or even think of them. The man, or whatever he was, might be able to read her mind. She felt the stranger’s rage more than saw it and what came next happened so swiftly later she’d wonder if it had happened at all. He was on her, his arms, a vice, around her and all she could do was scream. Kick. Fight. She broke his hold and shoved away from him. She got away. As she fled through the rain she heard him behind her, bellowing, an angry devil deprived of his quarry, but he couldn’t catch her. She was too fast. Her feet flew over the wet ground as she wove through the trees. Please God, let her get home safely! Even before she finished the silent prayer she found herself, clothes dripping water in a puddle on the old linoleum floor, standing in her kitchen. Just like that. “Whoa,” she rasped, doubling over. “How did I get here so fast? I don’t remember getting here. Coming inside.” Trembling, she staggered to the window and, hiding against the wall, looked out; scared the man had pursued her home and was even now ready to break in the door to take her away. Or to hurt her children. But there was no one out there. The rain was a solid curtain of water, lightning ripped the sky and thunder shook the world, but she was safe. She didn’t know how she knew that but she did. He couldn’t follow her inside. Not into her home, unless she invited him in. Which she’d never do. Shivering, she slumped against the wall and lowered her wet face into her hands. If she’d been able, she would have cried. She couldn’t. She could only feel panic. She didn’t know who this Zebulon or his leader was, although she had her suspicions. Vampires. For some reason they wanted her. And she and her family were in danger. She checked on her children, relieved to see they were sleeping peacefully in their beds. Nothing had hurt them. No one had stolen them away. She kept an eye on the windows for a long time. Alert to every night sound and whisper. Only silence, except for the rain and wind. No one came. The rain slowed, the sky’s fireworks blustered away to annoy another town and when nothing else happened she switched on a nightlight in the bathroom and took a two-minute shower. As the night wore on she opened the library books, the ones on vampires, and began to pour through them at the kitchen table. Guarding her home and her children. Trying to find answers she was afraid she wasn’t going to find. Normal people didn’t believe in vampires and normal people wrote those books. By the time she was done she knew no more than she had when she’d begun. She probably knew more than the authors…because, unlike them, she knew vampires existed. They were real creatures. Use wooden stakes of Aspen to kill the things. Cut off their evil heads. Burn them to ashes. Bah! Nothing she didn’t already know. Nothing she thought would help her in her situation…because, deep inside, she feared they weren’t normal vampires. She didn’t know how she knew this, but she did. She suddenly had acquired an eleventh sense. A vampire sense. Most people didn’t know that humans actually had ten senses. She’d read that somewhere. That the sense of touch involved four different sets of nerves, the skin senses and were considered four separate ones. Heat. Cold. Pressure. Pain. Motion (kinesthetic sense). Balance (vestibular sense). So there were ten. But now she had eleven. She’d have to find help somewhere else. Where? From whom? She would have done anything to have been able to ask Jeff for help. He’d been good at solving mysteries, formulating a plan. Fixing the problem. He would have known what to do. Because she didn’t. When she had the Internet up and going she could look for answers there. In her bed, at first, she didn’t sleep. She was too afraid. Then finally oblivion came. Filling her stomach with blood, fleeing through the black woods, and waiting for the intruder to come, had exhausted her.",

      "content": "Chapter 5 Jenny “Mom, we got to go to the grocery store today for sure.” Sarah stared into the refrigerator, her hand holding the door open. “We don’t have no milk. Well, we don’t have anything really. How are we going to eat breakfast?” “Pop Tarts. There’s a box in the cabinet above you. Strawberry iced. You like strawberry. Water to drink.” A twinge of guilt bit her. What kind of a mother was she…no food in the house, no milk? Terrible. But she’d had other things on her mind. “Positively, we’ll go to the store today. First thing.” “We haven’t unpacked the toaster yet.” Sarah pointed out. “I’ll find it.” Teddy volunteered. “It’ll be in a box marked kitchen appliances, right?” “It should be.” Jenny was wiping down the doors of the cabinets with furniture polish, erasing a thin film of grime that covered everything. An empty house collected a lot of dusty gunk. Outside the sun was hiding behind clouds. Rain was coming. She could smell it as she could smell the blood in the animals frolicking in the forest behind the house. Rabbits. The kids had been up for fifteen minutes and were in their pajamas. Tired from the move, they’d slept late. Jenny had never gone to bed. Too much to do. She looked at her daughter. “Soon as you eat and get dressed we’ll go shopping. You’re right, we need food. Supplies.” “Can I come, too?” Teddy shouted from the other room where he was rummaging around in the boxes. “Of course. You’re the man of the house. You can load up and bring the groceries in.” “Thanks. I always wanted to be a pack mule,” he shouted back. “And you’d make a fine one, too.” Jenny snickered. “With those big strong shoulders of yours.” “Mom,” her son’s voice irritated as only a pre-teen’s could be. “Please.” When he put the toaster on the counter she gave him a hug. He was getting so tall. Every day he reminded her more and more of his father. An uncannily smart kid. Hard working and dependable. “Thanks for finding the toaster, son.” “Wasn’t hard. You wrote on the side of the boxes what was inside each one. Makes it pretty easy–if you can read that scribble of yours. Mom, you got to write clearer.” “I’ll remember that next time we move.” She’d forgotten she’d listed the items on each box. Just another thing she’d forgotten. She wondered what was happening to her memory then that thought, too, escaped from her mind. She couldn’t hold on to them anymore. Sarah was beside her, tugging at her hand. “I like my room. It’s not real big, but that’s okay. It won’t take too long to paint. I won’t have as much to keep clean, either. Can I get new curtains today for the windows? Black ones to keep out the light, just like a vampire would want, and a purple rug to put on the floor? Oh, maybe black paint for the walls, too?” Jenny’s breath caught in her throat. “Black curtains and paint? Why would you want that?” “It’s the Twilight influence,” Teddy sing-songed, rolling his eyes. “You know, vampires, like in the books? They like the dark, and black and purple are their colors.” “Oh.” Jenny gazed at her daughter, inwardly relieved. “Sarah, sorry, no black curtains. No black walls. I draw the line at that. Black walls would make that room look like a mouse’s closet. Pick lighter colors please.” “Mom.” “No argument on this, Sarah. You’ll thank me later.” When she grows out of this Twilight stage and into the next. “Fat chance,” her daughter grumbled sarcastically under her breath but when she saw the warning look Jenny sent her, she shut up. A sulky expression covered her face instead. A minute later the girl’s moodiness was gone. “Can I still have new curtains and stuff?” Sarah wanted to make the room her daughter’s, make it pretty. A new start deserved a new room. Paint, curtains and a rug couldn’t cost that much, could they? She’d try not to let her money worries spoil their shopping expedition. They’d check out the Dollar Store next to Joey’s Diner. It’d be their third stop after the grocery and the paint store. Though she didn’t relish going in there; treading on the hallowed ground where once the old theater had stood. She didn’t want to wake up the ghosts. But a bargain was a bargain and right now money was tight. “Sure, honey. We’ll get paint for the rooms today. It’ll be our first project.” Her eyes traveled around the dingy kitchen. “How about yellow for the kitchen and warm beige for the living room?” “I like yellow.” Sarah was putting Pop Tarts in the toaster Teddy had plugged in. She watched them eat Pop Tarts, still feeling bad for not providing a more wholesome breakfast, and paid attention as they talked about the house, their rooms, what they wanted for lunch and supper. If they were going to like living in Summer Haven. If there’d be any cool kids in such a hick town. If there was a mall close by. For a few moments, bathed in the normalcy of her children’s lives she nearly forgot the abnormality of hers. “Don’t you want one?” Sarah offered her a warm Pop Tart wrapped in a napkin. “No thanks. I’m not hungry. I’ll have one later. Right now you two go get showers, get dressed and we’ll drive into town. We have a full day ahead of us.” “I’m first in the bathroom,” Sarah called. “You got it. There’re clean towels, wash cloths and soap in there for you.” “Thanks, Mom.” “Teddy you’re next.” “Only one bathroom in this place, jeez,” Teddy bemoaned. “How did you and Uncle Joey stand it?” “We had no choice. This is an old house built by your great grandfather, Jeremiah Lacey. Conveniences like more than one bathroom were luxuries in those days. Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it. We all will.” Their last house had had two full and one three-quarter bathrooms. One bathroom would take some getting used to. After breakfast they rushed off to do as she’d asked. They were good kids and rarely gave her trouble. Well, not real trouble anyway. Jeff had had a hand in that. He’d been a loving but firm father; he’d taught them to be independent and resourceful. And they’d both taught them right from wrong. Now what would she be able to teach them? Their journey into town and their visit to the Summer Haven Town Market was a trip down memory lane. Nothing had changed much. Oh, the market was modernized in many ways, rearranged and brightened up more than when she’d run around it as a child stealing pieces of chocolate from cellophane bags when no one was looking. Even now, after all these years, she felt bad about that. Stealing candy. She and Joey made their own spending money when they’d gotten older but when they’d been small and hungry there’d been times they’d snatched things to eat from stores. Stray pieces of fruit. Cupcakes. Candy. They’d both had a sweet tooth. Oh well, that was then and this was now. Her childhood was long behind her and her stealing phase was part of that. Over the years she’d made amends for those petty sins by being kind and giving to others. Lately, after all that had happened to her, she wondered if it’d been enough. She was being punished for something. When in the store she’d looked for Oscar but didn’t see him. At the checkout she’d asked and was told he worked the evening shift that day and wouldn’t be in until three. She’d have to catch him another time. Outside it was overcast, a solid murky sky, but she found she still needed a hat and sunglasses. Light hurt her eyes, though now she understood why. The outing went well. The grocery store had everything she needed and at fair prices. There was a modest hardware store down the road where she got the paint and supplies at sale prices and stayed within her budget. She made a brief stop at the library, and leaving the kids in the car so they wouldn’t see the books she was checking out, she walked in and on a temporary library card took out three scholarly looking books on vampires. She could Google the subject on the Internet but a creature of old habits she figured a hardcopy backup couldn’t hurt. Besides she didn’t have the Internet yet. Another thing to put on her list of to do’s. There was one last place to shop and she dreaded it. The Dollar General that stood where the Grand Theater once had; where she and Jeff had destroyed the vampire family who’d been culling the town’s people–and burned it to the ground. She parked in front of the dollar store as far away from Joey’s Diner as she could get, hoping he wouldn’t see her car. No such luck. Her hawk-eyed brother saw her and the kids through the diner’s window and waved. She motioned she was going next door and kept walking. “Can we go in for something to eat first before we go to the Dollar Store?” Sarah begged. “Since breakfast was so skimpy.” Her black sweatshirt brought out the gold in her brown eyes and blond hair. Jenny had braided it and the braid hung halfway down her daughter’s back. The girl had grown inches since spring. People thought she was at least ten years old because of how tall she was. “I second that.” Teddy was halfway to the diner. “I’m starving, too. That Pop Tart didn’t do the trick for me. I’m a growing boy.” “You know,” Sarah ended in a timorous voice, “Uncle Joey will give us free food.” Jenny felt a tug to her heart. Her children’s sensitivity to their financial situation was touching. For their sake she kept her tone light. “All righty, food first. We’ll go in and play the family card. Joey can’t resist starving people any way. He’ll feed us. Free we can afford.” And they did. Joey filled their bellies and their ears with town gossip as he filled her cup with coffee. “Police Chief Donald was in early this morning for breakfast. You remember Rusty Donald, don’t you? Little fat kid who used to invite us to his house to swim in his gigantic swimming pool and lorded it over us like a tyrant?” “I remember him. Vaguely.” Another rich kid from their poor youth. There’d been many. However, she remembered him differently than her brother. Rusty had been a little over bearing but she’d seen through his lack of self-confidence to the lonely child beneath. Joey had made fun of him but she’d liked him. They’d become friends, sort of, in her junior and senior year. They were both honor roll and loved to read. Unlike what Joey believed, Rusty had been highly intelligent, merely socially backward. Then. “He still as fat?” “Naw, he’s tall and slim now. A couple years ago he found out he had a minor heart problem and dropped about a hundred pounds. Though he was a pain in the butt as a kid he’s turned into a mighty fine law officer, educated, professional and thorough–and a good friend. “Anyway, Rusty told me Nellie and Sammy Jameson have up and gone missing. Their kids called up worried saying they had Sunday dinner with their folks every week at their house but when they went out there day before yesterday the old couple were nowhere to be seen. Not a trace. No dinner. Nothing. “No sign, in fact, they’d been there since the night before. Dirty plates were found in the sink from a late night snack and that was about it. And the car, their keys and cell phones, Nellie’s purse, were still there.” Jenny didn’t recall the Jamesons but the knowledge they were missing bothered her. Déjà vu. Missing people. That’s how the vampire trouble began all those years ago. “That’s mysterious. I don’t know them but I hope they find them soon.” “Me, too. The town is getting spooked, more so since Graham Lintoner, a night guard at the vacant stove factory, was attacked last night. The rumor is by some animal or something. He was bitten up pretty bad. He’s only alive because he was able to get to his gun, shoot, and hit, he says, whatever tackled him. It got away. But he’s in the hospital.” “That’s horrible.” Her thoughts weren’t on the wounded security guard, it was on what she feared might have done the wounding. Animal, her butt. Ha. Was it her? Did she steal out in the night and do these horrible things unaware she was doing them? Was she truly as in control as she believed or was she in reality a feral bloodsucker now, too? Was she fooling herself? For a second an image of a ghostly man hiding behind night trees flashed in her mind but when she attempted to capture it, it melted away, a snowflake in her fingers, leaving behind only a nagging guilt that somehow she was to blame. She couldn’t shake it. Sarah then toppled off one of the barstools she was spinning on and attending to her swept everything else from Jenny’s mind. A small bump and hurt pride was the result. Teddy teased his sister until she forgot about both of them as Laurie brought out ice for it. Afterwards Jenny hurried the kids through lunch. “We have a lot left to do today, rooms to paint and rugs to put down, and we should get going. So eat up kiddos. Chop, chop.” This time to avoid her brother’s prying she ate a part of her lunch but later, in the restroom threw it up. Her ploy worked. No one suspected what she’d done. The hunger had returned and was torturing her. Everywhere she looked she smelled and saw walking bags of blood. Her stomach began to ache. Her reason to skew. Every bone in her body began to melt, or at least it felt that way. In the Dollar General they quickly picked up the remainder of the items they needed. Jenny wasn’t sure how much longer she could last. The whole time she was jumpy knowing what had once stood there and had happened there when it’d been the movie theater. Terror and pain clung to the site in the form of misty phantoms. Remnants of the tormented humans that had been kept in basement cages and of the torture, psychological and physical, and the ultimate deaths of the vampires’ victims. They were beneath the bricks and wood of the new store. Screaming at her. And because of her condition she was more attuned to it than most people would have been. Well that and because she and Jeff had been responsible for the freeing of those souls. She couldn’t stand being there. She hurried her kids through the store and drove home as if something awful was following her. In a way it was. The past. Returning to Summer Haven had revived the memories time had diluted and hidden deep in her psyche. Now the ghosts were closer and their voices louder. For the first time she questioned if returning had been a smart move. Too late now, she thought, as she drove up to the farmhouse. For better or worse, this was where they were and this was where they had to stay. If there were…problems…she’d have to deal with them as best she could. It was her children she was anxious for. Because this time she had so much more to lose. As they entered the house the rain began, changing the afternoon into a premature evening. It sang through the air above them and left spots on the house’s old wooden siding. When the door closed, she could hear it slapping against the outside walls. For as long as she could recall rain had soothed her. The music, the fragrance of it, above all at night when it filled the world and made her feel snug behind the strong walls of home. Tonight the rain just made her restless. It was outside. Not locked in as she was. She had a longing to escape and race the raindrops, but she had things to do. She had children to take care of. There were endless chores. The basic pieces of furniture were in place but there was so much more to do. Painting came first. Of all the things that could instantly beautify a home, that was at the top of the list. They painted the living room first. Her plan was to do one room a day. It shouldn’t be hard. She’d been the resident painter in the family since she’d been a child. If something needed to be painted, she did it. It was one of the reasons she’d teamed up with her father years ago to paint houses. Painting, like writing, was in her blood. Sarah was like her. Good with the paintbrush. Neat. Precise. She loved to paint and draw, she was really good at it, and it didn’t matter how big the canvas was. Putting color on anything made her happy. She hummed a string of songs from the Twilight soundtrack as she worked. The girl wanted to become a singer or an artist one day. She had that creative soul. Poor thing. Teddy not so much. He picked up the roller and being nearly as tall as Jenny he was given the job of the higher places. He did it with a grimace on his lips and a grouchy look on his face, but he did it. She’d bribed him. His room would be painted next. He’d wanted an electric purple with neon orange stripes but she talked him into a medium blue splattered with white stars on the ceiling instead. “You like astronomy, so wouldn’t that be neat? A room of stars? I’ll cut out a star stencil and that’ll make it easy.” Anything would be better than a room striped like a toy racing car. Purple and orange, ugh. “I guess.” He mumbled something under his breath he thought she couldn’t hear but she did. “Yeah, I liked staring at the damn stars when I was like five. Jeez.” “Teddy!” she admonished. “Watch your language.” His stare tipped her off he couldn’t believe she’d heard what he’d said. He mouthed something else, no voice, just mouth, which she could still hear. She ignored it. Shaking her head, she kept pushing the brush around the trim on the door. Using all her self-control she kept the hunger at bay. Seven more hours. Six more. Five. She silently counted down the time before the children went to bed and she could venture out into the rainy night to find what she needed. What she had to have. “The room looks so good, Momma,” Sarah gushed after they’d finished the first coat. It was after seven and the wet afternoon had evolved into a wet evening. “It makes the room look brand new. I like it.” The girl was sitting on the couch, her legs motionless for once because she was worn out. There were paint splotches on her cheeks, hands and old clothes she’d put on when they’d returned from shopping. Teddy’s painting outfit had no splotches on them. Not a one. “Yeah, it looks good. Real good. I’m proud of us. “Now what’s for supper?” Supper. The thought of food made her want to gag. “I stuck frozen lasagna in the oven forty-five minutes ago. It’ll be ready to eat about the time you two are clean and changed.” She didn’t have to tell them twice. While they were washing up she made their salads and popped rolls in beside the lasagna. She was surprised the ancient stove still worked. The food was on the table by the time Sarah and Teddy wandered into the kitchen with droopy shoulders and sleepy eyes. The day had worn them out. They ate in weary silence, the rain as a backdrop. Jenny pushed her lasagna around on the plate but didn’t eat much. That happened when she was too tired. Usually before they’d go to bed they’d watch television or play on the computer (which hadn’t been set up and connected yet) but that night by the time their stomachs were full they kissed her goodnight and drug themselves to bed without a peep of dissent. Fine with her. She waited for fifteen minutes and tiptoed up to their rooms to check them. Both were sleeping. Good. She bolted into the evening drizzle. No raincoat. Nothing on her head. Just her in her old jeans and T-Shirt and the cool night. Her skin had changed. It was whiter. Firmer. The chilly wind and raindrops didn’t affect her. She wasn’t cold. She wasn’t anything. Earlier, while she’d been prying a lid off a paint can, she’d gouged her hand, but it hadn’t bled and the cut healed before her eyes. She hid it from the kids. She was learning that being different had beneficial side effects. Were they enough to outweigh the unpleasant realities of being what she’d become? She’d probably find that out sooner or later. By the time she’d gotten to the place where her trailer had once stood the light rain had changed into a downpour and lightning was slashing through the night behind the ebony silhouetted trees. Thunder boomed above her head. She didn’t care. She was one with the night and her new abilities alerted her nourishment was near. She could smell it. Hear it. As she stood there, the raindrops cascading off her face and down her body, she saw it. A deer was making its way painfully through the tangled underbrush. It was old and sick. She sensed soon it would die. She didn’t hesitate but came up behind the creature and took its life, drank its blood. She thought the bigger the animal she drank from the longer it’d stave off her hunger. It seemed to make sense. If she didn’t want to end up feeding on her children. She thought someone was following her long before they made their move. She wasn’t afraid. Her strength had grown and she no longer felt so vulnerable. Fast as the wind, she believed she could outrun them. Or hide from them by climbing a tree. A bolt of lightning hit the ground not far away, shuddering the earth and blinding her. When the earth stopped shaking and her eyesight returned she was looking into the face of a man. But a strange man. He was so tall, freakishly taller than her, dressed in somber clothes that merged into the blackness; with long silverish hair, a sharp predatory face and unsmiling lips. Then she remembered. The other night. The other man she’d seen from a distance. She wasn’t sure it was the same one but she believed he was. She could have run, but emboldened by her new strengths, she stood her ground. “Who are you and what do you want from me?” She glared at him through the heavy rain. He didn’t move. “I’m Zebulon. Servant to our leader. He’s sent me to fetch you.” The man had a heavy accent, yet she couldn’t place it. European perhaps. “Fetch me?” What was she, some prey to be bagged; a trophy to be gathered? His smile struck her as sinister. “No trophy, Jenny. One of us and we’ve come to collect you.” The fear was strong and bitter in her mouth. Heart stopping. My children. “What if I don’t want to come? I don’t know you or this…leader of yours.” Her voice cracked as she said the name. Her mind was seeking a way for her to escape, as she sensed great danger from this stranger. “You haven’t got a choice. He’s sent for you and you must come, leave this human world you know behind. Forever. You’re not one of them anymore. You know that. You’re one of us. Come. Now! Or you’ll make our leader angry and you wouldn’t want to see him angry, believe me.” The curve of his lips was another threat. He’d somehow drawn closer without her seeing it. No more than five feet away. His eyes glittered through the rainfall as a sky of lightning erupted behind him. He put his hand out and she was filled with the almost overpowering urge to give him hers. Go with him. Do anything and everything he asked of her. No! She rocked her head back and forth. She couldn’t leave her children. Joey. The farmhouse that was becoming her home. “I don’t know you and I sure as hell don’t know this leader of yours. Leave me alone. Tell him I’m sorry, I decline the offer.” She didn’t dare speak of her children alone in the farmhouse or even think of them. The man, or whatever he was, might be able to read her mind. She felt the stranger’s rage more than saw it and what came next happened so swiftly later she’d wonder if it had happened at all. He was on her, his arms, a vice, around her and all she could do was scream. Kick. Fight. She broke his hold and shoved away from him. She got away. As she fled through the rain she heard him behind her, bellowing, an angry devil deprived of his quarry, but he couldn’t catch her. She was too fast. Her feet flew over the wet ground as she wove through the trees. Please God, let her get home safely! Even before she finished the silent prayer she found herself, clothes dripping water in a puddle on the old linoleum floor, standing in her kitchen. Just like that. “Whoa,” she rasped, doubling over. “How did I get here so fast? I don’t remember getting here. Coming inside.” Trembling, she staggered to the window and, hiding against the wall, looked out; scared the man had pursued her home and was even now ready to break in the door to take her away. Or to hurt her children. But there was no one out there. The rain was a solid curtain of water, lightning ripped the sky and thunder shook the world, but she was safe. She didn’t know how she knew that but she did. He couldn’t follow her inside. Not into her home, unless she invited him in. Which she’d never do. Shivering, she slumped against the wall and lowered her wet face into her hands. If she’d been able, she would have cried. She couldn’t. She could only feel panic. She didn’t know who this Zebulon or his leader was, although she had her suspicions. Vampires. For some reason they wanted her. And she and her family were in danger. She checked on her children, relieved to see they were sleeping peacefully in their beds. Nothing had hurt them. No one had stolen them away. She kept an eye on the windows for a long time. Alert to every night sound and whisper. Only silence, except for the rain and wind. No one came. The rain slowed, the sky’s fireworks blustered away to annoy another town and when nothing else happened she switched on a nightlight in the bathroom and took a two-minute shower. As the night wore on she opened the library books, the ones on vampires, and began to pour through them at the kitchen table. Guarding her home and her children. Trying to find answers she was afraid she wasn’t going to find. Normal people didn’t believe in vampires and normal people wrote those books. By the time she was done she knew no more than she had when she’d begun. She probably knew more than the authors…because, unlike them, she knew vampires existed. They were real creatures. Use wooden stakes of Aspen to kill the things. Cut off their evil heads. Burn them to ashes. Bah! Nothing she didn’t already know. Nothing she thought would help her in her situation…because, deep inside, she feared they weren’t normal vampires. She didn’t know how she knew this, but she did. She suddenly had acquired an eleventh sense. A vampire sense. Most people didn’t know that humans actually had ten senses. She’d read that somewhere. That the sense of touch involved four different sets of nerves, the skin senses and were considered four separate ones. Heat. Cold. Pressure. Pain. Motion (kinesthetic sense). Balance (vestibular sense). So there were ten. But now she had eleven. She’d have to find help somewhere else. Where? From whom? She would have done anything to have been able to ask Jeff for help. He’d been good at solving mysteries, formulating a plan. Fixing the problem. He would have known what to do. Because she didn’t. When she had the Internet up and going she could look for answers there. In her bed, at first, she didn’t sleep. She was too afraid. Then finally oblivion came. Filling her stomach with blood, fleeing through the black woods, and waiting for the intruder to come, had exhausted her.",

      "content": "Chapter 6 Jenny The sun was out the next morning, yet an inexplicable feeling of dismay lingered though she couldn’t remember exactly why. Something frightening had happened to her in the woods the night before. But what? When she tried to remember she got nothing. Lost time. A blank. It was as if a chunk of her life had vanished from her mind. All she knew was she had to be careful. She had to be vigilant. There was something that wanted to hurt her and her family and she couldn’t let it. In the meantime, there was work to do, rooms to paint and a house beautification to accomplish. So she and the kids spent the day working on Teddy’s bedroom and the kitchen. The following days they finished the other rooms. Each night, with a sense of disquiet she couldn’t rationalize, as the children slept she’d wait until practically dawn before she’d venture out and hunt. Deep in the forest and nowhere near the meadow where her trailer had once sat among the weeds. The days passed. New powers, amazing speed, agility, endless vigor and self-healing, emerged. Her senses improved a hundred fold. She could see the bugs crawling up the trees in the dark. Hear faint noises or smell blood miles away. At times, a gift she couldn’t quite master but was learning to, she’d will herself instantly to another place. Once she ended up in the middle of town by the gazebo, laughed softly–good thing it was pre-dawn and no one was around to see her–and tried again. Three tries later she got home. In time she’d learn she couldn’t always wind travel, as she began to call it. Some days she couldn’t do it at all. The hunger drove her mad at times but if she fed most nights she found she could endure it. It became easier every day. And she kept busy. Denial became a part of her thought process. If she didn’t think about her being a vampire…then surely it didn’t exist. Right? The farmhouse flowered into life, like an old sick cat given love and care until it learned to trust and purr again. The more she did to it the more she wanted to do. The three of them were going to make it beautiful. Better than it’d ever been. Once the house had been sad, now it was happy. It’d never looked so good. Her heart swelled with pride with each room they finished. The place looked so different from the one they’d stepped into days before. The freshly colored walls and the nicer furniture and paintings they’d brought with them had transformed it. Joey, leaving Laurie in charge of the diner, stopped by most days to see their progress. Sometimes he lent a hand, though Laurie couldn’t handle the diner crowds by herself for long. Bad economy or not, their business was booming. Best thing was, whenever Joey dropped by he brought food, which saved her from cooking for the kids. It was nice to have him around again. Catered food didn’t hurt, either. “You know, Mom,” Teddy proclaimed at the end of the week, “this place is starting to look pretty good. For an old wreck of a house, that is.” “We have all of us to thank. You two are doing a fantastic job. I’m proud of you.” They were eating at the supper table. Or the kids were. Jenny told them she’d nibbled at the stove while she was cooking the meal. She watched them eat. There was still a lot to do but she was feeling energized. Another interesting side effect of her condition, as she was beginning to call it, she did like. The children asked to go to their rooms when the meal was over. The next day they were starting school. “Do we have to go to school tomorrow?” Teddy was nearly to the stairs; he turned to look at her, his face petulant. “We have more painting and other stuff to do.” “I can manage it from here, Son. There’s only a little left to do. And yes, you have to go to school. You’ve missed enough days. If you go now you won’t be too far behind the others in your class. I called the school this morning and enrolled both of you. It’s a small town so both the elementary and the junior high school are in the same building. Grades one through eight. So you’ll be together. “Your father and I went to that school, you know, though the principal said it’s been remodeled since. You’ll like it and you’re going to make loads of new friends.” “Do we ride the bus or are you driving us?” Teddy had halted midway up the steps. “The bus. It’ll come by in front of the house around 7:45 tomorrow morning. When you get to the school go by the main office and they’ll give you papers to bring home for me to sign. They’ll also help you get situated and direct you to your classrooms. “So pick out the clothes you’ll want to wear tomorrow. If you need them cleaned or pressed, give them to me before you go to bed, you two, deal?” Sarah stood before her, smiling. She loved school. “Deal.” She clapped her hands together. “I can’t wait. I’m going upstairs and find something cute to wear tomorrow.” Her face grew serious. “I miss my old friends so much. You think I’ll find new ones tomorrow?” “Of course you will.” Jenny took the girl into her arms and stroked her hair. She’d been trying not to behave differently towards them, but it was hard. Kids needed physical contact. “Give it a little time, honey. Nothing comes quick. Remember you might be new to Summer Haven but your family has lived here for a long time. You’re not actually an outsider. You’re going to have lots of friends, you’ll see.” “Oh, I hope so. I can’t wait!” “I’ll come up later and tuck you both in.” “Don’t worry about me,” Teddy said from the top of the stairs. “I’m too big for that nonsense. Besides I’ll be busy on the computer.” They’d connected it the night before with Joey’s help. Teddy was content. “So I’ll say goodnight now. Goodnight.” She almost argued with him but stopped, remembering herself at that age. How independent she’d been. Craving her solitude. Teddy was growing up and she had to let him. Respect his growing independence. So she said nothing. She’d look in and steal a kiss when he was sleeping. Jenny watched Sarah skip up the steps to watch television in her room. Then she cleared away and washed the supper dishes. She was going to paint the bathroom but decided to do it the next day. There were other things she needed to do. She settled in a corner of the living room, keyed up her laptop and tapped in the words she knew would direct her to the right websites. Everything she ever wanted to know about vampires. Two hours later, glancing at the clock she’d hung between paintings of autumn woods, she turned the computer off, disappointed. Again myths and speculation was all she’d found. The only people that admitted to believing in vampires sounded like they were crazy. She’d found nothing that could help her. Upstairs she embraced and kissed Sarah goodnight then snuggled the cover up around her once she got in bed. “You okay for clothes tomorrow?” “Uh huh, I’m wearing the sunflower dress daddy bought me for my last birthday. It’s clean and everything. See, it’s right there in my closet.” Jenny looked. It was a light cotton material and had short sleeves. “Kind of cool for the weather we’re having, isn’t it?” “Nah. I’ll wear my brown sweater with it. That’ll keep me warm enough.” “Okay. The sunflower dress it is. Now get some sleep.” After turning on the nightlight her daughter insisted on having beside her bed, she snapped off the lamp and left the room. Just as she thought, Teddy was sleeping. She tiptoed into his room and laid a kiss on his forehead. Gazing down at her son in the dark she felt the greatest wave of sorrow she’d experienced so far. Was she a fool for thinking she could continue her life as if nothing (other than having to wring poor animal’s necks and drain their blood for food) had changed? A fool for staying with Teddy and Sarah? Every day her doubts tore her apart. She’d begun to think ahead, far ahead–what would she do when her children grew up, grew older, and she never aged? How would she hide that? Not a clue. It was too odd a notion to dwell on for too long. Not when she had other immediate concerns. She was having more blackouts during her night hunts. Some of them lasted a few minutes, some longer. She’d return from her forays and, by the clock, more time had passed than she’d thought. Last night she’d lost track of three hours. Totally lost them. She was changing even more. She could feel it in her bones, her flesh, and her very thoughts. What happened if she mutated into something alien? Something she couldn’t control? What happened if she truly became a danger to her children? She had to find out more about her condition. Get help. From somewhere or someone. She was at the computer twenty minutes later when she heard a knock at the front door. Nine-thirty. Not too late. It was probably Joey. She opened it. “Andy?” She was surprised to see Joey’s friend standing on the other side of the screen door. “What are you doing out this late on a work night?” Her smile covered her annoyance. She’d been about to go out. The night was clear, the air crisp and the moon full. A perfect night to hunt. Except now she had company. “I hate to bother you but I was driving by and spied the lights still on. I had to talk to someone and for some reason you came to mind. If it’s too late or a bad time,” he said softly, eyes down, “I’ll leave you alone.” It was the disheartened tone of his voice that let her know something was wrong and her natural empathy kicked in. “No, no. It’s not too late. Come on in.” He came inside and with trudging steps followed her to the sofa. “The kids are in bed, I take it?” “Yep. They go back to school tomorrow. New town. New school. It won’t be easy so a good night’s sleep was in order. Sit down, Andy.” He sat down. “Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?” “Now that sounds perfect. I’d appreciate that after the day I’ve had.” When she went to start the pot he surprised her again, got up and followed her. “The house looks great.” His eyes took in his kitchen surroundings. “I can’t believe you’ve done so much to it in such a short time. It’s so homey and all.” “Thanks. We were motivated.” She flashed him a smile as he lowered himself onto a chair. “There’s a lot left to do, painting, minor repairs, but we’re working on it.” As the coffee perked she sat across from him. She’d only seen him twice since she’d moved home but tonight he looked dreadful. His hair was uncombed and his eyes were shaded with what she thought was stunned disbelief. “Okay,” she murmured gently. “It’s all over your face. What’s wrong?” “It’s been a terrible day.” His eyes met hers. His expression was troubled. He stopped talking. “And?” “First thing this morning, like most mornings before work, I go to your brother’s diner for breakfast and Police Chief Donald, who’s also there for breakfast, tells me Graham Lintoner, the night guard who was wounded last weekend at the factory didn’t make it.” “Didn’t make it?” “He died.” His sigh was heavy. “Or was found dead at his house. They’d released him from the hospital yesterday, his condition satisfactory, and last night someone broke in and–oh, God, this is so horrendous–cut his head off.” She was too shocked to say anything. “That wasn’t all the good Police Chief had to say. Seems they located Nellie and Sammy Jameson. You know the couple that’s been missing the last few days?” Oh, no. She didn’t want to hear what he was about to say, afraid of what was coming. Still she nodded. “Well, they found their bodies out in the woods. In fact, not far from here.” He stared out the window behind her. “Both dead. The Chief wouldn’t tell me how they died but I could see the worry in him. He said they’d been dead for days. Murdered.” “Oh, that’s terrible. I mean I don’t know any of these people but since they’re neighbors, so to speak, I feel bad about what’s happened to them.” “I knew all three. Not real well but well enough to feel a loss. And it hit me hard. All dead. I couldn’t believe it. So my day was already tainted. Then I went to work.” Ah, ha. Here it was. “Walked in, and first thing, my supervisor comes into my office and lowers the boom. He has to lay off three people. And I’m one of them. Said he was so sorry but the bank was in financial trouble with the sick economy and the people around here forfeiting on their loans, and he had no choice.” Andy’s distress was painful to see. “I’ve seen people lose their jobs but I never thought it’d happen to me. I’ve worked at the bank over twenty years. Been a dependable innovative employee. Worked hard. Worse thing was I didn’t see it coming. Not at all. Heck, I recently bought bedroom furniture and a new car.” He massaged his fingers along the side of his head. A tiny groan escaped. “I was such a fool not to see the writing on the wall. There’d been rumors going around the office for months about some of our jobs being gone. I didn’t pick up on any of it. So positive that, sure, half the town, half the country were losing their jobs, but mine was safe. They needed me. Stupid me.” She almost reached out to touch him, but remembering how cold her skin was and how his flesh would affect her, she didn’t. Instead she said, “I’m so sorry, Andy. I kind of know how you feel. Not exactly. I haven’t lost a job I’d been at for two decades. I’m so sorry for you. But I don’t have a job, either. We’ll look for new jobs together.” He smiled for the first time since he’d arrived. “We’re in the same boat. Does it always feel this bad?” “It gets better, you’ll see. What you have to do is keep in mind this happens all the time to people. Leave one job, find another. That’s life. Think of it this way. You were way overdue, that’s all.” “Jenny, why would you want a regular job anyway? You’re a published author. A good one. I’d think publishers would be breaking down your door for your next novel.” Her laughter must have sounded sarcastic. “That would be if there was a next novel. I haven’t been writing the last few years. Life, my family’s needs, got in the way. Don’t get me wrong, I loved being a full time mom and helping my husband with his business but my writing has suffered. Besides, the sales of my last book didn’t do that well so I imagine I’d have a tough time selling any new ones. The publishing world has changed. The bad economy has hit it, too. Oh, and e-books and self-publishing are taking over the world.” “Then write e-books. Self-publish them. Heck,” he looked embarrassed, “I fought it at first but in the end even I broke down and bought a Kindle. It’s great. I can make the type as large as I want and it holds hundreds of books. No more lugging a pile of novels around. I take it everywhere. It’s great. I buy self-published books all the time.” “I’ve heard the new Kindle’s great, too.” Jeff had been going to give me one for my birthday but he hadn’t made it to August. So no Kindle. She got Andy a cup of coffee. One for herself, though she barely touched it. And for a time they sat and talked about other things. How the town had changed since she’d been away; how life and the world had changed. Current events. The topics always came back to the murders and his last day at his job. It’d hurt him the way his supervisor had him watched like a thief as he’d packed up his personal things and then had him escorted out of the building to his new Ford Mustang. “I didn’t even get a going away party. After all I’ve done for them. The years I gave.” He shook his head. “Well, here’s your party. I have some left over pie in the fridge Joey sent over yesterday. Apple. You want a piece? Got Cool Whip, too.” He smiled. “Sure. To both. Thank you. Come to think of it, I never ate supper. Too upset. I’ve been driving around all day since I got the boot. Yep, come to think of it, I am hungry.” So was she. But she’d have to wait for her food. “I’ll give you an extra big piece and an extra scoop of topping.” He stayed a little longer. He was easy to be with; easy to talk to. She just didn’t get too near. About the time she caught herself staring longingly at his throat and wondering if it would hurt if she just took a little of his blood, she sent him home. He seemed in a better frame of mind, not as desperate and lost, than when he’d first arrived. As he left in his car she could barely keep from dashing outside and into the night, her hunger demanding to be fed. She waited ten minutes, looked in on her sleeping children one last time; locked up the house, then faded into the moonlight bathed woods. She raced through the trees trying to escape the nagging fear that had taken root when Andy told her about the dead bodies. Did she kill that guard last night…did she murder those two elderly people during one of her blackouts in the woods…and then forgot she had? Has she become the monster she feared she would become? She jogged faster and deeper into the woods, far away from her house and Summer Haven. She was careful, kept her ears and eyes open, caught her supper swiftly, drank it, and scurried home, where she dropped into bed and tried to sleep, tried to be normal as she’d once been. Her rat-in-a-maze thinking wouldn’t let her. She needed help and the only person she could trust with her secret, who’d believe her and not want to kill her, was Joey. But she was afraid of telling him, what with his history of vampires having nearly killed him and having killed their father and mother, but she had to. There was no other choice. Her secret was too much for her to deal with alone. If she were responsible for the murders, if she really had gone rogue, someone would have to protect her children and the community from her. Joey was the one. Tomorrow she’d speak to him. Confess she was a vampire and needed his help. His life was about to change. Like hers had. And it’d never be the same. Poor Joey.",

      "content": "Chapter 6 Jenny The sun was out the next morning, yet an inexplicable feeling of dismay lingered though she couldn’t remember exactly why. Something frightening had happened to her in the woods the night before. But what? When she tried to remember she got nothing. Lost time. A blank. It was as if a chunk of her life had vanished from her mind. All she knew was she had to be careful. She had to be vigilant. There was something that wanted to hurt her and her family and she couldn’t let it. In the meantime, there was work to do, rooms to paint and a house beautification to accomplish. So she and the kids spent the day working on Teddy’s bedroom and the kitchen. The following days they finished the other rooms. Each night, with a sense of disquiet she couldn’t rationalize, as the children slept she’d wait until practically dawn before she’d venture out and hunt. Deep in the forest and nowhere near the meadow where her trailer had once sat among the weeds. The days passed. New powers, amazing speed, agility, endless vigor and self-healing, emerged. Her senses improved a hundred fold. She could see the bugs crawling up the trees in the dark. Hear faint noises or smell blood miles away. At times, a gift she couldn’t quite master but was learning to, she’d will herself instantly to another place. Once she ended up in the middle of town by the gazebo, laughed softly–good thing it was pre-dawn and no one was around to see her–and tried again. Three tries later she got home. In time she’d learn she couldn’t always wind travel, as she began to call it. Some days she couldn’t do it at all. The hunger drove her mad at times but if she fed most nights she found she could endure it. It became easier every day. And she kept busy. Denial became a part of her thought process. If she didn’t think about her being a vampire…then surely it didn’t exist. Right? The farmhouse flowered into life, like an old sick cat given love and care until it learned to trust and purr again. The more she did to it the more she wanted to do. The three of them were going to make it beautiful. Better than it’d ever been. Once the house had been sad, now it was happy. It’d never looked so good. Her heart swelled with pride with each room they finished. The place looked so different from the one they’d stepped into days before. The freshly colored walls and the nicer furniture and paintings they’d brought with them had transformed it. Joey, leaving Laurie in charge of the diner, stopped by most days to see their progress. Sometimes he lent a hand, though Laurie couldn’t handle the diner crowds by herself for long. Bad economy or not, their business was booming. Best thing was, whenever Joey dropped by he brought food, which saved her from cooking for the kids. It was nice to have him around again. Catered food didn’t hurt, either. “You know, Mom,” Teddy proclaimed at the end of the week, “this place is starting to look pretty good. For an old wreck of a house, that is.” “We have all of us to thank. You two are doing a fantastic job. I’m proud of you.” They were eating at the supper table. Or the kids were. Jenny told them she’d nibbled at the stove while she was cooking the meal. She watched them eat. There was still a lot to do but she was feeling energized. Another interesting side effect of her condition, as she was beginning to call it, she did like. The children asked to go to their rooms when the meal was over. The next day they were starting school. “Do we have to go to school tomorrow?” Teddy was nearly to the stairs; he turned to look at her, his face petulant. “We have more painting and other stuff to do.” “I can manage it from here, Son. There’s only a little left to do. And yes, you have to go to school. You’ve missed enough days. If you go now you won’t be too far behind the others in your class. I called the school this morning and enrolled both of you. It’s a small town so both the elementary and the junior high school are in the same building. Grades one through eight. So you’ll be together. “Your father and I went to that school, you know, though the principal said it’s been remodeled since.

Her secret was too much for her to deal with alone. If she were responsible for the murders, if she really had gone rogue, someone would have to protect her children and the community from her. Joey was the one. Tomorrow she’d speak to him. Confess she was a vampire and needed his help. His life was about to change. Like hers had. And it’d never be the same. Poor Joey.",

      "content": "Chapter 7 Jenny Teddy and Sarah had no trouble catching the school bus when it lurched to a stop at the end of the driveway. Vacation had lasted long enough and they were ready to resume their children’s lives. They missed their old friends, their routines, and were looking forward to forming new ones. Hiding in the shadows behind the door, she watched them skip down the driveway and climb onto the bus. Sarah had decided against the sunflower dress in favor of a dark purple one with black leggings. A black and purple bracelet. The Twilight influence again. All those dark colors. For Jenny, the girl couldn’t grow out of it too soon. Before he got on the bus, Teddy pivoted and glanced at the house. The look on his face apprehensive. With her new eyes she could see his expression clear as day. He was worried about her. The strange way she’d been acting. Her appearance. Perhaps he’d woke up and found her gone at night. Something about the way he looked at her in the morning. He’s hesitant to ask what’s wrong. Does he wonder what she does outside alone in the woods. He’s afraid of her. Oh, no. After the bus drove off she closed the door and telephoned Joey. “Hi Joey. How’s it going?” “Same old same old, you know. Business is steady. Meatloaf special today and we’re finishing up the breakfast crowd so we can start cooking tons of modified hamburger. “Laurie’s changed her hair color again. Next time you see her she’ll be a flaming redhead. It looks ridiculous, her head’s on fire, but please don’t tell her that. Pretend it looks just beautiful.” “I’ll do that.” In the background she could hear the light banter of customers and the clatter of silverware. Laurie yelling an order in. Scrambled eggs and toast. “What can I do for you? Cause you never call this early unless you want something.” There was good-natured humor in his voice. Basically Joey was a happy person. Or he was now. After she told him what she was going to tell him. Not so much. “Can you come over? Right now? There’s something really important I need to discuss with you.” “Right now…at eight o’clock in the morning…before our breakfast rush is over?” “Yes, please.” “Whoa, this must be important.” “Oh, it is. You have no idea. Please?” “I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Fire up the coffee and I’ll bring donuts.” “None for me, Brother. Just for you,” she imparted sadly. “Hurry.” She hung up, got out of her robe and dressed. She was feeling even stranger than usual. Frighteningly detached. Increasingly restless. The lure of fresh blood, the hunt, was so strong; the urge to start running and never stop beat at her until she thought she’d go crazy. To be free of all human ties and restrictions. Feed. Be free. Feed. Free. The only thing that kept her there was Teddy and Sarah. Joey. Fear of the unknown. What her life might now become. Otherwise, she’d be gone. She had the oddest thought. When she’d been a child she’d seen this old science fiction movie about this man who’d been affected by radiation or something and then began to shrink. He got smaller and smaller and smaller. He lost his wife, his family, his career and finally his very way of life. It was as if he ceased to exist as a man. In the end he was so tiny, miniscule really, that he had no idea what his future, his life, would become. She felt like that microscopic man…on the threshold of a new world. She didn’t know if she should be terrified, resigned or awed. *** An hour later, at the kitchen table with shadows crowding around them (all the curtains were tightly closed), Joey stared at her, his face tinged with horrified pity as he tried to hide another emotion. Fear. The bag of donuts untouched. She’d confessed everything. What she believed had happened during the attack in St. Louis. Her discovery of what she was becoming, her growing strength and powers; her night hunts for animals to feed on. Her blackouts. Most of her fears. “Oh, my God, Jenny.” At first he’d recoiled, shifting his body away as if she’d had the plague. Slowly, as they talked, he stopped moving away. When she reached out her hand, her eyes pleading for understanding and comfort, he took it. “That explains the absence of an appetite, I guess. Your moodiness. Paleness. Aversion to the sun. Oh, my God.” “You saw all that?” “Of course, I did. You never wore hats or sunglasses much before. In the beginning I thought you were hiding tear-swollen eyes. Hiding the grief over losing Jeff. Aftereffects of your trauma and coma. I did wonder, though. You haven’t really been yourself lately. Not since the–” “Attack? Jeff’s death? The coma?” “Yeah. All of those.” There was a hesitation she caught in his reply. She could smell the fear on him. “I won’t hurt you, Joey,” she spoke in a whisper, her gaze on his face. “I love you. It seems to make the difference. I can control it so far. Or I think I can. That’s the problem. I’m changing rapidly now and I’m scared. I have these,” her voice trailed off, “blackouts.” He was thoughtful for a minute and finally said, “We’ll find a way to beat it. I swear. We’ll find a cure. Or something. “But right now I need time to wrap my head around this. Some time to think.” He squeezed her hand, reassuringly. “I don’t believe this has happened. Not to you. Of all the people in the world, after all you’ve been through,” he shook his head, “not to you.” “Join the club. I can’t believe it either. Ironic, huh? Long ago I hunted and killed vampires and now I am one. Ha, ha. Every day I open my eyes and think it’s been a really bad dream. I wake up all the way and–whoops–it isn’t a nightmare at all. It’s my life.” “God’s got a mean sense of humor.” “God had nothing to do with this.” She couldn’t help it, her bitterness oozed through. “I’m so sorry.” He released her hand and rubbed his eyes. All the happiness she’d seen in him the last week had evaporated. His shoulders slumped. His eyes looked so sad. “I was scared you wouldn’t understand. You wouldn’t accept me after what’s happened. What I’ve become. I’m so relieved.” “That I don’t want to ostracize you or put a stake through your bloodsucking heart? That I still love you as a brother should and that I’m going to help?” “Yes.” “What else would I do? You’re my sister. You and the kids are all I have left of my family. I wouldn’t let you or them down. No way. I’m in for the long haul. I love you.” “Thank you, Joey.” She would have hugged him but was afraid to. He seemed edgy. “I love you, too.” “Is there anything I can do now? Anything at all?” She’d thought long and hard about that before she’d called him. “No. Be there for me. Keep loving me and the kids. Help me fight this scourge or learn to live with it. Keep an eye on me. In case. You know.” She tensed up. “Be ready to take the children if things go really wrong.” “Take the children?” She refilled his coffee cup. Outside birds were singing and a parade of dried leaves flew by the window. The seasons and the world went on as they always had. Uncaring about humans and their trivial affairs. Their sorrows or tribulations. “You know, take them to live with you and Laurie if I can’t beat this thing.” He was shaking his head, then got it. “Oh, if you have to go away or if…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. They looked at each other. If she could have cried, she would have. “It won’t come to that. I know it,” he insisted. “We’ll find a way out of this, I promise. We’ll research. Dig. There’s got to be something or someone that can help you. We’ll find an expert who’ll know how to deal with these things.” “Yeah, sure, we’ll find a witch or something,” she said mockingly, “who can change me back into a human or send me backward in time so I can keep it from happening. Fat chance.” “Aah, I don’t think that’s possible.” Joey had no sense of humor. She forced a smile out of her lips. “A long shot, I know.” “Except for disliking the sun, your white skin–and plenty of people have pale skin–you don’t seem too different, Sis.” “You should see me killing and sucking the blood out of the wild animals I catch.” “You have fangs and everything?” “They’re growing. Only come out when I feed.” He blinked. “Your eyes are different.” “I know. They glitter.” “Not a lot. Just don’t look directly at people for too long.” “I’ll try not to. It’s kinda hard if you don’t look at people when they’re speaking to you. Makes them think you aren’t paying attention, you’re rude or you’re hiding something.” “There’s that, you’re right. Sunglasses?” “Outside, perhaps. Inside it’s the other side of eccentric.” He laughed meekly and came to his feet. “I have to get back to the diner for the lunch rush. Is there anything I can do for you now?” “No. I had to tell you, that’s all. You needed to know. I needed help. Support. Thank you for coming.” “I’ll phone you later. In the meantime, I’ll try to come up with some ideas. I’ll put my thinking cap on.” They smiled together at the reference to an old television show they used to watch as kids. “All right,” she said. “I’ve already spent hours reading dusty books and scouring the Internet for anything that might help, but so far zippo. Apparently vampires only exist in fiction novels, movies and in Stephanie Meyer’s vivid imagination.” “Wouldn’t she be surprised?” “No doubt.” He threw his arms around her and gave her a big hug before he left. She knew he was afraid of her, but he did it anyway. He loved her that much. Feeling better now that someone knew her secret, was on her side, her fingers motioned goodbye as he drove away. She wasn’t alone any longer. Still the doubts snuck back in. What was he thinking now? That the attack and the coma had addled her brain, made her delusional, or that, wow, did they have a huge problem on their backs? She could have showed him her fangs, but she hadn’t learned how to make them appear without biting into something. Anyway, that would have scared him even more. He hadn’t asked about the three dead people and she hadn’t brought it up. Hadn’t he made the connection or had he been too freaked out to broach the subject under the circumstances? Probably the latter. If she’d been in his shoes she would have been freaked out, too. After all, he’d seen firsthand, as she had, what vampires were capable of. Endless carnage and heartless bloodshed. Insidious powers a normal gun or knife couldn’t fight. The rest of the day she painted walls, baseboards, and drove herself nuts going over everything again and again. She didn’t know what the hell to do. Please, let Joey think of something. The ringing of the telephone interrupted and, laying down the paintbrush, she answered it. It was the school. Contrary to what she’d been told a few days earlier when she’d called them they did need her to show up in person to sign the kids’ enrollment papers. They asked her to come in, sooner the better. Today would be better. She didn’t want to go into town and mingle with people but didn’t see a way out of it. So she cleaned up, grabbed her hat and sunglasses, and drove into Summer Haven. It was a bright sunny day so she wore long sleeves and blue jeans. Parking the car beneath lofty shade trees, she rushed into the building. She’d never get used to avoiding the sun, which she loved. And beaches. Water. What would she do if she got to the point where she couldn’t tolerate the sunlight at all? Don’t think about that. Not now. The school, a brick oblong with rolls of identical windows, was the same building she’d gone to years before but it’d been remodeled, modernized, and was as good as new inside. It felt strange entering the doors. She was relieved that no invisible wall stopped her. She walked right in. Must be because it was a public building. She signed what she had to sign in a cubby hole of an office, quickly snooped around, liked what she saw (everything spic and span and friendly faces) and scooted out of there. The library. She decided to see if there were any more books she could check out about vampires. Her last visit had been so rushed. What she hadn’t found on the Internet might be inside a dusty old tome high on a shelf somewhere. Not everything written about vampires had to be romances. Somewhere, sometime, someone must have written something she could use to fight what was happening to her. Something real. So it was worth at least another look. Vampires did exist so it stood to reason others had discovered that truth as well and lived to tell or write about it. Well, she could hope, couldn’t she? The library was cool and dim. Taking off her hat, she left the sunglasses on. She located a handful of hardbacks seeming more serious than the fluff she’d taken out before or had read about on the Web and checked them out on her shiny new library card, which had been waiting at the front desk for her. One of the books was tattered; its pages brown-edged with age, and had been written by some hoity-toity professor from Harvard. The cover wasn’t sensational, no lurid pictures of blood-dripping and fanged monsters, but simply silver embossed words on black: Vampires. They Exist. Hmm, there might be something in it she could use. Jenny thought she recognized the older lady taking care of her as someone who’d worked there when she’d been a kid–or looked like that other woman anyway. Tall, skinny, with ash gray hair in a bun, gold rimmed glasses; dowdy dress that could have been in style in the nineteen sixties. Tight smile. She hadn’t been in the library her last visit. The woman gave her a funny look when she saw the titles. “I’m a writer,” Jenny explained. “I write about vampires, ghosts and such.” She lightly tapped the books stacked before her. “This is research.” And, in a way, it was. “Oh, I know who you are. Jenny Lacy.” “Jenny Sanders now.” “Yes, Sanders. You married Jeff Sanders, a local boy…and I’m so sorry to hear of his death.” Jenny barely blinked, inclining her head in assent. “Don’t remember me, huh? I’ve known you since you were a tot. Knew your mom and dad, too.” The woman’s eyes were gentle but knowing. “I’m Mrs. Willard? You used to come in here every Saturday for your books. I never saw a child love to read as much as you did. I wasn’t surprised at all when you became a writer. And I’ve read some of your novels. You’re not much on reality but what a storyteller.” “Oh. Thank you.” Self-conscious for a moment. It’d been a long time since someone had recognized her as an author. “I’m sorry I don’t remember you but I’ve never been good with faces. Or names. My husband used to say it was because I’m always making up names and descriptions for my fictitious characters so my mind gets confused and forgets the real ones.” “That’s all right. I have a forgettable face. But that’s as imaginative an excuse as I’ve ever heard.” The woman’s quick smile told Jenny she was forgiven for not recognizing her. “I heard you and your two children had moved back here.” Small towns. Nothing stayed a secret. “We’re living in my mom and dad’s farmhouse out on Suncrest Road. Fixing it up. It needs it.” “Hmm.” The look on the librarian’s face became guarded. “Hmm what?” “Well, I’m not one to spread unfounded gossip but since you’re living there now and you’re a writer you might be interested. Rumor is your farmhouse is haunted.” “Haunted?” A shiver rippled across the skin of her neck. “With…?” “Ghosts. So they say.” Weren’t vampires enough? Now there were translucent dead, too? Oh, great. “Who says?” “Well.” The woman, eyes shifting to a person browsing through the aisle to her left then to man clicking away on one of the library’s new computers in the corner acted as if she didn’t want to tell her, and it disturbed Jenny. “Well?” The woman cleared her throat softly. “Townsfolk say they’ve heard crying from the empty farmhouse during the day. Voices. Creepy noises. They’ve driven or walked by at night and seen strange lights moving around in the windows. There have been lots of such stories. For years.” Joey had the electricity turned on only last week. What was the woman talking about? Jenny didn’t move. Standing there, she’d scooped up her books and cradled them in her arms. An eerie feeling came over her. “That was probably my brother Joey stumbling around in the house with a flashlight.” “At two o’clock in the morning?” “Joey has weird working hours at his diner. And he’s a night person.” The woman gave her a cynical look. “Some people have heard horses neighing behind your house, as well, and there aren’t any horses out that way. Not anymore, anyway.” Jenny shrugged. “It was an old abandoned house. People sometimes think they’re haunted.” “Not all houses have that place’s history, though. Your mother and father?” Jenny knew what she meant. To the townspeople, person or persons unknown murdered her parents. But no one now but Joey and she knew the murders, all the murders which had taken place that long ago summer, had been done by vampires. Officially they remained unsolved. Deadly mysteries. No wonder people believed the Lacy farmhouse was haunted. “Well, I’ve been living there for a few days and haven’t heard or seen a thing. No lights. No ghosts of my dead parents hovering around. So there. Nothing strange going on at all.” Except she was a vampire, haunted the woods and fields at night herself snuffing out tiny animals for their life’s blood, and she lived in the house. But that was another story altogether. “Anyway, I’ll divulge a secret. Ghosts don’t exist.” With what she hoped was a whimsical shrug she asked, “Do you believe in them?” Mrs. Willard smiled. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” Jenny stared at her. Odd answer. “Only if you want me to know.” “A discussion for another time. Right now I have work to do.” The woman turned to the computer and started keying something in. “I’m sure I’ll see you again. You being a writer, loving books and all.” Her gentle laughter was good-natured. Then Jenny remembered Mrs. Willard. A lot of people had thought she was a little more than eccentric. She lived by herself in a rambling Victorian behemoth on the edge of town. She’d never remarried after her husband had died when she was in her twenties. Her life, her world, had been, and apparently still was, the library. Classic librarian. From the old school. These days Jenny was used to seeing young people scurrying around and working in a library. Out with the old, in with the young. Wasn’t that the way of the world. “Okay then. See you soon.” Hugging the books closely, Jenny exited the building. The day had grown overcast while she’d been inside. The clouds scudded across the slate sky and created puddles of shadows. The world had melted into an early dusk. Jenny breathed a sigh of relief because in the last week the sun had become her enemy. She couldn’t stop mulling over what Mrs. Willard had said about ghosts in the farmhouse. What if it weren’t ghosts at all? What if it was? Who were they and what did they want? Oh, please. Didn’t she have enough problems? There was sudden movement in the corner of her eye. Quick as she twisted her head, sharp as her sight had become, she barely caught the silhouetted figure before it merged into the grove of trees behind the library. Someone was stalking her. It wasn’t the first time she’d seen a figure or felt watched. So many times, out in the night woods, she could have sworn someone or something was tracking her. If only she could remember. But it was creeping her out and damned if she was going to put up with it any longer. Tossing the books and her purse in the car, she chased after the intruder. She didn’t catch him. He evaporated into the forest like a mist. After running around in circles for way too long, she returned to the car and headed to the farmhouse. Wondering what that had been about. At home she kept busy as her mind plagued her with what she was going to do about her vampirism and how her brother was handling it. She kept expecting him to call or drop by. Knowing him, what she’d confessed that morning would sooner or later come to a boil and he’d be on her doorstep with more questions and fears. She was right. Later that night after the children were in bed, after she’d taken her run out in the woods and the diner had been closed a half-hour, he rapped on her door. He was mutely red-eyed and she knew he was upset. The reality of what had befallen her–them–had hit home. “I had to see you, Jenny. We need to talk.” “I know.” She let him in and they went into the kitchen. They sat down. The house was silent. The night, for once, was, too. She’d fed and it’d filled her belly and calmed her nerves. “You know about the recent murders around town, don’t you?” Her hands were folded before her on the table, her eyes on her brother’s frightened face. “I knew about them this morning, too. I just….” She inhaled slowly, a wretchedness she was beginning to know all too well revisiting. “Hadn’t made the connection yet. Afraid to ask me about them, right?” “Right.” “But you have anyway.” She leveled her eyes at him. “It wasn’t me, Joey. I’ve thought and thought about it and I’m pretty sure it wasn’t me. I didn’t kill those people.” “Pretty sure? You said you’ve had blackouts.” “I have. But I don’t think I’ve been out killing people. I’d feel it here if I had.” She laid a hand over her heart. “And there’s something else. Someone’s stalking me. I’ve suspected it, sort of, for days but this morning I saw him outside the library. He was inhumanly tall. He moved like some horror movie apparition with lightning speed. I lost him in that patch of woods behind the building.” “Could be he’s who the cops are looking for.” His voice was hopeful, latching on to any other possibility for the slayings other than his sister was a cold-blood murderess. “Could be. Isn’t it conveniently coincidental that someone is following me, with what’s happened and all, skulking around town, and people are ending up dead?” “Or not,” Joey countered. “Or not.” She cocked her head, listening to the night beyond the walls. Something or someone was moving out there somewhere. Suddenly her body was on alert. Danger. Danger. “You’re scared of me, aren’t you?” She posed the question she’d been dreading. He took too long to answer. “No. You’re my sister. I know you wouldn’t hurt me.” “Scared, tell me the truth now,” she smiled sadly, “a little?” “A little.” He spread two of his fingers about an inch apart. She got up, walked to the window and stared out. “Don’t be. I might be one of them,” she couldn’t say the word, “but I’m still me, too. Like I said I love you. You’ll always be safe from me. One way or another. “Is that what you were worried about? Why you came over?” Outside there were shadows shape shifting among the stark trees and a low hissing as if someone were angrily whispering far away. She tried to make sense of the black noise, form it into words, something she could understand. But couldn’t. “I agonized all day over what you told me this morning and I had to see how you were doing. If I’d heard what I thought I’d heard. You’re a…vampire.” She laughed humorlessly. “Oh, you heard right.” “And to tell you a Detective Ben Bradley from St. Louis telephoned me today. Asked a mess of questions about you. He wanted your new cell, home phone number and address.” “You gave it to him?” “What do you think? Not to would have raised suspicion. He’ll probably phone you.” “He probably will.” She hazily recalled the detective as a polite man with melancholy eyes who’d visited in the hospital and wanted her to remember more of what had happened the night of the attack. It seemed so long ago. Coma-stunned and still reeling from her ordeal, she hadn’t been able to dredge up much of anything. Not then anyway. “Do you think he knows about the disappearances and new murders here?” Joey gave her something else to fret about. “Police communicate by computers now and talk among themselves. Compare assault and murder statistics. Look for threads.” Oh boy. “I don’t know, even if he’s aware of the murders why would he want to talk to me?” “Just a thought,” Joey said. “Nah, he probably wants to ask me more questions about the attack. Follow up, that’s all.” Or so she hoped, but she had a bad feeling. What if the detective did know about the recent murders and had made the link to the St. Louis attack and somehow to her? Not likely. How could he? There were still too many missing pieces–or were there? “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be cool when I talk to him. Pretend I haven’t remembered anything else.” That was easy to do on the telephone. Long distance. She was getting good at hiding her true emotions. With his confusion and concern, her brother looked older. Or perhaps it was her acute eyesight. “Then I won’t worry about it. I just thought I’d give you a heads up.” “Thanks.” “But I am really bothered about what’s happening here. The murders. What do you think is going on? Who could be doing them?” “I wish I knew.” She had a theory but it was too scary to dwell on for long. “Me, too. The town is spooked. People are staying inside because they’re scared, especially at night. Boy, does this feel familiar.” A faint sneer formed on his lips. He didn’t have to say the words: It’s just like twelve years ago but she heard them in her head anyway. “Yep, Déjà vu. Be careful out there, Joey. I mean it. Something’s not right.” “You’re telling me?” He tugged at his ear and let out a breath. “Enough bad news, I got to get home. Laurie’s waiting up for me.” He slowly rose to his feet. At the door he stopped. “Andy was in tonight. It’s dreadful about him losing his job.” “I know. He came by and told me about it.” “Hmmm. Interesting. He came by here? When?” “The day he lost his job. He said he needed someone to talk to.” “You know he’s always had a crush on you.” “On me?” “When we were kids he always asked about you. Almost asked you out for a date once.” “You’re kidding? I never knew that. Why didn’t he?” “You began dating Jeff and married him if I recollect correctly. When your first book came out Andy bought it and had me send it to you to autograph. And every book you wrote after it. I guess you don’t remember that, huh?” “Sorry. No. It was a lifetime ago it seems like when I was an author.” She changed the subject. “Speaking of Andy, how’s he doing?” “After losing his job and it had time to sink in? Devastated. I’ve never seen him so depressed. That guy loved his job. Loved that bank. A proud man, it defined him. I don’t know what he’s going to do. There’re no jobs around here. None that would suit him. His family trust fund dried up years ago so now he’s like the rest of us. Scrambling to make a living. “I’m so sick of this recession. More like a depression,” he groused. “One night I saw a man rummaging through our dumpster. The dumpster. Where is it going to end?” “I don’t know.” She wouldn’t meet his eyes, shifted from foot to foot, her hand on the door. She had to find a job. She’d lost her home, too. And until her house sold in Millstadt she was basically broke. Jeff’s small life insurance payout was about gone and her bank balance was low. “Oh, I’m sorry, Sis. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. You’re going to find a job. I know it. There’s one out there somewhere for a woman as smart as you.” How about one for a vampire? Not likely. “Yeah, sure. How about a night job? Guarding a blood bank in some hospital? A very big hospital.” So a couple of missing bags of blood a night wouldn’t tip them off. “Out of town, of course.” Her brother actually forced out a laugh. He still regarded her with wary eyes. It broke her heart. He was scared of her and what she’d become. Could be he’d never get over it. “Before I go,” he murmured, “how are you doing?” He reached out and when his flesh touched hers she saw the sorrow in his eyes. Her skin was as cold as snow-covered stone. “Coping. Barely. So far I’ve resisted the urge to suck a human dry or knock my brains out. I get my nourishment from running down terrified animals like a wild beast and sinking my fangs into them. As I learn to control my hunger, I’m trying not to kill them, just drink enough to sustain me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. “But, oh Joey,” her disgust must have shown in her expression, “What’ll I do if I go bonkers and start randomly killing people like those other vampires we destroyed years ago? I’m only still here because of you and the kids. I love you too much to leave. Otherwise I’d be gone or I’d kill myself.” “God, Jenny, don’t do that!” he cried. “I couldn’t bear it. Have patience. Hang on. We’ll figure something out, I swear.” “Joey, why did this have to happen to me? What have I done so wrong that I deserve it? Weren’t the attack and my coma, Jeff’s death enough? Haven’t I suffered enough?” She felt like ranting at the sky and did every night, deep in the woods where no one would hear. “It’ll be okay, Sis.” She could hear the desperation in his voice. “I took off from the diner tonight. Told Laurie I wasn’t feeling well. I’ve been researching on the Internet; reading stuff. Looking for an answer.” “Me, too. You discover anything we don’t already know?” “Not so far. I’m still looking. I won’t give up until I find something or someone that can help you.” “Thanks Joey. I love you, you know that?” “I know that. And back at ya.” When he was gone she tried to sleep. To hide. Sleep kept her from thinking about how messed up her life was. Kept her from probing for solutions she couldn’t find. Things would look better tomorrow. Or she prayed so.",

      "content": "Chapter 7 Jenny Teddy and Sarah had no trouble catching the school bus when it lurched to a stop at the end of the driveway. Vacation had lasted long enough and they were ready to resume their children’s lives. They missed their old friends, their routines, and were looking forward to forming new ones. Hiding in the shadows behind the door, she watched them skip down the driveway and climb onto the bus. Sarah had decided against the sunflower dress in favor of a dark purple one with black leggings. A black and purple bracelet. The Twilight influence again. All those dark colors. For Jenny, the girl couldn’t grow out of it too soon. Before he got on the bus, Teddy pivoted and glanced at the house. The look on his face apprehensive. With her new eyes she could see his expression clear as day. He was worried about her. The strange way she’d been acting. Her appearance. Perhaps he’d woke up and found her gone at night. Something about the way he looked at her in the morning. He’s hesitant to ask what’s wrong. Does he wonder what she does outside alone in the woods. He’s afraid of her. Oh, no. After the bus drove off she closed the door and telephoned Joey. “Hi Joey. How’s it going?” “Same old same old, you know. Business is steady. Meatloaf special today and we’re finishing up the breakfast crowd so we can start cooking tons of modified hamburger. “Laurie’s changed her hair color again. Next time you see her she’ll be a flaming redhead. It looks ridiculous, her head’s on fire, but please don’t tell her that. Pretend it looks just beautiful.” “I’ll do that.” In the background she could hear the light banter of customers and the clatter of silverware. Laurie yelling an order in. Scrambled eggs and toast. “What can I do for you? Cause you never call this early unless you want something.” There was good-natured humor in his voice. Basically Joey was a happy person. Or he was now. After she told him what she was going to tell him. Not so much. “Can you come over? Right now? There’s something really important I need to discuss with you.” “Right now…at eight o’clock in the morning…before our breakfast rush is over?” “Yes, please.” “Whoa, this must be important.” “Oh, it is. You have no idea. Please?” “I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Fire up the coffee and I’ll bring donuts.” “None for me, Brother. Just for you,” she imparted sadly. “Hurry.” She hung up, got out of her robe and dressed. She was feeling even stranger than usual. Frighteningly detached. Increasingly restless. The lure of fresh blood, the hunt, was so strong; the urge to start running and never stop beat at her until she thought she’d go crazy. To be free of all human ties and restrictions. Feed. Be free. Feed. Free. The only thing that kept her there was Teddy and Sarah. Joey. Fear of the unknown. What her life might now become. Otherwise, she’d be gone. She had the oddest thought. When she’d been a child she’d seen this old science fiction movie about this man who’d been affected by radiation or something and then began to shrink. He got smaller and smaller and smaller. He lost his wife, his family, his career and finally his very way of life. It was as if he ceased to exist as a man. In the end he was so tiny, miniscule really, that he had no idea what his future, his life, would become. She felt like that microscopic man…on the threshold of a new world. She didn’t know if she should be terrified, resigned or awed. *** An hour later, at the kitchen table with shadows crowding around them (all the curtains were tightly closed), Joey stared at her, his face tinged with horrified pity as he tried to hide another emotion. Fear. The bag of donuts untouched. She’d confessed everything. What she believed had happened during the attack in St. Louis. Her discovery of what she was becoming, her growing strength and powers; her night hunts for animals to feed on. Her blackouts. Most of her fears. “Oh, my God, Jenny.” At first he’d recoiled, shifting his body away as if she’d had the plague. Slowly, as they talked, he stopped moving away. When she reached out her hand, her eyes pleading for understanding and comfort, he took it. “That explains the absence of an appetite, I guess. Your moodiness. Paleness. Aversion to the sun. Oh, my God.” “You saw all that?” “Of course, I did. You never wore hats or sunglasses much before. In the beginning I thought you were hiding tear-swollen eyes. Hiding the grief over losing Jeff. Aftereffects of your trauma and coma. I did wonder, though. You haven’t really been yourself lately. Not since the–” “Attack? Jeff’s death? The coma?” “Yeah. All of those.” There was a hesitation she caught in his reply. She could smell the fear on him. “I won’t hurt you, Joey,” she spoke in a whisper, her gaze on his face. “I love you. It seems to make the difference. I can control it so far. Or I think I can. That’s the problem. I’m changing rapidly now and I’m scared. I have these,” her voice trailed off, “blackouts.” He was thoughtful for a minute and finally said, “We’ll find a way to beat it. I swear. We’ll find a cure. Or something. “But right now I need time to wrap my head around this. Some time to think.” He squeezed her hand, reassuringly. “I don’t believe this has happened. Not to you. Of all the people in the world, after all you’ve been through,” he shook his head, “not to you.” “Join the club. I can’t believe it either. Ironic, huh? Long ago I hunted and killed vampires and now I am one. Ha, ha. Every day I open my eyes and think it’s been a really bad dream. I wake up all the way and–whoops–it isn’t a nightmare at all. It’s my life.” “God’s got a mean sense of humor.” “God had nothing to do with this.” She couldn’t help it, her bitterness oozed through. “I’m so sorry.” He released her hand and rubbed his eyes. All the happiness she’d seen in him the last week had evaporated. His shoulders slumped. His eyes looked so sad. “I was scared you wouldn’t understand. You wouldn’t accept me after what’s happened. What I’ve become. I’m so relieved.” “That I don’t want to ostracize you or put a stake through your bloodsucking heart? That I still love you as a brother should and that I’m going to help?” “Yes.” “What else would I do? You’re my sister. You and the kids are all I have left of my family. I wouldn’t let you or them down. No way. I’m in for the long haul. I love you.” “Thank you, Joey.” She would have hugged him but was afraid to. He seemed edgy. “I love you, too.” “Is there anything I can do now? Anything at all?” She’d thought long and hard about that before she’d called him. “No. Be there for me. Keep loving me and the kids. Help me fight this scourge or learn to live with it. Keep an eye on me. In case. You know.” She tensed up. “Be ready to take the children if things go really wrong.” “Take the children?” She refilled his coffee cup. Outside birds were singing and a parade of dried leaves flew by the window. The seasons and the world went on as they always had. Uncaring about humans and their trivial affairs. Their sorrows or tribulations. “You know, take them to live with you and Laurie if I can’t beat this thing.” He was shaking his head, then got it. “Oh, if you have to go away or if…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. They looked at each other. If she could have cried, she would have. “It won’t come to that. I know it,” he insisted. “We’ll find a way out of this, I promise. We’ll research. Dig. There’s got to be something or someone that can help you. We’ll find an expert who’ll know how to deal with these things.” “Yeah, sure, we’ll find a witch or something,” she said mockingly, “who can change me back into a human or send me backward in time so I can keep it from happening. Fat chance.” “Aah, I don’t think that’s possible.” Joey had no sense of humor. She forced a smile out of her lips. “A long shot, I know.” “Except for disliking the sun, your white skin–and plenty of people have pale skin–you don’t seem too different, Sis.” “You should see me killing and sucking the blood out of the wild animals I catch.” “You have fangs and everything?” “They’re growing. Only come out when I feed.” He blinked. “Your eyes are different.” “I know. They glitter.” “Not a lot. Just don’t look directly at people for too long.” “I’ll try not to. It’s kinda hard if you don’t look at people when they’re speaking to you. Makes them think you aren’t paying attention, you’re rude or you’re hiding something.” “There’s that, you’re right. Sunglasses?” “Outside, perhaps. Inside it’s the other side of eccentric.” He laughed meekly and came to his feet. “I have to get back to the diner for the lunch rush. Is there anything I can do for you now?” “No. I had to tell you, that’s all. You needed to know. I needed help. Support. Thank you for coming.” “I’ll phone you later. In the meantime, I’ll try to come up with some ideas. I’ll put my thinking cap on.” They smiled together at the reference to an old television show they used to watch as kids. “All right,” she said. “I’ve already spent hours reading dusty books and scouring the Internet for anything that might help, but so far zippo. Apparently vampires only exist in fiction novels, movies and in Stephanie Meyer’s vivid imagination.” “Wouldn’t she be surprised?” “No doubt.” He threw his arms around her and gave her a big hug before he left. She knew he was afraid of her, but he did it anyway. He loved her that much. Feeling better now that someone knew her secret, was on her side, her fingers motioned goodbye as he drove away. She wasn’t alone any longer. Still the doubts snuck back in. What was he thinking now? That the attack and the coma had addled her brain, made her delusional, or that, wow, did they have a huge problem on their backs? She could have showed him her fangs, but she hadn’t learned how to make them appear without biting into something. Anyway, that would have scared him even more. He hadn’t asked about the three dead people and she hadn’t brought it up. Hadn’t he made the connection or had he been too freaked out to broach the subject under the circumstances? Probably the latter. If she’d been in his shoes she would have been freaked out, too. After all, he’d seen firsthand, as she had, what vampires were capable of. Endless carnage and heartless bloodshed. Insidious powers a normal gun or knife couldn’t fight. The rest of the day she painted walls, baseboards, and drove herself nuts going over everything again and again. She didn’t know what the hell to do. Please, let Joey think of something. The ringing of the telephone interrupted and, laying down the paintbrush, she answered it. It was the school. Contrary to what she’d been told a few days earlier when she’d called them they did need her to show up in person to sign the kids’ enrollment papers. They asked her to come in, sooner the better. Today would be better. She didn’t want to go into town and mingle with people but didn’t see a way out of it. So she cleaned up, grabbed her hat and sunglasses, and drove into Summer Haven. It was a bright sunny day so she wore long sleeves and blue jeans. Parking the car beneath lofty shade trees, she rushed into the building. She’d never get used to avoiding the sun, which she loved. And beaches. Water. What would she do if she got to the point where she couldn’t tolerate the sunlight at all? Don’t think about that. Not now. The school, a brick oblong with rolls of identical windows, was the same building she’d gone to years before but it’d been remodeled, modernized, and was as good as new inside. It felt strange entering the doors. She was relieved that no invisible wall stopped her. She walked right in. Must be because it was a public building. She signed what she had to sign in a cubby hole of an office, quickly snooped around, liked what she saw (everything spic and span and friendly faces) and scooted out of there. The library. She decided to see if there were any more books she could check out about vampires. Her last visit had been so rushed. What she hadn’t found on the Internet might be inside a dusty old tome high on a shelf somewhere. Not everything written about vampires had to be romances. Somewhere, sometime, someone must have written something she could use to fight what was happening to her. Something real. So it was worth at least another look. Vampires did exist so it stood to reason others had discovered that truth as well and lived to tell or write about it. Well, she could hope, couldn’t she? The library was cool and dim. Taking off her hat, she left the sunglasses on. She located a handful of hardbacks seeming more serious than the fluff she’d taken out before or had read about on the Web and checked them out on her shiny new library card, which had been waiting at the front desk for her. One of the books was tattered; its pages brown-edged with age, and had been written by some hoity-toity professor from Harvard. The cover wasn’t sensational, no lurid pictures of blood-dripping and fanged monsters, but simply silver embossed words on black: Vampires. They Exist. Hmm, there might be something in it she could use. Jenny thought she recognized the older lady taking care of her as someone who’d worked there when she’d been a kid–or looked like that other woman anyway. Tall, skinny, with ash gray hair in a bun, gold rimmed glasses; dowdy dress that could have been in style in the nineteen sixties. Tight smile. She hadn’t been in the library her last visit. The woman gave her a funny look when she saw the titles. “I’m a writer,” Jenny explained. “I write about vampires, ghosts and such.” She lightly tapped the books stacked before her. “This is research.” And, in a way, it was. “Oh, I know who you are. Jenny Lacy.” “Jenny Sanders now.” “Yes, Sanders. You married Jeff Sanders, a local boy…and I’m so sorry to hear of his death.” Jenny barely blinked, inclining her head in assent. “Don’t remember me, huh? I’ve known you since you were a tot. Knew your mom and dad, too.” The woman’s eyes were gentle but knowing. “I’m Mrs. Willard? You used to come in here every Saturday for your books. I never saw a child love to read as much as you did. I wasn’t surprised at all when you became a writer. And I’ve read some of your novels. You’re not much on reality but what a storyteller.” “Oh. Thank you.” Self-conscious for a moment. It’d been a long time since someone had recognized her as an author. “I’m sorry I don’t remember you but I’ve never been good with faces. Or names. My husband used to say it was because I’m always making up names and descriptions for my fictitious characters so my mind gets confused and forgets the real ones.” “That’s all right. I have a forgettable face. But that’s as imaginative an excuse as I’ve ever heard.” The woman’s quick smile told Jenny she was forgiven for not recognizing her. “I heard you and your two children had moved back here.” Small towns. Nothing stayed a secret. “We’re living in my mom and dad’s farmhouse out on Suncrest Road. Fixing it up. It needs it.” “Hmm.” The look on the librarian’s face became guarded. “Hmm what?” “Well, I’m not one to spread unfounded gossip but since you’re living there now and you’re a writer you might be interested. Rumor is your farmhouse is haunted.” “Haunted?” A shiver rippled across the skin of her neck. “With…?” “Ghosts. So they say.” Weren’t vampires enough? Now there were translucent dead, too? Oh, great. “Who says?” “Well.” The woman, eyes shifting to a person browsing through the aisle to her left then to man clicking away on one of the library’s new computers in the corner acted as if she didn’t want to tell her, and it disturbed Jenny. “Well?” The woman cleared her throat softly. “Townsfolk say they’ve heard crying from the empty farmhouse during the day. Voices. Creepy noises. They’ve driven or walked by at night and seen strange lights moving around in the windows. There have been lots of such stories. For years.” Joey had the electricity turned on only last week. What was the woman talking about? Jenny didn’t move. Standing there, she’d scooped up her books and cradled them in her arms. An eerie feeling came over her. “That was probably my brother Joey stumbling around in the house with a flashlight.” “At two o’clock in the morning?” “Joey has weird working hours at his diner. And he’s a night person.” The woman gave her a cynical look. “Some people have heard horses neighing behind your house, as well, and there aren’t any horses out that way. Not anymore, anyway.” Jenny shrugged. “It was an old abandoned house. People sometimes think they’re haunted.” “Not all houses have that place’s history, though. Your mother and father?” Jenny knew what she meant. To the townspeople, person or persons unknown murdered her parents. But no one now but Joey and she knew the murders, all the murders which had taken place that long ago summer, had been done by vampires. Officially they remained unsolved. Deadly mysteries. No wonder people believed the Lacy farmhouse was haunted. “Well, I’ve been living there for a few days and haven’t heard or seen a thing. No lights. No ghosts of my dead parents hovering around. So there. Nothing strange going on at all.” Except she was a vampire, haunted the woods and fields at night herself snuffing out tiny animals for their life’s blood, and she lived in the house. But that was another story altogether. “Anyway, I’ll divulge a secret. Ghosts don’t exist.” With what she hoped was a whimsical shrug she asked, “Do you believe in them?” Mrs. Willard smiled. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” Jenny stared at her. Odd answer. “Only if you want me to know.” “A discussion for another time. Right now I have work to do.” The woman turned to the computer and started keying something in. “I’m sure I’ll see you again. You being a writer, loving books and all.” Her gentle laughter was good-natured. Then Jenny remembered Mrs. Willard. A lot of people had thought she was a little more than eccentric. She lived by herself in a rambling Victorian behemoth on the edge of town. She’d never remarried after her husband had died when she was in her twenties. Her life, her world, had been, and apparently still was, the library. Classic librarian. From the old school. These days Jenny was used to seeing young people scurrying around and working in a library. Out with the old, in with the young. Wasn’t that the way of the world. “Okay then. See you soon.” Hugging the books closely, Jenny exited the building. The day had grown overcast while she’d been inside. The clouds scudded across the slate sky and created puddles of shadows. The world had melted into an early dusk. Jenny breathed a sigh of relief because in the last week the sun had become her enemy. She couldn’t stop mulling over what Mrs. Willard had said about ghosts in the farmhouse. What if it weren’t ghosts at all? What if it was? Who were they and what did they want? Oh, please. Didn’t she have enough problems? There was sudden movement in the corner of her eye. Quick as she twisted her head, sharp as her sight had become, she barely caught the silhouetted figure before it merged into the grove of trees behind the library. Someone was stalking her. It wasn’t the first time she’d seen a figure or felt watched. So many times, out in the night woods, she could have sworn someone or something was tracking her. If only she could remember. But it was creeping her out and damned if she was going to put up with it any longer. Tossing the books and her purse in the car, she chased after the intruder. She didn’t catch him. He evaporated into the forest like a mist. After running around in circles for way too long, she returned to the car and headed to the farmhouse. Wondering what that had been about. At home she kept busy as her mind plagued her with what she was going to do about her vampirism and how her brother was handling it. She kept expecting him to call or drop by. Knowing him, what she’d confessed that morning would sooner or later come to a boil and he’d be on her doorstep with more questions and fears. She was right. Later that night after the children were in bed, after she’d taken her run out in the woods and the diner had been closed a half-hour, he rapped on her door. He was mutely red-eyed and she knew he was upset. The reality of what had befallen her–them–had hit home. “I had to see you, Jenny. We need to talk.” “I know.” She let him in and they went into the kitchen. They sat down. The house was silent. The night, for once, was, too. She’d fed and it’d filled her belly and calmed her nerves. “You know about the recent murders around town, don’t you?” Her hands were folded before her on the table, her eyes on her brother’s frightened face. “I knew about them this morning, too. I just….” She inhaled slowly, a wretchedness she was beginning to know all too well revisiting. “Hadn’t made the connection yet. Afraid to ask me about them, right?” “Right.” “But you have anyway.” She leveled her eyes at him. “It wasn’t me, Joey. I’ve thought and thought about it and I’m pretty sure it wasn’t me. I didn’t kill those people.” “Pretty sure? You said you’ve had blackouts.” “I have. But I don’t think I’ve been out killing people. I’d feel it here if I had.” She laid a hand over her heart. “And there’s something else. Someone’s stalking me. I’ve suspected it, sort of, for days but this morning I saw him outside the library. He was inhumanly tall. He moved like some horror movie apparition with lightning speed. I lost him in that patch of woods behind the building.” “Could be he’s who the cops are looking for.” His voice was hopeful, latching on to any other possibility for the slayings other than his sister was a cold-blood murderess. “Could be. Isn’t it conveniently coincidental that someone is following me, with what’s happened and all, skulking around town, and people are ending up dead?” “Or not,” Joey countered. “Or not.” She cocked her head, listening to the night beyond the walls. Something or someone was moving out there somewhere. Suddenly her body was on alert. Danger. Danger. “You’re scared of me, aren’t you?” She posed the question she’d been dreading. He took too long to answer. “No. You’re my sister. I know you wouldn’t hurt me.” “Scared, tell me the truth now,” she smiled sadly, “a little?” “A little.” He spread two of his fingers about an inch apart. She got up, walked to the window and stared out. “Don’t be. I might be one of them,” she couldn’t say the word, “but I’m still me, too. Like I said I love you. You’ll always be safe from me. One way or another. “Is that what you were worried about? Why you came over?” Outside there were shadows shape shifting among the stark trees and a low hissing as if someone were angrily whispering far away. She tried to make sense of the black noise, form it into words, something she could understand. But couldn’t. “I agonized all day over what you told me this morning and I had to see how you were doing. If I’d heard what I thought I’d heard. You’re a…vampire.” She laughed humorlessly. “Oh, you heard right.” “And to tell you a Detective Ben Bradley from St. Louis telephoned me today. Asked a mess of questions about you. He wanted your new cell, home phone number and address.” “You gave it to him?” “What do you think? Not to would have raised suspicion. He’ll probably phone you.” “He probably will.” She hazily recalled the detective as a polite man with melancholy eyes who’d visited in the hospital and wanted her to remember more of what had happened the night of the attack. It seemed so long ago. Coma-stunned and still reeling from her ordeal, she hadn’t been able to dredge up much of anything. Not then anyway. “Do you think he knows about the disappearances and new murders here?” Joey gave her something else to fret about. “Police communicate by computers now and talk among themselves. Compare assault and murder statistics. Look for threads.” Oh boy. “I don’t know, even if he’s aware of the murders why would he want to talk to me?” “Just a thought,” Joey said. “Nah, he probably wants to ask me more questions about the attack. Follow up, that’s all.” Or so she hoped, but she had a bad feeling. What if the detective did know about the recent murders and had made the link to the St. Louis attack and somehow to her? Not likely. How could he? There were still too many missing pieces–or were there? “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be cool when I talk to him. Pretend I haven’t remembered anything else.” That was easy to do on the telephone. Long distance. She was getting good at hiding her true emotions. With his confusion and concern, her brother looked older. Or perhaps it was her acute eyesight. “Then I won’t worry about it. I just thought I’d give you a heads up.” “Thanks.” “But I am really bothered about what’s happening here. The murders. What do you think is going on? Who could be doing them?” “I wish I knew.” She had a theory but it was too scary to dwell on for long. “Me, too. The town is spooked. People are staying inside because they’re scared, especially at night. Boy, does this feel familiar.” A faint sneer formed on his lips. He didn’t have to say the words: It’s just like twelve years ago but she heard them in her head anyway. “Yep, Déjà vu. Be careful out there, Joey. I mean it. Something’s not right.” “You’re telling me?” He tugged at his ear and let out a breath. “Enough bad news, I got to get home. Laurie’s waiting up for me.” He slowly rose to his feet. At the door he stopped. “Andy was in tonight. It’s dreadful about him losing his job.” “I know. He came by and told me about it.” “Hmmm. Interesting. He came by here? When?” “The day he lost his job. He said he needed someone to talk to.” “You know he’s always had a crush on you.” “On me?” “When we were kids he always asked about you. Almost asked you out for a date once.” “You’re kidding? I never knew that. Why didn’t he?” “You began dating Jeff and married him if I recollect correctly. When your first book came out Andy bought it and had me send it to you to autograph. And every book you wrote after it. I guess you don’t remember that, huh?” “Sorry. No. It was a lifetime ago it seems like when I was an author.” She changed the subject. “Speaking of Andy, how’s he doing?” “After losing his job and it had time to sink in? Devastated. I’ve never seen him so depressed. That guy loved his job. Loved that bank. A proud man, it defined him. I don’t know what he’s going to do. There’re no jobs around here. None that would suit him. His family trust fund dried up years ago so now he’s like the rest of us. Scrambling to make a living. “I’m so sick of this recession. More like a depression,” he groused. “One night I saw a man rummaging through our dumpster. The dumpster. Where is it going to end?” “I don’t know.” She wouldn’t meet his eyes, shifted from foot to foot, her hand on the door. She had to find a job. She’d lost her home, too. And until her house sold in Millstadt she was basically broke. Jeff’s small life insurance payout was about gone and her bank balance was low. “Oh, I’m sorry, Sis. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. You’re going to find a job. I know it. There’s one out there somewhere for a woman as smart as you.” How about one for a vampire? Not likely. “Yeah, sure. How about a night job? Guarding a blood bank in some hospital? A very big hospital.” So a couple of missing bags of blood a night wouldn’t tip them off. “Out of town, of course.” Her brother actually forced out a laugh. He still regarded her with wary eyes. It broke her heart. He was scared of her and what she’d become. Could be he’d never get over it. “Before I go,” he murmured, “how are you doing?” He reached out and when his flesh touched hers she saw the sorrow in his eyes. Her skin was as cold as snow-covered stone. “Coping. Barely. So far I’ve resisted the urge to suck a human dry or knock my brains out. I get my nourishment from running down terrified animals like a wild beast and sinking my fangs into them. As I learn to control my hunger, I’m trying not to kill them, just drink enough to sustain me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. “But, oh Joey,” her disgust must have shown in her expression, “What’ll I do if I go bonkers and start randomly killing people like those other vampires we destroyed years ago? I’m only still here because of you and the kids. I love you too much to leave. Otherwise I’d be gone or I’d kill myself.” “God, Jenny, don’t do that!” he cried. “I couldn’t bear it. Have patience. Hang on. We’ll figure something out, I swear.” “Joey, why did this have to happen to me? What have I done so wrong that I deserve it? Weren’t the attack and my coma, Jeff’s death enough? Haven’t I suffered enough?” She felt like ranting at the sky and did every night, deep in the woods where no one would hear. “It’ll be okay, Sis.” She could hear the desperation in his voice. “I took off from the diner tonight. Told Laurie I wasn’t feeling well. I’ve been researching on the Internet; reading stuff. Looking for an answer.” “Me, too. You discover anything we don’t already know?” “Not so far. I’m still looking. I won’t give up until I find something or someone that can help you.” “Thanks Joey. I love you, you know that?” “I know that. And back at ya.” When he was gone she tried to sleep. To hide. Sleep kept her from thinking about how messed up her life was. Kept her from probing for solutions she couldn’t find. Things would look better tomorrow. Or she prayed so.",

      "content": "Chapter 7 Jenny Teddy and Sarah had no trouble catching the school bus when it lurched to a stop at the end of the driveway. Vacation had lasted long enough and they were ready to resume their children’s lives. They missed their old friends, their routines, and were looking forward to forming new ones. Hiding in the shadows behind the door, she watched them skip down the driveway and climb onto the bus. Sarah had decided against the sunflower dress in favor of a dark purple one with black leggings. A black and purple bracelet. The Twilight influence again. All those dark colors. For Jenny, the girl couldn’t grow out of it too soon. Before he got on the bus, Teddy pivoted and glanced at the house. The look on his face apprehensive. With her new eyes she could see his expression clear as day. He was worried about her. The strange way she’d been acting. Her appearance. Perhaps he’d woke up and found her gone at night. Something about the way he looked at her in the morning. He’s hesitant to ask what’s wrong. Does he wonder what she does outside alone in the woods. He’s afraid of her. Oh, no. After the bus drove off she closed the door and telephoned Joey. “Hi Joey. How’s it going?” “Same old same old, you know. Business is steady. Meatloaf special today and we’re finishing up the breakfast crowd so we can start cooking tons of modified hamburger. “Laurie’s changed her hair color again. Next time you see her she’ll be a flaming redhead. It looks ridiculous, her head’s on fire, but please don’t tell her that. Pretend it looks just beautiful.” “I’ll do that.” In the background she could hear the light banter of customers and the clatter of silverware. Laurie yelling an order in. Scrambled eggs and toast. “What can I do for you? Cause you never call this early unless you want something.” There was good-natured humor in his voice. Basically Joey was a happy person. Or he was now. After she told him what she was going to tell him. Not so much. “Can you come over? Right now? There’s something really important I need to discuss with you.” “Right now…at eight o’clock in the morning…before our breakfast rush is over?” “Yes, please.” “Whoa, this must be important.” “Oh, it is. You have no idea. Please?” “I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Fire up the coffee and I’ll bring donuts.” “None for me, Brother. Just for you,” she imparted sadly. “Hurry.” She hung up, got out of her robe and dressed. She was feeling even stranger than usual. Frighteningly detached. Increasingly restless. The lure of fresh blood, the hunt, was so strong; the urge to start running and never stop beat at her until she thought she’d go crazy. To be free of all human ties and restrictions. Feed. Be free. Feed. Free. The only thing that kept her there was Teddy and Sarah. Joey. Fear of the unknown. What her life might now become. Otherwise, she’d be gone. She had the oddest thought. When she’d been a child she’d seen this old science fiction movie about this man who’d been affected by radiation or something and then began to shrink. He got smaller and smaller and smaller. He lost his wife, his family, his career and finally his very way of life. It was as if he ceased to exist as a man. In the end he was so tiny, miniscule really, that he had no idea what his future, his life, would become. She felt like that microscopic man…on the threshold of a new world. She didn’t know if she should be terrified, resigned or awed. *** An hour later, at the kitchen table with shadows crowding around them (all the curtains were tightly closed), Joey stared at her, his face tinged with horrified pity as he tried to hide another emotion. Fear. The bag of donuts untouched. She’d confessed everything. What she believed had happened during the attack in St. Louis. Her discovery of what she was becoming, her growing strength and powers; her night hunts for animals to feed on. Her blackouts. Most of her fears. “Oh, my God, Jenny.” At first he’d recoiled, shifting his body away as if she’d had the plague. Slowly, as they talked, he stopped moving away. When she reached out her hand, her eyes pleading for understanding and comfort, he took it. “That explains the absence of an appetite, I guess. Your moodiness. Paleness. Aversion to the sun. Oh, my God.” “You saw all that?” “Of course, I did. You never wore hats or sunglasses much before. In the beginning I thought you were hiding tear-swollen eyes. Hiding the grief over losing Jeff. Aftereffects of your trauma and coma. I did wonder, though. You haven’t really been yourself lately. Not since the–” “Attack? Jeff’s death? The coma?” “Yeah. All of those.” There was a hesitation she caught in his reply. She could smell the fear on him. “I won’t hurt you, Joey,” she spoke in a whisper, her gaze on his face. “I love you. It seems to make the difference. I can control it so far. Or I think I can. That’s the problem. I’m changing rapidly now and I’m scared. I have these,” her voice trailed off, “blackouts.” He was thoughtful for a minute and finally said, “We’ll find a way to beat it. I swear. We’ll find a cure. Or something. “But right now I need time to wrap my head around this. Some time to think.” He squeezed her hand, reassuringly. “I don’t believe this has happened. Not to you. Of all the people in the world, after all you’ve been through,” he shook his head, “not to you.” “Join the club. I can’t believe it either. Ironic, huh? Long ago I hunted and killed vampires and now I am one. Ha, ha. Every day I open my eyes and think it’s been a really bad dream. I wake up all the way and–whoops–it isn’t a nightmare at all. It’s my life.” “God’s got a mean sense of humor.” “God had nothing to do with this.” She couldn’t help it, her bitterness oozed through. “I’m so sorry.” He released her hand and rubbed his eyes. All the happiness she’d seen in him the last week had evaporated. His shoulders slumped. His eyes looked so sad. “I was scared you wouldn’t understand. You wouldn’t accept me after what’s happened. What I’ve become. I’m so relieved.” “That I don’t want to ostracize you or put a stake through your bloodsucking heart? That I still love you as a brother should and that I’m going to help?” “Yes.” “What else would I do? You’re my sister. You and the kids are all I have left of my family. I wouldn’t let you or them down. No way. I’m in for the long haul. I love you.” “Thank you, Joey.” She would have hugged him but was afraid to. He seemed edgy. “I love you, too.” “Is there anything I can do now? Anything at all?” She’d thought long and hard about that before she’d called him. “No. Be there for me. Keep loving me and the kids. Help me fight this scourge or learn to live with it. Keep an eye on me. In case. You know.” She tensed up. “Be ready to take the children if things go really wrong.” “Take the children?” She refilled his coffee cup. Outside birds were singing and a parade of dried leaves flew by the window. The seasons and the world went on as they always had. Uncaring about humans and their trivial affairs. Their sorrows or tribulations. “You know, take them to live with you and Laurie if I can’t beat this thing.” He was shaking his head, then got it. “Oh, if you have to go away or if…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. They looked at each other. If she could have cried, she would have. “It won’t come to that. I know it,” he insisted. “We’ll find a way out of this, I promise. We’ll research. Dig. There’s got to be something or someone that can help you. We’ll find an expert who’ll know how to deal with these things.” “Yeah, sure, we’ll find a witch or something,” she said mockingly, “who can change me back into a human or send me backward in time so I can keep it from happening. Fat chance.” “Aah, I don’t think that’s possible.” Joey had no sense of humor. She forced a smile out of her lips. “A long shot, I know.” “Except for disliking the sun, your white skin–and plenty of people have pale skin–you don’t seem too different, Sis.” “You should see me killing and sucking the blood out of the wild animals I catch.” “You have fangs and everything?” “They’re growing. Only come out when I feed.” He blinked. “Your eyes are different.” “I know. They glitter.” “Not a lot. Just don’t look directly at people for too long.” “I’ll try not to. It’s kinda hard if you don’t look at people when they’re speaking to you. Makes them think you aren’t paying attention, you’re rude or you’re hiding something.” “There’s that, you’re right. Sunglasses?” “Outside, perhaps. Inside it’s the other side of eccentric.” He laughed meekly and came to his feet. “I have to get back to the diner for the lunch rush. Is there anything I can do for you now?” “No. I had to tell you, that’s all. You needed to know. I needed help. Support. Thank you for coming.” “I’ll phone you later. In the meantime, I’ll try to come up with some ideas. I’ll put my thinking cap on.” They smiled together at the reference to an old television show they used to watch as kids. “All right,” she said. “I’ve already spent hours reading dusty books and scouring the Internet for anything that might help, but so far zippo. Apparently vampires only exist in fiction novels, movies and in Stephanie Meyer’s vivid imagination.” “Wouldn’t she be surprised?” “No doubt.” He threw his arms around her and gave her a big hug before he left. She knew he was afraid of her, but he did it anyway. He loved her that much. Feeling better now that someone knew her secret, was on her side, her fingers motioned goodbye as he drove away. She wasn’t alone any longer. Still the doubts snuck back in. What was he thinking now? That the attack and the coma had addled her brain, made her delusional, or that, wow, did they have a huge problem on their backs? She could have showed him her fangs, but she hadn’t learned how to make them appear without biting into something. Anyway, that would have scared him even more. He hadn’t asked about the three dead people and she hadn’t brought it up. Hadn’t he made the connection or had he been too freaked out to broach the subject under the circumstances? Probably the latter. If she’d been in his shoes she would have been freaked out, too. After all, he’d seen firsthand, as she had, what vampires were capable of. Endless carnage and heartless bloodshed. Insidious powers a normal gun or knife couldn’t fight. The rest of the day she painted walls, baseboards, and drove herself nuts going over everything again and again. She didn’t know what the hell to do. Please, let Joey think of something. The ringing of the telephone interrupted and, laying down the paintbrush, she answered it. It was the school. Contrary to what she’d been told a few days earlier when she’d called them they did need her to show up in person to sign the kids’ enrollment papers. They asked her to come in, sooner the better. Today would be better. She didn’t want to go into town and mingle with people but didn’t see a way out of it. So she cleaned up, grabbed her hat and sunglasses, and drove into Summer Haven. It was a bright sunny day so she wore long sleeves and blue jeans. Parking the car beneath lofty shade trees, she rushed into the building. She’d never get used to avoiding the sun, which she loved. And beaches. Water. What would she do if she got to the point where she couldn’t tolerate the sunlight at all? Don’t think about that. Not now. The school, a brick oblong with rolls of identical windows, was the same building she’d gone to years before but it’d been remodeled, modernized, and was as good as new inside. It felt strange entering the doors. She was relieved that no invisible wall stopped her. She walked right in. Must be because it was a public building. She signed what she had to sign in a cubby hole of an office, quickly snooped around, liked what she saw (everything spic and span and friendly faces) and scooted out of there. The library. She decided to see if there were any more books she could check out about vampires. Her last visit had been so rushed. What she hadn’t found on the Internet might be inside a dusty old tome high on a shelf somewhere. Not everything written about vampires had to be romances. Somewhere, sometime, someone must have written something she could use to fight what was happening to her. Something real. So it was worth at least another look. Vampires did exist so it stood to reason others had discovered that truth as well and lived to tell or write about it. Well, she could hope, couldn’t she? The library was cool and dim. Taking off her hat, she left the sunglasses on. She located a handful of hardbacks seeming more serious than the fluff she’d taken out before or had read about on the Web and checked them out on her shiny new library card, which had been waiting at the front desk for her. One of the books was tattered; its pages brown-edged with age, and had been written by some hoity-toity professor from Harvard. The cover wasn’t sensational, no lurid pictures of blood-dripping and fanged monsters, but simply silver embossed words on black: Vampires. They Exist. Hmm, there might be something in it she could use. Jenny thought she recognized the older lady taking care of her as someone who’d worked there when she’d been a kid–or looked like that other woman anyway. Tall, skinny, with ash gray hair in a bun, gold rimmed glasses; dowdy dress that could have been in style in the nineteen sixties. Tight smile. She hadn’t been in the library her last visit. The woman gave her a funny look when she saw the titles. “I’m a writer,” Jenny explained. “I write about vampires, ghosts and such.” She lightly tapped the books stacked before her. “This is research.” And, in a way, it was. “Oh, I know who you are. Jenny Lacy.” “Jenny Sanders now.” “Yes, Sanders. You married Jeff Sanders, a local boy…and I’m so sorry to hear of his death.” Jenny barely blinked, inclining her head in assent. “Don’t remember me, huh? I’ve known you since you were a tot. Knew your mom and dad, too.” The woman’s eyes were gentle but knowing. “I’m Mrs. Willard? You used to come in here every Saturday for your books. I never saw a child love to read as much as you did. I wasn’t surprised at all when you became a writer. And I’ve read some of your novels. You’re not much on reality but what a storyteller.” “Oh. Thank you.” Self-conscious for a moment. It’d been a long time since someone had recognized her as an author. “I’m sorry I don’t remember you but I’ve never been good with faces. Or names. My husband used to say it was because I’m always making up names and descriptions for my fictitious characters so my mind gets confused and forgets the real ones.” “That’s all right. I have a forgettable face. But that’s as imaginative an excuse as I’ve ever heard.” The woman’s quick smile told Jenny she was forgiven for not recognizing her. “I heard you and your two children had moved back here.” Small towns. Nothing stayed a secret. “We’re living in my mom and dad’s farmhouse out on Suncrest Road. Fixing it up. It needs it.” “Hmm.” The look on the librarian’s face became guarded. “Hmm what?” “Well, I’m not one to spread unfounded gossip but since you’re living there now and you’re a writer you might be interested. Rumor is your farmhouse is haunted.” “Haunted?” A shiver rippled across the skin of her neck. “With…?” “Ghosts. So they say.” Weren’t vampires enough? Now there were translucent dead, too? Oh, great. “Who says?” “Well.” The woman, eyes shifting to a person browsing through the aisle to her left then to man clicking away on one of the library’s new computers in the corner acted as if she didn’t want to tell her, and it disturbed Jenny. “Well?” The woman cleared her throat softly. “Townsfolk say they’ve heard crying from the empty farmhouse during the day. Voices. Creepy noises. They’ve driven or walked by at night and seen strange lights moving around in the windows. There have been lots of such stories. For years.” Joey had the electricity turned on only last week. What was the woman talking about? Jenny didn’t move. Standing there, she’d scooped up her books and cradled them in her arms. An eerie feeling came over her. “That was probably my brother Joey stumbling around in the house with a flashlight.” “At two o’clock in the morning?” “Joey has weird working hours at his diner. And he’s a night person.” The woman gave her a cynical look. “Some people have heard horses neighing behind your house, as well, and there aren’t any horses out that way. Not anymore, anyway.” Jenny shrugged. “It was an old abandoned house. People sometimes think they’re haunted.” “Not all houses have that place’s history, though. Your mother and father?” Jenny knew what she meant. To the townspeople, person or persons unknown murdered her parents. But no one now but Joey and she knew the murders, all the murders which had taken place that long ago summer, had been done by vampires. Officially they remained unsolved. Deadly mysteries. No wonder people believed the Lacy farmhouse was haunted. “Well, I’ve been living there for a few days and haven’t heard or seen a thing. No lights. No ghosts of my dead parents hovering around. So there. Nothing strange going on at all.” Except she was a vampire, haunted the woods and fields at night herself snuffing out tiny animals for their life’s blood, and she lived in the house. But that was another story altogether. “Anyway, I’ll divulge a secret. Ghosts don’t exist.” With what she hoped was a whimsical shrug she asked, “Do you believe in them?” Mrs. Willard smiled. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” Jenny stared at her. Odd answer. “Only if you want me to know.” “A discussion for another time. Right now I have work to do.” The woman turned to the computer and started keying something in. “I’m sure I’ll see you again. You being a writer, loving books and all.” Her gentle laughter was good-natured. Then Jenny remembered Mrs. Willard. A lot of people had thought she was a little more than eccentric. She lived by herself in a rambling Victorian behemoth on the edge of town. She’d never remarried after her husband had died when she was in her twenties. Her life, her world, had been, and apparently still was, the library. Classic librarian. From the old school. These days Jenny was used to seeing young people scurrying around and working in a library. Out with the old, in with the young. Wasn’t that the way of the world. “Okay then. See you soon.” Hugging the books closely, Jenny exited the building. The day had grown overcast while she’d been inside. The clouds scudded across the slate sky and created puddles of shadows. The world had melted into an early dusk. Jenny breathed a sigh of relief because in the last week the sun had become her enemy. She couldn’t stop mulling over what Mrs. Willard had said about ghosts in the farmhouse. What if it weren’t ghosts at all? What if it was? Who were they and what did they want? Oh, please. Didn’t she have enough problems? There was sudden movement in the corner of her eye. Quick as she twisted her head, sharp as her sight had become, she barely caught the silhouetted figure before it merged into the grove of trees behind the library. Someone was stalking her. It wasn’t the first time she’d seen a figure or felt watched. So many times, out in the night woods, she could have sworn someone or something was tracking her. If only she could remember. But it was creeping her out and damned if she was going to put up with it any longer. Tossing the books and her purse in the car, she chased after the intruder. She didn’t catch him. He evaporated into the forest like a mist. After running around in circles for way too long, she returned to the car and headed to the farmhouse. Wondering what that had been about. At home she kept busy as her mind plagued her with what she was going to do about her vampirism and how her brother was handling it. She kept expecting him to call or drop by. Knowing him, what she’d confessed that morning would sooner or later come to a boil and he’d be on her doorstep with more questions and fears. She was right. Later that night after the children were in bed, after she’d taken her run out in the woods and the diner had been closed a half-hour, he rapped on her door. He was mutely red-eyed and she knew he was upset. The reality of what had befallen her–them–had hit home. “I had to see you, Jenny. We need to talk.” “I know.” She let him in and they went into the kitchen. They sat down. The house was silent. The night, for once, was, too. She’d fed and it’d filled her belly and calmed her nerves. “You know about the recent murders around town, don’t you?” Her hands were folded before her on the table, her eyes on her brother’s frightened face. “I knew about them this morning, too. I just….” She inhaled slowly, a wretchedness she was beginning to know all too well revisiting. “Hadn’t made the connection yet. Afraid to ask me about them, right?” “Right.” “But you have anyway.” She leveled her eyes at him. “It wasn’t me, Joey. I’ve thought and thought about it and I’m pretty sure it wasn’t me. I didn’t kill those people.” “Pretty sure? You said you’ve had blackouts.” “I have. But I don’t think I’ve been out killing people. I’d feel it here if I had.” She laid a hand over her heart. “And there’s something else. Someone’s stalking me. I’ve suspected it, sort of, for days but this morning I saw him outside the library. He was inhumanly tall. He moved like some horror movie apparition with lightning speed. I lost him in that patch of woods behind the building.” “Could be he’s who the cops are looking for.” His voice was hopeful, latching on to any other possibility for the slayings other than his sister was a cold-blood murderess. “Could be. Isn’t it conveniently coincidental that someone is following me, with what’s happened and all, skulking around town, and people are ending up dead?” “Or not,” Joey countered. “Or not.” She cocked her head, listening to the night beyond the walls. Something or someone was moving out there somewhere. Suddenly her body was on alert. Danger. Danger. “You’re scared of me, aren’t you?” She posed the question she’d been dreading. He took too long to answer. “No. You’re my sister. I know you wouldn’t hurt me.” “Scared, tell me the truth now,” she smiled sadly, “a little?” “A little.” He spread two of his fingers about an inch apart. She got up, walked to the window and stared out. “Don’t be. I might be one of them,” she couldn’t say the word, “but I’m still me, too. Like I said I love you. You’ll always be safe from me. One way or another. “Is that what you were worried about? Why you came over?” Outside there were shadows shape shifting among the stark trees and a low hissing as if someone were angrily whispering far away. She tried to make sense of the black noise, form it into words, something she could understand. But couldn’t. “I agonized all day over what you told me this morning and I had to see how you were doing. If I’d heard what I thought I’d heard. You’re a…vampire.” She laughed humorlessly. “Oh, you heard right.” “And to tell you a Detective Ben Bradley from St. Louis telephoned me today. Asked a mess of questions about you. He wanted your new cell, home phone number and address.” “You gave it to him?” “What do you think? Not to would have raised suspicion. He’ll probably phone you.” “He probably will.” She hazily recalled the detective as a polite man with melancholy eyes who’d visited in the hospital and wanted her to remember more of what had happened the night of the attack. It seemed so long ago. Coma-stunned and still reeling from her ordeal, she hadn’t been able to dredge up much of anything. Not then anyway. “Do you think he knows about the disappearances and new murders here?” Joey gave her something else to fret about. “Police communicate by computers now and talk among themselves. Compare assault and murder statistics. Look for threads.” Oh boy. “I don’t know, even if he’s aware of the murders why would he want to talk to me?” “Just a thought,” Joey said. “Nah, he probably wants to ask me more questions about the attack. Follow up, that’s all.” Or so she hoped, but she had a bad feeling. What if the detective did know about the recent murders and had made the link to the St. Louis attack and somehow to her? Not likely. How could he? There were still too many missing pieces–or were there? “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be cool when I talk to him. Pretend I haven’t remembered anything else.” That was easy to do on the telephone. Long distance. She was getting good at hiding her true emotions. With his confusion and concern, her brother looked older. Or perhaps it was her acute eyesight. “Then I won’t worry about it. I just thought I’d give you a heads up.” “Thanks.” “But I am really bothered about what’s happening here. The murders. What do you think is going on? Who could be doing them?” “I wish I knew.” She had a theory but it was too scary to dwell on for long. “Me, too. The town is spooked. People are staying inside because they’re scared, especially at night. Boy, does this feel familiar.” A faint sneer formed on his lips. He didn’t have to say the words: It’s just like twelve years ago but she heard them in her head anyway. “Yep, Déjà vu. Be careful out there, Joey. I mean it. Something’s not right.” “You’re telling me?” He tugged at his ear and let out a breath. “Enough bad news, I got to get home. Laurie’s waiting up for me.” He slowly rose to his feet. At the door he stopped. “Andy was in tonight. It’s dreadful about him losing his job.” “I know. He came by and told me about it.” “Hmmm. Interesting. He came by here? When?” “The day he lost his job. He said he needed someone to talk to.” “You know he’s always had a crush on you.” “On me?” “When we were kids he always asked about you. Almost asked you out for a date once.” “You’re kidding? I never knew that. Why didn’t he?” “You began dating Jeff and married him if I recollect correctly. When your first book came out Andy bought it and had me send it to you to autograph. And every book you wrote after it. I guess you don’t remember that, huh?” “Sorry. No. It was a lifetime ago it seems like when I was an author.” She changed the subject. “Speaking of Andy, how’s he doing?” “After losing his job and it had time to sink in? Devastated. I’ve never seen him so depressed. That guy loved his job. Loved that bank. A proud man, it defined him. I don’t know what he’s going to do. There’re no jobs around here. None that would suit him. His family trust fund dried up years ago so now he’s like the rest of us. Scrambling to make a living. “I’m so sick of this recession. More like a depression,” he groused. “One night I saw a man rummaging through our dumpster. The dumpster. Where is it going to end?” “I don’t know.” She wouldn’t meet his eyes, shifted from foot to foot, her hand on the door. She had to find a job. She’d lost her home, too. And until her house sold in Millstadt she was basically broke. Jeff’s small life insurance payout was about gone and her bank balance was low. “Oh, I’m sorry, Sis. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad. You’re going to find a job. I know it. There’s one out there somewhere for a woman as smart as you.” How about one for a vampire? Not likely. “Yeah, sure. How about a night job? Guarding a blood bank in some hospital? A very big hospital.” So a couple of missing bags of blood a night wouldn’t tip them off. “Out of town, of course.” Her brother actually forced out a laugh. He still regarded her with wary eyes. It broke her heart. He was scared of her and what she’d become. Could be he’d never get over it. “Before I go,” he murmured, “how are you doing?” He reached out and when his flesh touched hers she saw the sorrow in his eyes. Her skin was as cold as snow-covered stone. “Coping. Barely. So far I’ve resisted the urge to suck a human dry or knock my brains out. I get my nourishment from running down terrified animals like a wild beast and sinking my fangs into them. As I learn to control my hunger, I’m trying not to kill them, just drink enough to sustain me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. “But, oh Joey,” her disgust must have shown in her expression, “What’ll I do if I go bonkers and start randomly killing people like those other vampires we destroyed years ago? I’m only still here because of you and the kids. I love you too much to leave. Otherwise I’d be gone or I’d kill myself.” “God, Jenny, don’t do that!” he cried. “I couldn’t bear it. Have patience. Hang on. We’ll figure something out, I swear.” “Joey, why did this have to happen to me? What have I done so wrong that I deserve it? Weren’t the attack and my coma, Jeff’s death enough? Haven’t I suffered enough?” She felt like ranting at the sky and did every night, deep in the woods where no one would hear. “It’ll be okay, Sis.” She could hear the desperation in his voice. “I took off from the diner tonight. Told Laurie I wasn’t feeling well. I’ve been researching on the Internet; reading stuff. Looking for an answer.” “Me, too. You discover anything we don’t already know?” “Not so far. I’m still looking. I won’t give up until I find something or someone that can help you.” “Thanks Joey. I love you, you know that?” “I know that. And back at ya.” When he was gone she tried to sleep. To hide. Sleep kept her from thinking about how messed up her life was. Kept her from probing for solutions she couldn’t find. Things would look better tomorrow. Or she prayed so.",

      "content": "Chapter 8 Jenny “I don’t want to go to school today,” her son announced the next morning, plopping down in a kitchen chair. The sun hid behind fat steel-tipped clouds. The wind whistled past the windows and the house groaned. “I hate this new school. All the kids are hicks.” This from a boy who’d basically enjoyed school until now. Her mother’s intuition told her something else was going on. “Now that’s not a nice thing to say, Teddy. They’re children just like you. And isn’t it too early to be making fun of your new neighbors?” She tilted up his defiant chin and made him look at her. “What’s really wrong?” He wouldn’t answer. “Teddy?” “The other kids don’t like me that’s what.” “Why?” “Don’t know,” he mumbled between bites of oatmeal. Lately it was hard making food for her children. Sometimes the smells made her sick. She’d taken to putting Vick’s Vapor Rub in her nostrils and telling the kids she had a slight cold. Didn’t help much, though. She used to love oatmeal. Sarah was watching them closely, her eyes hiding secrets, too. “Oatmeal’s good, Mom. Nice and hot. Can I have some more cinnamon on mine?” The girl was dressed in a pair of her worn blue jeans and a plain black sweater. Her daughter’s I-don’t-want-to-be-noticed clothes. She got the cinnamon from the cabinet; sprinkled some in Sarah’s bowl. Turning back to Teddy, she sat down. “I think you do. Tell me.” “What difference would it make if I tell you?” For the first time she saw rebellion in her son’s stance. He was growing up. Changing. He didn’t want his mother fixing things for him anymore. “What would it change?” “I don’t know. We could talk and decide what you could do to fix it like we’ve always done.” When her son remained silent her daughter spoke up. “I know why the other kids don’t like us.” Sensitive brown eyes gazed at her. “First off it’s because we live here. They think our house is haunted, and now that people are disappearing and getting knocked off–” Oh, no, her kids know what’s happening around town. “–since we’ve moved in they really don’t like us.” She muttered, “They think we have something to do with it.” Simple child logic but Jenny saw through it to the truth. People were frightened and they were looking for scapegoats. A new family in town would do it. Then there might be those who remembered past murders and that they ceased about the time she and Jeff moved away. Now she was back and so were the troubles. Yes, that could be part of it. Suddenly, staring at her children, she grew angry. How dare anyone take it out on her kids? “Have they hurt either of you?” “No, not exactly.” Sarah’s eyes were guarded, though, as they flicked to her brother. In a meeker voice she added, “Except I saw them pushing Teddy around after school on the sidewalk. This one kid called him a bunch of bad names. I got mad and kicked one of them but they didn’t stop.” “Sarah! Why did ya have to tell her that?” Teddy sputtered. “Told you not to.” “Physical violence doesn’t solve anything,” Jenny reminded them. “It felt good, though,” Sarah bragged, then dropped her shoulders. “Sorry, Mom but I’d do it again if they try to hurt Teddy.” “It’s admirable you’re so protective of each other. That’s a good thing. But you can’t strike back like that. Hitting when you’re hit. Two wrongs don’t make a right.” She couldn’t believe she’d said that. God, and how many times had her parents mouthed that to her when she’d been a child? Lots. And had she ever listened? Not hardly. “You won’t do it again. I’ll take care of it.” “No Mom,” Teddy whined, with a shocked look in his eyes she’d been seeing too often since he’d turned twelve. “What are you going to do? Talk to their parents or to them? That’ll only make it worse.” “I don’t know yet, but I’ll take care of it.” Teddy jumped up from his chair and stomped out of the room, leaving his oatmeal uneaten. She would have gone after him but figured it was better to give him space for a while. He’d get over it. And in a couple minutes he did. She wanted to drive them to school but they vetoed it. “If you start that the kids will make even more fun of us,” Teddy said. “Everyone rides the bus. We can’t be different if we’re trying to fit in.” “Yeah, Teddy’s right.” Sarah scrunched her lips together. “We just need to fit in.” So she watched them get on the bus then took the short cut through the woods to the school. The day, foggy and overcast, allowed her to travel comfortably. She didn’t need dark glasses or a scarf, but stuck both of them in her jacket’s pocket just in case. One thing she remembered from growing up there was the eerie way the autumn mist could swiftly creep into the surrounding woods and town and cloak them like gray cotton candy. She could see through it easily enough but others couldn’t. Her new speed got her to the school before the bus arrived. Which was good because she didn’t want her kids to know what she was up to; didn’t want anyone to know. She waited behind an elm tree by the school’s entrance and kept vigil until the children began to file into the building. Buses were pulling into the parking lot and her eyes found Teddy and Sarah as they exited theirs. There was a group of older boys waiting for them. One was bigger than the rest, heavy-set, with dirty rumpled clothes; one in a red sock cap, had a spiteful stare and the other two hid their spinelessness behind smirking smiles. The usual gang of unloved, angry low self-esteemed bullies that frequented and terrorized most schoolyards and who got their jollies by planting fear in others weaker or smaller than themselves. She’d seen their kind all her life and not just in the schoolyard. They were everywhere, beaten-down people who only felt better when they were beating down someone else, and she’d always despised them and their kind. The boys crowded around her children and she clearly heard every word. “Hey you two weirdoes?” The fat boy had a malicious grin. “How are the ghosts at your house doing? Made friends with them yet? They tell you yet where they’re stashing the bodies?” “We don’t want any trouble.” Teddy stood up to them with Sarah behind him. She could see the anxiety on his face but he wasn’t backing down. He reminded her of Jeff. Gutsy. “Just let us through so we can get to class.” “Sure.” The boy with the sock cap was within an arm’s reach of her son. “My mom says that everything was fine around here until you moved back into that damned house. Now my cousin, Sid, is missing, too. He’s only ten. He was last seen out by your place. Mom says your family is cursed, always have been. We don’t want you here.” Another one missing, a boy? Oh, no. Was it her? Oh, no, no, no. “We’ve got every right to live here as you.” Teddy was being brave as he inched his way nearer to the school; Sarah hiding behind him. “Get out of our way. Go push around somebody else.” The six of them were the only ones left outside as the first school bell rang. The mist churned around them, a prowling animal that nipped at their shoes. That’s when Teddy made his move. He elbowed past the chubby kid, dragging Sarah in his wake, and somehow the other boy ended up on the ground on his backside. Teddy laughed. Jenny almost laughed herself. The furious look on the ground kid’s face would have been a funny picture. Then the one in the red cap picked up and threw a hand-sized rock at Teddy and her good humor was gone. The rock hit her son on his left cheek. Blood ran down his face but he didn’t utter a cry. Not a whimper. The other boys had rocks and launched them as Teddy and Sarah made a dash for the school’s front doors. That’s when she acted. With her thoughts and a ceremonial flick of her hands the rocks somehow veered off in mid-air just enough so they missed their targets. Not by much, but it looked strange as hell, as if the two Sanders children had an invisible bubble around them. Confused disbelief transformed the bullies’ faces. Another YouTube moment. She chuckled softly as the aggressors turned tail and ran; scattering like the frightened children they were. Not a great show of power, she still didn’t have a lot of control over it yet, but she’d bet those bully boys wouldn’t try that again and they’d leave her children alone. For now anyway. Teddy and Sarah were statues. Teddy had seen the rocks deflect and his mouth had fallen open. He wiped the blood from his face and glanced around. As if he knew what had happened wasn’t natural. She crouched behind the tree so he wouldn’t see her. “Come on, Sarah, we’re late for class,” he murmured and ushered her into the building. At last, something good from what she’d become. Jenny went home the way she’d come; spending time in the woods catching something to feed on so she could stay home that night. The fog helped hide her. This time she didn’t leave a dead carcass behind, just a weaker deer hobbling away into the bushes, and she was so proud of herself. She was learning and adapting. This vampire stuff, she mused, wasn’t all that hard. *** After she’d been home awhile and was in the middle of decorating her bedroom there was a knock on the front door. When she answered it she was eye to eye with a man she didn’t recognize…at first. Then, slowly, the memory returned. Detective Bradley. The St. Louis cop who’d handled her husband’s murder case. He hadn’t wasted any time contacting her. In person, no less. For some reason it made her instinctively wary. “Mrs. Jenny Sanders, remember me, Detective Bradley?” He presented a shiny gold badge and afterwards slipped it into his jacket pocket. “I spoke to you in the hospital?” “I remember.” A faint smile covered her uneasiness. In the two times he’d visited her as she’d been recovering she’d gleaned he was clever and intuitive on a high level. Which meant she had to be careful around him. Watch what she said. Guard what she did. “You’re a ways from home, Detective.” “That I am. Can I come in and chat with you for a bit?” He was dressed in a tawny-colored leather jacket and beige pants, a jaunty hat tilted down across his forehead. His hair was still short and his eyes were still full of concern. But there was something else in them that made her leery. He was a man on a mission searching for answers and there was a personal reason behind it. Just a strong hunch she had. “About the attack?” “Among other things. I was here earlier but no one was home.” “I was on an errand. Come on in.” “I spent the time waiting at your brother’s diner–great food, by the way–and had an informative conversation with your Chief Donald. He brought me up to speed on what’s been going on in town.” He followed her into the house and into the kitchen. So he knew about the latest murders. Great. “I’ll make you some coffee.” “That would be kind of you.” Gazing around, he said, “By the fresh paint smell, appears you’re fixing things up. By what I can see, you’re doing a fine job.” He sat in the chair closest to the back door. Cops. Always wanting to be near an exit. “Your brother told me all about you and the kids moving in here. The house your parents used to own. How lovely you’re making it.” “Our childhood home to be exact.” The coffee perking, she turned to the man. She hated looking at him, showing her face. Could he tell she’d changed? Could he tell with those sharp eyes of his what she really was? She prayed not. “How are your children?” He was being so polite. “You have a boy and a girl, right?” “Teddy and Sarah. They’re doing as well as can be expected.” She thought of the bullies at the school. The rocks. “It’s hard for them, losing a dad and moving to a new town and school half way across the country. They’re coping. We all are.” “How have you been feeling?” “Much better. As you can see.” “It was like a miracle, you waking up from that coma the way you did and how quickly you’ve recovered.” Was that a note of skepticism in his voice? She wasn’t sure. “Good medical care. And,” she let a friendly smile slip out, “I had a few good reasons to get better fast.” “Your kids.” “Yes.” “We parents would do about anything for our kids, wouldn’t we?” She didn’t know what he was getting at so she said, “They’re at school now.” “I know.” She couldn’t bear it any longer. “Detective, I appreciate you coming all the way out here to speak to me but wouldn’t a telephone call have been a lot easier? And cheaper?” “Would have been, but I’m also interested in the strange occurrences happening here in Summer Haven.” Oh, oh. In she plunged. “Like what?” “Oh, disappearances. Unusual…homicides. Quite a few of them now. Fact is, the deaths are very similar to,” he hesitated and, as if he’d made a decision, forged on, “the way your husband died–and others.” “The way my husband died?” “You know what I’m talking about. Your husband had very little blood left in him. There were odd wounds along his neck, though the doctors believed he died from…other causes.” Once she’d been well enough she’d been told Jeff had been beaten to death, his throat cut so severely he’d practically been beheaded. Something else she couldn’t stand to think about. The police hadn’t mentioned the blood loss. Not to her anyway. She’d just assumed he’d bled a lot from his wounds. “Not an ordinary death. I’m thinking you know a little more than you’re letting on. That’s why I’m here.” So there it was. Her suspicion materialized. A vampire had killed Jeff. Oh, she’d known that truth some place deep inside but hadn’t wanted to accept it. But it made sense. Now someone, besides her and Joey, knew others were dying the same way. And he was a cop. Not good. Not good at all. This detective was too smart to be so close to the truth. “Why do you think I know something?” She evaded his eyes. “Because you survived.” “Oh.” “So I’m asking you: You know anything about these new murders here in town? Can you give me any information that might help in my investigation?” “Isn’t this out of your jurisdiction?” “It is.” “Then why are you here investigating these murders?” He gave her another intense look. “It’s my job.” “That can’t be all.” She’d caught that air of sadness about him again. This time she met his eyes and with a simple silent command made him tell her. Another little trick she’d learned she could sometimes perform. For a moment his strong will fought it. Then he spoke softly. “I think there’s a connection between your attack, the new murders here and some older ones in St. Louis. “Over five years ago my daughter, Meg, was mugged, like you and your husband, while she was out one evening shopping. Alone. They, whoever they were, killed her. Her body was drained of blood; nearly decapitated. Same wounds on her neck you and your husband had. Same senseless ferocity in the beating. “She was my only child. Just sixteen. Pretty, intelligent and loving. She wanted to be a nurse, but she never got the chance.” His hands clenched as they rested on the table. His coffee cold. Forgotten. “I’ve been chasing her murderers and investigating any similar crimes ever since. I won’t–I can’t–give up until I find her killers and bring them to justice. Put them away so they never hurt another innocent person. “I believe your attackers are the same ones who killed my little girl. They’re the same ones who’ve probably followed you back here and are killing your neighbors.” Ahhh. Now she understood and it softened her heart towards him. He’d lost his only daughter. She, too, feared something happening to her children and couldn’t imagine the heartbreak of losing one. Oh, how she wanted to help him. But she couldn’t. Not without giving away what she was; what she’d done in the distant past. Giving away that vampires did exist. That she was one now. His enemy. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, “for your loss.” “Thank you.” He swung his head towards the window. The fog was crowding up against the glass but couldn’t get in. There was such misery on his face she looked away. “Do you remember anything more now about the attack on you and your husband or that night? Is there anything, no matter how small, you could tell me that might help? Even an inconsequential detail might give us a clue.” She could have told him the truth but that would have been suicide. For her anyway. What would he do if he found out she was one of them? One of the same breed that had killed his daughter and those other people? There was no way she could confess her secret to him. Not now. Not ever. She had to be very careful. It was so different being on the other side, wasn’t it? “No. Not anything more than you already know,” she lied. “My memory draws a blank when it comes to that night. I’m sorry.” At least that part was true. He gulped down what was left of his coffee and stood up. “That’s a shame. I’m afraid there’ll be more murders if we don’t find and stop these animals.” “You think there is more than one?” That didn’t shock her. Vampires ran in packs. “There could be.” “And you don’t have any leads at all?” Now he wouldn’t look at her. “A few I need to follow up on.” “So you’ll be sticking around for a bit, huh?” “For a bit, yes. I’m staying in town at Hannah’s Bed and Breakfast.” Now his eyes met hers. “If you remember anything at all I’ll be there if you need to talk.” He handed her a business card. “My cell phone number is on the back. Call anytime.” “I will. If I remember anything else.” “Thank you for the chat and the coffee.” He paused at the door. “I am happy you’re doing better, Mrs. Sanders. After all that happened to you, you deserve it. “Take care of those kids of yours.” He finally smiled at her. She let him out and watched him plod into the mist; heard his car drive away. Not waiting long, she grabbed her purse and keys and rushed out the door. She had to talk to someone who’d understand; someone she trusted. Joey. She was scared and didn’t want to be alone. For as Detective Bradley walked out the door she’d heard voices in her head. Many voices. One or two stronger than the rest. Vampire voices. They were looking for her. Calling her. They were strong. And they wouldn’t give up. If she fell under their spell she’d never be able to remain in this, her life. With her children and brother. She’d become one of them, a soulless killer rampaging through the night seeking human blood. An enemy of mankind. A monster. Forever. Fight it! But it took all her strength not to go to them. Instead she drove to Joey’s Diner. He’d help. She knew he’d help. Since they’d been kids she could always count on him, no matter how bad the problem. She sure hoped he could calm her fears now. Because she was really frightened.",

The wind whistled past the windows and the house groaned. “I hate this new school. All the kids are hicks.” This from a boy who’d basically enjoyed school until now. Her mother’s intuition told her something else was going on. “Now that’s not a nice thing to say, Teddy. They’re children just like you. And isn’t it too early to be making fun of your new neighbors?” She tilted up his defiant chin and made him look at her. “What’s really wrong?” He wouldn’t answer. “Teddy?” “The other kids don’t like me that’s what.” “Why?” “Don’t know,” he mumbled between bites of oatmeal. Lately it was hard making food for her children. Sometimes the smells made her sick. She’d taken to putting Vick’s Vapor Rub in her nostrils and telling the kids she had a slight cold. Didn’t help much, though. She used to love oatmeal. Sarah was watching them closely, her eyes hiding secrets, too. “Oatmeal’s good, Mom. Nice and hot. Can I have some more cinnamon on mine?” The girl was dressed in a pair of her worn blue jeans and a plain black sweater. Her daughter’s I-don’t-want-to-be-noticed clothes. She got the cinnamon from the cabinet; sprinkled some in Sarah’s bowl. Turning back to Teddy, she sat down. “I think you do. Tell me.” “What difference would it make if I tell you?” For the first time she saw rebellion in her son’s stance. He was growing up. Changing. He didn’t want his mother fixing things for him anymore. “What would it change?” “I don’t know. We could talk and decide what you could do to fix it like we’ve always done.” When her son remained silent her daughter spoke up. “I know why the other kids don’t like us.” Sensitive brown eyes gazed at her. “First off it’s because we live here. They think our house is haunted, and now that people are disappearing and getting knocked off–” Oh, no, her kids know what’s happening around town. “–since we’ve moved in they really don’t like us.” She muttered, “They think we have something to do with it.” Simple child logic but Jenny saw through it to the truth. People were frightened and they were looking for scapegoats. A new family in town would do it. Then there might be those who remembered past murders and that they ceased about the time she and Jeff moved away. Now she was back and so were the troubles. Yes, that could be part of it.

That’ll only make it worse.” “I don’t know yet, but I’ll take care of it.” Teddy jumped up from his chair and stomped out of the room, leaving his oatmeal uneaten.

This time she met his eyes and with a simple silent command made him tell her. Another little trick she’d learned she could sometimes perform. For a moment his strong will fought it. Then he spoke softly. “I think there’s a connection between your attack, the new murders here and some older ones in St. Louis. “Over five years ago my daughter, Meg, was mugged, like you and your husband, while she was out one evening shopping. Alone. They, whoever they were, killed her. Her body was drained of blood; nearly decapitated. Same wounds on her neck you and your husband had. Same senseless ferocity in the beating. “She was my only child. Just sixteen. Pretty, intelligent and loving. She wanted to be a nurse, but she never got the chance.” His hands clenched as they rested on the table. His coffee cold. Forgotten. “I’ve been chasing her murderers and investigating any similar crimes ever since. I won’t–I can’t–give up until I find her killers and bring them to justice. Put them away so they never hurt another innocent person. “I believe your attackers are the same ones who killed my little girl. They’re the same ones who’ve probably followed you back here and are killing your neighbors.” Ahhh. Now she understood and it softened her heart towards him. He’d lost his only daughter. She, too, feared something happening to her children and couldn’t imagine the heartbreak of losing one. Oh, how she wanted to help him. But she couldn’t. Not without giving away what she was; what she’d done in the distant past. Giving away that vampires did exist. That she was one now. His enemy. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, “for your loss.” “Thank you.” He swung his head towards the window. The fog was crowding up against the glass but couldn’t get in. There was such misery on his face she looked away. “Do you remember anything more now about the attack on you and your husband or that night? Is there anything, no matter how small, you could tell me that might help? Even an inconsequential detail might give us a clue.” She could have told him the truth but that would have been suicide. For her anyway. What would he do if he found out she was one of them? One of the same breed that had killed his daughter and those other people? There was no way she could confess her secret to him. Not now. Not ever. She had to be very careful. It was so different being on the other side, wasn’t it? “No. Not anything more than you already know,” she lied. “My memory draws a blank when it comes to that night. I’m sorry.” At least that part was true. He gulped down what was left of his coffee and stood up. “That’s a shame. I’m afraid there’ll be more murders if we don’t find and stop these animals.” “You think there is more than one?” That didn’t shock her. Vampires ran in packs. “There could be.” “And you don’t have any leads at all?” Now he wouldn’t look at her. “A few I need to follow up on.” “So you’ll be sticking around for a bit, huh?” “For a bit, yes. I’m staying in town at Hannah’s Bed and Breakfast.” Now his eyes met hers. “If you remember anything at all I’ll be there if you need to talk.” He handed her a business card. “My cell phone number is on the back. Call anytime.” “I will. If I remember anything else.” “Thank you for the chat and the coffee.” He paused at the door. “I am happy you’re doing better, Mrs. Sanders. After all that happened to you, you deserve it. “Take care of those kids of yours.” He finally smiled at her. She let him out and watched him plod into the mist; heard his car drive away. Not waiting long, she grabbed her purse and keys and rushed out the door. She had to talk to someone who’d understand; someone she trusted. Joey. She was scared and didn’t want to be alone. For as Detective Bradley walked out the door she’d heard voices in her head. Many voices. One or two stronger than the rest. Vampire voices. They were looking for her. Calling her. They were strong. And they wouldn’t give up. If she fell under their spell she’d never be able to remain in this, her life. With her children and brother. She’d become one of them, a soulless killer rampaging through the night seeking human blood. An enemy of mankind. A monster. Forever. Fight it! But it took all her strength not to go to them. Instead she drove to Joey’s Diner. He’d help. She knew he’d help. Since they’d been kids she could always count on him, no matter how bad the problem. She sure hoped he could calm her fears now. Because she was really frightened.",

      "content": "Chapter 9 The Vampires There were four of them. There’d been five but their leader had banished the fifth back to the other place for the unforgivable crime of disobeying him. The empty, skyless land they all came from and despised; the land of their birth where the remainder of their kind lived in a state of numb terror among the rapacious denizens that resided there. The other place, as they all called it, was a sort of hell for their kind. None wanted to be there and all fought, every moment of every minute of their existence, to escape from. Few could. Because few had the power it took to travel from that place to the world of men. The world of men where the sky was a rainbow of colors instead of dirty water; the scents were intoxicating, the seasons were temperate, not glacial all the time, and the blood, human blood, was a sweet nectar they craved like humans craved heroin. The blood made them stronger. The more they had the longer they could remain in the human world. And they desired that above all. Their leader more than any of them. He had loathsome and formidable enemies in the other place. He, ancient and ruthless, had the control to go from world to world and bring along those he wished. Which made him someone with immense power in his old realm. Fog surged around the four stygian figures as they hunkered in the woods on the town’s edge. When standing at their full height, they were all nearly seven feet tall, with flowing hair the color of the moon. But their leader was the tallest; the most frightful of face and limb. Strong. Fierce. The hungriest and the cruelest. “Have you at least found out where she lives, Zebulan? Who she is?” he berated his subordinate coldly. The wind raked across his sharp-featured face and tugged at his long coat. Though he didn’t need one, none of them did. They couldn’t feel cold or warmth. Not in this world anyway. “No, and I’ve tried. She’s too strong already. She’s learned to cloak her thoughts and move through the air like lightning. I couldn’t catch her.” “Damn. How can she be stronger than you? You’re as old as I. Strongest behind me.” “She is. There’s something different about her. None of us made her. She turned all by herself. Unheard of.” “Not entirely,” he spoke harshly against the rising wind. He didn’t say it aloud or let them hear his thoughts but he’d known a few like her in his time. Mutants all. They turned mysteriously without his or his brethren’s’ blood. Yet they had some things in common. They were dangerous. Unpredictable. Strong. Would she be the one? Would she? “You must find her, Zebulan. Or one of you.” He glared at each of them in turn with rock black eyes. “I have this feeling about her.” He didn’t have to tell them what would happen if they didn’t do as ordered. They knew and it wasn’t pretty. Snapping his fingers, he’d send them back to the other place and imprison them there. Some never arrived…in one piece. They weren’t fools. They’d find the girl. The other two exchanged panicky looks. One sniffed the air as his comrade shifted from foot to foot, clenching and unclenching his claw like hands. They were hungry. Their inhuman eyes glittered. Their leader, knowing what was in their hearts said, “First we hunt, replenish our strength.” Then strode away. “Where?” One skittered along behind him. “There’s a road not far from here that sees much traffic even at this late hour. We’ll go there and pick something up.” The four of them floated into the mist between the trees and the night swallowed them. *** “Jack, please slow down,” his wife snapped as she peered through the condensation rimming the car’s window. She was a fragile woman with blond hair, thin skin and not much meat on her bones. A grade school teacher with a yearning to write children’s books someday. “This damn fog-soup,” he said, a gregarious man who sold siding for a living. Taking his right hand and using the cuff of his shirtsleeve he smeared the film away from the windshield so he could see. “I can barely make out the road. I hope I’m still on it.” The frown on his face was one he’d been wearing for the last hour. They’d been driving since early morning on their way to see his wife’s grandmother, in the hospital after suffering a stroke. The old lady had raised his wife so the two were close even though they now lived in different states. Their daughter was asleep, sprawled across the rear seat. He glanced at her to be sure she was okay. She was. The girl loved her great-grandmother and the old lady’s illness had upset her. When she was upset, she slept. But then the girl, at twelve years old, was a sensitive soul and ached for everyone and anyone who was having troubles. She helped the old people in their neighborhood by fetching groceries or cleaning their untidy little houses. She had a smile for everyone and everyone loved her. Grunting, he squinted through the cloudy window again. His wife was right about slowing down and his foot let up on the accelerator. The fog was a wall of gray all around them. “I have no idea where we are,” he admitted. “Could be on Jupiter for all I know.” “We’re somewhere in Florida,” she responded with a sense of humor he’d come to depend on and appreciate in hard times. She flashed him an encouraging smile. “Yeah, somewhere in Florida. Maybe we should pull over and wait this out?” His wife shook her head. “Mom said there wasn’t much time. She thinks Grandma is only holding on waiting to see us.” “I know, I know.” Something thumped on the car’s roof. Unusual because they were driving a sturdy over-sized SUV with a luggage rack on top. It happened again. The car swerved violently to the right and they almost careened off the road. “What the hell was that?” Listening, the man cocked his head and slowed the car down to a crawl. All he could hear was the engine and tree limbs sliding along the side of the vehicle. Outside, the wind was a soft moan. The night was endless. Their headlights cut through it but showed little. More fog. A gauntlet of dark swaying trees ahead of them. A thin ribbon of road. Another thump on the roof. Louder. Something dragging towards the front. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Jack had a really bad feeling about it all right before the man’s face–horrifying to look at because of the unearthly hunger in its mad eyes and the sharp spike like teeth–lowered down and stared at him through the windshield. A man’s on top of the car? While I’m driving? What– His wife screamed as the man’s fist shattered in the glass; came in and snatched her. Jack yelled when she was yanked up and through the hole as if she’d been a rag doll. There hadn’t even been time to reach out for her. Save her. His daughter thrashed in the back seat; he glimpsed her in the rearview mirror, in a death struggle with something that had gotten in the car. Another one? The girl was crying and whimpering for him. Daddy help me! Daddy. D-a-d-d-y! She shrieked and was gone. Like his wife. Gone. This is a damn nightmare! I’ve fallen asleep at the wheel, he thought as a hand rammed through the side window and wrenched him out. His screams reverberated into the October night as the car, driverless, veered off the road and crashed into a tree. The fog surrounded the vehicle like a shroud, muffling the car’s death throes. The headlights remained on for hours before the battery gave out. There was a bloody purse in the front seat and a fuzzy pink stuffed animal in the back. Suitcases in the trunk.

      "content": "Chapter 10 Jenny Joey calmed her down. He took her in the diner’s kitchen and, comforting her only the way he could, talked most of her fears away in a soft voice so no one around them could hear. There among the people working with the food and the normal activity of everyday life she let herself be persuaded that everything would be all right. Somehow. “That detective came out to the farmhouse. Asked a mess of questions,” she said right off. “He was here earlier. I told him how to get to where you lived.” He looked guilty. “Sorry. I had to. He asked. Wouldn’t take no for an answer.” “That’s okay. He would have found me sooner or later. I’m afraid I wasn’t much help to him. Of course, I couldn’t be. I’m almost in as much of the dark as he is.” There was doubt on her brother’s face. “Not really. At least you know what’s doing the killings.” She just stared at him and nodded. “Those voices I heard in my head are scaring the daylights out of me,” she whispered. The kitchen smelled of onion rings. Once one of her favorite foods, the odor now made her queasy. “I could lie to you and say it’s going to be hunky-dory, Sis, but I won’t. Cause I don’t know. I’ve searched the Internet high and low for help and, so far, nothing.” “Isn’t that what I said? People,” she breathed, “don’t believe in vampires. Not really. That’s the supernatural’s greatest defense. A vampire once told me that.” “I haven’t given up. I’ve sent e-mails to so-called experts in the field who might be able to enlighten us. I even sent one to that Harvard professor of yours who wrote that book. Don’t worry, I didn’t mention our names or where we live. I’m waiting for answers. Maybe one of them will help us or send us in the right direction.” “When and if they stop laughing. Give it up, Joey. No one’s going to help us. No one human, anyway.” “I won’t give up.” “And it eases my heart just knowing you won’t.” “That’s the courageous woman I know. All I can tell you now is to be careful. Stay alert. Keep in touch with me. Until we can figure out what to do.” “That’s the problem. I don’t have a clue, either. It’s bad enough,” she dropped her gaze, hung her head, “what happened to Jeff. Me. Now I’m really frightened. I need time to adjust to my new form of existence.” Her smile was brittle. “But it looks like I won’t be getting it. “When I heard those voices I realized we were all in danger. That’s one thing I’m sure of.” “and you have no idea who or where they are?” “No, but overhearing them sent a panic through me. I believe they’re behind the disappearances and the murders. No, I know it. And they’re going to kill again. Soon.” “More?” She nodded. “Oh, God, we can’t let that happen.” “How can we stop it?” He shook his head and said what she was afraid to, “Maybe we can’t.” She headed for the door. School would be out soon and she had to be there when the kids got home. “I have to go but I’ll stay in touch. You, too.” “I will.” She’d gone home. The sun went down. She fixed supper for Teddy and Sarah. Hot dogs and pork and beans. Evening news came on as they ate, her pushing her food around on the plate, going to her lips but not going in, so it looked like she was eating, and they watched the small TV on the kitchen counter. Long ago she’d given up no television at supper. The kids liked to watch it as they ate. It made them happy. So she let them. It’d worked out. Teddy liked the world news. Sarah rarely watched because she was too busy yakking about her day. “Mom?” Sarah asked during a commercial after observing her pretense of eating. It hadn’t fooled her. “You’re not eating. Again. If you don’t eat you’re going to turn into a skeleton.” Sarah stuck a bite of her hot dog in front of her mother’s mouth and Jenny took it. First chance she got, she got up, sidled to the sink, spit it out and washed it away. Then cleared off the table. Teddy with his see-everything eyes. “Mom, you spit that out, didn’t you?” Caught. “It didn’t taste right, that’s all. Don’t worry about it.” “Are you sure you’re okay?” he pressed. “You seem different lately.” “I’m fine. Just tired. It takes a long time to get over a coma.” She put on a smile and hugged him. “Sarah’s been hogging the conversation. How was your day at school?” Teddy squirmed in his chair. Before he could reply Sarah butted in, “Something weird happened to us this morning.” Teddy kicked her under the table. “Ouch!” she yelped. “No it didn’t,” he grumbled, throwing her a shut-up look. “What happened?” Jenny directed the question to her daughter. “Nothing,” Teddy cut his sister off again. Sarah giggled. “Wade Cruthers and his stupid friends won’t bother us anymore, that’s what happened. They got theirs. Should have saw their faces when those rocks nearly hit them.” Another giggle. Jenny looked at Teddy. His shoulders gave a dismissive shrug. “We were having a little trouble with a couple of kids, that’s all. Cause we’re new. We got it straightened out, though. They won’t be pestering us anymore.” “They were even nice to us after school. Smiled, were polite and everything.” Sarah rinsed her empty plate off. It was her turn to wash dishes. Teddy would dry. That was the deal when Jenny made the meal. “That’s good.” “Ha, I told them the ghosts were protecting us and they better not bother us no more or the ghosts would get them,” Sarah said in a low whisper and snickered mischievously. “Boy, were they scared.” Jenny hid her smile. So it’d worked. She caught the strange look Teddy gave her. His eyes were on her face for a long time until she turned away. “You have homework?” she grilled them. Teddy nodded. “Not much.” Sarah returned to the table and snuggled into Jenny’s arms. Jenny hoped her clothes would keep the coldness of her skin from the child. “My teacher, Mrs. Riceall, doesn’t believe in a lot of homework. She says if we can’t learn it during school hours we shouldn’t worry about it after school. I like her.” “Mrs. Riceall? Oh, your Uncle Joey and I both had her when we were kids. She must be old as dirt.” “Older.” Sarah grinned. “But she’s nice.” “She always was.” Jenny had the memory of a plain woman with a gentle smile and kind blue eyes, raspy voice. Short of stature. She’d been the teacher who’d first inspired her to write after Jenny had stood in front of the class and read a story about her and Joey, when they’d been really young, trying to ride some wild ponies in Sutton’s field; long before her father had bought them horses. An adventure that had ended disastrously. Jenny had been thrown into a thorn bush and Joey’s pony had run away with him and then dumped him unceremoniously into a muddy creek. Their mom has been so mad. They could have been hurt. But it made for a great story. Forbidden ponies. Just punishment. Afterwards, Mrs. Riceall had clapped and exclaimed, “Someday, Jenny Lacey, you’re going to be a writer!” Funny, she’d never told her: Jenny, you’re also going to be a vampire. Oh well. “Mom.” Sarah snuggled closer. “I don’t feel so good.” “What’s wrong, honey?” “I think I got a fever. My throat’s sore. Has been all day but now it’s worse. Do I need to go to the doctor?” Reality hit home and not for the first time. They didn’t have a doctor. Not here anyway. Worse, they didn’t have medical coverage. Another thing that had departed with Jeff’s business. A doctor’s appointment with the usual tests or an emergency room visit could wipe out what was left of their savings. They needed medical coverage and she needed a job that would give it to them. “No, I don’t think so. Not yet. Let’s take your temperature, though.” She took Sarah’s hand, led her into the bathroom and, pulling the thermometer from the medicine cabinet, checked her temperature, with an anxious Teddy looking on. “Ninety-nine point one. You have a slight fever. Nothing to worry about yet. I’ll give you an aspirin and you’re going to bed early tonight. We’ll see how you’re feeling in the morning.” “Okay, Mommy.” Her daughter’s face was flushed. “Don’t worry, Sarah,” Teddy said. “You’ll feel better tomorrow. You’ll see.” How she loved them. She was relieved what she felt for them hadn’t changed. Now that Jeff was gone they were her life. One of her greatest uncertainties was she’d stop loving them or harm them in some way. She didn’t know what she’d do if that happened. Just the thought filled her with anguish. Without her children she wouldn’t be able to go on. Surely, because of that love she could never become evil, never become a monster, could she? They’d keep her human. The kids went to their rooms, teddy did his homework, and the three of them watched television until bedtime, which was earlier than usual because Sarah wasn’t feeling well and Teddy said he was tired. By eight o’clock they were both tucked in. Worried about the kids, she didn’t want to be away from the house for long and didn’t wander far from it. That night she was going to try something different. She came upon a large doe, stopped and gently called it to her with her thoughts. It came. Let her touch it. She talked soothingly as she drank, just what she needed, and let it go. With grateful wonder she watched as it plunged into the undergrowth and into the night. She hadn’t killed it; didn’t think she’d even hurt it. Thank you, God. Perhaps she wasn’t a monster. Her gratefulness was short lived. Returning to the house, she felt eyes on her. A dark clothed man with glowing silver hair hid concealed behind a tree. A forgotten memory uncoiled inside of her. She’d seen this man before, but couldn’t place where or when. She hated that her memory was being so spotty lately, but the terror was instant. She couldn’t let him catch her. By then his hands were on her throat and she was caught like the doe. Staring up into a face so far above her. “Our leader wants to see you. Now. Don’t fight. Come along quietly.” A voice in her mind attempted to mesmerize her as she’d mesmerized her prey earlier. She listened but fought obeying it. “And if I don’t?” she clenched through her teeth. “I’ll drag you.” There was callousness in the way he held her. As if she was a lower creature. His fingers tightened and she thought she’d pass out. “Who’s your leader?” She forced the words out. “Your master. He calls. You come. You’ll learn.” So afraid she had difficulty breathing. “What…does…he…want from me?” “You.” A deep cold invaded her and she knew she had to get away. She couldn’t let herself be captured. She couldn’t be taken to this leader. Couldn’t abandon her children. Her family. Her home. It was a defensive response. She pried the man’s hands off her neck and kicked him. Hard. He squealed in angry shock, flew into the air and the dark mist swallowed him. Before she willed herself away, she sent a burst of pain at him and smiled when he screamed from inside the mist. Her powers were growing. She sent him another for good measure. His second shriek wasn’t finished before she found herself standing, alone, in her own kitchen. She’d escaped the danger. If he couldn’t follow her, that is. Frowning, her mind clutched at the memory of what had just happened and as it began to fade away, she fought to retain it. She’d about forgotten the encounter when something clicked in her mind and the cloud lifted. They couldn’t make her forget them, their threat, any longer. She brought forth the image of the man in the woods and the horror he’d produced. She wouldn’t forget him now. Someone was looking for her. Someone dangerous. Someone she must avoid at any cost. Who was he? She didn’t know and she didn’t want to. But she mustn’t forget. The next hour the black squares of the windows made her jumpy. She was worried his henchman had followed her home; that her and her children were in peril. No one came for her. Two hours went by. She realized she was fighting, every minute, to keep from forgetting the incident. She wrote a note to herself, in case, she did forget. It bothered her to no end that the memory wanted to dissolve on her. Was she going insane? Losing her human identity? Being forced to change even more? Under someone else’s control? She couldn’t be sure of anything. Again her eyes scanned the windows. Outside the wind moaned and the leaves clicked against the windowpanes. There was no man in dark clothes out there. No one. It startled her an hour later when her cell phone rang. “Who’d be calling at ten o’clock at night,” she muttered as she placed the phone to her ear, putting the checkbook aside she’d been trying to balance. Though no matter what she did, the column of figures came out lacking. Barely enough for next month’s bills. She’d made the decision as tough as it would be she had to look for a job. Had to make money somehow. They needed groceries, warmth and light, and, yes, medical coverage. “Hello?” “Jenny?” It was Andy. “Here.” “I hate calling you this late but can I could stop by for a while? I was out getting ice cream and thought you might like some, too.” She wanted to say no but the loneliness in his voice wouldn’t let her. “Sure. The kids are in bed and I could use some grownup company. Don’t bother with the ice cream, though, I had a huge supper and, I swear, couldn’t eat another thing.” “Too late. I’m at your door, ice cream and all.” “I’ll let you in.” “Chocolate, huh? Thank you. But you’ll have to eat it yourself,” she told him as she shut the door behind him. He was carrying a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. “No thanks. I’ve had my pint. Second of the day, to be exact. Put this in the freezer for later?” “If I don’t eat it the kids will enjoy it tomorrow after supper.” She took it from him and put it in the freezer. “What brings you out on a night like this? Visibility can’t be more than three feet in any direction. Not a fit night for man or beast.” They sat on the couch in the living room in front of the muted television. He didn’t look happy. His strained expression and slouching figure told her that story. “Job hunting, huh?” She turned off the television with the remote, crossed her legs under her and swung around to face him. “I suppose you’ve had a grueling day of it?” “How can you tell?” He leaned against the cushions. His fingers moved up his face and kneaded the skin around his eyes, his body filled up the contours of the sofa. His uncombed hair brushed his shoulders. There were the beginnings of gray streaks among the blond. He was, frustration aside, a fairly good-looking man. It came to her that, yes indeed, he’d changed. He was no longer the spoiled adolescent she’d known when they’d been young. Something had transformed him. She wondered what it’d been. “Easy. I’ve had friends and family lose their jobs in this recession. I recognize the look.” “What look?” He was studying her now. The house around them was hushed, but the night was listening. “That look of hopeless despair when someone has gone out looking and can’t find anything. Wretched exasperation.” “Ah, that look. I imagine my aggravation is showing?” “It sure is.” She reached out and patted his hand. Withdrew it hastily. “Don’t worry so much, Andy, it’s only been a few days since you lost your job. It can’t be all that bad.” “It is. This is a small town. I’ve hit every bank, financial institution and mortgage company for miles around and there isn’t anything available for someone with my qualifications. I know. I’ve been to every one of them. Most places wouldn’t accept my applications. Hiring freeze. In twenty years working, I’ve never seen it this bad.” “And I commiserate with you. I’m in the same boat. Only difference is I haven’t started actually looking for a job yet, though I will be real soon. The money we have left won’t last long and today I realized my children need health care. Ours lapsed after I came home from the hospital and buying it out on the market is way too expensive for our budget. A job with benefits would take care of everything. It’s the only thing, aside from winning the lottery, that will.” His glance was empathetic. “We’re both on the Titanic then. Pity us.” “Head for the lifeboats.” She tried to lighten the mood. “What lifeboats?” Her laugh was a sorry excuse for one. “I’ve been dreading the job search. I have to write up a resume. Don’t know what the heck I’m going to put in it.” She stared out the windows. Was that something flitting behind the glass? She stiffened. “What about your writing?” “Ha, ha. How many places would hire me around here if I wrote down I was a published novelist, of horror stories no less? No one. Like I said the other night I don’t have a new book to sell. I was going to begin one about the time….” she trailed off unable to finish. “Oh, I see.” Then after a pause, he said, “Can’t you start something and get an advance? Isn’t that how it’s done?” “A pitch, a book proposal? In better times I could have. Not now. The publishing world has collapsed like the economy. Companies have shed editors and personnel down to the bone. My agent said I’d have to have a completed blockbuster to be in the running. I have zippo. Not even one idea. My mind’s been either absent,” she gave him a small smile, “or on other things lately.” He didn’t have to ask what. “So what sort of job are you looking for?” “Beats me. I’m really not qualified for much else. That’s the way it is with writers. Seems all we can do well is write. Not real necessary in the real world. So you see, my problem’s worse than yours. Though, when I was younger, I painted houses and did small home improvements working with my dad. I loved fixing up peoples’ homes. Making them pretty. Still do. It makes me happy.” He looked around. “I can see you have a talent for it. This place looks better every time I come over. You have a way with a paintbrush.” “Well, if you can come up with a job that would incorporate all this,” she spread her hands to encompass her restorations, “and pay me, let me know. It has to be close and during school hours. I’d want to be home evenings and weekends for my kids.” Outside the windows nothing stirred. She’d about forgotten the man in the woods when his image slithered into her mind and the panic with it. The fact that she’d nearly forgotten the episode again alarmed her. What was wrong with her? “I will, though…come to think of it, there is a job in town you might be interested in.” “There is?” “The Ace Hardware store across from the grocery market needs someone. They have to be knowledgeable on home improvements, paints and things like that. Tools. It’s daytime work. Pays not great but Glen Dryer, the man who owns and runs the place, is a sweetheart to work for I’ve heard. The store is family friendly because he’s a devoted family man. He offers health care, too, which is rare these days. He’d work with you on the hours. Tell him I sent you.” “Why aren’t you going for it?” “Please. I don’t know a finishing nail from a paint swatch. Color blind, on top of it. Looking around at the work you’ve done here, I see you do.” “Well, then, thank you for the tip. I’ll look into it.” “You’re welcome.” He slumped down, released a sigh. “What else is making you so sad?” she asked. “It’s easy to see something more is bothering you.” “Ah, you know, it’s not just the lousy job market, layoffs and plant closings, it’s the gruesome goings on around here lately. The slayings. There’s this mood of doom hanging over the town. Everyone’s experiencing it. I can see it in peoples’ faces and in the way they’re acting. Spooked.” Her heart, if any heavier, would have fallen to her feet. She was responsible, somehow, for the town’s misfortunes. She knew it. Like the detective said, she’d brought them with her. Something awful had followed her. Was stalking her. And now the town. “Has something else happened?” She was afraid of the answer. “A boy’s missing. The town’s waiting, holding its breath. Everyone’s waiting for the next–” “Murder?” She glanced away, gnawing on her lip. “Yes. Anyway, losing my job was traumatic enough but with all this other stuff I don’t know what to think. It’s like the town is cursed.” His apologetic smile came then, as if knowing he was bringing her down, too. He patted her hand and let it linger. Could he feel the iciness of her skin? See her eyes that glittered like black stars? She lowered her eyelids and slowly pulled her hand from his as she repositioned her body. “I’m sure it’ll be okay. It’s going to get better. You’ll see.” She hated lying but what else could she say? That, yes, there’ll be more murders? Many more. And it could get worse? She couldn’t do that. “Let’s pray you’re right. Another murder and the town will go ballistic.” She closed her eyes. Oh, please God, don’t let there be any more. “Oh, I’m sorry. You must be tired. The work here. The kids. It’s late. I should be going. I just wanted to check up on the three of you. Make sure you’re doing okay.” Her eyes opened. She made her lips smile. “We are. Thank you for worrying about us. Bringing the ice cream. Tipping me off about the job. It’s kind of you.” He returned her half-hearted smile and the caring reflected in his eyes wasn’t lost on her. Was he falling for her? Heaven help him. That would never do for so many reasons. Her worst fears were confirmed when, still looking at her, he leaned over and laid a soft kiss on her cheek. The beginning of love. A tiny glimmer. Yet it was there. Not now. The thought of it overwhelmed her and she couldn’t breathe for a moment. His blood smells so delicious. Warm. Pumping below his soft skin. Yummy. She stared at him, not moving. Not trusting herself. He misunderstood her reaction and rose from the couch. “I shouldn’t have done that. I’m sorry. With Jeff being gone such a short time and all. It was thoughtless of me. I’ll go now. I can let myself out.” She could have smoothed things over but, again, she didn’t trust herself. When he’d kissed her all she’d wanted to do was bite his neck and drink…and she’d just fed. Why was she so weak? Was it something about Andy or was it the way he felt about her? The caring? She wasn’t sure but couldn’t take the chance. He needed to leave. Run. So she stayed where she was. Her and her tired smile. “Thank you for worrying about us, Andy. I hope you find a job.” She watched him slip out the door. She got up and locked it securely behind him. Not for her sake, her safety, but for his. After checking the windows, and seeing nothing unusual on the other side, she trudged upstairs. She lay in the dark bedroom, tossing and turning. If she could just sleep, when she awoke her problems, the murders, everything, might be only a terrible nightmare. Lots of rest was what she needed. Or a new life. Of course, that she couldn’t have. The night silently laughed at her as she prayed for deliverance.",

      "content": "Chapter 10 Jenny Joey calmed her down. He took her in the diner’s kitchen and, comforting her only the way he could, talked most of her fears away in a soft voice so no one around them could hear. There among the people working with the food and the normal activity of everyday life she let herself be persuaded that everything would be all right. Somehow. “That detective came out to the farmhouse. Asked a mess of questions,” she said right off. “He was here earlier. I told him how to get to where you lived.” He looked guilty. “Sorry. I had to. He asked. Wouldn’t take no for an answer.” “That’s okay. He would have found me sooner or later. I’m afraid I wasn’t much help to him. Of course, I couldn’t be. I’m almost in as much of the dark as he is.” There was doubt on her brother’s face. “Not really. At least you know what’s doing the killings.” She just stared at him and nodded. “Those voices I heard in my head are scaring the daylights out of me,” she whispered. The kitchen smelled of onion rings. Once one of her favorite foods, the odor now made her queasy. “I could lie to you and say it’s going to be hunky-dory, Sis, but I won’t. Cause I don’t know. I’ve searched the Internet high and low for help and, so far, nothing.” “Isn’t that what I said? People,” she breathed, “don’t believe in vampires. Not really. That’s the supernatural’s greatest defense. A vampire once told me that.” “I haven’t given up. I’ve sent e-mails to so-called experts in the field who might be able to enlighten us. I even sent one to that Harvard professor of yours who wrote that book. Don’t worry, I didn’t mention our names or where we live. I’m waiting for answers. Maybe one of them will help us or send us in the right direction.” “When and if they stop laughing. Give it up, Joey. No one’s going to help us. No one human, anyway.” “I won’t give up.” “And it eases my heart just knowing you won’t.” “That’s the courageous woman I know. All I can tell you now is to be careful. Stay alert. Keep in touch with me. Until we can figure out what to do.” “That’s the problem. I don’t have a clue, either. It’s bad enough,” she dropped her gaze, hung her head, “what happened to Jeff. Me. Now I’m really frightened. I need time to adjust to my new form of existence.” Her smile was brittle. “But it looks like I won’t be getting it. “When I heard those voices I realized we were all in danger. That’s one thing I’m sure of.” “and you have no idea who or where they are?” “No, but overhearing them sent a panic through me. I believe they’re behind the disappearances and the murders. No, I know it. And they’re going to kill again. Soon.” “More?” She nodded. “Oh, God, we can’t let that happen.” “How can we stop it?” He shook his head and said what she was afraid to, “Maybe we can’t.” She headed for the door. School would be out soon and she had to be there when the kids got home. “I have to go but I’ll stay in touch. You, too.” “I will.” She’d gone home. The sun went down. She fixed supper for Teddy and Sarah. Hot dogs and pork and beans. Evening news came on as they ate, her pushing her food around on the plate, going to her lips but not going in, so it looked like she was eating, and they watched the small TV on the kitchen counter. Long ago she’d given up no television at supper. The kids liked to watch it as they ate. It made them happy. So she let them. It’d worked out. Teddy liked the world news. Sarah rarely watched because she was too busy yakking about her day. “Mom?” Sarah asked during a commercial after observing her pretense of eating. It hadn’t fooled her. “You’re not eating. Again. If you don’t eat you’re going to turn into a skeleton.” Sarah stuck a bite of her hot dog in front of her mother’s mouth and Jenny took it. First chance she got, she got up, sidled to the sink, spit it out and washed it away. Then cleared off the table. Teddy with his see-everything eyes. “Mom, you spit that out, didn’t you?” Caught. “It didn’t taste right, that’s all. Don’t worry about it.” “Are you sure you’re okay?” he pressed. “You seem different lately.” “I’m fine. Just tired. It takes a long time to get over a coma.” She put on a smile and hugged him. “Sarah’s been hogging the conversation. How was your day at school?” Teddy squirmed in his chair. Before he could reply Sarah butted in, “Something weird happened to us this morning.” Teddy kicked her under the table. “Ouch!” she yelped. “No it didn’t,” he grumbled, throwing her a shut-up look. “What happened?” Jenny directed the question to her daughter. “Nothing,” Teddy cut his sister off again. Sarah giggled. “Wade Cruthers and his stupid friends won’t bother us anymore, that’s what happened. They got theirs. Should have saw their faces when those rocks nearly hit them.” Another giggle. Jenny looked at Teddy. His shoulders gave a dismissive shrug. “We were having a little trouble with a couple of kids, that’s all. Cause we’re new. We got it straightened out, though. They won’t be pestering us anymore.” “They were even nice to us after school. Smiled, were polite and everything.” Sarah rinsed her empty plate off. It was her turn to wash dishes. Teddy would dry. That was the deal when Jenny made the meal. “That’s good.” “Ha, I told them the ghosts were protecting us and they better not bother us no more or the ghosts would get them,” Sarah said in a low whisper and snickered mischievously. “Boy, were they scared.” Jenny hid her smile. So it’d worked. She caught the strange look Teddy gave her. His eyes were on her face for a long time until she turned away. “You have homework?” she grilled them. Teddy nodded. “Not much.” Sarah returned to the table and snuggled into Jenny’s arms. Jenny hoped her clothes would keep the coldness of her skin from the child. “My teacher, Mrs. Riceall, doesn’t believe in a lot of homework. She says if we can’t learn it during school hours we shouldn’t worry about it after school. I like her.” “Mrs. Riceall? Oh, your Uncle Joey and I both had her when we were kids. She must be old as dirt.” “Older.” Sarah grinned. “But she’s nice.” “She always was.” Jenny had the memory of a plain woman with a gentle smile and kind blue eyes, raspy voice. Short of stature. She’d been the teacher who’d first inspired her to write after Jenny had stood in front of the class and read a story about her and Joey, when they’d been really young, trying to ride some wild ponies in Sutton’s field; long before her father had bought them horses. An adventure that had ended disastrously. Jenny had been thrown into a thorn bush and Joey’s pony had run away with him and then dumped him unceremoniously into a muddy creek. Their mom has been so mad. They could have been hurt. But it made for a great story. Forbidden ponies. Just punishment. Afterwards, Mrs. Riceall had clapped and exclaimed, “Someday, Jenny Lacey, you’re going to be a writer!” Funny, she’d never told her: Jenny, you’re also going to be a vampire. Oh well. “Mom.” Sarah snuggled closer. “I don’t feel so good.” “What’s wrong, honey?” “I think I got a fever. My throat’s sore. Has been all day but now it’s worse. Do I need to go to the doctor?” Reality hit home and not for the first time. They didn’t have a doctor. Not here anyway. Worse, they didn’t have medical coverage. Another thing that had departed with Jeff’s business. A doctor’s appointment with the usual tests or an emergency room visit could wipe out what was left of their savings. They needed medical coverage and she needed a job that would give it to them. “No, I don’t think so. Not yet. Let’s take your temperature, though.” She took Sarah’s hand, led her into the bathroom and, pulling the thermometer from the medicine cabinet, checked her temperature, with an anxious Teddy looking on. “Ninety-nine point one. You have a slight fever. Nothing to worry about yet. I’ll give you an aspirin and you’re going to bed early tonight. We’ll see how you’re feeling in the morning.” “Okay, Mommy.” Her daughter’s face was flushed. “Don’t worry, Sarah,” Teddy said. “You’ll feel better tomorrow. You’ll see.” How she loved them. She was relieved what she felt for them hadn’t changed. Now that Jeff was gone they were her life. One of her greatest uncertainties was she’d stop loving them or harm them in some way. She didn’t know what she’d do if that happened. Just the thought filled her with anguish. Without her children she wouldn’t be able to go on. Surely, because of that love she could never become evil, never become a monster, could she? They’d keep her human. The kids went to their rooms, teddy did his homework, and the three of them watched television until bedtime, which was earlier than usual because Sarah wasn’t feeling well and Teddy said he was tired. By eight o’clock they were both tucked in. Worried about the kids, she didn’t want to be away from the house for long and didn’t wander far from it. That night she was going to try something different. She came upon a large doe, stopped and gently called it to her with her thoughts. It came. Let her touch it. She talked soothingly as she drank, just what she needed, and let it go. With grateful wonder she watched as it plunged into the undergrowth and into the night. She hadn’t killed it; didn’t think she’d even hurt it. Thank you, God. Perhaps she wasn’t a monster. Her gratefulness was short lived. Returning to the house, she felt eyes on her. A dark clothed man with glowing silver hair hid concealed behind a tree. A forgotten memory uncoiled inside of her. She’d seen this man before, but couldn’t place where or when.

His fingers tightened and she thought she’d pass out. “Who’s your leader?” She forced the words out. “Your master. He calls. You come.

She couldn’t be taken to this leader. Couldn’t abandon her children. Her family. Her home. It was a defensive response. She pried the man’s hands off her neck and kicked him. Hard.

They needed groceries, warmth and light, and, yes, medical coverage. “Hello?” “Jenny?” It was Andy. “Here.” “I hate calling you this late but can I could stop by for a while?

His fingers moved up his face and kneaded the skin around his eyes, his body filled up the contours of the sofa. His uncombed hair brushed his shoulders.

My mind’s been either absent,” she gave him a small smile, “or on other things lately.” He didn’t have to ask what. “So what sort of job are you looking for?” “Beats me. I’m really not qualified for much else. That’s the way it is with writers. Seems all we can do well is write. Not real necessary in the real world. So you see, my problem’s worse than yours. Though, when I was younger, I painted houses and did small home improvements working with my dad. I loved fixing up peoples’ homes. Making them pretty. Still do. It makes me happy.” He looked around. “I can see you have a talent for it. This place looks better every time I come over. You have a way with a paintbrush.” “Well, if you can come up with a job that would incorporate all this,” she spread her hands to encompass her restorations, “and pay me, let me know. It has to be close and during school hours. I’d want to be home evenings and weekends for my kids.” Outside the windows nothing stirred. She’d about forgotten the man in the woods when his image slithered into her mind and the panic with it. The fact that she’d nearly forgotten the episode again alarmed her. What was wrong with her? “I will, though…come to think of it, there is a job in town you might be interested in.” “There is?” “The Ace Hardware store across from the grocery market needs someone. They have to be knowledgeable on home improvements, paints and things like that. Tools. It’s daytime work. Pays not great but Glen Dryer, the man who owns and runs the place, is a sweetheart to work for I’ve heard. The store is family friendly because he’s a devoted family man. He offers health care, too, which is rare these days. He’d work with you on the hours. Tell him I sent you.” “Why aren’t you going for it?” “Please. I don’t know a finishing nail from a paint swatch. Color blind, on top of it. Looking around at the work you’ve done here, I see you do.” “Well, then, thank you for the tip. I’ll look into it.” “You’re welcome.” He slumped down, released a sigh. “What else is making you so sad?” she asked. “It’s easy to see something more is bothering you.” “Ah, you know, it’s not just the lousy job market, layoffs and plant closings, it’s the gruesome goings on around here lately. The slayings. There’s this mood of doom hanging over the town. Everyone’s experiencing it. I can see it in peoples’ faces and in the way they’re acting. Spooked.” Her heart, if any heavier, would have fallen to her feet. She was responsible, somehow, for the town’s misfortunes. She knew it. Like the detective said, she’d brought them with her. Something awful had followed her. Was stalking her. And now the town. “Has something else happened?” She was afraid of the answer. “A boy’s missing. The town’s waiting, holding its breath. Everyone’s waiting for the next–” “Murder?” She glanced away, gnawing on her lip. “Yes. Anyway, losing my job was traumatic enough but with all this other stuff I don’t know what to think. It’s like the town is cursed.” His apologetic smile came then, as if knowing he was bringing her down, too. He patted her hand and let it linger. Could he feel the iciness of her skin? See her eyes that glittered like black stars? She lowered her eyelids and slowly pulled her hand from his as she repositioned her body. “I’m sure it’ll be okay. It’s going to get better. You’ll see.” She hated lying but what else could she say? That, yes, there’ll be more murders? Many more. And it could get worse? She couldn’t do that. “Let’s pray you’re right. Another murder and the town will go ballistic.” She closed her eyes. Oh, please God, don’t let there be any more. “Oh, I’m sorry. You must be tired. The work here. The kids. It’s late. I should be going. I just wanted to check up on the three of you. Make sure you’re doing okay.” Her eyes opened. She made her lips smile. “We are. Thank you for worrying about us. Bringing the ice cream. Tipping me off about the job. It’s kind of you.” He returned her half-hearted smile and the caring reflected in his eyes wasn’t lost on her. Was he falling for her? Heaven help him. That would never do for so many reasons. Her worst fears were confirmed when, still looking at her, he leaned over and laid a soft kiss on her cheek. The beginning of love. A tiny glimmer. Yet it was there. Not now. The thought of it overwhelmed her and she couldn’t breathe for a moment. His blood smells so delicious. Warm. Pumping below his soft skin. Yummy. She stared at him, not moving. Not trusting herself. He misunderstood her reaction and rose from the couch. “I shouldn’t have done that. I’m sorry. With Jeff being gone such a short time and all. It was thoughtless of me. I’ll go now. I can let myself out.” She could have smoothed things over but, again, she didn’t trust herself. When he’d kissed her all she’d wanted to do was bite his neck and drink…and she’d just fed. Why was she so weak? Was it something about Andy or was it the way he felt about her? The caring? She wasn’t sure but couldn’t take the chance. He needed to leave. Run. So she stayed where she was. Her and her tired smile. “Thank you for worrying about us, Andy. I hope you find a job.” She watched him slip out the door. She got up and locked it securely behind him. Not for her sake, her safety, but for his. After checking the windows, and seeing nothing unusual on the other side, she trudged upstairs. She lay in the dark bedroom, tossing and turning. If she could just sleep, when she awoke her problems, the murders, everything, might be only a terrible nightmare. Lots of rest was what she needed. Or a new life. Of course, that she couldn’t have. The night silently laughed at her as she prayed for deliverance.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 Jenny The next morning, after the children climbed on the bus for school, Jenny got dressed and drove into town. She wore her best slacks, a sweater top, a light car coat and a trendy sock cap. Almost overnight the weather had turned into winter. Winter in Florida. Not cold but chilly. The sky was a flat pewter, which allowed her to move about freely, and the wind was capricious. Dry leaves danced around on the sidewalks and streets. She no longer felt the chill but she’d look funny running around town without proper attire. So she put on her costume. It did strike her, as she was dressing, that it was funny…she was a vampire going out to apply for a job. But she couldn’t think of any other legitimate way to raise money. The Ace Hardware had been there for over thirty years so she was well acquainted with it. She used to go there with her father for building supplies. But Glen Dryer was new. According to Joey, who she’d called before she’d set out, he’d been the owner for the last eight years and was doing a bang up job of it. He’d expanded the building and the business and was widely respected as a savvy businessman and an excellent employer. “It’s not a bad idea,” Joey had confirmed when she’d called him. “You working there. The pay’s fairly high for a service job and the work environment is amiable. Laid back. And remember, it is kinda shadowy in there. Not many windows.” “Sounds perfect to me.” “Say hi to Shelly for me, would you? She’s one of Laurie’s friends who’s been working there the last year. She likes it.” Jenny slipped her sunglasses into her purse, stood straight and walked in. Her first impression was the store was larger than she recalled. More organized. It was festively decorated for Halloween. There were pumpkins and raven colored cats taped on the walls and orange and black crepe twisted around the checkout counters. Real festive. Bowls of candy corn sat welcoming by the three cash registers. Computers really. The store had been updated to the twenty-first century and everything looked shiny and new. Impressive. It smelled of paint and metal and brought back so many memories of her and her dad. The woman at the one open checkout smiled brightly at her. “Hello. I’m Shelly, can I help you?” “Is Mr. Dryer in?” Jenny returned the smile, a tense flutter behind it. It’d been so long since she’d applied for a job of any kind her mind was running in circles. She’d lost the social skill for it. Her stomach was uneasy. She tried to look smart. Helpful. And nothing like a vampire. “He’s in the back. Are you Jenny?” “I am. How do you know my name?” “Oh, your brother, Joey, called and told me to be nice to you. That you were applying for the job here and would probably be a little nervous.” “Joey’s got a big mouth,” she said with a chuckle. “That he does.” The short woman with frizzy red hair circling her head like a round helmet came from behind the counter and stuck out her plump hand. Her eyes a Christmas green. “But he’s a lovable big mouth, makes the best cheeseburgers in the county, and any sister of his is a welcome addition to our little town. Nice to meet you.” “Same here.” Jenny couldn’t help herself. She liked the bubbly woman right off. There was an instant bond as if she’d known her before. Perhaps she had. In her other life. “You don’t remember me, do you?” “You look familiar. Sorry. I’m not good at recalling faces.” “That’s okay. I’ve changed a lot. I used to be real skinny and real pretty. No freckles. No joke.” I used to see you around town with your father when I was a teenager. Everyone knew who you were. The town’s famous writer.” The woman didn’t see her flinch. Shelly gestured her towards the rear of the room. “Glen’s at his desk back there in the corner waiting for you. I told him you were coming.” The woman grinned and mouthed softly, “Don’t worry. If you can add, talk in complete sentences and have a friendly smile, Glen will hire you. We really need help. “The last girl walked out a month ago. She was a real nitwit who never showed up on time, not once. We’ve been hard put to cover all the hours since. Glen’s happy you’re interested. Me, too. Go get it, girl. Good luck.” “Thanks, Shelly.” With a lighter step Jenny went in search of who she optimistically hoped would be her new boss. A bald-headed man with glasses scribbling away at a desk at the other end of the store, he was easy to find. When she walked up he came from behind it, and smiling, grabbed her hand. “Jenny Sanders, huh?” “Yes.” “Well, here, sit on down in this chair and let’s converse.” He was polite, professional, but easy to talk to. She could see where he’d be a good boss. He seemed to care about people and he listened. They spoke and she told him about herself, her children, and what had brought her back to town. Well, not everything, of course. But enough. “I heard about the job from Andy Sullivan.” He nodded his head. “Fantastic guy. Shame he lost his job. But, knowing Andy, he’ll bounce back quick enough. He’s smart. Tried to hire him myself but he’s allergic to everything to do with home improvements. He couldn’t get out of here fast enough.” Mr. Dryer appeared amused. She told him about her history with fixing buildings, her work with her father years before and how she liked decorating. They discussed the pay and benefits, which were generous, as Andy had said. Then he offered her the job. She accepted. “When can you start?” he inquired, eagerly. “Monday? That’s not too far off, is it?” It was Wednesday. “I’m finishing up moving us into my mom and dad’s old farmhouse. I’m still painting. Repairing. But I should be about done by Monday.” “That’ll be fine. I heard you were fixing the old place up and I’m glad. It’s a house that needed it. They don’t build them like that anymore. Solid. Lovely location. Like being in the country but close to town.” He took his glasses off and cleaned them with a cloth he’d produced from a drawer. His smile showed slightly crooked teeth. “You said your kids start school at eight, so would starting work at nine be acceptable? Working until three? Monday through Friday? Shelly and my other employee, Sam, who’s my sister Ella’s boy, will work the weekends.” “Perfect.” She rose from the chair and they shook hands, sealing the deal. “I’ll be here Monday morning at nine o’clock. Thank you so much, Mr. Dryer. You won’t be sorry. I’m a hard worker and a fast learner.” “Of that, I have little doubt. Ah, and call me Glen. We’re friends here. You’ll see. The town is tight knit. Why your brother Joey and I play chess sometimes at the diner when it isn’t too busy. With Andy, we go hunting sometimes. For deer, in season, you know. Like Joey, he’s a good friend of mine, too.” Jenny, again, was amazed at how Joey had changed since she’d been gone. Once a self-involved loner he’d actually turned into a man with an army of friends and a real place in the community. She was glad he was so well known and liked. It made her proud. Their dad would have been proud. He’d been a social fun-loving person as well. Very community minded. “See you Monday then.” She passed Shelly on the way out and gave her a thumbs up. “Monday morning,” she informed the girl, who laughed and gave her a thumbs up back. For the first time since she’d been home, Jenny felt a twinge of relief; a sense that perhaps she was going to make it. Fit in. Have a new life. Well, as much as she could with her secret. And she realized that, not once, had she looked at Shelly or Glen and wanted to slurp up their tasty blood. Must have been the excitement of the whole job thing. Perhaps everything was going to work out. Whistling as she slipped into her car, she caught sight of the Summer Haven Market and it reminded her the kids needed milk and fresh fruit. She maneuvered the car into the parking lot. She’d run in and get what they needed. A gallon of milk. A bag of Red Delicious apples. Four bananas. A Three Musketeers candy bar for Teddy and an Almond Joy for Sarah. Already checked out, her hand was extended, palm upwards, to receive her change when the girl, who’d waited on her, remarked, “Did you hear about the new killings?” A sense of doom washed over her. She didn’t want to know, but had to ask, “I know about that little boy who’s missing. There have been more killings since that old couple and the factory security guard?” The girl had bobbed above-her-ears chestnut hair, a pretty face, but didn’t look older than fifteen. Now her childish face wore a mask of anxiety. There was fright in her blue eyes. Her blood, below thick skin covered with light hair, had a musky strong smell to it. “Yep. Three more. A family, father, mother and child, found dead out past Norma’s Orchard right before you get to Lesterville Bridge. The bodies were in the woods, terribly mauled, they say. Their car had smashed into a tree. It happened in that thick fog the other night.” A family. Another child.Oh, no. Norma’s Orchard wasn’t far from her house. Deep in the woods. The other night. “Who told you this?” “Well, my sister, Jackie, goes out with George Kasper, one of the deputies who were at the scene and he tells her everything. Can’t keep a secret. Then she tells me everything.” A sly grin. “Nobody can keep a secret in Summer Haven. You know that.” Oh, how well she knew that. “The police have any idea what happened? Was it the accident?” “No. They were beaten to death. Accident happened during or after. Police aren’t sure.” “They know who might have done it?” Jenny kept her face emotionless. Not easy. She’d had a black out the night of the heavy fog, too. Not a long one, but still. Enough to put fear in her heart. And there was that strange stalker of hers. The one she’d recently not forgotten. “Just like the others, they probably don’t know squat. Chief Donald won’t talk about it and he’s warned his deputies to keep their mouths shut, too. George will be in so much trouble if the Chief finds out he’s blabbed.” “Why so close-mouthed? Shouldn’t we be told everything so we can protect ourselves?” “You’d think so, wouldn’t you? Chief’s doing everything strictly by the book, George says, because there’s this big city detective in town nosing around and he wants to impress him. Good an excuse as any, I suppose. But all this secrecy? It’s not natural. We’re all scared silly. As you said, people need to know what’s going on. “I’ll tell you what. I keep my dad’s shotgun close these days. And loaded. You’d be smart to do the same. But I’d like to know…what are the cops hiding?” That there are vampires in town again? “I don’t know,” Jenny replied blandly and dropped her change into her purse. She grabbed the brown paper bag, said her thank you and goodbye, and scurried out into the cloudy day. In the car’s shadows, she leaned against the steering wheel, head down, and shivered. Not from the chill which she couldn’t feel but from the knowledge she was still in a nightmare and might not come out again. She didn’t know what to do. “Oh, Jeff, where are you when I need you? What do I do now? Who’s going to protect the kids and me? How am I supposed to handle this alone?” Three more dead. A family. A child. Like Teddy and Sarah. Oh, God. All her earlier happiness at snagging a job had dulled. She sat there for a long time watching the townspeople going about their normal activities. Running from store to store. Stopping to gossip with their neighbors. Driving by with everyday thoughts on their faces. If they only knew what had come among them. Poor things. When she’d gathered her wits about her again she drove to Joey’s diner. Since it was the gossip center of the town he might know more than the checkout girl had. She was right. For the first time Joey didn’t try to force a cheeseburger down her throat. Though he commented she was getting too skinny. Too pale. “You’re changing.” He stood above her as she sat in the most private, lightless corner booth they had. “Your skin’s as white as mashed potatoes. Your eyes are weird. Black glass. You move…faster.” She tipped her head. “Got to work on that. That’s what a vampire looks and acts like, remember?” she muttered. “You feeling all right still?” It was between breakfast and lunch and the diner was practically empty. Laurie was in the back preparing the lunch specials. Joey sat down beside her. “Sure, as right as a vampire can feel among what she likes to eat.” She flashed him a full set of teeth. Now, when she wanted, she could force the tips of her fangs out. Joey stared at them and her and she was suddenly uncomfortable. Her brother’s eyes hadn’t left her once since she’d come in. Trying to see if she was still her. Looking for signs of malignancy. It made her guilt worse. She asked about the new murders. “I know about them. Chief Donald was in for breakfast when we first opened this morning. He’s a mess. Worried. They have no leads and no suspects. The mystery and the sheer brutality of the killings unnerved him and it takes a lot to unnerve that guy.” “It’s unnerved me, too.” She met her brother’s eyes and tried to hide her guilt. “You didn’t do this, Jenny. You didn’t. You’d never hurt another human being, and never a child. So stop blaming yourself. You didn’t bring this on yourself or the town.” “I wish I had your faith in my goodness.” “If need be I’ll have enough for both of us.” He lowered his voice. “Problem is, though Chief Donald wasn’t Chief when we had our little, er, war with those bloodsuckers a dozen years ago, he’s seen the similarities. He asked me about it and the murders today. My being assaulted all those years ago. About you and dad and the destruction of the old theater. I don’t think I said anything that would incriminate us but I bet he’s going to pay you a visit soon. He’s got questions.” “Oh, great. Another cop nosing around. Just what I need.” “You’ll be okay. Keep your cool when he comes to question you. Tell him as much of the truth as you can without saying we were fighting vampires or that you’re one now. You’re a writer, you have a way with words. Convince him.” “I’ll try. It’s getting harder. With all that’s happening. I’m not sure what the truth is anymore and that makes it harder to lie…about anything.” Joey put his arm around her. “It’ll be okay. We’ll figure this out. Right now I’m just as troubled about you and the kids out there at the farmhouse alone with this maniac or whatever is out there as I am for myself, Laurie and the town. “You should move back into the apartment with me and Laurie until they catch whoever or whatever is doing this.” She actually laughed. “Hey, budding vampire here. Supernatural abilities. I can take care of myself.” “Yeah, maybe you can. How about the kids? Can you watch them every second? I mean, don’t you go out sometimes at night?” He had her there. “I never go far or stay gone long. And what difference does it make where we are? We all have to work. We will all be away from the house or apartment at times. I believe they’re safer now with me at the farmhouse. I’m better equipped now more than ever to fight whoever is behind these crimes. And I’m being very careful.” “Then that’s that.” He wiped his hands on his apron, brushed his hair from his face. “I haven’t stopped searching for help for you. I’ve gotten responses to my e-mails from a couple so-called supernatural experts but so far they’re just nonsense. One guy said I was nuts. “Another one, that professor, at that prestigious college who wrote that book on vampires claimed he believed in them but not as true mystical beings with super powers, as he called them. They were people who thought they needed to drink blood. “One guy said it was a sign of mental illness. Blah, blah, blah. The closest I came to someone who sounded half sane was this writer who lives in Maine who told me the best way to kill a vampire was to shoot it with a crossbow. The arrow tipped in silver and holy water. Aim for the eyes, he told me. That goes into their brains and sort of short circuits them. Then they die and just melt away to goo. Sheesh. None of them know what they’re talking about. Sorry. I won’t give up, though, I promise.” “Thanks, Brother. I’m reading up on it, too. Like you, so far, nothing that can help me.” A couple entered the diner and sat down nearby. Joey inhaled deeply and slid out of the booth. “Duty calls. Listen, telephone me anytime, day or night, if you need me. Or you and the kids stop by here or at the apartment anytime. If you are afraid or something happens, call me. I’ll come. With my shotgun loaded, my pockets full of holy water and wooden stakes.” “Thanks, but you know none of those things work. Fire or beheading is what it takes.” “If you can get that close. I was trying to get a smile out of you.” “It didn’t work.” “I know.” He reached down and squeezed her hand before he moved away to tend to his customers. Then she got up and left.",

For the first time since she’d been home, Jenny felt a twinge of relief; a sense that perhaps she was going to make it. Fit in. Have a new life. Well, as much as she could with her secret. And she realized that, not once, had she looked at Shelly or Glen and wanted to slurp up their tasty blood. Must have been the excitement of the whole job thing. Perhaps everything was going to work out. Whistling as she slipped into her car, she caught sight of the Summer Haven Market and it reminded her the kids needed milk and fresh fruit. She maneuvered the car into the parking lot. She’d run in and get what they needed. A gallon of milk. A bag of Red Delicious apples. Four bananas. A Three Musketeers candy bar for Teddy and an Almond Joy for Sarah. Already checked out, her hand was extended, palm upwards, to receive her change when the girl, who’d waited on her, remarked, “Did you hear about the new killings?” A sense of doom washed over her. She didn’t want to know, but had to ask, “I know about that little boy who’s missing. There have been more killings since that old couple and the factory security guard?” The girl had bobbed above-her-ears chestnut hair, a pretty face, but didn’t look older than fifteen. Now her childish face wore a mask of anxiety. There was fright in her blue eyes. Her blood, below thick skin covered with light hair, had a musky strong smell to it. “Yep. Three more. A family, father, mother and child, found dead out past Norma’s Orchard right before you get to Lesterville Bridge. The bodies were in the woods, terribly mauled, they say. Their car had smashed into a tree. It happened in that thick fog the other night.” A family. Another child.Oh, no. Norma’s Orchard wasn’t far from her house. Deep in the woods. The other night. “Who told you this?” “Well, my sister, Jackie, goes out with George Kasper, one of the deputies who were at the scene and he tells her everything. Can’t keep a secret. Then she tells me everything.” A sly grin. “Nobody can keep a secret in Summer Haven. You know that.” Oh, how well she knew that. “The police have any idea what happened? Was it the accident?” “No. They were beaten to death. Accident happened during or after. Police aren’t sure.” “They know who might have done it?” Jenny kept her face emotionless. Not easy. She’d had a black out the night of the heavy fog, too. Not a long one, but still. Enough to put fear in her heart. And there was that strange stalker of hers. The one she’d recently not forgotten. “Just like the others, they probably don’t know squat. Chief Donald won’t talk about it and he’s warned his deputies to keep their mouths shut, too. George will be in so much trouble if the Chief finds out he’s blabbed.” “Why so close-mouthed? Shouldn’t we be told everything so we can protect ourselves?” “You’d think so, wouldn’t you? Chief’s doing everything strictly by the book, George says, because there’s this big city detective in town nosing around and he wants to impress him. Good an excuse as any, I suppose. But all this secrecy? It’s not natural. We’re all scared silly. As you said, people need to know what’s going on. “I’ll tell you what. I keep my dad’s shotgun close these days. And loaded. You’d be smart to do the same. But I’d like to know…what are the cops hiding?” That there are vampires in town again? “I don’t know,” Jenny replied blandly and dropped her change into her purse. She grabbed the brown paper bag, said her thank you and goodbye, and scurried out into the cloudy day. In the car’s shadows, she leaned against the steering wheel, head down, and shivered. Not from the chill which she couldn’t feel but from the knowledge she was still in a nightmare and might not come out again. She didn’t know what to do. “Oh, Jeff, where are you when I need you? What do I do now? Who’s going to protect the kids and me? How am I supposed to handle this alone?” Three more dead. A family. A child. Like Teddy and Sarah. Oh, God. All her earlier happiness at snagging a job had dulled. She sat there for a long time watching the townspeople going about their normal activities. Running from store to store. Stopping to gossip with their neighbors. Driving by with everyday thoughts on their faces. If they only knew what had come among them. Poor things. When she’d gathered her wits about her again she drove to Joey’s diner. Since it was the gossip center of the town he might know more than the checkout girl had. She was right. For the first time Joey didn’t try to force a cheeseburger down her throat. Though he commented she was getting too skinny. Too pale. “You’re changing.” He stood above her as she sat in the most private, lightless corner booth they had. “Your skin’s as white as mashed potatoes. Your eyes are weird. Black glass. You move…faster.” She tipped her head. “Got to work on that. That’s what a vampire looks and acts like, remember?” she muttered. “You feeling all right still?” It was between breakfast and lunch and the diner was practically empty. Laurie was in the back preparing the lunch specials. Joey sat down beside her. “Sure, as right as a vampire can feel among what she likes to eat.” She flashed him a full set of teeth. Now, when she wanted, she could force the tips of her fangs out. Joey stared at them and her and she was suddenly uncomfortable. Her brother’s eyes hadn’t left her once since she’d come in. Trying to see if she was still her. Looking for signs of malignancy. It made her guilt worse. She asked about the new murders. “I know about them. Chief Donald was in for breakfast when we first opened this morning. He’s a mess. Worried. They have no leads and no suspects. The mystery and the sheer brutality of the killings unnerved him and it takes a lot to unnerve that guy.” “It’s unnerved me, too.” She met her brother’s eyes and tried to hide her guilt. “You didn’t do this, Jenny. You didn’t. You’d never hurt another human being, and never a child. So stop blaming yourself. You didn’t bring this on yourself or the town.” “I wish I had your faith in my goodness.” “If need be I’ll have enough for both of us.” He lowered his voice. “Problem is, though Chief Donald wasn’t Chief when we had our little, er, war with those bloodsuckers a dozen years ago, he’s seen the similarities. He asked me about it and the murders today. My being assaulted all those years ago. About you and dad and the destruction of the old theater. I don’t think I said anything that would incriminate us but I bet he’s going to pay you a visit soon. He’s got questions.” “Oh, great. Another cop nosing around. Just what I need.” “You’ll be okay. Keep your cool when he comes to question you. Tell him as much of the truth as you can without saying we were fighting vampires or that you’re one now. You’re a writer, you have a way with words. Convince him.” “I’ll try. It’s getting harder. With all that’s happening. I’m not sure what the truth is anymore and that makes it harder to lie…about anything.” Joey put his arm around her. “It’ll be okay. We’ll figure this out. Right now I’m just as troubled about you and the kids out there at the farmhouse alone with this maniac or whatever is out there as I am for myself, Laurie and the town. “You should move back into the apartment with me and Laurie until they catch whoever or whatever is doing this.” She actually laughed. “Hey, budding vampire here. Supernatural abilities. I can take care of myself.” “Yeah, maybe you can. How about the kids? Can you watch them every second? I mean, don’t you go out sometimes at night?” He had her there. “I never go far or stay gone long. And what difference does it make where we are? We all have to work. We will all be away from the house or apartment at times. I believe they’re safer now with me at the farmhouse. I’m better equipped now more than ever to fight whoever is behind these crimes. And I’m being very careful.” “Then that’s that.” He wiped his hands on his apron, brushed his hair from his face. “I haven’t stopped searching for help for you. I’ve gotten responses to my e-mails from a couple so-called supernatural experts but so far they’re just nonsense. One guy said I was nuts. “Another one, that professor, at that prestigious college who wrote that book on vampires claimed he believed in them but not as true mystical beings with super powers, as he called them. They were people who thought they needed to drink blood. “One guy said it was a sign of mental illness. Blah, blah, blah. The closest I came to someone who sounded half sane was this writer who lives in Maine who told me the best way to kill a vampire was to shoot it with a crossbow. The arrow tipped in silver and holy water. Aim for the eyes, he told me. That goes into their brains and sort of short circuits them. Then they die and just melt away to goo. Sheesh. None of them know what they’re talking about. Sorry. I won’t give up, though, I promise.” “Thanks, Brother. I’m reading up on it, too. Like you, so far, nothing that can help me.” A couple entered the diner and sat down nearby. Joey inhaled deeply and slid out of the booth. “Duty calls. Listen, telephone me anytime, day or night, if you need me. Or you and the kids stop by here or at the apartment anytime. If you are afraid or something happens, call me. I’ll come. With my shotgun loaded, my pockets full of holy water and wooden stakes.” “Thanks, but you know none of those things work. Fire or beheading is what it takes.” “If you can get that close. I was trying to get a smile out of you.” “It didn’t work.” “I know.” He reached down and squeezed her hand before he moved away to tend to his customers. Then she got up and left.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 Jenny Driving home, she’d had to put her sunglasses and a brimmed hat on. The sun had come out and driven away the shadows. She wished she could have felt the warmth on her skin. As she passed through town her eyes caught the Halloween decorations going up everywhere. The town, as it did every year, was evolving into a quaint postcard of spooky decorations and a plague of carved pumpkins. So picturesque. The holiday two weeks away. It seemed an appropriate time of year for what her life had become. For her, she mused as she pivoted the wheel, it would be Halloween forever. So she felt right at home. At the house she put the groceries away and got her mind off what was bothering her by finishing painting her room. She’d picked a subtle shade of milk chocolate brown she liked. When she was done, after she’d cleaned up the paint stuff and herself, she returned upstairs to her room; walked to the wall of windows and studied the yard below. The leaves on the trees fringing the woods were still lush and fairly green. She missed the turning of the colors, gold, orange and crimson, that’d be common in Illinois. She’d loved autumn in the Midwest. Fall in Summer Haven was sweet, but different. The farmhouse’s yard with the trees and shrubs, though, were breathtaking anyway, like looking at an expensive calendar picture. She loved this house. This room. All the memories of her childhood it contained. Good and bad. This would forever be home to her. She’d realized since she’d moved back she’d never leave it again. She’d grow old and die here. If she could grow old or die now. Her possible immortality and the tribulations it would cause down the line were too new to be real to her, but they were beginning to sink in. In time they’d come to light and she’d face them. If nothing else, her husband’s murder taught her she could only live in the moment. Noting else was promised. She heard the school bus braking in front of the house. Her children were home. Downstairs she let them in and knew something was going on the second they streamed past her. They were giggling. Happy. They hadn’t been in a long time and it made her happy, too. “Okay, you two, what’s up?” Sarah, her cheeks flushed and a secret ready to burst out of her mouth, swung around and opened her jacket. “Can we keep it, Mommy? Please?” There nestled between the coat and her daughter’s sweatshirt was a tiny mewling kitten. Its fur, patches of it missing, was black and its eyes big and full of contentment. An ugly scab covered its nose and it was scrawny. It raked its tiny claws in the air at her and hissed, scuttled back into the warmth and safety of Sarah’s jacket. It didn’t like her. Perhaps it knew what she was. “A kitten? How did you get it home and where did it come from?” Teddy dropped his books on the couch. “She smuggled it home on the bus. It’s a sneaky cat because it stayed quiet all the way, like it knew it had to. No one suspected we had it. We found it on the sidewalk in front of the school. It’d been hiding in the bushes. Some of the kids were teasing and kicking at it. It’s a fighter. You should have seen it attacking those kids. It bit one of them. Scratched another.” She looked at the kitten again. It was so little. Just a bit of dirty fur over a few tiny bones. But, bedraggled as it was, it was precious. There was something about a kitten that tugged at people’s hearts. Most people anyway. If they could ever find a way to keep a kitten a kitten forever it’d be the most sought after pet in the world. “Yeah, and Teddy saved it. He pushed right into those kids and rescued it. Kicked them good. You should have seen them scatter. No one bothers Teddy anymore, not since he showed them what for.” Sarah beamed up at her brother. “He’s my hero.” “Ah, it was nothing,” Teddy huffed proudly as he petted the kitten’s knobby head. “Who’d hurt a little poor defenseless kitten? Those kids were so mean. I showed them.” “Listen to it purr. It loves us already. Well, except for you, Mommy. It doesn’t know you yet, that’s all.” Sarah lifted the kitten up in her hands and whirled around, then snuggled the creature tenderly in her arms. “Look, it wants to stay with us. It picked us and now it belongs to us and us to it.” Sarah looked at her pleadingly. “Can we keep it?” Ugly as it was it was cute. She loved cats. She’d had a few as a child, but not in recent years. Now that she thought on it, she’d missed not having a cat and couldn’t say no. “You sure it doesn’t belong to anyone?” “We’re sure. If it belonged to someone would it be starving? Pitiful looking? So scared of people? No.” Sarah was watching her as she cuddled the kitten. “Please?” “Okay. But you two will have to help take care of it, you hear me? Feed it. Let it out when it wants to go out. It’ll have to be trained to go outside to do its business. I won’t have a litter box in the house. They stink too much.” She could get one of those cat doors. That was an idea. If the creature lived through the night, that is. It was so emaciated she wasn’t sure it’d make it. That would hurt her children. Yet getting rid of the kitten would also hurt them. The first nights after her change she’d had to kill those animals out in the woods. She still felt guilty about it. Saving this kitten might in some small way atone for some of that. “We hear you. We’ll take good care of it,” Sarah promised and Teddy echoed her. “What do you want to name the kitten?” she asked, coming close and stroking its skinny body. She couldn’t smell blood at all. There was so little of it in the creature. “Amadeus,” Sarah proclaimed smugly. “That’s a strange name for a kitten, honey. Amadeus is an old dead composer. You sure?” “Oh, I’m sure. It just popped into my head on the way home. I think the kitten told me.” “Oh, so it talks, huh?” Jenny smiled. “Nah, I can just hear it in my mind. Amadeus is a special kitty.” Teddy twirled his finger in a series of circles by his ear. “My sister’s wacky, I always knew it.” Then he smiled, too. She hadn’t seen her children so excited by something in a long time. She enjoyed their happiness and was glad the creature had come home with them. The kitten leapt from her daughter’s arms into hers. It missed and its little claws dug into her shirt and hung on as it meowed over and over. Laughing, she took it into her hands and snuggled it. It purred loudly. Something jumped in its fur. Fleas. “It needs a bath,” she said. “First thing.” Together they took the kitten into the kitchen and gave it milk. A little leftover meat she found in the refrigerator. They made a trip to the market for flea shampoo and cat food leaving Teddy in the car to hold the cat until they returned. Jenny gave the kitten a bath, dried it and fed it again. It could barely walk and she wondered if it’d live through the night. It’d break the kids’ hearts if it died now. Even she was getting attached to it. The evening was about the cat. Talking about it. Petting it. Trying to decide whether it was male or female. It was too little and none of them could tell, so they just called it an it when they didn’t use its name. After supper they made a bed in the kitchen but the cat ended up sleeping with Sarah. Somehow its tiny legs made it up the steps and next thing Jenny knew it’d found her daughter’s room and bed and crawled up into it. When she went to check on Sarah later, the kitten was there sleeping peacefully beside her daughter’s neck. She left it there. Later as Jenny watched television trying to get up the courage to go out and hunt, her mind heavy with her own problems, the kitten appeared out of nowhere and scrambled into her lap. It ran up her robe onto her shoulder and rested against her neck where it purred so loudly she ended up forgetting everything and laughing softly. It had adopted all of them. Even her. “Hey, cat, you got it wrong. I’m a vampire, not a witch,” she told it. For an answer it licked her neck and promptly fell asleep. “You’re a sweetheart, Amadeus.” The cat didn’t wake up but flexed its claws against her cold skin as if it’d heard her. “Ah, not afraid of me, huh? If you knew what I was you would be. “Or do you know?” The kitten moved in its sleep and a strange trilling sound came from its throat. She’d never heard a cat make sounds like that. As if it was talking to her. She stroked its now soft fur. “I hope you make it, Amadeus, I really do. I think I could like having you around. And you make my children happy.” She remained with the kitten on her shoulder for a time, thinking. Afterward she placed the tiny fur ball, asleep, in its bed in the kitchen and slipped out the back door. She’d put off going out to hunt for as long as she could. The hunger had flared up and she couldn’t fight it any longer. The night, for once, was clear. No wind or fog. A quarter moon lit her way as she glided through the yard and into the woods. She was cautious, a memory haunted her that there was a man in the woods she should be afraid of, she should avoid. It was odd having the memory but not recalling what the man looked like or what he’d done to her. Odd that she knew the memory of the man fought to escape her and, so far, by will alone, she’d retained it. As if something or someone was trying to erase it. So she hunted swiftly, keeping her ears and eyes open for intruders. In the last few days she’d felt more changes coming over her. An owl hooted far away, miles perhaps, deep in some tree and she could hear it. She could run at a speed faster than any human and she could see in the dark, and further, as if it were day. When she caught the deer, at first it struggled, and she sent comforting thoughts so it calmed. Standing still, it let her drink. She was gentle with it and was sure under her spell it didn’t feel anything. She released the animal and it stumbled into the bushes and sprinted away. She hadn’t hurt it. Much. Only borrowed some of its blood. Oh yeah, she could handle this vampire thing. Live a life without taking lives. Control it. Easy. She loped through the woods, thrilling at the strength in her body, the sheer joy of being free in the night, the deer’s warm blood giving her a sense of euphoria the like of which she’d rarely had in her other life. She now understood how vampires grew to love their strange existence. Her night run was exhilarating. The blood tasted had been liquid chocolate and went down like the finest champagne. Who needed meat and potatoes? She stopped, her ears taking in the song of the night. In the heart of the woods, miles away, a coyote howled. Closer, a horse neighed. Stamped its hooves. Whinnied. That sounds like dad’s old horse, Black Beauty. Impossible. Black Beauty’s dead. Both horses are dead. They died years ago in the field behind the farmhouse. Slaughtered by the theater vampires as revenge, a warning, against her and Jeff’s interference. Hooves galloped somewhere in the distance. There was a flurry of snorting and pawing. They came closer, louder, and then began to move away, diminish. A familiar whinny floated on the air and was echoed by another. Her lips curved into a smile. It was Black Beauty and Lightning. Even after all this time she’d recognized their distinctive neighs. She ran in their direction. The yearning, a bittersweet reminder of the past and the people and things she’d lost, to see them again so strong she couldn’t stop. When she stumbled out of the trees into a clearing the moon showed her two ghostly horses, one darker in the shadows than the other, galloping on the far end in the moonlight. They slowed and floated to a halt; the darker one, young again, turned its majestic head and tossed its flowing mane, pawed the ground, and stared right at her. Black Beauty. It was really him. But not. She could see through the horse. The same with the other one, Lightning. Ghosts. “Hey, boy,” she shouted out to the animal. “Black Beauty, come here, boy.” The horse stopped, looked at her; reared. Its whinny was gentle horse laughter. She went towards it but, with its companion, it spun on transparent hooves and jumped into thin air. Both vanished as if they’d never been there. Damn, was seeing and hearing ghost animals another one of her new abilities? Was she going to be able to see other kinds of spirits as well? Please, not human ghosts. She couldn’t take that. She had way too many dead people in her past. Some had loved, some had hated her and some she was responsible for their demise. No way she wanted to see any of them, as much as her heart said she would; her good sense said she wouldn’t. What kind of a damn vampire was she anyway? The idea of living in a world where dead people, even those she’d loved, could just show up, upset her nearly as much as being a creature of the night. There had to be a division between life and death or she feared for the last shred of her sanity. Perhaps the ghost horses had just been in her mind? Something she’d wanted so badly she’d wished them into being. After all, she had a vivid imagination; she’d been under great stress. In the place where she’d once loved and known them, perhaps she’d imagined her father’s horses prancing around. That was it. Simple. All in her mind. The moon had inched downwards in the sky as she turned and headed towards the farmhouse. It was time to return home to her children. Awareness of the shadows stalking her, an encircling noose of entrapment, began once she entered the woods. She’d let her guard down again. So foolish of her. Before she could run, the shadows were on her. A steely hand grabbed one arm, another clamped around the other. Her instincts warned she was in real danger. These were her kind but not like her. There was this stench of malevolence around them. Strong as smoke. Don’t let them capture you. You must get away. “Ah,” a voice spoke near her ear, “you are strong. Zebulon said you were. I didn’t believe him. It’s beyond me how you’ve come to be what you are. It’s extraordinarily rare you didn’t die and then became one of us. You’ll come with us. Now.” “Who are you?” she demanded, not struggling to escape. Be smart. Wait for a chance. Think of Teddy and Sarah. You must protect them. “I go by Dante. And you?” She refused to answer. “Can’t you read my mind?” He didn’t answer for a minute. Then he replied, “It doesn’t matter. All you need to know is you belong to us. We’ll decide what to do with you. Come along.” “And if I don’t come along as you so nicely put it?” “Then,” his laugh was somehow sinister, “we’ll have no further use for you. You’ll die here and now. I’m stronger than you. We’re all stronger than you.” As afraid as she was, the words slipped out, “Did you kill my husband?” “Your husband?” As if he didn’t know what she was talking about. “Jeff Sanders. We were attacked in St. Louis beneath a bridge late one night the end of August. He died. I lived. Something, a cloud of shadows, swept in and out and left him dead.” The vampire didn’t respond at first as if he were mulling it over. “Well, did you?” “Most likely. We dispatch so many of you. You’re our nourishment. We travel all over your world.” He snapped his fingers and the crack ricocheted around them. “You can’t expect me to recall every last pitiful one and where.” The heartlessness in his voice made her instantly loathe him, as his grip tightened. “How did you find me?” “What you are called to us once your change was complete. It’s the way we knew you existed. Distance doesn’t matter.” “Are you…am I…a vampire?” “A vampire?” “A vampire,” she hissed. Another disgusted laugh. “Vampire? That’s what your kind think we are, except we’re so much more. We’re from another…place.” His free hand waved in front of her face. “A vampire is a creature you humans made up. We’re not dead or undead, nor one of your devil’s disciples or any of those ridiculous things. One day we’ll rule this planet and all you cattle on it. “I’ll give you a choice. You join us or not. It matters little to me either way. We just can’t have you out in the world running free. Alerting people to our existence before we’re ready for that to happen. It puts us in danger. If you’re not with us, you’re our enemy–and our enemies we do not allow to live.” She didn’t want to join him. Them. She wanted to scratch his eyes out and break his neck. Jeff had been more than this monster’s nourishment; his death more than a consumed Happy Meal to her, to Teddy and Sarah. Damn if she was going with them! The rage, fear and loss of the last month boiled over inside her and ignoring the words and warnings, she tore from their grasp and fled. Her body, lifting from the ground, moved faster than the wind through the night trees. Behind her she heard their curses and pursuit. She thought of the farmhouse, longing for the safety of its walls, and suddenly she was there in her kitchen. Her enemies left behind somewhere in the woods. She got away this time. How? Could they track her? Find her? She didn’t know. She held her breath, listening, for what felt like an eternity. Nothing. After a while she thought she might be safe. No one had followed her. She consciously cloaked her thoughts, her very being, and shutting her eyes, leaned against the wall so she wouldn’t sink to the floor. At night, she left on a nightlight above the sink so the kitchen was dim with shadows. They moved and terrified her. Making her believe for a heart-stopping moment that the vampire and his gang knew where she and her children lived; had found her. Her eyes stared through the window and outside. She listened. No one was in the kitchen. There was no one outside. The night, the yard, was empty. Her body began to shake and she collapsed into a chair. They mustn’t find her. If they did her children and she were dead. As if things couldn’t have gotten any worse, with her metamorphosis and all, they had. She slumped, head bent, hand across her eyes. No tears came, but the hopelessness did, sucking away part of her soul. If she still had a soul? Did whatever she was now have a soul? She didn’t know. It was merely another brick to weigh her down. Something tiny and furry bounced across the floor and launched itself into her lap, meowing the whole way, announcing its entrance. Amadeus climbed up her blue jeans and sweatshirt. As if it was hugging her, its paws slid around her neck and its tongue licked her face. A paw tickled her cheek. Its purr was louder than anything else in the night and helped to dampen her panic. And made her smile. “You don’t care that I’m a vampire or whatever the hell I am, do you, fur ball?” she groaned softly. “Or that other weird life forms–cause I don’t really know what they are, either–are chasing me and want to kill me? You just want me to feed you. Give you a dry and warm place to sleep. Love you.” It gave out a run of nearly human-sounding meows as it talked to her. “Yeah, you got it. You’ve already wrapped me around your little paws.” She stroked its skinny body. “And, for me, being hunted is a real drag. I’m going to have to be so damn careful from now on. As if I don’t have enough to worry about.” She sighed, watching out the window nearest her. “Though, you know, it’s kind of amazing being able to go anywhere speed-of-light or whisk myself from one place to another. Oh, and I feel great. I don’t get tired or feel sick. My bad ear doesn’t give me any pain anymore, or those two teeth because I think my cavities are gone. Poof. I don’t feel hot or cold. I sort of miss that, though. I liked feeling the chilly air or warm sun on my skin. Least I can still smell things. Hear things. Super human well, in fact.” She tilted her head. Nothing was outside. No one was coming for her. She’d hear it. They were safe for now. This time anyway. The kitten produced another string of inflective meows. She gathered it into her arms and stood up. The room didn’t spin. The cat went back into its bed next to the stove. It circled the towel she’d tucked in the box and lay down. One or two more faint meows and it closed its eyes and grew still. “You’re going to be a good kitty, aren’t you? None of this keeping us up all night making noise or pouncing on us?” she asked. She’d had a cat once that played all night, would jump on her head in the wee hours and wake her up. Used to scare the heck out of her. Always thought it was a burglar or something. The kitten didn’t answer. Not one whimper. It was asleep. She would have loved to shut her eyes but was afraid to. She’d discovered if she got at least four hours sleep, her strengths were renewed; otherwise she wasn’t at her peak. But what would she do if those killers found her? She’d stay up the whole night if she had to, to guard her children, her home. Yet after half the night of anxious waiting and watching her mind grew fuzzy. This time so she wouldn’t forget what had happened she wrote a detailed note to herself, about the vampire who’d captured her and what he’d said, and put it in the top drawer of her dresser, someplace she’d find it and read it. Often. Around three in the morning she succumbed to exhaustion and slept fitfully in the living room chair. When she opened her eyes, it was morning. A new day. She rubbed her face, cleaned the sleep from her eyes, and looked around. The sun shone across the carpeting. Upstairs, Teddy was yelling at Sarah about something, as they were getting ready for school. And she remembered something bad had ensued the night before in the woods. She shook her head, stretched, her mind fighting to recall what it was. She finally seized a vague memory of really tall men surrounding her in the forest; of escaping them, of extreme danger to her and the kids. Yet she wasn’t too concerned. It all seemed like a dream. Could be it had been. It was only after the children had caught the bus, when she went into her drawer for underwear, that she saw the note with her name on it in her own handwriting. Confused, she read it, and everything she needed to know flooded back, along with the terror. It hadn’t been a dream, it’d been real. An hour later, showered and dressed, wearing a lightweight jacket, cap and sunglasses; after making sure there was no one lurking around the house, she drove to the diner to see her brother. He needed to know what had happened so he could help her understand, cope. Then again, she craved company. The note had scared her that much. In the car she scrutinized images in the rearview mirror; examined the scenery as it passed. No one seemed to be following her. Not right now anyway.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 Jenny Driving home, she’d had to put her sunglasses and a brimmed hat on. The sun had come out and driven away the shadows. She wished she could have felt the warmth on her skin. As she passed through town her eyes caught the Halloween decorations going up everywhere. The town, as it did every year, was evolving into a quaint postcard of spooky decorations and a plague of carved pumpkins. So picturesque. The holiday two weeks away. It seemed an appropriate time of year for what her life had become. For her, she mused as she pivoted the wheel, it would be Halloween forever. So she felt right at home. At the house she put the groceries away and got her mind off what was bothering her by finishing painting her room. She’d picked a subtle shade of milk chocolate brown she liked. When she was done, after she’d cleaned up the paint stuff and herself, she returned upstairs to her room; walked to the wall of windows and studied the yard below. The leaves on the trees fringing the woods were still lush and fairly green. She missed the turning of the colors, gold, orange and crimson, that’d be common in Illinois. She’d loved autumn in the Midwest. Fall in Summer Haven was sweet, but different. The farmhouse’s yard with the trees and shrubs, though, were breathtaking anyway, like looking at an expensive calendar picture. She loved this house. This room. All the memories of her childhood it contained. Good and bad. This would forever be home to her. She’d realized since she’d moved back she’d never leave it again. She’d grow old and die here. If she could grow old or die now. Her possible immortality and the tribulations it would cause down the line were too new to be real to her, but they were beginning to sink in. In time they’d come to light and she’d face them. If nothing else, her husband’s murder taught her she could only live in the moment. Noting else was promised. She heard the school bus braking in front of the house. Her children were home. Downstairs she let them in and knew something was going on the second they streamed past her. They were giggling. Happy. They hadn’t been in a long time and it made her happy, too. “Okay, you two, what’s up?” Sarah, her cheeks flushed and a secret ready to burst out of her mouth, swung around and opened her jacket. “Can we keep it, Mommy? Please?” There nestled between the coat and her daughter’s sweatshirt was a tiny mewling kitten. Its fur, patches of it missing, was black and its eyes big and full of contentment. An ugly scab covered its nose and it was scrawny. It raked its tiny claws in the air at her and hissed, scuttled back into the warmth and safety of Sarah’s jacket. It didn’t like her. Perhaps it knew what she was. “A kitten? How did you get it home and where did it come from?” Teddy dropped his books on the couch. “She smuggled it home on the bus. It’s a sneaky cat because it stayed quiet all the way, like it knew it had to. No one suspected we had it. We found it on the sidewalk in front of the school. It’d been hiding in the bushes. Some of the kids were teasing and kicking at it. It’s a fighter. You should have seen it attacking those kids. It bit one of them. Scratched another.” She looked at the kitten again. It was so little. Just a bit of dirty fur over a few tiny bones. But, bedraggled as it was, it was precious. There was something about a kitten that tugged at people’s hearts. Most people anyway. If they could ever find a way to keep a kitten a kitten forever it’d be the most sought after pet in the world. “Yeah, and Teddy saved it. He pushed right into those kids and rescued it. Kicked them good. You should have seen them scatter. No one bothers Teddy anymore, not since he showed them what for.” Sarah beamed up at her brother. “He’s my hero.” “Ah, it was nothing,” Teddy huffed proudly as he petted the kitten’s knobby head. “Who’d hurt a little poor defenseless kitten? Those kids were so mean. I showed them.” “Listen to it purr. It loves us already. Well, except for you, Mommy. It doesn’t know you yet, that’s all.” Sarah lifted the kitten up in her hands and whirled around, then snuggled the creature tenderly in her arms. “Look, it wants to stay with us. It picked us and now it belongs to us and us to it.” Sarah looked at her pleadingly. “Can we keep it?” Ugly as it was it was cute. She loved cats. She’d had a few as a child, but not in recent years. Now that she thought on it, she’d missed not having a cat and couldn’t say no. “You sure it doesn’t belong to anyone?” “We’re sure. If it belonged to someone would it be starving? Pitiful looking? So scared of people? No.” Sarah was watching her as she cuddled the kitten. “Please?” “Okay. But you two will have to help take care of it, you hear me? Feed it. Let it out when it wants to go out. It’ll have to be trained to go outside to do its business. I won’t have a litter box in the house. They stink too much.” She could get one of those cat doors. That was an idea. If the creature lived through the night, that is. It was so emaciated she wasn’t sure it’d make it. That would hurt her children. Yet getting rid of the kitten would also hurt them. The first nights after her change she’d had to kill those animals out in the woods. She still felt guilty about it. Saving this kitten might in some small way atone for some of that. “We hear you. We’ll take good care of it,” Sarah promised and Teddy echoed her. “What do you want to name the kitten?” she asked, coming close and stroking its skinny body. She couldn’t smell blood at all. There was so little of it in the creature. “Amadeus,” Sarah proclaimed smugly. “That’s a strange name for a kitten, honey. Amadeus is an old dead composer. You sure?” “Oh, I’m sure. It just popped into my head on the way home. I think the kitten told me.” “Oh, so it talks, huh?” Jenny smiled. “Nah, I can just hear it in my mind. Amadeus is a special kitty.” Teddy twirled his finger in a series of circles by his ear. “My sister’s wacky, I always knew it.” Then he smiled, too. She hadn’t seen her children so excited by something in a long time. She enjoyed their happiness and was glad the creature had come home with them. The kitten leapt from her daughter’s arms into hers. It missed and its little claws dug into her shirt and hung on as it meowed over and over. Laughing, she took it into her hands and snuggled it. It purred loudly. Something jumped in its fur. Fleas. “It needs a bath,” she said. “First thing.” Together they took the kitten into the kitchen and gave it milk. A little leftover meat she found in the refrigerator. They made a trip to the market for flea shampoo and cat food leaving Teddy in the car to hold the cat until they returned. Jenny gave the kitten a bath, dried it and fed it again. It could barely walk and she wondered if it’d live through the night. It’d break the kids’ hearts if it died now. Even she was getting attached to it. The evening was about the cat. Talking about it. Petting it. Trying to decide whether it was male or female. It was too little and none of them could tell, so they just called it an it when they didn’t use its name. After supper they made a bed in the kitchen but the cat ended up sleeping with Sarah. Somehow its tiny legs made it up the steps and next thing Jenny knew it’d found her daughter’s room and bed and crawled up into it. When she went to check on Sarah later, the kitten was there sleeping peacefully beside her daughter’s neck. She left it there. Later as Jenny watched television trying to get up the courage to go out and hunt, her mind heavy with her own problems, the kitten appeared out of nowhere and scrambled into her lap. It ran up her robe onto her shoulder and rested against her neck where it purred so loudly she ended up forgetting everything and laughing softly. It had adopted all of them. Even her. “Hey, cat, you got it wrong. I’m a vampire, not a witch,” she told it. For an answer it licked her neck and promptly fell asleep. “You’re a sweetheart, Amadeus.” The cat didn’t wake up but flexed its claws against her cold skin as if it’d heard her. “Ah, not afraid of me, huh? If you knew what I was you would be. “Or do you know?” The kitten moved in its sleep and a strange trilling sound came from its throat. She’d never heard a cat make sounds like that. As if it was talking to her. She stroked its now soft fur. “I hope you make it, Amadeus, I really do. I think I could like having you around. And you make my children happy.” She remained with the kitten on her shoulder for a time, thinking. Afterward she placed the tiny fur ball, asleep, in its bed in the kitchen and slipped out the back door. She’d put off going out to hunt for as long as she could. The hunger had flared up and she couldn’t fight it any longer. The night, for once, was clear. No wind or fog. A quarter moon lit her way as she glided through the yard and into the woods. She was cautious, a memory haunted her that there was a man in the woods she should be afraid of, she should avoid. It was odd having the memory but not recalling what the man looked like or what he’d done to her. Odd that she knew the memory of the man fought to escape her and, so far, by will alone, she’d retained it. As if something or someone was trying to erase it. So she hunted swiftly, keeping her ears and eyes open for intruders. In the last few days she’d felt more changes coming over her. An owl hooted far away, miles perhaps, deep in some tree and she could hear it. She could run at a speed faster than any human and she could see in the dark, and further, as if it were day. When she caught the deer, at first it struggled, and she sent comforting thoughts so it calmed. Standing still, it let her drink. She was gentle with it and was sure under her spell it didn’t feel anything. She released the animal and it stumbled into the bushes and sprinted away. She hadn’t hurt it. Much. Only borrowed some of its blood. Oh yeah, she could handle this vampire thing. Live a life without taking lives. Control it. Easy. She loped through the woods, thrilling at the strength in her body, the sheer joy of being free in the night, the deer’s warm blood giving her a sense of euphoria the like of which she’d rarely had in her other life. She now understood how vampires grew to love their strange existence. Her night run was exhilarating. The blood tasted had been liquid chocolate and went down like the finest champagne. Who needed meat and potatoes? She stopped, her ears taking in the song of the night. In the heart of the woods, miles away, a coyote howled. Closer, a horse neighed. Stamped its hooves. Whinnied. That sounds like dad’s old horse, Black Beauty. Impossible. Black Beauty’s dead. Both horses are dead. They died years ago in the field behind the farmhouse. Slaughtered by the theater vampires as revenge, a warning, against her and Jeff’s interference. Hooves galloped somewhere in the distance. There was a flurry of snorting and pawing. They came closer, louder, and then began to move away, diminish. A familiar whinny floated on the air and was echoed by another. Her lips curved into a smile. It was Black Beauty and Lightning. Even after all this time she’d recognized their distinctive neighs. She ran in their direction. The yearning, a bittersweet reminder of the past and the people and things she’d lost, to see them again so strong she couldn’t stop. When she stumbled out of the trees into a clearing the moon showed her two ghostly horses, one darker in the shadows than the other, galloping on the far end in the moonlight. They slowed and floated to a halt; the darker one, young again, turned its majestic head and tossed its flowing mane, pawed the ground, and stared right at her. Black Beauty. It was really him. But not. She could see through the horse. The same with the other one, Lightning. Ghosts. “Hey, boy,” she shouted out to the animal. “Black Beauty, come here, boy.” The horse stopped, looked at her; reared. Its whinny was gentle horse laughter. She went towards it but, with its companion, it spun on transparent hooves and jumped into thin air. Both vanished as if they’d never been there. Damn, was seeing and hearing ghost animals another one of her new abilities? Was she going to be able to see other kinds of spirits as well? Please, not human ghosts. She couldn’t take that. She had way too many dead people in her past. Some had loved, some had hated her and some she was responsible for their demise. No way she wanted to see any of them, as much as her heart said she would; her good sense said she wouldn’t. What kind of a damn vampire was she anyway? The idea of living in a world where dead people, even those she’d loved, could just show up, upset her nearly as much as being a creature of the night. There had to be a division between life and death or she feared for the last shred of her sanity. Perhaps the ghost horses had just been in her mind? Something she’d wanted so badly she’d wished them into being. After all, she had a vivid imagination; she’d been under great stress. In the place where she’d once loved and known them, perhaps she’d imagined her father’s horses prancing around. That was it. Simple. All in her mind. The moon had inched downwards in the sky as she turned and headed towards the farmhouse. It was time to return home to her children. Awareness of the shadows stalking her, an encircling noose of entrapment, began once she entered the woods. She’d let her guard down again. So foolish of her. Before she could run, the shadows were on her. A steely hand grabbed one arm, another clamped around the other. Her instincts warned she was in real danger. These were her kind but not like her. There was this stench of malevolence around them. Strong as smoke. Don’t let them capture you. You must get away. “Ah,” a voice spoke near her ear, “you are strong. Zebulon said you were. I didn’t believe him. It’s beyond me how you’ve come to be what you are. It’s extraordinarily rare you didn’t die and then became one of us. You’ll come with us. Now.” “Who are you?” she demanded, not struggling to escape. Be smart. Wait for a chance. Think of Teddy and Sarah. You must protect them. “I go by Dante. And you?” She refused to answer. “Can’t you read my mind?” He didn’t answer for a minute. Then he replied, “It doesn’t matter. All you need to know is you belong to us. We’ll decide what to do with you. Come along.” “And if I don’t come along as you so nicely put it?” “Then,” his laugh was somehow sinister, “we’ll have no further use for you. You’ll die here and now. I’m stronger than you. We’re all stronger than you.” As afraid as she was, the words slipped out, “Did you kill my husband?” “Your husband?” As if he didn’t know what she was talking about. “Jeff Sanders. We were attacked in St. Louis beneath a bridge late one night the end of August. He died. I lived. Something, a cloud of shadows, swept in and out and left him dead.” The vampire didn’t respond at first as if he were mulling it over. “Well, did you?” “Most likely. We dispatch so many of you. You’re our nourishment. We travel all over your world.” He snapped his fingers and the crack ricocheted around them. “You can’t expect me to recall every last pitiful one and where.” The heartlessness in his voice made her instantly loathe him, as his grip tightened. “How did you find me?” “What you are called to us once your change was complete. It’s the way we knew you existed. Distance doesn’t matter.” “Are you…am I…a vampire?” “A vampire?” “A vampire,” she hissed. Another disgusted laugh. “Vampire? That’s what your kind think we are, except we’re so much more. We’re from another…place.” His free hand waved in front of her face. “A vampire is a creature you humans made up. We’re not dead or undead, nor one of your devil’s disciples or any of those ridiculous things. One day we’ll rule this planet and all you cattle on it. “I’ll give you a choice. You join us or not. It matters little to me either way. We just can’t have you out in the world running free. Alerting people to our existence before we’re ready for that to happen. It puts us in danger. If you’re not with us, you’re our enemy–and our enemies we do not allow to live.” She didn’t want to join him. Them. She wanted to scratch his eyes out and break his neck. Jeff had been more than this monster’s nourishment; his death more than a consumed Happy Meal to her, to Teddy and Sarah. Damn if she was going with them! The rage, fear and loss of the last month boiled over inside her and ignoring the words and warnings, she tore from their grasp and fled. Her body, lifting from the ground, moved faster than the wind through the night trees. Behind her she heard their curses and pursuit. She thought of the farmhouse, longing for the safety of its walls, and suddenly she was there in her kitchen. Her enemies left behind somewhere in the woods. She got away this time. How? Could they track her? Find her? She didn’t know. She held her breath, listening, for what felt like an eternity. Nothing. After a while she thought she might be safe. No one had followed her. She consciously cloaked her thoughts, her very being, and shutting her eyes, leaned against the wall so she wouldn’t sink to the floor. At night, she left on a nightlight above the sink so the kitchen was dim with shadows. They moved and terrified her. Making her believe for a heart-stopping moment that the vampire and his gang knew where she and her children lived; had found her. Her eyes stared through the window and outside. She listened. No one was in the kitchen. There was no one outside. The night, the yard, was empty. Her body began to shake and she collapsed into a chair. They mustn’t find her. If they did her children and she were dead. As if things couldn’t have gotten any worse, with her metamorphosis and all, they had. She slumped, head bent, hand across her eyes. No tears came, but the hopelessness did, sucking away part of her soul. If she still had a soul? Did whatever she was now have a soul? She didn’t know. It was merely another brick to weigh her down. Something tiny and furry bounced across the floor and launched itself into her lap, meowing the whole way, announcing its entrance. Amadeus climbed up her blue jeans and sweatshirt. As if it was hugging her, its paws slid around her neck and its tongue licked her face. A paw tickled her cheek. Its purr was louder than anything else in the night and helped to dampen her panic. And made her smile. “You don’t care that I’m a vampire or whatever the hell I am, do you, fur ball?” she groaned softly. “Or that other weird life forms–cause I don’t really know what they are, either–are chasing me and want to kill me? You just want me to feed you. Give you a dry and warm place to sleep. Love you.” It gave out a run of nearly human-sounding meows as it talked to her. “Yeah, you got it. You’ve already wrapped me around your little paws.” She stroked its skinny body. “And, for me, being hunted is a real drag. I’m going to have to be so damn careful from now on. As if I don’t have enough to worry about.” She sighed, watching out the window nearest her. “Though, you know, it’s kind of amazing being able to go anywhere speed-of-light or whisk myself from one place to another. Oh, and I feel great. I don’t get tired or feel sick. My bad ear doesn’t give me any pain anymore, or those two teeth because I think my cavities are gone. Poof. I don’t feel hot or cold. I sort of miss that, though. I liked feeling the chilly air or warm sun on my skin. Least I can still smell things. Hear things. Super human well, in fact.” She tilted her head. Nothing was outside. No one was coming for her. She’d hear it. They were safe for now. This time anyway. The kitten produced another string of inflective meows. She gathered it into her arms and stood up. The room didn’t spin. The cat went back into its bed next to the stove. It circled the towel she’d tucked in the box and lay down. One or two more faint meows and it closed its eyes and grew still. “You’re going to be a good kitty, aren’t you? None of this keeping us up all night making noise or pouncing on us?” she asked. She’d had a cat once that played all night, would jump on her head in the wee hours and wake her up. Used to scare the heck out of her. Always thought it was a burglar or something. The kitten didn’t answer. Not one whimper. It was asleep. She would have loved to shut her eyes but was afraid to. She’d discovered if she got at least four hours sleep, her strengths were renewed; otherwise she wasn’t at her peak. But what would she do if those killers found her? She’d stay up the whole night if she had to, to guard her children, her home. Yet after half the night of anxious waiting and watching her mind grew fuzzy. This time so she wouldn’t forget what had happened she wrote a detailed note to herself, about the vampire who’d captured her and what he’d said, and put it in the top drawer of her dresser, someplace she’d find it and read it. Often. Around three in the morning she succumbed to exhaustion and slept fitfully in the living room chair. When she opened her eyes, it was morning. A new day. She rubbed her face, cleaned the sleep from her eyes, and looked around. The sun shone across the carpeting. Upstairs, Teddy was yelling at Sarah about something, as they were getting ready for school. And she remembered something bad had ensued the night before in the woods. She shook her head, stretched, her mind fighting to recall what it was. She finally seized a vague memory of really tall men surrounding her in the forest; of escaping them, of extreme danger to her and the kids. Yet she wasn’t too concerned. It all seemed like a dream. Could be it had been. It was only after the children had caught the bus, when she went into her drawer for underwear, that she saw the note with her name on it in her own handwriting.

      "content": "Chapter 13 Jenny The diner was busy. Breakfast hours. She wove her way through the crowd towards an empty shadowed booth, catching snatches of conversation on the way. –That poor family. All three found dead in their car. Police won’t release how they were killed, don’t understand why. I do know one was a child, only twelve. So terrible. –Chief Donald says there are no suspects. Again. Damn, what’s going on in this town? –I’m terrified. Got my family reporting in every two hours. Staying away from those woods. Most of the bodies have been found there. –You know, these murders we’ve been having lately? Reminds me of those we had back about a decade or so ago. People disappeared then, too. Some of them were found dead later. It was about the time the Old Grand Theater burned down, remember? –I’m scared silly to even go out these days. Never at night. I wish they’d catch this serial killer. What are the police hiding anyway? She didn’t want to eavesdrop but couldn’t avoid it. Her ears were too sharp. Everyone was gossiping about the murders; trying to make sense of them. Big news in a little town. Sliding into the booth, she waited for Joey to notice her. She took off her dark glasses and studied the people around her. Chief Donald sat on a stool at the counter drinking coffee. An empty plate in front of him. She recognized him not so much from the past as from the uniform he was wearing. He met her eyes and tipped his hat. He was coming over. “Good morning, Jenny. Remember me? We were in school together about a hundred years ago.” His smile was short lived, though. “Nice to have you back in Summer Haven. Joey said you’d moved into the farmhouse. You mind if I sit here with you for a minute or two? Catching you here this morning saves me a trip out to see you. There are some questions I’d like to ask.” “I know who you are, Chief Donald.” She also put a fake smile on her face. “And I remember you from school.” She gestured at the seat across from her. “Please sit down.” He sat down. His coffee cup had come along with him and suddenly there was Joey bustling over to refill it. The chief nodded at her brother and reached for the silver container with the milk in it. “Hey, Sis.” Joey sent her a furtive look. “Can I get you something?” “Sure, a blueberry muffin and a cup of your famous coffee.” Joey stared at her and she grinned at him. She knew what he was thinking. “Oh, that stomach trouble of yours must be better, huh?” her brother remarked. “It is. I found if I take it easy and not over eat I’m fine.” The last couple days she’d learned by experimenting she could actually eat food now. In small amounts. It was comforting to sit and eat with her children, made her feel more normal, even if most of it tasted like cardboard, and some of it still came up, though that was getting better every day, too. Now some things tasted like flavored cardboard and she only threw it up half the time. And here at the diner eating made her fit in better. “Can you put butter on that muffin for me?” “Sure.” He had an empty cup in his other hand and putting it down in front of her, filled it. “I’ll see you soon as Chief Donald and I get done catching up,” she informed Joey. “I’ve got something to tell you.” Joey nodded understandingly. “I’ll be here.” He went behind the counter, grabbed a muffin and two pats of butter and with a flourish set them before her. With his lopsided grin he went to refill someone else’s empty cup. “So what can I do for you, Chief Donald?” Her brother had been right. The man had changed. There wasn’t a trace of the old roly-poly kid, the practical joker, they’d known in high school. If anything, he was humorless, gaunt, now. His hair prematurely going white and thin. His eyes were much older than his years. Then again a lot had happened in the last few weeks. Vile homicides could prematurely age a person. She never would have recognized him if she’d seen him, out of uniform, on the street. “Call me Rusty. After all we were friends once, I thought. You know me. Don’t let the badge throw you.” Under the circumstances, the badge intimidated the hell out of her. “Okay, Rusty, old friend, what can I do for you?” “I imagine you know about the random killings Summer Haven’s been in the midst of?” “I do. It’s awful. Joey’s kept me updated. This diner is the gossip center of town.” “Isn’t it, though?” He took a swig of his coffee and reclined in the booth. “The reason I wanted to see you was these murders, I feel, are similar to the ones that occurred about twelve years ago. I wasn’t an officer here yet, but I recall you were living in town at the time. If you remember anything about them, I thought you might fill me in.” “I was living here, after my divorce, and was working with my dad. Fixing up houses.” “I recollect that. I remember seeing you and your dad driving around town in that beat-up old truck of his. Saw you both working once on the outside of that old theater. Painting the Winchester’s house. Anyway, I looked up the old records and saw you and your brother Joey had been questioned over some incidents that transpired during that time.” His look was direct, his lined face serious. “Joey was assaulted by someone who was never caught, correct? He nearly died?” “Yes.” She remained calm, as she buttered the muffin. “And you and Jeff–I knew him, too, and I’m sorry for your loss–were the ones who called in the fire at the old Grand Theater; you two were there when it happened? Didn’t see anything, though. I got that right?” “Right.” She fidgeted in her seat. She hated refreshing the old memories. Too painful. Too close to the truth. “You know dead bodies were found in the theater’s basement in the ruins after the fire? Bodies that were included in the closed police reports but never reported in the newspapers. I find that more than strange, don’t you?” Oh, oh. “How did you know that?” “I told you, the classified reports. I read them. All of them. Every word. And I made some correlations to what’s going on now.” She had to give him credit. He was nothing if not thorough. “Yes, there were dead bodies found in the theater. If you’re asking me if I know anything about them, who they were or how they got there…I don’t,” she fibbed. “Jeff and I were lucky to escape from that fire, we told the officers at the time. We’d been working on the place, fixing it up, right before. To this day, I don’t know what started it or anything else about it. Sorry.” “You were miraculously lucky to get out alive.” He was waiting for her to say something more but she knew when it was time to keep her mouth shut and this was it. “So, there’s nothing else you can give me that might clear things up a little?” “I don’t know anything else about those old murders. Like most people in town I heard about them, were troubled over them, at the time, but other than that nothing.” She shrugged. “With my divorce, Dad and Mom’s estrangement and Joey’s attack, I had my own problems.” He looked at her, his left eyebrow rising slightly. She had the feeling he suspected she wasn’t telling the truth. A human lie detector. “That’s a shame. I was really hoping you’d be able to help me out. “These new murders,” he shook his head, his face unhappy, “are spooking me and the town something terrible. There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason.” He didn’t say, either, that their savagery disturbed him even more, but she caught the thought. Lately she could sometimes read peoples’ minds, especially when they were upset or scared. Chief Donald was scared. “Like I said, I can’t help you. I’m sorry.” Jenny caught Joey watching them from behind the counter, an anxious frown tugging down his face. She sent him a small smile. It’s okay. I’m handling it. Stop fretting. “Hmm. You know there’s this detective from St. Louis investigating these murders, too? Been here for days now. Hanging around. Poking his big city nose into everything. Says they remind him of some killings St. Louis has been having the last five or six years. Same MO. He says he knows you.” “He does. Detective Bradley. Nice man. He was the officer looking into that mugging on my husband and me in St. Louis. The one Jeff died during.” She didn’t have to tell the Chief about what she was referring to. Joey had filled him in. “Sorry about that. Jeff was a good man.” Chief Donald’s eyes reflected the appropriate sympathy. She nodded and continued. “The detective questioned me a few times while I was in the hospital.” “Don’t you find it unusual that he followed you here and now Summer Haven is seeing the same kind of attacks? That the murders only began after you returned?” He was good, but she had the feeling the Chief was covering his true feelings. “Of course I do. But I don’t know any more than I’ve already told you.” She gave him a steady glance with just a touch of innocence as she took a bite of muffin and a sip of coffee. She sent a thought out that she was telling the truth. It worked. “But if I think of anything else that might help your investigation or learn anything I’ll be sure to call you. I promise.” He drummed his fingers on the table, his gaze broken. “Well, thanks Jenny. Been nice talking to you again. As I said, welcome back to Summer Haven.” An easy smile to show her there were no hard feelings. “You remember anything, though, give me a call.” “I will…Rusty.” She took another bite of the muffin. He got up. Pulled a couple of dollars from his wallet, walked over to her brother behind the counter and handed them over. “Great breakfast as always, Joey.” “Thanks, Chief.” Then he bustled out the door, got in his squad car and drove away. Joey was right there. “Think he believed you?” “He believed me.” Joey sat down beside her so they could speak without yelling. The diner was still crowded. The noise level had risen with a group of retirees that filled the booths around them. Joey gave the seniors a twenty-percent daily discount for breakfast. Now they moseyed in most days to socialize over their meals with their buddies and if the diner wasn’t too busy, play cards or chess on the rear tables. “If you would have gotten here twenty minutes earlier, Jenny, you would have run into that St. Louis detective as well.” “Goody. Glad I missed him. It was enough fun lying to Chief Donald, er, Rusty.” “Well, what’s happened? I can see it on your face. Something bad, huh?” “Oh, yeah. Real bad.” In a voice somewhere above a whisper but loud enough so he could hear, she told him about the ghost horses, the voices she’d begun to hear and about her run in with the vampire and his sycophants. When she was done he didn’t utter a word; stunned, he stared off into the distance. “Joey?” She touched his hand clenched on the table. “What do you think? What should I do?” He faced her. “I don’t know. I’m not going to lie. It scares the hell out of me to know there are more vampires–or whatever they’re calling themselves–back in town; that they’re hunting for you and the kids and butchering our friends and neighbors. “God, Jenny, it’s happening all over again.” And it would scare him. After what that band of vampire-wolf fiends did to him last time. Playing with him, cutting him up for sport before they drained so much blood he about died. It’d taken him years to get over it. Physically and mentally. “I’m so sorry,” she muttered. “I’ve brought them here. It’s my fault.” His anger was quick. “No, it’s not your fault. You didn’t ask for this anymore than the last time. We’re the victims here. Again. Damn, what are we, vampire magnets?” She sighed. “I don’t know.” “We just have to find a way out of it, that’s all.” “We have to find a way to fight them and win. Again.” Without Jeff. The thought revived the sorrow of losing her husband. “Get rid of them. I’m not running away from my home, my family for the second time. They’re not going to chase me off.” “Yeah, we’re going to fight them.” His expression reflected panic. “How?” Laurie was waving at Joey from the open kitchen door. “Baby, got a mess of orders in here waiting for you to come get ’em.” The doors swung shut behind her. Her brother moaned and got to his feet. “Work calls. Better get that food out before our hungry customers go looking for it.” He smiled down at her, squeezed her shoulder. “We’ll find a way out of this, Sis, I promise. “I’m waiting on this important information from that writer up east, who claims he’s had a few run-ins with vampires and a friend who had, too. He said he had some other hush-hush sources he was conferring with.” “These entities claim they’re not vampires. They’re something different.” “I know. That’s why I think this old guy might be able to help. He swears his friend’s attackers weren’t vampires either, but beings from another universe or planet or something. Kind of like alien vampires.” Jenny perked up. “Sounds right. Could be he can help.” “I’m waiting for an answer, perhaps tonight when I check my e-mails. I’ll call you.” “God, I hope he can help.” It was something, better than nothing. Joey hurried off towards the kitchen and she was scooting out of the booth, leaving the remains of her muffin and coffee, when she bumped into someone. She looked up and, recognizing him, smiled. “Andy.” “Well, just the person I wanted to see,” he voiced cheerily. “I was going to call you after breakfast.” His pleasure at seeing her was genuine, though he looked distracted as if he had other things on his mind. Handsome in a blue suit, his hair combed, his face freshly shaved, he looked like a typical successful businessman. No one would guess he had no business to go to. “Hi Andy.” She reclaimed her seat. There was nothing waiting for her at home other than more trepidation. She was done painting walls, moving furniture around, so taking a few minutes to see how her friend was doing wouldn’t hurt her. He sat down across from her and when Joey rushed by after dropping his orders on a nearby table Andy hollered for him to bring some coffee and a couple of donuts. “You know what I like.” “Sure thing,” Joey hollered back and kept going. “You look so professional,” she complimented Andy. “You must be out job hunting?” “Getting ready to hit the pavement, yep. Soon as I get my coffee, donuts and Joey’s amiable chatter fix. My morning ritual. It gives me courage to face the job hunting rat race out there.” “So no luck yet, huh?” “Not yet.” He finally smiled at her. “But, congratulations, a little birdie told me you got that job at Ace the other day.” “Name of Joey, huh?” She smiled in return. “I did. I can’t thank you enough for the lead. It’s such a relief to know I have a job and I think I’m going to like it there. The boss, Glenn, seems like a fair but easy going guy.” “He is.” “Friend of yours, too.” “He is.” Joey brought Andy’s coffee and shot her and her half eaten muffin a sly look. She shot him one right back. “Still here, huh?” “Just talking to Andy. For a bit. You know, making new friends.” “Everyone needs friends.” Joey winked at her and left. “You have any luck finding a job? Any nibbles? Anything?” she asked the man across from her in the suit. “Not a one. Nada. But I’m going out there every day to fight the good fight. Slim pickings, though.” He drank from the steaming cup. “Whoa, that brother of yours makes the best coffee.” “Don’t worry, I know someone will hire you soon. You’ve got skills and experience. Some one’s going to be lucky to get you. I’ll keep my fingers crossed.” “Thanks.” He put the cup down. “I applied for unemployment benefits yesterday. It was an eye-opening humbling experience. I know I’m not alone. I think the whole town was there. It was still weird. “A group of us jobless, about eight who hit it off, have decided we’re going to form a sort of club. We’re going to return to one of our houses each week to swig coffee, play cards and moan and groan over our horrendous job interview experiences after every report in. Trade job openings, if we find any, with each other, and network. Had the first meeting yesterday. It helped.” “Sounds like fun.” “Unfortunately, you can’t belong. You have a job.” There was no animosity in his words, he seemed happy for her. She had no idea why she did it but she did. “How about coming over for supper tonight? I promised the kids we’d make homemade pizzas. We’ll have more than enough.” “Well, thanks. I’d love to come over and mooch a free meal off of you. After all, you’re employed,” he teased, “and I’m not.” They talked about her new job, how Teddy and Sarah were fitting in at school and how the farmhouse redecorating was coming along then they said goodbye. Andy needed to get going on his job hunt. She was restless, her stomach a tad upset at the food she’d eaten, and somehow, she thought someone was watching her. “Good luck today,” she said. “See you about seven?” “Seven is perfect. Gives me time to go home and get cleaned up.” She waved at Joey, put on her sunglasses and left the diner. Peculiar emotions beset her when she strolled past the Dollar Store. Instead, she saw the Grand Theater, in all its lavish old-fashioned beauty, the way she’d known it as a child. From inside came that melancholy cry of a haunting violin, weeping on the breeze. I’ve heard that song before. Played that way. Years ago. By a vampire, head of the undead family that had resided there; who Jeff and I later destroyed. In a bewildered trance, she walked to the front door and through it as if it’d been made of mist or memories. Into the lobby of the Grand. Inside she slowly swiveled around in a circle, dizzy, her eyes wide. The lobby appeared as it had that last night. Beautifully restored to its earlier glory. Ready for its audience. The lights twinkled softly; the carpets were plush and the hand-fashioned woodwork, smelling of polish, shone. The sweet scent of popcorn and butter, cheese and nachos hovered in the air. The glass case was full of candy boxes. Boston Baked Beans, Jujubes and chocolate covered raisins. Those flat little chocolate pills with the tiny white candy dots on top. The carpet-covered stairs curved to the balcony and for a moment she was sure she saw the vampires who’d once lived there. The five of them. Peering back at her with angry eyes, except for the one who’d pretended to be their father. His eyes, as he played the violin resting on his shoulder, were bottomless and sad. The music rose to a crescendo and filled her head. The world. He smiled, disappearing with the others into the smoke. She stumbled out of the theater. Her memories had revived the remorse. That’s why she was seeing ghosts. But Jeff and she had only done what they’d had to do. The vampires had been feeding on the townspeople. Just like now. She grabbed the door handle. The theater vanished and she was running out of the Dollar Store as if ghosts were chasing her. They were. It means something. The vampire with the violin was trying to tell her something. She just didn’t know what. She’d believed he’d been her friend, or as much a friend as a vampire could be. He’d admired her. In the end, he’d saved her life, defending her against his more bloodthirsty children, and sacrificed his existence so she could live. She couldn’t get to her car and drive away fast enough. Maybe she was going insane? That’d explain it. A breakdown. Hell, why not? She’d been through a lot the last few months. On the way home, she stopped by the grocery and bought the ingredients for the pizzas; stopped by the library and picked up the books Mrs. Willard had gotten in for her. Maybe one of them would provide the answer to what was happening to her and a way to fight the beings stalking her. She could hope, couldn’t she? *** They’d eaten the last slice of pizza and were at the table playing Scrabble, when Jenny heard the horses outside snorting and pawing. She’d eaten a bite or two herself and had been encouraged when it’d actually didn’t taste too bad. She got up under the pretext of getting more snacks and looked out the window into the night. The moon was a radiant round ball showing only yard and trees. Horses whinnied. There was nothing there but shadows. Discomfort inched across her skin. What did Black Beauty want with her? Was he trying to warn her of something, too? “Something wrong?” Andy asked as she placed a bowl of grapes on the table and sat down. The kitten was climbing up her chair trying to get to her. It’d spent the evening jumping on one or another of them, licking their faces or snuggling into their laps. It wasn’t satisfied unless it was being held. “No. Just thought I heard something outside.” She wasn’t sure if it’d help but in her mind she’d been envisioning a sort of cloak of invisibility around her, her children and her house to hide them from the vampires. She prayed it was working. “Oh.” Sarah cheered when she formed an eight-letter word with triple points. Teddy wasn’t as into it as the girls. The words he chose were adequate but short. Eventually Andy threw up his hands in surrender. “You guys, little witch and big witch, are too good for me.” He winked at Sarah and Jenny. “I’ve had enough. For tonight anyway.” “We’ve all had enough,” Jenny said. “Besides it’s the kid’s bedtime. School tomorrow.” There was a chorus of half-hearted dissent but it dwindled away as soon as Jenny gave them the mom look. “You know nine o’clock is lights out and it’s fifteen minutes to. Just enough time to get ready for bed, kiddos.” Teddy went upstairs without another word; lately he was always ready to sleep, but Sarah hung on her arm, bantering with Andy about the new Pink CD that she was crazy to have and how far she’d gotten in the new Twilight novel she’d borrowed from a friend at school. “Okay, missy, you’ve stalled enough, it’s time for bed.” With a yawn, Sarah did as she was told. When both children were tucked in Jenny returned to the living room. “For her age, your daughter’s quite the reader.” He was slouched on the sofa, arms stretched up along the edge, looking weary. The kitten was up there, too, swatting its tiny paws at Andy’s wiggling fingers; talking to him, making its funny meow sounds. Jenny could have sworn it was saying, Andy, let me on your shoulder. At least Andy was smiling. He’d spent the day being turned down for jobs. It’d depressed him. “I miss my old job. I get up in the morning and it feels strange not having one to go to. My life feels disrupted. I have no sense of purpose anymore.” She’d spent the night cheering him up. At least it’d kept her mind off her own problems. “You’re a good mother, Jenny,” he said when she reentered the room. “I don’t know how you’ve done it with all that’s happened to you. I just wanted to tell you that.” “The easiest thing I’ve ever done is be a mother. I love my kids. They’re my life.” When she repositioned herself on the couch beside him she was sure not to sit too close. She hadn’t hunted yet. “You look tired, Andy.” The kitten was biting his fingers, snarling. All five ounces of it. “I am. You’d think looking for a job wouldn’t be as tiring as working an eight-hour day, but it’s more.” “Don’t worry, you’ll find something soon. I know you will.” “Well, when I start feeling sorry for myself, I think of you, how brave you’ve been, how cheerful you always are and suddenly I have to feel better. Tell myself things aren’t that bad.” His hand reached out and lightly touched her cheek. She didn’t move. “You know I’m falling in love with you, don’t you?” he whispered. “In a way, I think, I’ve loved you since high school. Only Jeff beat me to it.” “I was afraid of that,” she replied under her breath. An image of Jeff’s loving face hovered in her memory and stabbed her heart like a thorn. “What?” Her smile was sad. “Don’t do this, Andy. Please? It’s too soon.” He had no idea what she was. Any romantic involvement would be impossible, even if she hadn’t just lost her husband. And especially not with those vampires from another place stalking her. He pulled away. “I know. I’m sorry. Couldn’t stop myself.” He surprised her and gave her an apologetic smile. “But the cat’s out of the bag, can’t put it back. Now you know. And I’m glad.” His eyes were earnest, his feelings transparent. He was a good man. The kids liked him. She didn’t want to lose him as a friend and confidant. She just wished he’d kept his romantic feelings to himself. “And I’m flattered, but can we just be friends for now? See what happens down the road?” Stall. Stall. Better than hurting his feelings when he was down and out. “Sure. Friends. If you need time, I have time. I’m a very patient man.” “It’s time to go home, Andy.” He stood and stretched. Gave her one last grin. “It was a great evening being with you and the kids. Supper was delicious. Even if the cat landed in the middle and nibbled on it before we did. The games were fun. I had a good time. Can we do it again?” “We’ll do it again.” “Soon?” “Soon.” “I hope so. Can I call you sometime tomorrow?” She nodded, walked with him to the door and before she could say anything else he leaned over and laid a kiss on her cheek then fled out into the night. “Good night, Andy,” she called out behind him and thought she saw him wave at her before he got in his car. She closed the door. When she was sure he was gone she went out the back. Her hunt that night was brief and close to home. Deer wandered into the neighborhood all the time and she found one quickly in the field behind the farmhouse. She went nowhere near the deep woods where she’d hunted before and run into the vampires. She couldn’t take the chance they’d find her again. Or, worse, follow her home. She was in bed an hour later. There was so much to do the next two days, because after the weekend her new job started. It’d been a long time since she’d worked for anyone but her husband. So it was going to be interesting. She hoped she remembered how to be a working person. When she was half asleep she felt the kitten’s furry body wiggle under the covers. It’d found its way through the dark house and gotten up the stairs. Spunky little thing. The cat purred as her fingers caressed its back and, like her, finally found asleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 13 Jenny The diner was busy. Breakfast hours. She wove her way through the crowd towards an empty shadowed booth, catching snatches of conversation on the way. –That poor family. All three found dead in their car. Police won’t release how they were killed, don’t understand why. I do know one was a child, only twelve. So terrible. –Chief Donald says there are no suspects. Again. Damn, what’s going on in this town? –I’m terrified. Got my family reporting in every two hours. Staying away from those woods. Most of the bodies have been found there. –You know, these murders we’ve been having lately? Reminds me of those we had back about a decade or so ago. People disappeared then, too. Some of them were found dead later. It was about the time the Old Grand Theater burned down, remember? –I’m scared silly to even go out these days. Never at night. I wish they’d catch this serial killer. What are the police hiding anyway? She didn’t want to eavesdrop but couldn’t avoid it. Her ears were too sharp. Everyone was gossiping about the murders; trying to make sense of them. Big news in a little town. Sliding into the booth, she waited for Joey to notice her. She took off her dark glasses and studied the people around her. Chief Donald sat on a stool at the counter drinking coffee. An empty plate in front of him. She recognized him not so much from the past as from the uniform he was wearing. He met her eyes and tipped his hat. He was coming over. “Good morning, Jenny. Remember me? We were in school together about a hundred years ago.” His smile was short lived, though. “Nice to have you back in Summer Haven. Joey said you’d moved into the farmhouse. You mind if I sit here with you for a minute or two? Catching you here this morning saves me a trip out to see you. There are some questions I’d like to ask.” “I know who you are, Chief Donald.” She also put a fake smile on her face. “And I remember you from school.” She gestured at the seat across from her. “Please sit down.” He sat down. His coffee cup had come along with him and suddenly there was Joey bustling over to refill it. The chief nodded at her brother and reached for the silver container with the milk in it. “Hey, Sis.” Joey sent her a furtive look. “Can I get you something?” “Sure, a blueberry muffin and a cup of your famous coffee.” Joey stared at her and she grinned at him. She knew what he was thinking. “Oh, that stomach trouble of yours must be better, huh?” her brother remarked. “It is. I found if I take it easy and not over eat I’m fine.” The last couple days she’d learned by experimenting she could actually eat food now. In small amounts. It was comforting to sit and eat with her children, made her feel more normal, even if most of it tasted like cardboard, and some of it still came up, though that was getting better every day, too. Now some things tasted like flavored cardboard and she only threw it up half the time. And here at the diner eating made her fit in better. “Can you put butter on that muffin for me?” “Sure.” He had an empty cup in his other hand and putting it down in front of her, filled it. “I’ll see you soon as Chief Donald and I get done catching up,” she informed Joey. “I’ve got something to tell you.” Joey nodded understandingly. “I’ll be here.” He went behind the counter, grabbed a muffin and two pats of butter and with a flourish set them before her. With his lopsided grin he went to refill someone else’s empty cup. “So what can I do for you, Chief Donald?” Her brother had been right. The man had changed. There wasn’t a trace of the old roly-poly kid, the practical joker, they’d known in high school. If anything, he was humorless, gaunt, now. His hair prematurely going white and thin. His eyes were much older than his years. Then again a lot had happened in the last few weeks. Vile homicides could prematurely age a person. She never would have recognized him if she’d seen him, out of uniform, on the street. “Call me Rusty. After all we were friends once, I thought. You know me. Don’t let the badge throw you.” Under the circumstances, the badge intimidated the hell out of her. “Okay, Rusty, old friend, what can I do for you?” “I imagine you know about the random killings Summer Haven’s been in the midst of?” “I do. It’s awful. Joey’s kept me updated. This diner is the gossip center of town.” “Isn’t it, though?” He took a swig of his coffee and reclined in the booth. “The reason I wanted to see you was these murders, I feel, are similar to the ones that occurred about twelve years ago. I wasn’t an officer here yet, but I recall you were living in town at the time. If you remember anything about them, I thought you might fill me in.” “I was living here, after my divorce, and was working with my dad. Fixing up houses.” “I recollect that. I remember seeing you and your dad driving around town in that beat-up old truck of his. Saw you both working once on the outside of that old theater. Painting the Winchester’s house. Anyway, I looked up the old records and saw you and your brother Joey had been questioned over some incidents that transpired during that time.” His look was direct, his lined face serious. “Joey was assaulted by someone who was never caught, correct? He nearly died?” “Yes.” She remained calm, as she buttered the muffin. “And you and Jeff–I knew him, too, and I’m sorry for your loss–were the ones who called in the fire at the old Grand Theater; you two were there when it happened? Didn’t see anything, though. I got that right?” “Right.” She fidgeted in her seat. She hated refreshing the old memories. Too painful. Too close to the truth. “You know dead bodies were found in the theater’s basement in the ruins after the fire? Bodies that were included in the closed police reports but never reported in the newspapers. I find that more than strange, don’t you?” Oh, oh. “How did you know that?” “I told you, the classified reports. I read them. All of them. Every word. And I made some correlations to what’s going on now.” She had to give him credit. He was nothing if not thorough. “Yes, there were dead bodies found in the theater. If you’re asking me if I know anything about them, who they were or how they got there…I don’t,” she fibbed. “Jeff and I were lucky to escape from that fire, we told the officers at the time. We’d been working on the place, fixing it up, right before. To this day, I don’t know what started it or anything else about it. Sorry.” “You were miraculously lucky to get out alive.” He was waiting for her to say something more but she knew when it was time to keep her mouth shut and this was it. “So, there’s nothing else you can give me that might clear things up a little?” “I don’t know anything else about those old murders. Like most people in town I heard about them, were troubled over them, at the time, but other than that nothing.” She shrugged. “With my divorce, Dad and Mom’s estrangement and Joey’s attack, I had my own problems.” He looked at her, his left eyebrow rising slightly. She had the feeling he suspected she wasn’t telling the truth. A human lie detector. “That’s a shame. I was really hoping you’d be able to help me out. “These new murders,” he shook his head, his face unhappy, “are spooking me and the town something terrible. There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason.” He didn’t say, either, that their savagery disturbed him even more, but she caught the thought. Lately she could sometimes read peoples’ minds, especially when they were upset or scared. Chief Donald was scared. “Like I said, I can’t help you. I’m sorry.” Jenny caught Joey watching them from behind the counter, an anxious frown tugging down his face. She sent him a small smile. It’s okay. I’m handling it. Stop fretting. “Hmm. You know there’s this detective from St. Louis investigating these murders, too? Been here for days now. Hanging around. Poking his big city nose into everything. Says they remind him of some killings St. Louis has been having the last five or six years. Same MO. He says he knows you.” “He does. Detective Bradley. Nice man. He was the officer looking into that mugging on my husband and me in St. Louis. The one Jeff died during.” She didn’t have to tell the Chief about what she was referring to. Joey had filled him in. “Sorry about that. Jeff was a good man.” Chief Donald’s eyes reflected the appropriate sympathy. She nodded and continued. “The detective questioned me a few times while I was in the hospital.” “Don’t you find it unusual that he followed you here and now Summer Haven is seeing the same kind of attacks? That the murders only began after you returned?” He was good, but she had the feeling the Chief was covering his true feelings. “Of course I do. But I don’t know any more than I’ve already told you.” She gave him a steady glance with just a touch of innocence as she took a bite of muffin and a sip of coffee. She sent a thought out that she was telling the truth. It worked. “But if I think of anything else that might help your investigation or learn anything I’ll be sure to call you. I promise.” He drummed his fingers on the table, his gaze broken. “Well, thanks Jenny. Been nice talking to you again. As I said, welcome back to Summer Haven.” An easy smile to show her there were no hard feelings. “You remember anything, though, give me a call.” “I will…Rusty.” She took another bite of the muffin. He got up. Pulled a couple of dollars from his wallet, walked over to her brother behind the counter and handed them over. “Great breakfast as always, Joey.” “Thanks, Chief.” Then he bustled out the door, got in his squad car and drove away. Joey was right there. “Think he believed you?” “He believed me.” Joey sat down beside her so they could speak without yelling. The diner was still crowded. The noise level had risen with a group of retirees that filled the booths around them. Joey gave the seniors a twenty-percent daily discount for breakfast. Now they moseyed in most days to socialize over their meals with their buddies and if the diner wasn’t too busy, play cards or chess on the rear tables. “If you would have gotten here twenty minutes earlier, Jenny, you would have run into that St. Louis detective as well.” “Goody. Glad I missed him. It was enough fun lying to Chief Donald, er, Rusty.” “Well, what’s happened? I can see it on your face. Something bad, huh?” “Oh, yeah. Real bad.” In a voice somewhere above a whisper but loud enough so he could hear, she told him about the ghost horses, the voices she’d begun to hear and about her run in with the vampire and his sycophants. When she was done he didn’t utter a word; stunned, he stared off into the distance. “Joey?” She touched his hand clenched on the table. “What do you think? What should I do?” He faced her. “I don’t know. I’m not going to lie. It scares the hell out of me to know there are more vampires–or whatever they’re calling themselves–back in town; that they’re hunting for you and the kids and butchering our friends and neighbors. “God, Jenny, it’s happening all over again.” And it would scare him. After what that band of vampire-wolf fiends did to him last time. Playing with him, cutting him up for sport before they drained so much blood he about died. It’d taken him years to get over it. Physically and mentally. “I’m so sorry,” she muttered. “I’ve brought them here. It’s my fault.” His anger was quick. “No, it’s not your fault. You didn’t ask for this anymore than the last time. We’re the victims here. Again. Damn, what are we, vampire magnets?” She sighed. “I don’t know.” “We just have to find a way out of it, that’s all.” “We have to find a way to fight them and win. Again.” Without Jeff. The thought revived the sorrow of losing her husband. “Get rid of them. I’m not running away from my home, my family for the second time. They’re not going to chase me off.” “Yeah, we’re going to fight them.” His expression reflected panic. “How?” Laurie was waving at Joey from the open kitchen door. “Baby, got a mess of orders in here waiting for you to come get ’em.” The doors swung shut behind her. Her brother moaned and got to his feet. “Work calls. Better get that food out before our hungry customers go looking for it.” He smiled down at her, squeezed her shoulder. “We’ll find a way out of this, Sis, I promise. “I’m waiting on this important information from that writer up east, who claims he’s had a few run-ins with vampires and a friend who had, too. He said he had some other hush-hush sources he was conferring with.” “These entities claim they’re not vampires. They’re something different.” “I know. That’s why I think this old guy might be able to help. He swears his friend’s attackers weren’t vampires either, but beings from another universe or planet or something. Kind of like alien vampires.” Jenny perked up. “Sounds right. Could be he can help.” “I’m waiting for an answer, perhaps tonight when I check my e-mails. I’ll call you.” “God, I hope he can help.” It was something, better than nothing. Joey hurried off towards the kitchen and she was scooting out of the booth, leaving the remains of her muffin and coffee, when she bumped into someone. She looked up and, recognizing him, smiled. “Andy.” “Well, just the person I wanted to see,” he voiced cheerily. “I was going to call you after breakfast.” His pleasure at seeing her was genuine, though he looked distracted as if he had other things on his mind. Handsome in a blue suit, his hair combed, his face freshly shaved, he looked like a typical successful businessman. No one would guess he had no business to go to. “Hi Andy.” She reclaimed her seat. There was nothing waiting for her at home other than more trepidation. She was done painting walls, moving furniture around, so taking a few minutes to see how her friend was doing wouldn’t hurt her. He sat down across from her and when Joey rushed by after dropping his orders on a nearby table Andy hollered for him to bring some coffee and a couple of donuts. “You know what I like.” “Sure thing,” Joey hollered back and kept going. “You look so professional,” she complimented Andy. “You must be out job hunting?” “Getting ready to hit the pavement, yep. Soon as I get my coffee, donuts and Joey’s amiable chatter fix. My morning ritual. It gives me courage to face the job hunting rat race out there.” “So no luck yet, huh?” “Not yet.” He finally smiled at her. “But, congratulations, a little birdie told me you got that job at Ace the other day.” “Name of Joey, huh?” She smiled in return. “I did. I can’t thank you enough for the lead. It’s such a relief to know I have a job and I think I’m going to like it there. The boss, Glenn, seems like a fair but easy going guy.” “He is.” “Friend of yours, too.” “He is.” Joey brought Andy’s coffee and shot her and her half eaten muffin a sly look. She shot him one right back. “Still here, huh?” “Just talking to Andy. For a bit. You know, making new friends.” “Everyone needs friends.” Joey winked at her and left. “You have any luck finding a job? Any nibbles? Anything?” she asked the man across from her in the suit. “Not a one. Nada. But I’m going out there every day to fight the good fight. Slim pickings, though.” He drank from the steaming cup. “Whoa, that brother of yours makes the best coffee.” “Don’t worry, I know someone will hire you soon. You’ve got skills and experience. Some one’s going to be lucky to get you. I’ll keep my fingers crossed.” “Thanks.” He put the cup down. “I applied for unemployment benefits yesterday. It was an eye-opening humbling experience. I know I’m not alone. I think the whole town was there. It was still weird. “A group of us jobless, about eight who hit it off, have decided we’re going to form a sort of club. We’re going to return to one of our houses each week to swig coffee, play cards and moan and groan over our horrendous job interview experiences after every report in. Trade job openings, if we find any, with each other, and network. Had the first meeting yesterday. It helped.” “Sounds like fun.” “Unfortunately, you can’t belong. You have a job.” There was no animosity in his words, he seemed happy for her. She had no idea why she did it but she did. “How about coming over for supper tonight? I promised the kids we’d make homemade pizzas. We’ll have more than enough.” “Well, thanks. I’d love to come over and mooch a free meal off of you. After all, you’re employed,” he teased, “and I’m not.” They talked about her new job, how Teddy and Sarah were fitting in at school and how the farmhouse redecorating was coming along then they said goodbye. Andy needed to get going on his job hunt. She was restless, her stomach a tad upset at the food she’d eaten, and somehow, she thought someone was watching her. “Good luck today,” she said. “See you about seven?” “Seven is perfect. Gives me time to go home and get cleaned up.” She waved at Joey, put on her sunglasses and left the diner. Peculiar emotions beset her when she strolled past the Dollar Store. Instead, she saw the Grand Theater, in all its lavish old-fashioned beauty, the way she’d known it as a child. From inside came that melancholy cry of a haunting violin, weeping on the breeze. I’ve heard that song before. Played that way. Years ago. By a vampire, head of the undead family that had resided there; who Jeff and I later destroyed. In a bewildered trance, she walked to the front door and through it as if it’d been made of mist or memories. Into the lobby of the Grand. Inside she slowly swiveled around in a circle, dizzy, her eyes wide. The lobby appeared as it had that last night. Beautifully restored to its earlier glory. Ready for its audience. The lights twinkled softly; the carpets were plush and the hand-fashioned woodwork, smelling of polish, shone. The sweet scent of popcorn and butter, cheese and nachos hovered in the air. The glass case was full of candy boxes. Boston Baked Beans, Jujubes and chocolate covered raisins. Those flat little chocolate pills with the tiny white candy dots on top. The carpet-covered stairs curved to the balcony and for a moment she was sure she saw the vampires who’d once lived there. The five of them. Peering back at her with angry eyes, except for the one who’d pretended to be their father. His eyes, as he played the violin resting on his shoulder, were bottomless and sad. The music rose to a crescendo and filled her head. The world. He smiled, disappearing with the others into the smoke. She stumbled out of the theater. Her memories had revived the remorse. That’s why she was seeing ghosts. But Jeff and she had only done what they’d had to do. The vampires had been feeding on the townspeople. Just like now. She grabbed the door handle. The theater vanished and she was running out of the Dollar Store as if ghosts were chasing her. They were. It means something. The vampire with the violin was trying to tell her something. She just didn’t know what. She’d believed he’d been her friend, or as much a friend as a vampire could be. He’d admired her. In the end, he’d saved her life, defending her against his more bloodthirsty children, and sacrificed his existence so she could live. She couldn’t get to her car and drive away fast enough. Maybe she was going insane? That’d explain it. A breakdown. Hell, why not? She’d been through a lot the last few months. On the way home, she stopped by the grocery and bought the ingredients for the pizzas; stopped by the library and picked up the books Mrs. Willard had gotten in for her. Maybe one of them would provide the answer to what was happening to her and a way to fight the beings stalking her. She could hope, couldn’t she? *** They’d eaten the last slice of pizza and were at the table playing Scrabble, when Jenny heard the horses outside snorting and pawing. She’d eaten a bite or two herself and had been encouraged when it’d actually didn’t taste too bad. She got up under the pretext of getting more snacks and looked out the window into the night. The moon was a radiant round ball showing only yard and trees. Horses whinnied. There was nothing there but shadows. Discomfort inched across her skin. What did Black Beauty want with her? Was he trying to warn her of something, too? “Something wrong?” Andy asked as she placed a bowl of grapes on the table and sat down. The kitten was climbing up her chair trying to get to her. It’d spent the evening jumping on one or another of them, licking their faces or snuggling into their laps. It wasn’t satisfied unless it was being held. “No. Just thought I heard something outside.” She wasn’t sure if it’d help but in her mind she’d been envisioning a sort of cloak of invisibility around her, her children and her house to hide them from the vampires. She prayed it was working. “Oh.” Sarah cheered when she formed an eight-letter word with triple points. Teddy wasn’t as into it as the girls. The words he chose were adequate but short. Eventually Andy threw up his hands in surrender. “You guys, little witch and big witch, are too good for me.” He winked at Sarah and Jenny. “I’ve had enough. For tonight anyway.” “We’ve all had enough,” Jenny said. “Besides it’s the kid’s bedtime. School tomorrow.” There was a chorus of half-hearted dissent but it dwindled away as soon as Jenny gave them the mom look. “You know nine o’clock is lights out and it’s fifteen minutes to. Just enough time to get ready for bed, kiddos.” Teddy went upstairs without another word; lately he was always ready to sleep, but Sarah hung on her arm, bantering with Andy about the new Pink CD that she was crazy to have and how far she’d gotten in the new Twilight novel she’d borrowed from a friend at school. “Okay, missy, you’ve stalled enough, it’s time for bed.” With a yawn, Sarah did as she was told. When both children were tucked in Jenny returned to the living room. “For her age, your daughter’s quite the reader.” He was slouched on the sofa, arms stretched up along the edge, looking weary. The kitten was up there, too, swatting its tiny paws at Andy’s wiggling fingers; talking to him, making its funny meow sounds. Jenny could have sworn it was saying, Andy, let me on your shoulder. At least Andy was smiling. He’d spent the day being turned down for jobs. It’d depressed him. “I miss my old job. I get up in the morning and it feels strange not having one to go to. My life feels disrupted. I have no sense of purpose anymore.” She’d spent the night cheering him up. At least it’d kept her mind off her own problems. “You’re a good mother, Jenny,” he said when she reentered the room. “I don’t know how you’ve done it with all that’s happened to you. I just wanted to tell you that.” “The easiest thing I’ve ever done is be a mother. I love my kids. They’re my life.” When she repositioned herself on the couch beside him she was sure not to sit too close. She hadn’t hunted yet. “You look tired, Andy.” The kitten was biting his fingers, snarling. All five ounces of it. “I am. You’d think looking for a job wouldn’t be as tiring as working an eight-hour day, but it’s more.” “Don’t worry, you’ll find something soon. I know you will.” “Well, when I start feeling sorry for myself, I think of you, how brave you’ve been, how cheerful you always are and suddenly I have to feel better. Tell myself things aren’t that bad.” His hand reached out and lightly touched her cheek. She didn’t move. “You know I’m falling in love with you, don’t you?” he whispered. “In a way, I think, I’ve loved you since high school. Only Jeff beat me to it.” “I was afraid of that,” she replied under her breath. An image of Jeff’s loving face hovered in her memory and stabbed her heart like a thorn. “What?” Her smile was sad. “Don’t do this, Andy. Please? It’s too soon.” He had no idea what she was. Any romantic involvement would be impossible, even if she hadn’t just lost her husband. And especially not with those vampires from another place stalking her. He pulled away. “I know. I’m sorry. Couldn’t stop myself.” He surprised her and gave her an apologetic smile. “But the cat’s out of the bag, can’t put it back. Now you know. And I’m glad.” His eyes were earnest, his feelings transparent. He was a good man. The kids liked him. She didn’t want to lose him as a friend and confidant. She just wished he’d kept his romantic feelings to himself. “And I’m flattered, but can we just be friends for now? See what happens down the road?” Stall. Stall. Better than hurting his feelings when he was down and out. “Sure. Friends. If you need time, I have time. I’m a very patient man.” “It’s time to go home, Andy.” He stood and stretched. Gave her one last grin. “It was a great evening being with you and the kids. Supper was delicious. Even if the cat landed in the middle and nibbled on it before we did. The games were fun. I had a good time. Can we do it again?” “We’ll do it again.” “Soon?” “Soon.” “I hope so. Can I call you sometime tomorrow?” She nodded, walked with him to the door and before she could say anything else he leaned over and laid a kiss on her cheek then fled out into the night. “Good night, Andy,” she called out behind him and thought she saw him wave at her before he got in his car. She closed the door. When she was sure he was gone she went out the back. Her hunt that night was brief and close to home. Deer wandered into the neighborhood all the time and she found one quickly in the field behind the farmhouse. She went nowhere near the deep woods where she’d hunted before and run into the vampires. She couldn’t take the chance they’d find her again. Or, worse, follow her home. She was in bed an hour later. There was so much to do the next two days, because after the weekend her new job started. It’d been a long time since she’d worked for anyone but her husband. So it was going to be interesting. She hoped she remembered how to be a working person. When she was half asleep she felt the kitten’s furry body wiggle under the covers. It’d found its way through the dark house and gotten up the stairs. Spunky little thing. The cat purred as her fingers caressed its back and, like her, finally found asleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 14 Kyle, David and Abby Kyle agreed to meet David and Abby after school at their special place, in the woods beneath the old weeping willow by the creek. It was between their three houses and an easy gathering spot. Then maybe, if they had enough money, they’d go to Joey’s Diner, scoff up some cheeseburgers and onion rings for supper and hang out before going home to do homework and spending time with their families. Kyle had to be home by dark. He didn’t like being told what to do. Heck, he was practically fifteen but his parents, controlling adults that they were, were all worked up over the murders and wanted him locked behind their doors before night came. Stupid grownups. Nothing was going to get him. He was too fast and could run like a cheetah. Too tall. Too strong. He could take care of himself. He’d be with his friends. David was even taller than he was. Why, he was Summer Haven High’s best Quarterback and at sixteen already weighed two hundred pounds. He was a giant. Sure Abby was a little bitty thing but she was a girl, for heaven’s sake. She was on the track team, though, and could outrun all of them. He and David could protect her no problem as well as themselves. So he wasn’t scared. Not one tiny bit. He strode through the trees down an overgrown footpath, whistling and alternately singing at the top of his lungs, his ipod tucked into his ear. A storm was coming. He could smell it. Big fat mean-looking clouds had rushed in and filled up the sky. The light had run away. It could be nighttime already it was so dark. Made it hard to see the trail. But he’d grown up here and knew the woods like his own back yard. He’d been playing in them since he’d been a kid. Still he had trouble finding the willow tree. Then the bloodcurdling screams led him right to it. He could hear them through the music and yanked out his earplugs. Someone–sounded like Abby–was screaming their head off. Not far away. Scared as hell. He’d never heard her cry like that and he’d known her since they were in kindergarten. She was a plucky girl. Something was really wrong. He began to run, bumping into thin trees he could hardly see and tripping over clumps of dirt and bushes. He should have brought his pen-sized flashlight, which he usually carried in his pocket, but he hadn’t planned on the storm coming in so quickly. The screams had stopped. He ran faster, squinting in the grayish light. The sudden silence was almost worse than the shrieking. The clouds above him opened up and a ray of sun escaped through. Just enough light so when he arrived at the rendezvous place he saw all he needed to see and more than he wanted to. He hid behind a tree and rubbed his eyes twice thinking he wasn’t seeing what he was seeing. But he was. David was lying on the ground in an unnatural position. His limbs twisted and spread out like a broken chicken. Unmoving. Kyle thought he was going to throw up. He’d seen dead bodies in coffins before, his uncle’s funeral five years ago and a friend who’d died from a childhood disease last spring. David looked like them. A corpse. Oh, no. Abby was struggling with three really tall shadows–cause that’s what they looked like to him. One was asking her something. The voice, deep and eerily nothing much like a human voice, was loud. “She has long brown hair, brown eyes…anyone you know fits that description?” “There’re lots of women in town like that.” Kyle could hear the terror in Abby’s words. The shadows had mutated into huge men in leathery-looking clothes. They moved faster than ordinary humans should. Reminded him of those weird stop-go special effects he’d seen in movies and on television. This wasn’t The Vampire Diaries, though, this was real. Kyle’s brain was telling him one thing but his eyes were reflecting another. They weren’t human. “She’d be new to town. Her husband would have recently died. Do you know her?” Abby let out a cry of pain as she was lifted off her feet. Kyle would have launched himself from hiding to wrestle her attackers but he was a clever boy and knew he’d never be able to defeat all three. He had to get help. But he couldn’t leave Abby. Alone. In danger. Oh God, what was he going to do? Between sobs Abby sputtered, “There…is someone…new in town. A woman. Don’t know her name but…I heard my mom, who went to school with her, say she lives out in that old farmhouse that’s been empty for years. On Suncrest Road going west out of town. She has two kids. That’s all I know. I swear. “Now please let me go. You promised you’d let me go!” One of the shadows laughed. Kyle had seen enough horror movies to recognize a demon’s laugh. Abby’s scream was cut off. He wanted to shout out at them to leave her alone, rocket from his hiding place and slug them good for what they’d done to his friends. Instead, he covered his mouth with his hands and fought the urge to run away like a scared baby or throw up. Abby’s limp body dropped to the ground beside David’s. They’d killed both of his friends. His anger raged inside him, but he was too terrified, too smart, to know he could fight them and win. He couldn’t. He’d be lucky to get away with his own skin. He’d come to the conclusion the three weren’t really men. Something about the way they moved, the unearthly speed and the sound of their voices. They hovered and bent silently over his friends’ bodies, taking turns doing something to them he couldn’t see. They were ghouls. They were the killers the police were searching for. He’d caught them in the middle of their newest crime. If he’d arrived minutes sooner he would have been with his friends and he’d be dead as a fence post, too, lying on the ground by Abby and David. Who the hell were those creeps? Why had they killed his friends? He was holding his breath. So afraid they’d hear him. See him. Smell him. He had to get away without them being aware he was there or he’d be a goner. Somehow he knew that if he knew nothing else. His body trembled. His teeth chattered and he clamped down until his jaw hurt. Shhh. Be quiet. Be still. Wait it out. He didn’t want to die. If they could move as fast as warp drive he wouldn’t stand a chance running for it. He had to stay hidden until they were gone. They were talking silently now. He could tell by the way they behaved. Communicating without words. Looking around. He jerked back behind the tree. Squeezed his body as thin and compact as he could. Quieted his thoughts in case they could read minds. Well, hey, some demons could read minds. Some aliens, too. In the movies they usually could. Better safe than sorry. He wanted so badly to yank out his cell phone and call 911. Or his mom. Someone. But they’d hear him. Not a smart move. He snuck a quick look around the tree. The strange men were gone. Only Abby and David’s bodies were still there. So he hadn’t imagined it. It’d really happened. Kyle waited a long time, plastered up against the trunk, before he ventured out and knelt down by his friends. Touched them with shaking fingers. Tried to wake them. They were dead all right. Their flesh was cold, their faces frozen in masks of mutilated flesh. There were bite wounds above the terrible slashes that seemed to go almost all the way through their necks. Deep gashes on their face and arms. Awful, awful, awful. He cried as the first drops of rain and then the downpour came and soaked him. Lightning lit up everything. The tree. The bodies. Him. He couldn’t take the chance the demons, aliens or whatever the hell they were, were still around somewhere and would see him, or he’d stagger into them somewhere else in the woods. He was afraid to run, but he was more afraid not to. Hours must have gone by–well, maybe fifteen-twenty minutes at least–before he moved. His body shivered from the rain and what he’d seen. His fingers and face were cold. Finally screwing up the courage, staring around one last time, he took out his cell phone and called his mother. She’d know what to do. At first the phone wouldn’t work. Maybe it was the storm. He tried again. Got up and started hiking in the direction of town. The fifth time he keyed in his mom’s number it went through. The connection wasn’t good but she got the point something terrible had happened. She told him to go to Joey’s Diner, it was closer, and wait for her and the police there. So he did.",

He was afraid to run, but he was more afraid not to. Hours must have gone by–well, maybe fifteen-twenty minutes at least–before he moved. His body shivered from the rain and what he’d seen. His fingers and face were cold. Finally screwing up the courage, staring around one last time, he took out his cell phone and called his mother. She’d know what to do. At first the phone wouldn’t work. Maybe it was the storm. He tried again. Got up and started hiking in the direction of town. The fifth time he keyed in his mom’s number it went through. The connection wasn’t good but she got the point something terrible had happened. She told him to go to Joey’s Diner, it was closer, and wait for her and the police there. So he did.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 Jenny Jenny was working her shift at the hardware store when Joey called her on her cell. It was her fourth day. Norm Johnson had purchased thirty dollars’ worth of stuff and had limped out the door. He had to be at least eighty, still fixing his own leaky water faucets, and he’d known her dad and her from way back. One summer years ago they’d painted his house. Interior. All white. People knowing her and her family or her knowing them had turned out to be one of the blessings and one of the curses of the job. She waited on old acquaintances, neighbors or friends from her childhood or the years she’d lived in town with Jeff. When she put on the Ace Hardware apron and stepped behind the counter she found she enjoyed doing the job. She got along with Shelly, who was a little scatterbrained at times but sweet and helpful. It didn’t take long for Jenny to learn the computer system or how to do price checks. Stock the shelves. Dealing with the people was somewhat harder, when she was hungry preferring to drink their blood way more than sell them hammers or boxes of nails, but it was good practice. If she wanted to live an ordinary life she’d have to have people in it. Her boss treated her like a slumming celebrity, but he was glad to have a dependable, quick learner and he made her feel welcome. He had a sense of humor. With his benign but hokey jokes and Shelly’s good nature there was laughter around the store. Working in the world again, belonging somewhere, felt good even if it was a simple job like cashier. It lessened her loneliness. She got a discount, which would come in handy because there was work left to do on the farmhouse. The hours were perfect. She left every morning after her children got on the bus and was home before or sometimes soon after they got off. And she hadn’t bit any of her customers; not that she hadn’t had the urge, especially with the overly chatty or rude ones, but she’d refrained. A real source of pride. She was amazed every day she was holding down a normal job, juggling her kids and her blood hunger. Living life as if she weren’t a monster. It was almost too easy. She kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. If only the problem with those bloodthirsty vampire/beings and the killings would go away. She kept the note she’d written to remind herself of the threat they posed but no longer forgot they were searching for her. Her mind had become so much sharper. Her powers having grown to the point she wondered when they’d stop and what she’d eventually end up as. She was as careful as she could not to call attention to herself but yet live her life; do what she had to do to support and love her family. She and Joey searched for answers where and when they could. So far nothing had come of it. No one really believed in vampires and if they did they were as nutty as almonds. Even the writer from Maine hadn’t come through for them. And when Joey made the mistake of declaring vampires were real, the man stopped answering his e-mails. Another benefit of her job was it was the second best spot in town for gossip. So she wasn’t surprised Thursday afternoon after work, as she was walking towards the exit, that she overheard a customer outside telling Glen there was a ruckus over at Joey’s Diner. “There’s been another murder. Two,” said a young man she didn’t recognize in a UPS uniform. He had a handful of packages and a bundle of mail. Crew-cut short hair and a wisp of a mustache. “Two young people from town. I don’t know who they are. They aren’t releasing the names yet, but this time there’s a witness. I was at Joey’s delivering mail when the only survivor, another teenager, staggered in. The kid was a wreck. Blathering on about super tall people in the woods who moved like ghosts. Poor kid’s obviously off his rocker. Shock, I guess.” Jenny paused outside the door. She could hear through glass and brick walls. “Who’s the witness?” her boss asked. “Boy called Kyle Richards. Sixteen or so. He’s at the diner now talking with the police. Won’t be there long. I’m sure they’ll want him to take them to the bodies.” “This is horrible,” Glen exclaimed. “More murders. Young people. Least they have a witness. Maybe they can catch these bastards now.” She didn’t wait to hear more but high-tailed it to Joey’s. Using her super speed. Much faster than her car. *** “The kid’s already gone. Just left. He took the police to where the bodies are.” Joey was in the kitchen stirring a pot of chili. That night’s dinner special. Outside the storm had passed and the day had returned, or what was left of it. The kitchen was somewhat private, only Laurie running in and out with orders and another cook, Jason, busy across the room making the fried food, so they could talk if they kept their voices down. The dinner crowd was chattering outside the doors. Most talking about the new crime. If she wanted she could zero in on any conversation and hear it as clear as if she were out there with them. “Everyone’s scared out of their minds.” Joey glanced at her. “By dark this place will be empty. It’s been bad up until now but after these killings I might as well close up after supper for all the business we’ll do after nightfall.” “That might not be a bad idea anyway,” she remarked thoughtfully. “Did you learn anything from the boy that might help us?” “Kyle Richards, you mean?” “Yes.” “I snooped best I could when Chief Donald was questioning him. The boy was so upset they had to let him calm down before they could make any sense out of what he was saying. I gave him warm cocoa and listened.” Joey repeated what he’d overheard and Jenny, sitting on a stool out of the way, nodded. “It sounds like my nemesis and his gang all right. I wasn’t a hundred percent sure they were the ones doing the killings before but now I am. It’s them.” Her brother put the spoon on the stove by the bubbling pot and wiped his hands on his apron. He faced her. “What are we going to do?” “Try to find a way to locate and destroy them.” “And how in the hell are we going to do that? We don’t even know what they are. Really. What hurts or kills them. How can we hope to defeat them if they have all your powers and more. If there’s four of them?” His face reminded her of when they were children and he’d be afraid to go in the house because mom was on one of her irrational rampages. “I’ve contacted every paranormal expert on the Internet. When I tell them the truth, what we’re up against, what’s happened so far, they think I’m certifiable. They don’t believe me. Entities from another dimension or planet or whatever who have super powers and are as malevolent as any horror film villain? Ha. Sometimes I think I am crazy just believing in such creatures. Except, there’s the past and there’s you, so I know they exist. I know how powerful they must be. How hard they’ll be to vanquish.” “And no help in those books, either,” she said. “All things supernatural is really the thing now, except there seems to be a real difference of opinion on how to kill a fictional one as opposed to a real one.” Joey made a face. “You don’t think chopping their heads off will do it? Or burning them like you and Jeff did with those in the theater?” She nearly smiled at that. “Killing them is not so much the problem as catching them. Until now I’ve been spending all my energy on avoiding them.” “These newest murders have changed things, right?” She sighed. “Right. I kept praying they’d just go away. Leave. Doesn’t look like that’s going to happen. They’re here because of me. These murders aren’t going to stop unless someone stops them. Since no one but us know what we’re truly up against and what they’re capable of, it’s either going to be us or no one.” “Damn, why does it always have to be us?” Joey filled a bowl with chili and set it on a tray for pickup. Laurie would be in to get it. “I’ve been thinking. That St. Louis detective friend of yours was in here when the Richard’s kid was blubbering out his story. He must be working with Chief Donald. They talk together a lot. The detective knows more than he’s saying.” “I thought he left town.” “Nope. He told me he’s taking a hunk of vacation time and has been hanging around sniffing out clues since that out-of-town family was killed in the woods. Interrogating everyone. He eats here all the time. We talk. Interesting guy. We’ve become quite good friends, actually. I’ve mentioned supernatural things a few times and he seems…receptive.” “You didn’t tell him anything, did you?” “No. But I have a hunch he might believe us if I did.” “What makes you think that?” “Some of the things he’s told me. The way he reacted to some things I told him. Did you know about his daughter and how she died?” “I know. Same way Jeff died.” “Jenny, I think he knows or suspects our perps aren’t human. We could ask him for help. We’re in way over our heads.” “Ask a cop for help and tell him everything?” Joey got her meaning. “No, we don’t have to tell him about you. Just that these killers are after you, want to get rid of you, because they think you know something that could tie them to Jeff’s murder. Something like that. It could make sense. “He might know something that could help us or he might help us.” “You might be right. But I’m still not sure. We’d be taking a huge risk telling him what we know. What we’re really up against. Most people don’t, can’t, believe in vampires. Because that’s what I’m calling these things for lack of a better label. Vampires.” “Well, we can decide as we go along. Get him talking to us and see where it leads. But if nothing else he could help protect you and the kids.” That warning got through to her. Her children. They were in danger, too. “I don’t know. It’s a risk. Telling Detective Bradley what we know.” “Don’t you trust him?” In the next room the noise level rose. People were impatient, wanting to get their meals and go home. Joey was falling behind on the orders. She thought about that. “You know, I do. I think he’s a good man. An intelligent one, too.” “Then why don’t we take a chance and confide in him? As much as we can, anyway.” “We could. At the worst he’ll think we’re delusional and walk away.” “At best,” Joey said, “he might know something that would help us.” “Okay.” “If I see him tonight I’ll ask him to take a ride to your house with me and we’ll give it a try. He usually comes by every night for a late cup of coffee and a snack before he goes to his motel for the night.” “Why my house? The kids will be there.” “Your house is more private. We’ll come by later when Teddy and Sarah are asleep. Before you go out, you know, for your nightly, er, run? I’ll call you first. If Bradley doesn’t show up by eight, I’ll phone him. I have his number.” For the first time Joey looked hopeful. “Okay. Call me and hopefully I’ll see you both later tonight at the farmhouse.” The clock on the wall behind her brother caught her attention. “Right now I better go. The kids stayed over at school, helping to decorate for the Halloween party this weekend. But they’ll be home soon.” “Yep, you better go.” On her way out she said hi to Laurie and had rushed out when her sister-in-law followed her to the car, grabbed her by the arm, and halted her in her tracks. “Whoa, Jenny. You got a minute?” “Maybe a minute.” She moved away from the vehicle so she could talk in the shade of the restaurant’s awning. The sun was descending into the horizon of trees and hills but she felt better in the shadows. “The kids will be home any minute. I have to be there when they do. What’s up?” “Well, I haven’t seen much of you lately so I was wondering how things were going? How you like your new job? The kids their new school? How’s the refurbishing at the farmhouse coming. Your brother’s not real forthcoming on that sort of thing. Women’s chitchat. You know him. He talks a lot but doesn’t always say much. And I’ve been too busy tied to the diner to get out to visit you yet.” “Yeah, my brother’s not real chatty about that kind of stuff.” Guilt got the best of her. She’d neglected Laurie and couldn’t remember the last time they’d talked. Of course with what was going on being a good sister-in-law had been way low on her to-do list. So she quickly caught the other woman up. “I like the job. Glen’s a sweetheart. Discount’s great. Come on by if you need something and I can give you the family markdown. “Teddy and Sarah had a little trouble at first being the new kids at school but they’ve worked it out. The farmhouse looks like a different place. Bright and homey. I still have some work to do on it but it’s coming along nicely. You have to visit soon and see what we’ve done.” Laurie bobbed her head. “I’ll do that. I’ll make time.” “Andy has dropped by to visit a couple times. The kids like him. He’s been so kind. Hinted he was sweet on me.” “I could have told you that, Jenny. He’s had a thing for you forever.” “Or so Joey has also told me.” Jenny shook her head. “I’m a mess right now. I need friends but not a boyfriend.” “I know,” Laurie spoke quietly, patting Jenny’s hand motherly-like. “It’s too soon.” “It is.” “You doing all right, though?” “As well as can be expected.” “Time is what you need. That’s all. Time.” As she spoke Jenny noticed the impatient look in Laurie’s eyes as if she were waiting to say something else. She was right. “While I have you here, Jenny, I need to ask you something.” Jenny thought their conversation had ended and was edging towards her car but those words stopped her. “Go ahead ask away. Make it quick, the kids, you know?” Laurie appeared uneasy. She fiddled with the order pad in her hands. “Uh, you been seeing anything strange lately out at the farmhouse?” “What do you mean?” Immediately alert. The sun passed behind the clouds and the parking lot was suddenly dim. Shadows flitted in the corners of her eyes making her nervous. She had a sudden premonition something somewhere wasn’t right. Laurie hesitated, biting her lip. “Well, you know I hear a lot of stories waiting on folks here every day. I overhear things. They tell me things. And–.” “And what?” “People are seeing weird things around your house. Mostly at night when they drive by. There’s this story going around. I’ve heard it so many times now I have to ask about it.” Jenny, bracing herself, lifted her head. “Shoot.” “I know you don’t believe in ghosts and stuff but Claudia, who works for State Farm down the road here, was saying this morning over breakfast she worked late the night before and on her drive home past your place she saw all these floating lights in the dark bouncing around the farmhouse. She stopped her car and watched them.” “Floating lights? She thinks they were apparitions or something?” “She didn’t know what they were. She just said they were all around your house. At the windows. Balls of light that at times morphed into tall figures. Kinda bluish.” “How many?” “Two or three but sometimes as many as five. What with these murders and then seeing eerie glowing balls outside your windows it really scared her. Have you seen them?” “No.” Not lying. She’d seen the vampire and his friends; she’d seen ghost horses and heard unusual noises, but no, no light balls. Not yet anyway. But then anything was possible. She of all people knew that. “You say you’ve heard this story more than once?” “A bunch of times lately. It varies. Some people see these mysterious figures walking around your house, some say lights. I’d be careful. Who knows what the hell they are. Could be dangerous.” “Thanks for telling me. I’ll keep a look out.” “Have you seen anything strange around the farmhouse?” Laurie had her. Now she had to evade or fib. “Nothing but memories, that’s all.” Laurie gave her a compassionate look. “Well, I had to ask. You know me, curious as a cat. By the way, Joey told me about your new family member.” “Oh, Amadeus, our kitten?” “Yes. I’ll have to stop by and meet the little critter. I love cats.” “Although you don’t have any.” “Nah, not in the apartment. No critters allowed. When we buy our house, though, Joey said I could have as many cats as I want.” Jenny had a sudden mind picture of Laurie in a woodsy cabin with twenty cats of all sizes and colors climbing around her. “That going to be anytime soon? The new house?” Anxious to be going, Jenny had opened the car door and slid into the seat, looking up at Laurie through the open door. Tapping her fingers on the steering wheel. “We almost have enough money now. It’ll be soon. I hope. I hate living in that apartment. Too cramped.” “I would, too,” Jenny commiserated. “I need a house around me. A yard.” Jenny had a thought. “How come you and Joey didn’t move into the farmhouse?” Laurie evaded Jenny’s eyes. “Uh, I’d like a ranch style with a basement. In town. Close to the diner. You know?” Oh, Jenny knew. Laurie was afraid of the lights. A revelation. She never would have figured her sister-in-law for being afraid of such things. But apparently she was. “I better let you go, Jenny. Can’t let those kids come home to an empty house, right?” “Right. Thanks for the heads up about the spooky lights. I’ll keep my eyes and ears open. You’ve got to come over and see what we’ve done to the farmhouse.” Then remembering her sister-in-law’s busy work schedule, she tagged on, “Your next day off, come on by. You know you’re welcome anytime.” “I’ll call first.” “Good idea. That way you’ll be sure to catch me at home. Bye.” With that Jenny turned the key and pulled out of the parking slot. Her earlier premonition that something was wrong somewhere had all of a sudden grown so much stronger. The car raced down the road as twilight claimed the day. She hated how early it got dark this time of year and wished they’d get rid of daylight savings time altogether. What good was it? There were only so many hours of light and dark each day so who cared if it was an hour later or earlier by the clock? It was still the same amount of each no matter what. Moving it backward or forward an hour twice a year made no sense to her. It never had. When she drove into the driveway she knew something was wrong. The front door was wide open. Sarah’s red book bag lay abandoned on the porch steps. Jenny turned off the car and ran inside calling for her children. No replies. Silence. They should be home by now. The book bag. She rushed upstairs into their rooms. Returned to the kitchen. Checked the bathroom. The house was empty. “Sarah! Teddy! Where are you!” she cried at the top of her voice. After another race through the rooms she ran outside. Maybe they were playing in the back yard. They weren’t. Her children were gone and she knew. She just knew. The vampires had them. She heard their laughter in her head, taunting her. Come to us. Now. Or we’ll kill them. Their necks are so fragile. Their fear so pure. Their blood a delicacy we cannot forgo for long. So hurry. Out in the back yard, she screamed out their names again and plunged into the woods. They couldn’t be far away. It hadn’t been that long. If she hurried she could catch up to them. Limbs slapped her face; she tripped over fragments of dead wood, but didn’t stop. The trees were merging into the coming night’s gloom, night was nearly upon her, but still she ran. Searching. Listening. Calling for Sarah and Teddy. She’d never been so scared in her life. The violence in St. Louis had been different. She hadn’t known what had hit her. The anger, sorrow and fear of losing Jeff had come afterwards. What she was feeling now was agony. Her children were all that mattered. She had to find them. Rescue them. If it meant sacrificing her own life, she would without hesitation. And if she caught up to the vampires, then what? How could she fight them? She was just one and they were many. She didn’t care. Her children couldn’t be harmed. Faster. Faster. The vampires waited for her deep in the woods in the same place where she’d first run into Zebulon. Some invisible beacon had taken her straight to them. Beneath a maple tree Dante, Zebulon and two others stood waiting for her in the darkening forest. Sarah and Teddy were imprisoned in their arms. Sarah wept, frozen with fear. Her face white and small. Teddy was bravely kicking and shouting at his captor. So futile. Zebulon knocked the boy to his knees and, putting his foot on the child’s neck, forced him to the ground and held him there. The sight of her children in the vampires’ clutches made her so angry she wanted to rush at and beat them. In the same moment she thought: They’ll kill Teddy and Sarah. Snap their necks. It’d be so easy. If I lose my children I couldn’t bear it. So be careful. Clever. Don’t react foolishly. Sarah looked up. “Mommy, help us! Who are these men? What do they want?” Teddy, writhing on the ground, said nothing. He was still struggling. Fighting. Jenny’s rage burned white-hot, she’d never been so angry in her life, but she hid it. “Let them go.” She locked eyes with Dante. “Let them go. Right. Now.” Sarah went limp in Dante’s grip. “Who are you to give me orders? I have the power. You obey me.” “How did you find us?” “A girl we met yesterday in the woods was kind enough to tell us where you live. That you have two children. It was easy to find you.” “The young girl in the woods…you killed her and her friend, didn’t you?” Dante ignored her accusation. “I must admit your cloaking these last few days was impressive. It’s been a long time since we couldn’t find anyone we sought. I’m still at a loss to how you became one of us and have the advanced powers you do. I thought it impossible. You humans are too inferior–weak willed, with low stamina and intelligence–I never believed it could ever happen. “I’ve never been wrong. Before now. You puzzle me, Jenny.” She was weary of his voice. Her mind was busy trying to figure out a way of getting Teddy and Sarah free. She moved closer. “What do you want from me?” “A trade.” Dante, as if she weighed two feathers, held Sarah up to her. A ragdoll in his grasp. The girl was unmoving and Jenny was terrified somehow he’d done something to hurt her. “You come with us without any more trouble and we’ll let your children go free.” She didn’t believe she could trust them, yet what other choice did she have? None. “If you don’t, your children will die. Now. Before your eyes.” Jenny wanted to scream. Fight. Sink her new sharper teeth into him. But it wouldn’t do any good. Her enemies had her boxed in. Ensnared. And, more importantly, she couldn’t take the chance her children would be caught in the crossfire. “All right. A trade. Them for me. I’ll go with you but I’ll take them back to the farmhouse first. Telephone someone to come get them. I won’t leave them out here in the woods in the dark. No one knows where they are and they don’t know how to get home from here.” Dante burst out laughing. “You have spunk, I’ll say that. You intrigue me, Jenny, so I’ll make a gift of them to you. You can take them home. You have one hour. Then we come for you. And if you’re not waiting for us at the edge of the woods we’ll kill them. You. Your brother and his wife. And all your friends. “Yes, I know about them and where to find them. “One hour, Jenny. Don’t cross us. Leave your cell phone, your purse, everything but what you’re wearing. One hour.” The vampires were gone. As if they’d never been there. Sarah lay curled at her feet and Teddy was coming to his, still swinging his arms as if to ward off his captor. She fell to her knees and gathered her the girl into her arms. The child whimpered, stunned, not asleep but not yet awake. Jenny wept inwardly seeing her daughter like that. She reached for Teddy and he came, finally crying like the child he still was. “Mom, I tried so hard to keep them from taking Sarah. I did. They were too strong, too fast, too big. I’m sorry.” “It’s not your place to be sorry, sweetheart,” she hushed him gently. “It’s mine.” She kissed him on his head and hugged him tightly with her other arm. “Come on, I’m taking you home.” She got to her feet, lifting Sarah in her arms. Teddy trailed along behind her. On the way home through the night woods Jenny had only two thoughts: Why hadn’t the vampires killed all of them and what was she going to do now? There was only one reason she could think of. Dante was afraid of her. She had no idea why but there must be a reason, only she couldn’t fathom what it could be. How was she going to leave her children? What did Dante want with her? And what difference did it make? She didn’t care about herself. The vampires could do what they wanted with her as long as they left her family alone. They were what mattered. But could she trust them to leave those she loved alone? Leave other humans alone? Stop their butchering? She didn’t think so. Which was the problem and left only one solution. Go with them, bide her time, and find a way to exterminate them. Simple, but not simple. Once back at the house, she telephoned Joey and told him her story. “Come and take Sarah and Teddy for me. Protect them. I know it’s asking a lot, but there’s no one else. Please? Hurry.” “You can’t go with them, Jenny,” her brother stated, desperation making his voice crack. “They’ll kill you. Wait there. I’m calling Detective Bradley and the two of us will come out. With guns. Stakes. Whatever we need. Bradley will believe me. I know it. He’ll help. Please wait for us?” “Just get out here as soon as you can. Take the kids and care for them until I return.” She hung up. Amadeus flew out from under the couch and launched itself at her. The cat scuttled up her body like a climbing post and perched on her shoulder. Its tiny tongue licked her face and its claws latched into her sweater. It didn’t want her to go, either. Jenny tenderly lifted the kitten from her shoulder and put it in Sarah’s lap. “Who were those men, Mom?” Teddy asked as he huddled beside his sister, who was crying, on the couch. “What do they want with you and why are you going out to meet them again?” She gave him one last hug. “They’re bad men, Teddy. Very bad men. If you ever see them again…run. Hide. Don’t let them get near you, you hear?” As if that would help. It wouldn’t. But she had to say it anyway. He nodded. And his eyes told her he didn’t believe it, either. “Mom, don’t go. I’m afraid for you.” Sarah looked up long enough to speak in a weak voice. Jenny sighed and got up from the couch. She looked at her son. “Stay inside. Wait for your Uncle Joey. He’ll be here soon. You and your sister are going to stay with him and Laurie for a while.” “Mom?” “Don’t question me. Do as I say.” She moved to the back door, waited until she heard Joey’s truck coming down the road; before she went out she turned and met her children’s frightened eyes. “Teddy? Never forget I love you. Sarah? You’re my special girl. Love you. I always will. Never forget.” “We won’t, Mom,” Teddy answered. “But please wait until Uncle Joey gets here. He’ll help. Don’t go yet.” Sarah was crying softly. She’d jumped up from the couch and thrown her arms around her. Teddy joined her. The two children hugging her one last time. “I have to go.” The kitten meowed plaintively, sensing the unrest. Its little face turned to her, its eyes big, as it watched them from the cushions. Tears were streaming down her son’s face as Jenny disengaged from her children’s embrace, went out the door and closed it behind her. Joey’s truck was in the driveway. It took all she had inside of her to leave them like that. She stepped out to the end of the yard and met the four waiting in the dark for her. Then the five of them vanished into the woods.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 Jenny Jenny was working her shift at the hardware store when Joey called her on her cell. It was her fourth day. Norm Johnson had purchased thirty dollars’ worth of stuff and had limped out the door. He had to be at least eighty, still fixing his own leaky water faucets, and he’d known her dad and her from way back. One summer years ago they’d painted his house. Interior. All white. People knowing her and her family or her knowing them had turned out to be one of the blessings and one of the curses of the job. She waited on old acquaintances, neighbors or friends from her childhood or the years she’d lived in town with Jeff. When she put on the Ace Hardware apron and stepped behind the counter she found she enjoyed doing the job. She got along with Shelly, who was a little scatterbrained at times but sweet and helpful. It didn’t take long for Jenny to learn the computer system or how to do price checks. Stock the shelves. Dealing with the people was somewhat harder, when she was hungry preferring to drink their blood way more than sell them hammers or boxes of nails, but it was good practice. If she wanted to live an ordinary life she’d have to have people in it. Her boss treated her like a slumming celebrity, but he was glad to have a dependable, quick learner and he made her feel welcome. He had a sense of humor. With his benign but hokey jokes and Shelly’s good nature there was laughter around the store. Working in the world again, belonging somewhere, felt good even if it was a simple job like cashier. It lessened her loneliness. She got a discount, which would come in handy because there was work left to do on the farmhouse. The hours were perfect. She left every morning after her children got on the bus and was home before or sometimes soon after they got off. And she hadn’t bit any of her customers; not that she hadn’t had the urge, especially with the overly chatty or rude ones, but she’d refrained. A real source of pride. She was amazed every day she was holding down a normal job, juggling her kids and her blood hunger. Living life as if she weren’t a monster. It was almost too easy. She kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. If only the problem with those bloodthirsty vampire/beings and the killings would go away. She kept the note she’d written to remind herself of the threat they posed but no longer forgot they were searching for her. Her mind had become so much sharper. Her powers having grown to the point she wondered when they’d stop and what she’d eventually end up as. She was as careful as she could not to call attention to herself but yet live her life; do what she had to do to support and love her family. She and Joey searched for answers where and when they could. So far nothing had come of it. No one really believed in vampires and if they did they were as nutty as almonds. Even the writer from Maine hadn’t come through for them. And when Joey made the mistake of declaring vampires were real, the man stopped answering his e-mails. Another benefit of her job was it was the second best spot in town for gossip. So she wasn’t surprised Thursday afternoon after work, as she was walking towards the exit, that she overheard a customer outside telling Glen there was a ruckus over at Joey’s Diner. “There’s been another murder. Two,” said a young man she didn’t recognize in a UPS uniform. He had a handful of packages and a bundle of mail. Crew-cut short hair and a wisp of a mustache. “Two young people from town. I don’t know who they are. They aren’t releasing the names yet, but this time there’s a witness. I was at Joey’s delivering mail when the only survivor, another teenager, staggered in. The kid was a wreck. Blathering on about super tall people in the woods who moved like ghosts. Poor kid’s obviously off his rocker. Shock, I guess.” Jenny paused outside the door. She could hear through glass and brick walls. “Who’s the witness?” her boss asked. “Boy called Kyle Richards. Sixteen or so. He’s at the diner now talking with the police. Won’t be there long. I’m sure they’ll want him to take them to the bodies.” “This is horrible,” Glen exclaimed. “More murders. Young people. Least they have a witness. Maybe they can catch these bastards now.” She didn’t wait to hear more but high-tailed it to Joey’s. Using her super speed. Much faster than her car. *** “The kid’s already gone. Just left. He took the police to where the bodies are.” Joey was in the kitchen stirring a pot of chili. That night’s dinner special. Outside the storm had passed and the day had returned, or what was left of it. The kitchen was somewhat private, only Laurie running in and out with orders and another cook, Jason, busy across the room making the fried food, so they could talk if they kept their voices down. The dinner crowd was chattering outside the doors. Most talking about the new crime. If she wanted she could zero in on any conversation and hear it as clear as if she were out there with them. “Everyone’s scared out of their minds.” Joey glanced at her. “By dark this place will be empty. It’s been bad up until now but after these killings I might as well close up after supper for all the business we’ll do after nightfall.” “That might not be a bad idea anyway,” she remarked thoughtfully. “Did you learn anything from the boy that might help us?” “Kyle Richards, you mean?” “Yes.” “I snooped best I could when Chief Donald was questioning him. The boy was so upset they had to let him calm down before they could make any sense out of what he was saying. I gave him warm cocoa and listened.” Joey repeated what he’d overheard and Jenny, sitting on a stool out of the way, nodded. “It sounds like my nemesis and his gang all right. I wasn’t a hundred percent sure they were the ones doing the killings before but now I am. It’s them.” Her brother put the spoon on the stove by the bubbling pot and wiped his hands on his apron. He faced her. “What are we going to do?” “Try to find a way to locate and destroy them.” “And how in the hell are we going to do that? We don’t even know what they are. Really. What hurts or kills them. How can we hope to defeat them if they have all your powers and more. If there’s four of them?” His face reminded her of when they were children and he’d be afraid to go in the house because mom was on one of her irrational rampages. “I’ve contacted every paranormal expert on the Internet. When I tell them the truth, what we’re up against, what’s happened so far, they think I’m certifiable. They don’t believe me. Entities from another dimension or planet or whatever who have super powers and are as malevolent as any horror film villain? Ha. Sometimes I think I am crazy just believing in such creatures. Except, there’s the past and there’s you, so I know they exist. I know how powerful they must be. How hard they’ll be to vanquish.” “And no help in those books, either,” she said. “All things supernatural is really the thing now, except there seems to be a real difference of opinion on how to kill a fictional one as opposed to a real one.” Joey made a face. “You don’t think chopping their heads off will do it? Or burning them like you and Jeff did with those in the theater?” She nearly smiled at that. “Killing them is not so much the problem as catching them. Until now I’ve been spending all my energy on avoiding them.” “These newest murders have changed things, right?” She sighed. “Right. I kept praying they’d just go away. Leave. Doesn’t look like that’s going to happen. They’re here because of me. These murders aren’t going to stop unless someone stops them. Since no one but us know what we’re truly up against and what they’re capable of, it’s either going to be us or no one.” “Damn, why does it always have to be us?” Joey filled a bowl with chili and set it on a tray for pickup. Laurie would be in to get it. “I’ve been thinking. That St. Louis detective friend of yours was in here when the Richard’s kid was blubbering out his story. He must be working with Chief Donald. They talk together a lot. The detective knows more than he’s saying.” “I thought he left town.” “Nope. He told me he’s taking a hunk of vacation time and has been hanging around sniffing out clues since that out-of-town family was killed in the woods. Interrogating everyone. He eats here all the time. We talk. Interesting guy. We’ve become quite good friends, actually. I’ve mentioned supernatural things a few times and he seems…receptive.” “You didn’t tell him anything, did you?” “No. But I have a hunch he might believe us if I did.” “What makes you think that?” “Some of the things he’s told me. The way he reacted to some things I told him. Did you know about his daughter and how she died?” “I know. Same way Jeff died.” “Jenny, I think he knows or suspects our perps aren’t human. We could ask him for help. We’re in way over our heads.” “Ask a cop for help and tell him everything?” Joey got her meaning. “No, we don’t have to tell him about you. Just that these killers are after you, want to get rid of you, because they think you know something that could tie them to Jeff’s murder. Something like that. It could make sense. “He might know something that could help us or he might help us.” “You might be right. But I’m still not sure. We’d be taking a huge risk telling him what we know. What we’re really up against. Most people don’t, can’t, believe in vampires. Because that’s what I’m calling these things for lack of a better label. Vampires.” “Well, we can decide as we go along. Get him talking to us and see where it leads. But if nothing else he could help protect you and the kids.” That warning got through to her. Her children. They were in danger, too. “I don’t know. It’s a risk. Telling Detective Bradley what we know.” “Don’t you trust him?” In the next room the noise level rose. People were impatient, wanting to get their meals and go home. Joey was falling behind on the orders. She thought about that. “You know, I do. I think he’s a good man. An intelligent one, too.” “Then why don’t we take a chance and confide in him? As much as we can, anyway.” “We could. At the worst he’ll think we’re delusional and walk away.” “At best,” Joey said, “he might know something that would help us.” “Okay.” “If I see him tonight I’ll ask him to take a ride to your house with me and we’ll give it a try. He usually comes by every night for a late cup of coffee and a snack before he goes to his motel for the night.” “Why my house? The kids will be there.” “Your house is more private. We’ll come by later when Teddy and Sarah are asleep. Before you go out, you know, for your nightly, er, run? I’ll call you first. If Bradley doesn’t show up by eight, I’ll phone him. I have his number.” For the first time Joey looked hopeful. “Okay. Call me and hopefully I’ll see you both later tonight at the farmhouse.” The clock on the wall behind her brother caught her attention. “Right now I better go. The kids stayed over at school, helping to decorate for the Halloween party this weekend. But they’ll be home soon.” “Yep, you better go.” On her way out she said hi to Laurie and had rushed out when her sister-in-law followed her to the car, grabbed her by the arm, and halted her in her tracks. “Whoa, Jenny. You got a minute?” “Maybe a minute.” She moved away from the vehicle so she could talk in the shade of the restaurant’s awning. The sun was descending into the horizon of trees and hills but she felt better in the shadows. “The kids will be home any minute. I have to be there when they do. What’s up?” “Well, I haven’t seen much of you lately so I was wondering how things were going? How you like your new job? The kids their new school? How’s the refurbishing at the farmhouse coming. Your brother’s not real forthcoming on that sort of thing. Women’s chitchat. You know him. He talks a lot but doesn’t always say much. And I’ve been too busy tied to the diner to get out to visit you yet.” “Yeah, my brother’s not real chatty about that kind of stuff.” Guilt got the best of her. She’d neglected Laurie and couldn’t remember the last time they’d talked. Of course with what was going on being a good sister-in-law had been way low on her to-do list. So she quickly caught the other woman up. “I like the job. Glen’s a sweetheart. Discount’s great. Come on by if you need something and I can give you the family markdown. “Teddy and Sarah had a little trouble at first being the new kids at school but they’ve worked it out. The farmhouse looks like a different place. Bright and homey. I still have some work to do on it but it’s coming along nicely. You have to visit soon and see what we’ve done.” Laurie bobbed her head. “I’ll do that. I’ll make time.” “Andy has dropped by to visit a couple times. The kids like him. He’s been so kind. Hinted he was sweet on me.” “I could have told you that, Jenny. He’s had a thing for you forever.” “Or so Joey has also told me.” Jenny shook her head. “I’m a mess right now. I need friends but not a boyfriend.” “I know,” Laurie spoke quietly, patting Jenny’s hand motherly-like. “It’s too soon.” “It is.” “You doing all right, though?” “As well as can be expected.” “Time is what you need. That’s all. Time.” As she spoke Jenny noticed the impatient look in Laurie’s eyes as if she were waiting to say something else. She was right. “While I have you here, Jenny, I need to ask you something.” Jenny thought their conversation had ended and was edging towards her car but those words stopped her. “Go ahead ask away. Make it quick, the kids, you know?” Laurie appeared uneasy. She fiddled with the order pad in her hands. “Uh, you been seeing anything strange lately out at the farmhouse?” “What do you mean?” Immediately alert. The sun passed behind the clouds and the parking lot was suddenly dim. Shadows flitted in the corners of her eyes making her nervous. She had a sudden premonition something somewhere wasn’t right. Laurie hesitated, biting her lip. “Well, you know I hear a lot of stories waiting on folks here every day. I overhear things. They tell me things. And–.” “And what?” “People are seeing weird things around your house. Mostly at night when they drive by. There’s this story going around. I’ve heard it so many times now I have to ask about it.” Jenny, bracing herself, lifted her head. “Shoot.” “I know you don’t believe in ghosts and stuff but Claudia, who works for State Farm down the road here, was saying this morning over breakfast she worked late the night before and on her drive home past your place she saw all these floating lights in the dark bouncing around the farmhouse. She stopped her car and watched them.” “Floating lights? She thinks they were apparitions or something?” “She didn’t know what they were. She just said they were all around your house. At the windows. Balls of light that at times morphed into tall figures. Kinda bluish.” “How many?” “Two or three but sometimes as many as five. What with these murders and then seeing eerie glowing balls outside your windows it really scared her. Have you seen them?” “No.” Not lying. She’d seen the vampire and his friends; she’d seen ghost horses and heard unusual noises, but no, no light balls. Not yet anyway. But then anything was possible. She of all people knew that. “You say you’ve heard this story more than once?” “A bunch of times lately. It varies. Some people see these mysterious figures walking around your house, some say lights. I’d be careful. Who knows what the hell they are. Could be dangerous.” “Thanks for telling me. I’ll keep a look out.” “Have you seen anything strange around the farmhouse?” Laurie had her. Now she had to evade or fib. “Nothing but memories, that’s all.” Laurie gave her a compassionate look. “Well, I had to ask. You know me, curious as a cat. By the way, Joey told me about your new family member.” “Oh, Amadeus, our kitten?” “Yes. I’ll have to stop by and meet the little critter. I love cats.” “Although you don’t have any.” “Nah, not in the apartment. No critters allowed. When we buy our house, though, Joey said I could have as many cats as I want.” Jenny had a sudden mind picture of Laurie in a woodsy cabin with twenty cats of all sizes and colors climbing around her. “That going to be anytime soon? The new house?” Anxious to be going, Jenny had opened the car door and slid into the seat, looking up at Laurie through the open door. Tapping her fingers on the steering wheel. “We almost have enough money now. It’ll be soon. I hope. I hate living in that apartment. Too cramped.” “I would, too,” Jenny commiserated. “I need a house around me. A yard.” Jenny had a thought. “How come you and Joey didn’t move into the farmhouse?” Laurie evaded Jenny’s eyes. “Uh, I’d like a ranch style with a basement. In town. Close to the diner. You know?” Oh, Jenny knew. Laurie was afraid of the lights. A revelation. She never would have figured her sister-in-law for being afraid of such things. But apparently she was. “I better let you go, Jenny. Can’t let those kids come home to an empty house, right?” “Right. Thanks for the heads up about the spooky lights. I’ll keep my eyes and ears open. You’ve got to come over and see what we’ve done to the farmhouse.” Then remembering her sister-in-law’s busy work schedule, she tagged on, “Your next day off, come on by. You know you’re welcome anytime.” “I’ll call first.” “Good idea. That way you’ll be sure to catch me at home. Bye.” With that Jenny turned the key and pulled out of the parking slot. Her earlier premonition that something was wrong somewhere had all of a sudden grown so much stronger. The car raced down the road as twilight claimed the day. She hated how early it got dark this time of year and wished they’d get rid of daylight savings time altogether. What good was it? There were only so many hours of light and dark each day so who cared if it was an hour later or earlier by the clock? It was still the same amount of each no matter what. Moving it backward or forward an hour twice a year made no sense to her. It never had. When she drove into the driveway she knew something was wrong. The front door was wide open. Sarah’s red book bag lay abandoned on the porch steps. Jenny turned off the car and ran inside calling for her children. No replies. Silence. They should be home by now. The book bag. She rushed upstairs into their rooms. Returned to the kitchen. Checked the bathroom. The house was empty. “Sarah! Teddy! Where are you!” she cried at the top of her voice. After another race through the rooms she ran outside. Maybe they were playing in the back yard. They weren’t. Her children were gone and she knew. She just knew. The vampires had them. She heard their laughter in her head, taunting her. Come to us. Now. Or we’ll kill them. Their necks are so fragile. Their fear so pure. Their blood a delicacy we cannot forgo for long. So hurry. Out in the back yard, she screamed out their names again and plunged into the woods. They couldn’t be far away. It hadn’t been that long. If she hurried she could catch up to them. Limbs slapped her face; she tripped over fragments of dead wood, but didn’t stop. The trees were merging into the coming night’s gloom, night was nearly upon her, but still she ran. Searching. Listening. Calling for Sarah and Teddy. She’d never been so scared in her life. The violence in St. Louis had been different. She hadn’t known what had hit her. The anger, sorrow and fear of losing Jeff had come afterwards. What she was feeling now was agony. Her children were all that mattered. She had to find them. Rescue them. If it meant sacrificing her own life, she would without hesitation. And if she caught up to the vampires, then what? How could she fight them? She was just one and they were many. She didn’t care. Her children couldn’t be harmed. Faster. Faster. The vampires waited for her deep in the woods in the same place where she’d first run into Zebulon. Some invisible beacon had taken her straight to them. Beneath a maple tree Dante, Zebulon and two others stood waiting for her in the darkening forest. Sarah and Teddy were imprisoned in their arms. Sarah wept, frozen with fear. Her face white and small. Teddy was bravely kicking and shouting at his captor. So futile. Zebulon knocked the boy to his knees and, putting his foot on the child’s neck, forced him to the ground and held him there. The sight of her children in the vampires’ clutches made her so angry she wanted to rush at and beat them. In the same moment she thought: They’ll kill Teddy and Sarah. Snap their necks. It’d be so easy. If I lose my children I couldn’t bear it. So be careful. Clever. Don’t react foolishly. Sarah looked up. “Mommy, help us! Who are these men? What do they want?” Teddy, writhing on the ground, said nothing. He was still struggling. Fighting. Jenny’s rage burned white-hot, she’d never been so angry in her life, but she hid it. “Let them go.” She locked eyes with Dante. “Let them go. Right. Now.” Sarah went limp in Dante’s grip. “Who are you to give me orders? I have the power. You obey me.” “How did you find us?” “A girl we met yesterday in the woods was kind enough to tell us where you live. That you have two children. It was easy to find you.” “The young girl in the woods…you killed her and her friend, didn’t you?” Dante ignored her accusation. “I must admit your cloaking these last few days was impressive. It’s been a long time since we couldn’t find anyone we sought. I’m still at a loss to how you became one of us and have the advanced powers you do. I thought it impossible. You humans are too inferior–weak willed, with low stamina and intelligence–I never believed it could ever happen. “I’ve never been wrong. Before now. You puzzle me, Jenny.” She was weary of his voice. Her mind was busy trying to figure out a way of getting Teddy and Sarah free. She moved closer. “What do you want from me?” “A trade.” Dante, as if she weighed two feathers, held Sarah up to her. A ragdoll in his grasp. The girl was unmoving and Jenny was terrified somehow he’d done something to hurt her. “You come with us without any more trouble and we’ll let your children go free.” She didn’t believe she could trust them, yet what other choice did she have? None. “If you don’t, your children will die. Now. Before your eyes.” Jenny wanted to scream. Fight. Sink her new sharper teeth into him. But it wouldn’t do any good. Her enemies had her boxed in. Ensnared. And, more importantly, she couldn’t take the chance her children would be caught in the crossfire. “All right. A trade. Them for me. I’ll go with you but I’ll take them back to the farmhouse first. Telephone someone to come get them. I won’t leave them out here in the woods in the dark. No one knows where they are and they don’t know how to get home from here.” Dante burst out laughing. “You have spunk, I’ll say that. You intrigue me, Jenny, so I’ll make a gift of them to you. You can take them home. You have one hour. Then we come for you. And if you’re not waiting for us at the edge of the woods we’ll kill them. You. Your brother and his wife. And all your friends. “Yes, I know about them and where to find them. “One hour, Jenny. Don’t cross us. Leave your cell phone, your purse, everything but what you’re wearing. One hour.” The vampires were gone. As if they’d never been there. Sarah lay curled at her feet and Teddy was coming to his, still swinging his arms as if to ward off his captor. She fell to her knees and gathered her the girl into her arms. The child whimpered, stunned, not asleep but not yet awake. Jenny wept inwardly seeing her daughter like that. She reached for Teddy and he came, finally crying like the child he still was. “Mom, I tried so hard to keep them from taking Sarah. I did. They were too strong, too fast, too big. I’m sorry.” “It’s not your place to be sorry, sweetheart,” she hushed him gently. “It’s mine.” She kissed him on his head and hugged him tightly with her other arm. “Come on, I’m taking you home.” She got to her feet, lifting Sarah in her arms. Teddy trailed along behind her. On the way home through the night woods Jenny had only two thoughts: Why hadn’t the vampires killed all of them and what was she going to do now? There was only one reason she could think of. Dante was afraid of her. She had no idea why but there must be a reason, only she couldn’t fathom what it could be. How was she going to leave her children? What did Dante want with her? And what difference did it make? She didn’t care about herself. The vampires could do what they wanted with her as long as they left her family alone. They were what mattered. But could she trust them to leave those she loved alone? Leave other humans alone? Stop their butchering? She didn’t think so. Which was the problem and left only one solution. Go with them, bide her time, and find a way to exterminate them. Simple, but not simple. Once back at the house, she telephoned Joey and told him her story. “Come and take Sarah and Teddy for me. Protect them. I know it’s asking a lot, but there’s no one else. Please? Hurry.” “You can’t go with them, Jenny,” her brother stated, desperation making his voice crack. “They’ll kill you. Wait there. I’m calling Detective Bradley and the two of us will come out. With guns. Stakes. Whatever we need. Bradley will believe me. I know it. He’ll help. Please wait for us?” “Just get out here as soon as you can. Take the kids and care for them until I return.” She hung up. Amadeus flew out from under the couch and launched itself at her. The cat scuttled up her body like a climbing post and perched on her shoulder. Its tiny tongue licked her face and its claws latched into her sweater. It didn’t want her to go, either. Jenny tenderly lifted the kitten from her shoulder and put it in Sarah’s lap. “Who were those men, Mom?” Teddy asked as he huddled beside his sister, who was crying, on the couch. “What do they want with you and why are you going out to meet them again?” She gave him one last hug. “They’re bad men, Teddy. Very bad men. If you ever see them again…run. Hide. Don’t let them get near you, you hear?” As if that would help. It wouldn’t. But she had to say it anyway. He nodded. And his eyes told her he didn’t believe it, either. “Mom, don’t go. I’m afraid for you.” Sarah looked up long enough to speak in a weak voice. Jenny sighed and got up from the couch. She looked at her son. “Stay inside. Wait for your Uncle Joey. He’ll be here soon. You and your sister are going to stay with him and Laurie for a while.” “Mom?” “Don’t question me. Do as I say.” She moved to the back door, waited until she heard Joey’s truck coming down the road; before she went out she turned and met her children’s frightened eyes. “Teddy? Never forget I love you. Sarah? You’re my special girl. Love you. I always will. Never forget.” “We won’t, Mom,” Teddy answered. “But please wait until Uncle Joey gets here. He’ll help. Don’t go yet.” Sarah was crying softly. She’d jumped up from the couch and thrown her arms around her. Teddy joined her. The two children hugging her one last time. “I have to go.” The kitten meowed plaintively, sensing the unrest. Its little face turned to her, its eyes big, as it watched them from the cushions. Tears were streaming down her son’s face as Jenny disengaged from her children’s embrace, went out the door and closed it behind her. Joey’s truck was in the driveway. It took all she had inside of her to leave them like that. She stepped out to the end of the yard and met the four waiting in the dark for her. Then the five of them vanished into the woods.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 Jenny Jenny was working her shift at the hardware store when Joey called her on her cell. It was her fourth day. Norm Johnson had purchased thirty dollars’ worth of stuff and had limped out the door. He had to be at least eighty, still fixing his own leaky water faucets, and he’d known her dad and her from way back. One summer years ago they’d painted his house. Interior. All white. People knowing her and her family or her knowing them had turned out to be one of the blessings and one of the curses of the job. She waited on old acquaintances, neighbors or friends from her childhood or the years she’d lived in town with Jeff. When she put on the Ace Hardware apron and stepped behind the counter she found she enjoyed doing the job. She got along with Shelly, who was a little scatterbrained at times but sweet and helpful. It didn’t take long for Jenny to learn the computer system or how to do price checks. Stock the shelves. Dealing with the people was somewhat harder, when she was hungry preferring to drink their blood way more than sell them hammers or boxes of nails, but it was good practice. If she wanted to live an ordinary life she’d have to have people in it. Her boss treated her like a slumming celebrity, but he was glad to have a dependable, quick learner and he made her feel welcome. He had a sense of humor. With his benign but hokey jokes and Shelly’s good nature there was laughter around the store. Working in the world again, belonging somewhere, felt good even if it was a simple job like cashier. It lessened her loneliness. She got a discount, which would come in handy because there was work left to do on the farmhouse. The hours were perfect. She left every morning after her children got on the bus and was home before or sometimes soon after they got off. And she hadn’t bit any of her customers; not that she hadn’t had the urge, especially with the overly chatty or rude ones, but she’d refrained. A real source of pride. She was amazed every day she was holding down a normal job, juggling her kids and her blood hunger. Living life as if she weren’t a monster. It was almost too easy. She kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. If only the problem with those bloodthirsty vampire/beings and the killings would go away. She kept the note she’d written to remind herself of the threat they posed but no longer forgot they were searching for her. Her mind had become so much sharper. Her powers having grown to the point she wondered when they’d stop and what she’d eventually end up as. She was as careful as she could not to call attention to herself but yet live her life; do what she had to do to support and love her family. She and Joey searched for answers where and when they could. So far nothing had come of it. No one really believed in vampires and if they did they were as nutty as almonds. Even the writer from Maine hadn’t come through for them. And when Joey made the mistake of declaring vampires were real, the man stopped answering his e-mails. Another benefit of her job was it was the second best spot in town for gossip. So she wasn’t surprised Thursday afternoon after work, as she was walking towards the exit, that she overheard a customer outside telling Glen there was a ruckus over at Joey’s Diner. “There’s been another murder. Two,” said a young man she didn’t recognize in a UPS uniform. He had a handful of packages and a bundle of mail. Crew-cut short hair and a wisp of a mustache. “Two young people from town. I don’t know who they are. They aren’t releasing the names yet, but this time there’s a witness. I was at Joey’s delivering mail when the only survivor, another teenager, staggered in. The kid was a wreck. Blathering on about super tall people in the woods who moved like ghosts. Poor kid’s obviously off his rocker. Shock, I guess.” Jenny paused outside the door. She could hear through glass and brick walls. “Who’s the witness?” her boss asked. “Boy called Kyle Richards. Sixteen or so. He’s at the diner now talking with the police. Won’t be there long. I’m sure they’ll want him to take them to the bodies.” “This is horrible,” Glen exclaimed. “More murders. Young people. Least they have a witness. Maybe they can catch these bastards now.” She didn’t wait to hear more but high-tailed it to Joey’s. Using her super speed. Much faster than her car. *** “The kid’s already gone. Just left. He took the police to where the bodies are.” Joey was in the kitchen stirring a pot of chili. That night’s dinner special. Outside the storm had passed and the day had returned, or what was left of it. The kitchen was somewhat private, only Laurie running in and out with orders and another cook, Jason, busy across the room making the fried food, so they could talk if they kept their voices down. The dinner crowd was chattering outside the doors. Most talking about the new crime. If she wanted she could zero in on any conversation and hear it as clear as if she were out there with them. “Everyone’s scared out of their minds.” Joey glanced at her. “By dark this place will be empty. It’s been bad up until now but after these killings I might as well close up after supper for all the business we’ll do after nightfall.” “That might not be a bad idea anyway,” she remarked thoughtfully. “Did you learn anything from the boy that might help us?” “Kyle Richards, you mean?” “Yes.” “I snooped best I could when Chief Donald was questioning him. The boy was so upset they had to let him calm down before they could make any sense out of what he was saying. I gave him warm cocoa and listened.” Joey repeated what he’d overheard and Jenny, sitting on a stool out of the way, nodded. “It sounds like my nemesis and his gang all right. I wasn’t a hundred percent sure they were the ones doing the killings before but now I am. It’s them.” Her brother put the spoon on the stove by the bubbling pot and wiped his hands on his apron. He faced her. “What are we going to do?” “Try to find a way to locate and destroy them.” “And how in the hell are we going to do that? We don’t even know what they are. Really. What hurts or kills them. How can we hope to defeat them if they have all your powers and more. If there’s four of them?” His face reminded her of when they were children and he’d be afraid to go in the house because mom was on one of her irrational rampages. “I’ve contacted every paranormal expert on the Internet. When I tell them the truth, what we’re up against, what’s happened so far, they think I’m certifiable. They don’t believe me. Entities from another dimension or planet or whatever who have super powers and are as malevolent as any horror film villain? Ha. Sometimes I think I am crazy just believing in such creatures. Except, there’s the past and there’s you, so I know they exist. I know how powerful they must be. How hard they’ll be to vanquish.” “And no help in those books, either,” she said. “All things supernatural is really the thing now, except there seems to be a real difference of opinion on how to kill a fictional one as opposed to a real one.” Joey made a face. “You don’t think chopping their heads off will do it? Or burning them like you and Jeff did with those in the theater?” She nearly smiled at that. “Killing them is not so much the problem as catching them. Until now I’ve been spending all my energy on avoiding them.” “These newest murders have changed things, right?” She sighed. “Right. I kept praying they’d just go away. Leave. Doesn’t look like that’s going to happen. They’re here because of me. These murders aren’t going to stop unless someone stops them. Since no one but us know what we’re truly up against and what they’re capable of, it’s either going to be us or no one.” “Damn, why does it always have to be us?” Joey filled a bowl with chili and set it on a tray for pickup. Laurie would be in to get it. “I’ve been thinking. That St. Louis detective friend of yours was in here when the Richard’s kid was blubbering out his story. He must be working with Chief Donald. They talk together a lot. The detective knows more than he’s saying.” “I thought he left town.” “Nope. He told me he’s taking a hunk of vacation time and has been hanging around sniffing out clues since that out-of-town family was killed in the woods. Interrogating everyone. He eats here all the time. We talk. Interesting guy. We’ve become quite good friends, actually. I’ve mentioned supernatural things a few times and he seems…receptive.” “You didn’t tell him anything, did you?” “No. But I have a hunch he might believe us if I did.” “What makes you think that?” “Some of the things he’s told me. The way he reacted to some things I told him. Did you know about his daughter and how she died?” “I know. Same way Jeff died.” “Jenny, I think he knows or suspects our perps aren’t human. We could ask him for help. We’re in way over our heads.” “Ask a cop for help and tell him everything?” Joey got her meaning. “No, we don’t have to tell him about you. Just that these killers are after you, want to get rid of you, because they think you know something that could tie them to Jeff’s murder. Something like that. It could make sense. “He might know something that could help us or he might help us.” “You might be right. But I’m still not sure. We’d be taking a huge risk telling him what we know. What we’re really up against. Most people don’t, can’t, believe in vampires. Because that’s what I’m calling these things for lack of a better label. Vampires.” “Well, we can decide as we go along. Get him talking to us and see where it leads. But if nothing else he could help protect you and the kids.” That warning got through to her. Her children. They were in danger, too. “I don’t know. It’s a risk. Telling Detective Bradley what we know.” “Don’t you trust him?” In the next room the noise level rose. People were impatient, wanting to get their meals and go home. Joey was falling behind on the orders. She thought about that. “You know, I do. I think he’s a good man. An intelligent one, too.” “Then why don’t we take a chance and confide in him? As much as we can, anyway.” “We could. At the worst he’ll think we’re delusional and walk away.” “At best,” Joey said, “he might know something that would help us.” “Okay.” “If I see him tonight I’ll ask him to take a ride to your house with me and we’ll give it a try. He usually comes by every night for a late cup of coffee and a snack before he goes to his motel for the night.” “Why my house? The kids will be there.” “Your house is more private. We’ll come by later when Teddy and Sarah are asleep. Before you go out, you know, for your nightly, er, run? I’ll call you first. If Bradley doesn’t show up by eight, I’ll phone him. I have his number.” For the first time Joey looked hopeful. “Okay. Call me and hopefully I’ll see you both later tonight at the farmhouse.” The clock on the wall behind her brother caught her attention. “Right now I better go. The kids stayed over at school, helping to decorate for the Halloween party this weekend. But they’ll be home soon.” “Yep, you better go.” On her way out she said hi to Laurie and had rushed out when her sister-in-law followed her to the car, grabbed her by the arm, and halted her in her tracks. “Whoa, Jenny. You got a minute?” “Maybe a minute.” She moved away from the vehicle so she could talk in the shade of the restaurant’s awning. The sun was descending into the horizon of trees and hills but she felt better in the shadows. “The kids will be home any minute. I have to be there when they do. What’s up?” “Well, I haven’t seen much of you lately so I was wondering how things were going? How you like your new job? The kids their new school? How’s the refurbishing at the farmhouse coming. Your brother’s not real forthcoming on that sort of thing. Women’s chitchat. You know him. He talks a lot but doesn’t always say much. And I’ve been too busy tied to the diner to get out to visit you yet.” “Yeah, my brother’s not real chatty about that kind of stuff.” Guilt got the best of her. She’d neglected Laurie and couldn’t remember the last time they’d talked. Of course with what was going on being a good sister-in-law had been way low on her to-do list. So she quickly caught the other woman up. “I like the job. Glen’s a sweetheart. Discount’s great. Come on by if you need something and I can give you the family markdown. “Teddy and Sarah had a little trouble at first being the new kids at school but they’ve worked it out. The farmhouse looks like a different place. Bright and homey. I still have some work to do on it but it’s coming along nicely. You have to visit soon and see what we’ve done.” Laurie bobbed her head. “I’ll do that. I’ll make time.” “Andy has dropped by to visit a couple times. The kids like him. He’s been so kind. Hinted he was sweet on me.” “I could have told you that, Jenny. He’s had a thing for you forever.” “Or so Joey has also told me.” Jenny shook her head. “I’m a mess right now. I need friends but not a boyfriend.” “I know,” Laurie spoke quietly, patting Jenny’s hand motherly-like. “It’s too soon.” “It is.” “You doing all right, though?” “As well as can be expected.” “Time is what you need. That’s all. Time.” As she spoke Jenny noticed the impatient look in Laurie’s eyes as if she were waiting to say something else. She was right. “While I have you here, Jenny, I need to ask you something.” Jenny thought their conversation had ended and was edging towards her car but those words stopped her. “Go ahead ask away. Make it quick, the kids, you know?” Laurie appeared uneasy. She fiddled with the order pad in her hands. “Uh, you been seeing anything strange lately out at the farmhouse?” “What do you mean?” Immediately alert. The sun passed behind the clouds and the parking lot was suddenly dim. Shadows flitted in the corners of her eyes making her nervous. She had a sudden premonition something somewhere wasn’t right. Laurie hesitated, biting her lip. “Well, you know I hear a lot of stories waiting on folks here every day. I overhear things. They tell me things. And–.” “And what?” “People are seeing weird things around your house. Mostly at night when they drive by. There’s this story going around. I’ve heard it so many times now I have to ask about it.” Jenny, bracing herself, lifted her head. “Shoot.” “I know you don’t believe in ghosts and stuff but Claudia, who works for State Farm down the road here, was saying this morning over breakfast she worked late the night before and on her drive home past your place she saw all these floating lights in the dark bouncing around the farmhouse. She stopped her car and watched them.” “Floating lights? She thinks they were apparitions or something?” “She didn’t know what they were. She just said they were all around your house. At the windows. Balls of light that at times morphed into tall figures. Kinda bluish.” “How many?” “Two or three but sometimes as many as five. What with these murders and then seeing eerie glowing balls outside your windows it really scared her. Have you seen them?” “No.” Not lying. She’d seen the vampire and his friends; she’d seen ghost horses and heard unusual noises, but no, no light balls. Not yet anyway. But then anything was possible. She of all people knew that. “You say you’ve heard this story more than once?” “A bunch of times lately. It varies. Some people see these mysterious figures walking around your house, some say lights. I’d be careful. Who knows what the hell they are. Could be dangerous.” “Thanks for telling me. I’ll keep a look out.” “Have you seen anything strange around the farmhouse?” Laurie had her. Now she had to evade or fib. “Nothing but memories, that’s all.” Laurie gave her a compassionate look. “Well, I had to ask. You know me, curious as a cat. By the way, Joey told me about your new family member.” “Oh, Amadeus, our kitten?” “Yes. I’ll have to stop by and meet the little critter. I love cats.” “Although you don’t have any.” “Nah, not in the apartment. No critters allowed. When we buy our house, though, Joey said I could have as many cats as I want.” Jenny had a sudden mind picture of Laurie in a woodsy cabin with twenty cats of all sizes and colors climbing around her. “That going to be anytime soon? The new house?” Anxious to be going, Jenny had opened the car door and slid into the seat, looking up at Laurie through the open door. Tapping her fingers on the steering wheel. “We almost have enough money now. It’ll be soon. I hope. I hate living in that apartment. Too cramped.” “I would, too,” Jenny commiserated. “I need a house around me. A yard.” Jenny had a thought. “How come you and Joey didn’t move into the farmhouse?” Laurie evaded Jenny’s eyes. “Uh, I’d like a ranch style with a basement. In town. Close to the diner. You know?” Oh, Jenny knew. Laurie was afraid of the lights. A revelation. She never would have figured her sister-in-law for being afraid of such things. But apparently she was. “I better let you go, Jenny. Can’t let those kids come home to an empty house, right?” “Right. Thanks for the heads up about the spooky lights. I’ll keep my eyes and ears open. You’ve got to come over and see what we’ve done to the farmhouse.” Then remembering her sister-in-law’s busy work schedule, she tagged on, “Your next day off, come on by. You know you’re welcome anytime.” “I’ll call first.” “Good idea. That way you’ll be sure to catch me at home. Bye.” With that Jenny turned the key and pulled out of the parking slot. Her earlier premonition that something was wrong somewhere had all of a sudden grown so much stronger. The car raced down the road as twilight claimed the day. She hated how early it got dark this time of year and wished they’d get rid of daylight savings time altogether. What good was it? There were only so many hours of light and dark each day so who cared if it was an hour later or earlier by the clock? It was still the same amount of each no matter what. Moving it backward or forward an hour twice a year made no sense to her. It never had. When she drove into the driveway she knew something was wrong. The front door was wide open. Sarah’s red book bag lay abandoned on the porch steps. Jenny turned off the car and ran inside calling for her children. No replies. Silence. They should be home by now. The book bag. She rushed upstairs into their rooms. Returned to the kitchen. Checked the bathroom. The house was empty. “Sarah! Teddy! Where are you!” she cried at the top of her voice. After another race through the rooms she ran outside. Maybe they were playing in the back yard. They weren’t. Her children were gone and she knew. She just knew. The vampires had them. She heard their laughter in her head, taunting her. Come to us. Now. Or we’ll kill them. Their necks are so fragile. Their fear so pure. Their blood a delicacy we cannot forgo for long. So hurry. Out in the back yard, she screamed out their names again and plunged into the woods. They couldn’t be far away. It hadn’t been that long. If she hurried she could catch up to them. Limbs slapped her face; she tripped over fragments of dead wood, but didn’t stop. The trees were merging into the coming night’s gloom, night was nearly upon her, but still she ran. Searching. Listening. Calling for Sarah and Teddy. She’d never been so scared in her life. The violence in St. Louis had been different. She hadn’t known what had hit her. The anger, sorrow and fear of losing Jeff had come afterwards. What she was feeling now was agony. Her children were all that mattered. She had to find them. Rescue them. If it meant sacrificing her own life, she would without hesitation. And if she caught up to the vampires, then what? How could she fight them? She was just one and they were many. She didn’t care. Her children couldn’t be harmed. Faster. Faster. The vampires waited for her deep in the woods in the same place where she’d first run into Zebulon. Some invisible beacon had taken her straight to them. Beneath a maple tree Dante, Zebulon and two others stood waiting for her in the darkening forest. Sarah and Teddy were imprisoned in their arms. Sarah wept, frozen with fear. Her face white and small. Teddy was bravely kicking and shouting at his captor. So futile. Zebulon knocked the boy to his knees and, putting his foot on the child’s neck, forced him to the ground and held him there. The sight of her children in the vampires’ clutches made her so angry she wanted to rush at and beat them. In the same moment she thought: They’ll kill Teddy and Sarah. Snap their necks. It’d be so easy. If I lose my children I couldn’t bear it. So be careful. Clever. Don’t react foolishly. Sarah looked up. “Mommy, help us! Who are these men? What do they want?” Teddy, writhing on the ground, said nothing. He was still struggling. Fighting. Jenny’s rage burned white-hot, she’d never been so angry in her life, but she hid it. “Let them go.” She locked eyes with Dante. “Let them go. Right. Now.” Sarah went limp in Dante’s grip. “Who are you to give me orders? I have the power. You obey me.” “How did you find us?” “A girl we met yesterday in the woods was kind enough to tell us where you live. That you have two children. It was easy to find you.” “The young girl in the woods…you killed her and her friend, didn’t you?” Dante ignored her accusation. “I must admit your cloaking these last few days was impressive. It’s been a long time since we couldn’t find anyone we sought. I’m still at a loss to how you became one of us and have the advanced powers you do. I thought it impossible. You humans are too inferior–weak willed, with low stamina and intelligence–I never believed it could ever happen. “I’ve never been wrong. Before now. You puzzle me, Jenny.” She was weary of his voice. Her mind was busy trying to figure out a way of getting Teddy and Sarah free. She moved closer. “What do you want from me?” “A trade.” Dante, as if she weighed two feathers, held Sarah up to her. A ragdoll in his grasp. The girl was unmoving and Jenny was terrified somehow he’d done something to hurt her. “You come with us without any more trouble and we’ll let your children go free.” She didn’t believe she could trust them, yet what other choice did she have? None. “If you don’t, your children will die. Now. Before your eyes.” Jenny wanted to scream. Fight. Sink her new sharper teeth into him. But it wouldn’t do any good. Her enemies had her boxed in. Ensnared. And, more importantly, she couldn’t take the chance her children would be caught in the crossfire. “All right. A trade. Them for me. I’ll go with you but I’ll take them back to the farmhouse first. Telephone someone to come get them. I won’t leave them out here in the woods in the dark. No one knows where they are and they don’t know how to get home from here.” Dante burst out laughing. “You have spunk, I’ll say that. You intrigue me, Jenny, so I’ll make a gift of them to you. You can take them home. You have one hour. Then we come for you. And if you’re not waiting for us at the edge of the woods we’ll kill them. You. Your brother and his wife. And all your friends. “Yes, I know about them and where to find them. “One hour, Jenny. Don’t cross us. Leave your cell phone, your purse, everything but what you’re wearing. One hour.” The vampires were gone. As if they’d never been there. Sarah lay curled at her feet and Teddy was coming to his, still swinging his arms as if to ward off his captor. She fell to her knees and gathered her the girl into her arms. The child whimpered, stunned, not asleep but not yet awake. Jenny wept inwardly seeing her daughter like that. She reached for Teddy and he came, finally crying like the child he still was. “Mom, I tried so hard to keep them from taking Sarah. I did. They were too strong, too fast, too big. I’m sorry.” “It’s not your place to be sorry, sweetheart,” she hushed him gently. “It’s mine.” She kissed him on his head and hugged him tightly with her other arm. “Come on, I’m taking you home.” She got to her feet, lifting Sarah in her arms. Teddy trailed along behind her. On the way home through the night woods Jenny had only two thoughts: Why hadn’t the vampires killed all of them and what was she going to do now? There was only one reason she could think of. Dante was afraid of her. She had no idea why but there must be a reason, only she couldn’t fathom what it could be. How was she going to leave her children? What did Dante want with her? And what difference did it make? She didn’t care about herself. The vampires could do what they wanted with her as long as they left her family alone. They were what mattered. But could she trust them to leave those she loved alone? Leave other humans alone? Stop their butchering? She didn’t think so. Which was the problem and left only one solution. Go with them, bide her time, and find a way to exterminate them. Simple, but not simple. Once back at the house, she telephoned Joey and told him her story. “Come and take Sarah and Teddy for me. Protect them. I know it’s asking a lot, but there’s no one else. Please? Hurry.” “You can’t go with them, Jenny,” her brother stated, desperation making his voice crack. “They’ll kill you. Wait there. I’m calling Detective Bradley and the two of us will come out. With guns. Stakes. Whatever we need. Bradley will believe me. I know it. He’ll help. Please wait for us?” “Just get out here as soon as you can. Take the kids and care for them until I return.” She hung up. Amadeus flew out from under the couch and launched itself at her. The cat scuttled up her body like a climbing post and perched on her shoulder. Its tiny tongue licked her face and its claws latched into her sweater. It didn’t want her to go, either. Jenny tenderly lifted the kitten from her shoulder and put it in Sarah’s lap. “Who were those men, Mom?” Teddy asked as he huddled beside his sister, who was crying, on the couch. “What do they want with you and why are you going out to meet them again?” She gave him one last hug. “They’re bad men, Teddy. Very bad men. If you ever see them again…run. Hide. Don’t let them get near you, you hear?” As if that would help. It wouldn’t. But she had to say it anyway. He nodded. And his eyes told her he didn’t believe it, either. “Mom, don’t go. I’m afraid for you.” Sarah looked up long enough to speak in a weak voice. Jenny sighed and got up from the couch. She looked at her son. “Stay inside. Wait for your Uncle Joey. He’ll be here soon. You and your sister are going to stay with him and Laurie for a while.” “Mom?” “Don’t question me. Do as I say.” She moved to the back door, waited until she heard Joey’s truck coming down the road; before she went out she turned and met her children’s frightened eyes. “Teddy? Never forget I love you. Sarah? You’re my special girl. Love you. I always will. Never forget.” “We won’t, Mom,” Teddy answered. “But please wait until Uncle Joey gets here. He’ll help. Don’t go yet.” Sarah was crying softly. She’d jumped up from the couch and thrown her arms around her. Teddy joined her. The two children hugging her one last time. “I have to go.” The kitten meowed plaintively, sensing the unrest. Its little face turned to her, its eyes big, as it watched them from the cushions. Tears were streaming down her son’s face as Jenny disengaged from her children’s embrace, went out the door and closed it behind her. Joey’s truck was in the driveway. It took all she had inside of her to leave them like that. She stepped out to the end of the yard and met the four waiting in the dark for her. Then the five of them vanished into the woods.",

      "content": "Chapter 16 Joey Joey frantically dialed the telephone number scrawled on the back of the card the detective had given him the week before. The cop picked up after three rings and Joey exhaled with relief. In as few words as possible Joey explained why he was calling. Most of it anyway. He asked the detective to come over as soon as he could get there and he’d tell him everything on the way to his sister’s house. “Jenny’s in danger, they all are, and every minute counts. Please hurry, Detective.” “In that case I’ll meet you at her place. It’ll be faster.” “Okay. Meet you there.” Joey shut his cell phone and ran out the diner’s door, on the way shouting to Laurie that an emergency had come up and he had to get to Jenny’s. He’d catch her up on what was going on when he could. He drove like a crazy person to the apartment and dug out his rifle, the one his father had given him the last time there’d been vampires in town. It might not help but it made him feel better having it with him. Any weapon was better than no weapon. It took him five minutes to get to his sister’s. Detective Bradley’s car pulled in behind him and they ran into the house. They found two crying kids. Sarah was talking nonsense about humongous shadow men stealing them away and how they had taken their mommy. “They can move so fast. Like blurs. Their eyes make you sleepy. They’re mean too.” “They have her now. They have Mom.” Teddy was shaking. There was dirt on his face and bloodstains on his clothes. “She went into the woods to meet them. She traded herself for us. Uncle Joey you have to save her. They’re going to kill her, I just know it!” “How long has she been gone?” Joey asked his nephew. “Not long. A couple of minutes.” The boy grabbed his hand, pleading. “You have to go now. Please.” “What’s this about?” Detective Bradley directed the question to Joey. Wearing tan slacks and a sweater, his hair mussed, his face unshaven, he didn’t look much like a cop. They didn’t have the time to waste but Joey needed the detective on his side, at his back, when they went looking for his sister so, after taking the man aside so the kids wouldn’t hear, he gave him a condensed version about his family’s history with vampires. Real vampires. Jenny, his and Jeff’s part in it twelve years past and the innocents’ murders so like those happening now. Jenny’s recent conversion into a species of vampire stemming from the attack in St. Louis and how she’d been coping with it. The whole darn sordid tale. Or as much as he knew and thought the cop could handle without wigging out. “Teddy and Sarah’s abduction is a shock to me as well as Jenny’s surrender. She was terrified of these stalkers of hers and was desperately trying to avoid them. She’d been sort of cloaking herself and the kids so they wouldn’t be found.” “Cloaking?” “Uhh, her new state-of-being includes mind powers to hide herself and the kids from these, er, shadow men. I know, I know.” He put his hands up in a stopping motion. “Hard to believe. But true.” “Well,” the cop said flatly, “they found her anyway.” “They did. These vampires, or whatever they really are, must be very strong. We already know they’re soulless killers.” Joey’s voice was still barely above a whisper. “So you’ve suspected for some time who was behind these murders? These vampires, as you call them?” “We weren’t sure.” Joey made an excuse for not coming forward sooner. “Or we would have said something. Besides these vampires are powerful. You cops wouldn’t have stood a chance unless you believed in what they are, what they can do. You’d have died like the rest who’ve gone up against them. Jenny and I didn’t know what to do, but we were working on it. Until this.” “And your sister gave herself up to save her kids?” “You believe me then? That the murderers we’re looking for are vampires or something like vampires?” The detective stood straighter, his hand sliding to the revolver strapped across his chest beneath his sweater. “Since my daughter’s death, bizarre as it once seemed to me, I’ve suspected something supernatural…yes, even vampires. Nothing else added up. The way the victims were killed. The strange wounds found on them, the near decapitations, and the total draining of blood. How the perps seem to vanish into nothingness after every kill. “For a long time I tried to talk myself out of it. Thought I was plain off my rocker believing in blood-drinking creatures of any sort. But it’s the only thing that makes sense. I’ve seen what these animals can do. Could be they’re vampires or psychopaths who believe they are. Bottom line is simply they’re cold blooded killers with superhuman strengths and we have to stop them.” “How we going to do that?” Joey couldn’t help but think the detective was in for a big surprise, vampires were real, but at the moment, even that didn’t matter. Saving Jenny did. “We go after them. Find them.” He hesitated, a strange look stealing over his stern face. “Just to be sure, I dropped every bullet I have in my gun in holy water. I have wooden stakes in my trunk. A rosary in my pocket. I don’t believe a hundred percent in all this vampire crap but I was raised Catholic. Figures if there’re angels and devils, saints and all, there might be other entities in the world.” “Like vampires?” “Like vampires.” “So, we’re going after them?” “Soon as we drop these children off somewhere safe, we are.” Joey nodded. “Right.” Joey went back to the children and pulled them into his arms. His knees were weak, but he told himself not to be a coward. His sister needed him to be brave. He had to go after her. Save her if he could. If she were still alive. “Teddy, take your sister upstairs and pack clothes and whatever else you’ll need for a few days for both of you. But hurry. I’m taking you to the diner. You’ll stay there until Laurie gets someone to cover for us and then she’ll take you someplace safe.” He’d already thought of asking Andy to take the children later, after they’d searched for Jenny, and would call him once they were at the diner. Andy’s house was large. Secluded. If they didn’t find Jenny, the kids would be safer there. Best thing was the vampires didn’t know him or where he lived. The kids could hide there. “What about Amadeus?” Sarah scooped up the kitten. “She has to come with us. She’s too little to leave alone and we can’t let those bad men get her.” “She can come. I’ll get her box and food while you two get your stuff. Go. Be quick.” He didn’t have to tell them again. The boy took his sister’s hand and went to pack. When the children were ready he took them and the cat to the restaurant, broke the news to his wife in the kitchen that Jenny had been kidnapped and he and Detective Bradley were going to look for her. He didn’t tell her kidnapped by vampires. Maybe someday, but not that day. “You need to take care of the kids for a while. We’re going to close up the diner. Lizzie will help if you ask her.” “Lizzie’s in the back, she’ll help. Maybe Andy will take the kids? I think he’d want to.” “Not Andy. Not right now anyway. He’ll be out in the woods with everyone else looking for Jenny. When we all leave, you and Lizzie close up here. Will you watch Teddy and Sarah until we get back?” “You know I will,” his wife said. Joey then called Andy on his cell phone. When he got off he said to Laurie, “Andy’s on his way. I want you to take the kids to his house soon as the dinner’s closed up. Right away. He said you could hide them there. He’ll give us the keys when he gets here. Don’t go to the apartment.” “Hide them?” Laurie’s glance was questioning. “They could be in danger, too. Those men might come back for them. Might be looking for them.” “Oh, no.” Laurie stared at the children, standing a few feet away, her eyes apprehensive. “How did Andy take the bad news?” she asked, clasping their hands and ushering the children to a booth. The cat meowed and Sarah took it from its box to hold it. “Not good. He’s really upset.” “No more than any of us. Who the hell would kidnap Jenny and why? Who would be a danger to two helpless children? What’s going on? Is it the same person or people who’ve been doing these awful murders?” Joey wanted to sit down with his wife and tell her everything. Not yet. There were too many people around with big ears and eyes. He didn’t want to scare her any more than she already was. And there wasn’t time. “I’ll tell you everything I know later, I promise. Let’s just get these kids somewhere safe. Jenny was taken over thirty minutes ago now and we can’t waste another one. We have to go after her.” “I know you do.” Laurie left the kids side and put her arms around him. Joey hugged her and took the comfort. Heaven knew he needed it. He was so worried. “I’m so sorry. About Jenny and all.” Her eyes wet with tears. “You’re going to find her, you know that, don’t you?” “I hope so.” But what he couldn’t tell her was that he had little to no hope at all of finding her. Not if the vampires had her. His worst fear was that she was already dead. The loss was like a hand crushing his heart. He’d lost so many people he’d loved already. He couldn’t lose his sister. He just couldn’t. Minutes later Andy crashed through the door. He gave Laurie the keys to his house, the address, and interrogated Joey and Detective Bradley about Jenny’s abduction. He was beyond upset, he was heart-stricken. “I’m going with you to look for her. What are we waiting for?” The diner had already been emptied and Lizzie, not one to ask questions, was ready to lock it up and go to her bed in the back when they left. Outside the windows night had fallen. Rain cascaded down the glass. The wind cried. Joey knew how precious time was now. “Okay,” he said to his wife as he, Detective Bradley, Andy and a group of people wanting to help headed for the door. “I’ll be back soon as I can. Take the children to Andy’s and settle them in. They haven’t eaten supper. Andy said they can have anything in the house. Put them in the guest room, first one on the right on the second floor. Don’t leave them alone. Lock all the doors. Wait until I call.” He kissed her and went out the door with the others. They took the cop’s car. On their way Bradley used his cell phone to contact Chief Donald, telling Joey it couldn’t hurt to get him involved. “We’re going to need more manpower. We can comb the woods faster, more thoroughly, if we have extra help.” Joey let the detective make the call even though he feared for anyone who went into the woods with them. Yet even that fear dwindled away when he thought of his sister’s plight. And behind it all, he feared searching for Jenny, no matter how many men they had, what weapons they carried or where they looked, would be useless. They weren’t going to find her or her kidnappers. If the vampires were as powerful as Jenny said they were it’d be a waste of time. They were long gone. Jenny, too. Oh, but they had to try. He had to try. There was nothing else to do. He couldn’t just sit around and wring his hands; write up the obituary. He had to do something. They gathered the search party in the farmhouse, making it their headquarters. Chief Donald and his men arrived. The news spread and more townspeople arrived to help in the search. It touched him that Jenny and he had so many people willing to help. So many friends. A crowd of them went out into the woods in the chilly October night. It rained harder and the wind whipped at them. They could barely see anything. Yet they kept up the search through the night and into the next day and the day after that. And found nothing and no one. Jenny and the vampires that’d taken her were gone.",

      "content": "Chapter 16 Joey Joey frantically dialed the telephone number scrawled on the back of the card the detective had given him the week before. The cop picked up after three rings and Joey exhaled with relief. In as few words as possible Joey explained why he was calling. Most of it anyway. He asked the detective to come over as soon as he could get there and he’d tell him everything on the way to his sister’s house. “Jenny’s in danger, they all are, and every minute counts. Please hurry, Detective.” “In that case I’ll meet you at her place. It’ll be faster.” “Okay. Meet you there.” Joey shut his cell phone and ran out the diner’s door, on the way shouting to Laurie that an emergency had come up and he had to get to Jenny’s. He’d catch her up on what was going on when he could. He drove like a crazy person to the apartment and dug out his rifle, the one his father had given him the last time there’d been vampires in town. It might not help but it made him feel better having it with him. Any weapon was better than no weapon. It took him five minutes to get to his sister’s. Detective Bradley’s car pulled in behind him and they ran into the house. They found two crying kids. Sarah was talking nonsense about humongous shadow men stealing them away and how they had taken their mommy. “They can move so fast. Like blurs. Their eyes make you sleepy. They’re mean too.” “They have her now. They have Mom.” Teddy was shaking. There was dirt on his face and bloodstains on his clothes. “She went into the woods to meet them. She traded herself for us. Uncle Joey you have to save her. They’re going to kill her, I just know it!” “How long has she been gone?” Joey asked his nephew. “Not long. A couple of minutes.” The boy grabbed his hand, pleading. “You have to go now. Please.” “What’s this about?” Detective Bradley directed the question to Joey. Wearing tan slacks and a sweater, his hair mussed, his face unshaven, he didn’t look much like a cop. They didn’t have the time to waste but Joey needed the detective on his side, at his back, when they went looking for his sister so, after taking the man aside so the kids wouldn’t hear, he gave him a condensed version about his family’s history with vampires. Real vampires. Jenny, his and Jeff’s part in it twelve years past and the innocents’ murders so like those happening now. Jenny’s recent conversion into a species of vampire stemming from the attack in St. Louis and how she’d been coping with it. The whole darn sordid tale. Or as much as he knew and thought the cop could handle without wigging out. “Teddy and Sarah’s abduction is a shock to me as well as Jenny’s surrender. She was terrified of these stalkers of hers and was desperately trying to avoid them. She’d been sort of cloaking herself and the kids so they wouldn’t be found.” “Cloaking?” “Uhh, her new state-of-being includes mind powers to hide herself and the kids from these, er, shadow men. I know, I know.” He put his hands up in a stopping motion. “Hard to believe. But true.” “Well,” the cop said flatly, “they found her anyway.” “They did. These vampires, or whatever they really are, must be very strong. We already know they’re soulless killers.” Joey’s voice was still barely above a whisper. “So you’ve suspected for some time who was behind these murders? These vampires, as you call them?” “We weren’t sure.” Joey made an excuse for not coming forward sooner. “Or we would have said something. Besides these vampires are powerful. You cops wouldn’t have stood a chance unless you believed in what they are, what they can do. You’d have died like the rest who’ve gone up against them. Jenny and I didn’t know what to do, but we were working on it. Until this.” “And your sister gave herself up to save her kids?” “You believe me then? That the murderers we’re looking for are vampires or something like vampires?” The detective stood straighter, his hand sliding to the revolver strapped across his chest beneath his sweater. “Since my daughter’s death, bizarre as it once seemed to me, I’ve suspected something supernatural…yes, even vampires. Nothing else added up. The way the victims were killed. The strange wounds found on them, the near decapitations, and the total draining of blood. How the perps seem to vanish into nothingness after every kill. “For a long time I tried to talk myself out of it. Thought I was plain off my rocker believing in blood-drinking creatures of any sort. But it’s the only thing that makes sense. I’ve seen what these animals can do. Could be they’re vampires or psychopaths who believe they are. Bottom line is simply they’re cold blooded killers with superhuman strengths and we have to stop them.” “How we going to do that?” Joey couldn’t help but think the detective was in for a big surprise, vampires were real, but at the moment, even that didn’t matter. Saving Jenny did. “We go after them. Find them.” He hesitated, a strange look stealing over his stern face. “Just to be sure, I dropped every bullet I have in my gun in holy water. I have wooden stakes in my trunk. A rosary in my pocket. I don’t believe a hundred percent in all this vampire crap but I was raised Catholic. Figures if there’re angels and devils, saints and all, there might be other entities in the world.” “Like vampires?” “Like vampires.” “So, we’re going after them?” “Soon as we drop these children off somewhere safe, we are.” Joey nodded. “Right.” Joey went back to the children and pulled them into his arms. His knees were weak, but he told himself not to be a coward. His sister needed him to be brave. He had to go after her. Save her if he could. If she were still alive. “Teddy, take your sister upstairs and pack clothes and whatever else you’ll need for a few days for both of you. But hurry. I’m taking you to the diner. You’ll stay there until Laurie gets someone to cover for us and then she’ll take you someplace safe.” He’d already thought of asking Andy to take the children later, after they’d searched for Jenny, and would call him once they were at the diner. Andy’s house was large. Secluded. If they didn’t find Jenny, the kids would be safer there. Best thing was the vampires didn’t know him or where he lived. The kids could hide there. “What about Amadeus?” Sarah scooped up the kitten. “She has to come with us. She’s too little to leave alone and we can’t let those bad men get her.” “She can come. I’ll get her box and food while you two get your stuff. Go. Be quick.” He didn’t have to tell them again. The boy took his sister’s hand and went to pack. When the children were ready he took them and the cat to the restaurant, broke the news to his wife in the kitchen that Jenny had been kidnapped and he and Detective Bradley were going to look for her. He didn’t tell her kidnapped by vampires. Maybe someday, but not that day. “You need to take care of the kids for a while. We’re going to close up the diner. Lizzie will help if you ask her.” “Lizzie’s in the back, she’ll help. Maybe Andy will take the kids? I think he’d want to.” “Not Andy. Not right now anyway. He’ll be out in the woods with everyone else looking for Jenny. When we all leave, you and Lizzie close up here. Will you watch Teddy and Sarah until we get back?” “You know I will,” his wife said. Joey then called Andy on his cell phone. When he got off he said to Laurie, “Andy’s on his way. I want you to take the kids to his house soon as the dinner’s closed up. Right away. He said you could hide them there. He’ll give us the keys when he gets here. Don’t go to the apartment.” “Hide them?” Laurie’s glance was questioning. “They could be in danger, too. Those men might come back for them. Might be looking for them.” “Oh, no.” Laurie stared at the children, standing a few feet away, her eyes apprehensive. “How did Andy take the bad news?” she asked, clasping their hands and ushering the children to a booth. The cat meowed and Sarah took it from its box to hold it. “Not good. He’s really upset.” “No more than any of us. Who the hell would kidnap Jenny and why? Who would be a danger to two helpless children? What’s going on? Is it the same person or people who’ve been doing these awful murders?” Joey wanted to sit down with his wife and tell her everything.

He was beyond upset, he was heart-stricken. “I’m going with you to look for her.

      "content": "Chapter 17 Jenny Jenny didn’t know why they were keeping her alive. The first night they whisked her off to a sprawling house nestled on a cliff among thick woods and put her alone in a room. They’d traveled like the wind. How far they’d gone she didn’t know but it was a long way. Maybe even out of the county or the state. She wasn’t sure. They locked the door and the windows, chained her to the bed. The links were made of iron, heavy, and circled her wrists, and the chain was spiked to the floor. She’d have to gnaw off her own hands to break her bonds. “Don’t try to escape,” Dante warned. “We know where your brother and his wife live and work. If you run we’ll kill them. Bring them here; make you watch. Your children, too.” That had settled that. She lay in the room, on the bed, fighting her growing hunger, and listening to the rain pelting the roof. She had to play for time. If Joey did what she prayed he’d do, he’d hide her kids. They’d be safe. If he were real smart he’d also hide Laurie and himself. Only then could she take the chance. Escape. Yet even as she thought of getting away, she knew it was hopeless. She, her children, her family and friends couldn’t hide forever. There was no witness protection program from vampires. Or not any that she was aware of. She had to think of another plan. The vampires left her alone, or she thought they left her alone, for a time. The house grew quiet. They were probably out hunting and slaughtering innocents. It made her sick. Here she was tied up like a Thanksgiving turkey and not doing anything to stop them. Her hunger became a torment. She gazed with longing at the windows and the woods beyond. Full of game, and blood, that she couldn’t partake of. Sleep was difficult but she dozed in and out. Waiting. What did they want from her? If they were going to kill her why not just do it? Did they have something worse planned for her? Don’t think about it. Don’t. The house became noisy again. The drapes were pulled, darkening the room, but there was a sliver of light along the bottom. It must be morning. Dante appeared by her bedside. “Why haven’t you killed me yet?” she asked. “Oh, so you are awake?” His voice was throaty, mesmerizing, for a monster. The room was full of pale light. The sun was beginning to rise and she could see him. He looked human. Unbelievably tall and muscled, silver hair worn long and shaggy. His eyes gleamed blackish silver, when he tilted his head. Empty eyes. She wondered about his teeth. He smiled and bared them. His fangs were long, sharp and, unlike hers, filled his mouth in triple rows. When his lips smiled again they were normal. “I heard your thoughts. In this respect we’re like your mythical vampires.” “Our vampires?” She didn’t want to banter with him but she couldn’t stop herself. If she was to fight them, the more she knew about them the better. “Well, what you humans think vampires are like.” “Are there real vampires, then?” “Our distant cousins, you mean? There once were many, hundreds of your centuries ago. They came from our realm during your cavemen days. They’ve died out since. Or most of them have. Survival of the fittest, you know.” Her eyes blinked. “Your kind killed them all?” She wanted so badly to say, nah, nah, nah, nah…you didn’t. I’ve seen, destroyed, some of your brethren before. They still exist here in our world. But she was too shrewd to taunt him like that. Best to keep that a secret. If she could. She shut the thought out of her head. Go away. Go away. His laughter wasn’t human. It came from behind him. She looked to see if there was someone else there, but there was only him. “We did. Most fun we ever had. You humans aren’t half as much sport, let me tell you. We out run, out think and out fight you. And because most of you don’t believe in us we get away with it.” An echo of laughter. His thin lips didn’t move. “If they were like you why did you kill them?” “Excellent question. Because they were competition. Underneath they were nothing like us. They were mindless, hungry animals that had no purpose but to drink the blood we needed to exist.” “And you and your friends do have a purpose?” “We do. But that is a discussion for another time.” She opted not to press her luck and let it drop. “So, you said you were from another planet…dimension…what?” “Another place and time actually.” It was as if she were in a weird nightmare. “You’re an alien time traveler?” He actually laughed. “Your kind would call us that.” “Why are you here?” He seemed to consider answering or not, then shrugged, and did. “Our realm has no food left. Unless we feed on each other.” “So you can’t go home?” He thought about that, too, for a moment, examining her. “Why would we want to? The food–all the blood and more–we need is here. But no. The doorway closed long ago and except for a few of us with the power to travel back and forth, we’re stranded, you might say. Then again we need the hunt as much as the blood. We’re not like you. Sheep. Lemmings. You know, gutless.” She shivered. Vile. That’s what they were. It made no difference where they came from. Evil was evil. “We kill to survive so if that makes us evil, so be it.” “Killing to survive isn’t but butchering intelligent sentient beings and reveling in it is.” “Oh you humans see everything so black and white, don’t you? It isn’t. There’re so many of you, billions, what difference if there’s a few hundred less or so?” Dante sat down on the edge of the bed and leaned over to look at her; studying her as one might study a rare captured animal. His long thin fingers traced around her eyes and down her face. He touched her hair. She cringed but the chain kept her from moving out of his reach. “So soft,” he muttered. “Are you going to kill me?” There, she’d asked. It would be better to know one way or another. If she was going to die she might as well die fighting. “We were. At first. Now you’ve piqued our curiosity. Why didn’t you die in St. Louis? What makes you the one exception in a million that our bite turned you into one of us? Why do you have some of our powers and some we don’t have?” Some we don’t have? “This blending hasn’t ever happened before?” She finally understood her allure to them. “Humans becoming one of us? Not that I know of. Not that any of us have known of. There were myths we’ve heard through the centuries, yet none of us have seen. For some reason you are one of those exceptions.” “What are you going to do with me then?” But Dante wasn’t there. The room around her was empty. Damn. She’d had more questions to ask. She hadn’t learned near enough to help or to break the hold they had over her. She’d realized one thing, the most important, though. She’d been right, escaping from these alien vampires, as she’d begun to think of them, wouldn’t be the answer. She must destroy them. There was no other way she, those she loved and their future victims would ever be safe. If they didn’t kill her first. God, she missed her children. She was worried about them. Closing her eyes she concentrated and saw them. They were some place she didn’t recognize. A cozy kitchen filled with oak cabinets and lots of wood trim, an oak table and chairs. Outside the window there were trees. So it wasn’t Joey and Laurie’s apartment. Her children were getting ready for school. Laurie was feeding them breakfast and trying her best to settle their fears over Jenny’s absence. “Your mother will be found. You’ll see. The entire town is searching. But until she returns you two have to keep hoping for the best, do what your mom would want you to do. You need to make her proud. Just don’t tell anyone where you’re staying, understand? It’s very important. Promise!” Teddy was eating raisin bran, his head down. “Okay,” he mumbled. Sarah, in jeans and a red sweater–the warm sweater Jenny had bought last week because the weather was turning chilly–was sitting at the table with her Gameboy. The one Jeff had gotten her the Christmas before. They both looked so sad and it broke Jenny’s heart. But they were okay. Alive. They had a roof over their heads, food in their stomachs, clothes on their backs and people to care for them who loved them almost as much as Jenny did. Joey and Laurie would protect them. Sarah scooted closer to her brother as if being near to him made her feel safer. “I miss Mom, don’t you?” Sarah whispered. Teddy looked at her. “Me too. But we got to have faith like Uncle Joey says. We’ll get her back. Soon.” “Wish we were still going to school.” “You know what they said. It’s safer if we don’t for a while. In case those men are looking for us. Same with us not letting people know we’re here or seeing us.” “Yeah, I know.” Sarah let out a sigh. “It’s best.” Their words and actions brought a faint smile because if she never returned she knew her brother and sister-in-law would raise her children with firmness and love. That gave Jenny some peace of mind. Voices outside her room brought her to the present. She couldn’t let her jailers hear her thoughts and consciously blanked them out. She couldn’t let them see where her children were. They were out of danger for now and that’s the way she wanted them to stay. It made what she was planning easier, knowing that. Eventually, even with the growing hunger throbbing like fire through her veins and muscles; her fears, she slipped into a restless sleep. Chained as she was, it wasn’t easy to get comfortable, but she had to conserve her strength. Had to be ready. For whatever was coming. *** They woke her as the third night seeped into the room. The one called Zebulon unlocked her chains and dragged her to her feet. She was unsteady. Weakened because she hadn’t fed in days and stiff because of her chained captivity. Her legs didn’t work at first. What was wrong with her? Then terror swallowed her. Woke her up. Was she going to die now? Was this it? “No, you’re not going to die,” Zebulon confided. “Yet.” He led her out the door and through a lavishly accessorized and decorated home. Money, she thought. On her way through she wondered what had happened to the owners. Most likely dead, stuffed in a closet somewhere or stacked up in the basement. Bloodless flattened cadavers. Outside it was a drab day. There was a blowing wind and leaves flew around her head like dark snow. “Where are we going?” she asked as Zebulon shoved her down a trail behind the house. “Dante wants you to come along on our next hunt.” At least she wasn’t going to die. Wait…oh, God. “Hunt?” “He thought it was time you fed. Learned the correct way to treat the cattle.” “You mean humans?” He sent her an exasperated look. “Of course, humans. It’s what keeps us strong.” Human blood. Oh no. She didn’t want to do that. He pushed her onward but she halted in her tracks. “Don’t make Dante wait. He isn’t happy when he has to wait for anyone or anything. And you don’t want to see him unhappy. Trust me.” She didn’t trust him but of the four vampires he seemed the most sympathetic. He acknowledged and actually, not like Dante’s sadistic goading, talked to her while the other two acted as if she weren’t there. Plodding through the woods, she lost track of time. No moon so there was no light, yet she saw what was around her clear enough as her mind furiously tried to find a way to get rid of her jailers. They joined the others outside of a dark house. Dante looked over his shoulder and smiled. “Good you’re here. We’ve got a family ripe to be picked. There are five of them and there are five of us. Two old ones, two of middle years and one young one. They’re asleep now on the second floor. “It’s time you tasted human blood. See what it can do for you. You’ll be surprised.” “I won’t kill anyone. I won’t–” Dante was at her side, his hand gripping her arm so tightly she cried out in shock. Pain wasn’t something she’d felt much of since her turning. Apparently, her captors could inflict it easily on her. She didn’t know why, but that knowledge didn’t make her happy. “You’ll do what I tell you or someone you love will die before the night is over. Your brother, perhaps? I can get there and back before you miss me. Your children have gone into hiding but he has that rat hole diner of his and is easy to find. So is his wife. Do you understand me?” There were so many things she could have said but she uttered none of them. Defying him in front of the others would only enrage him more. “Yes.” Going into that house and being a part of the family’s brutal deaths was the worst nightmare she’d ever endured. She’d been unconscious during her husband’s murder, but she was wide awake during the slaughter. And being forced to drink the blood of the old woman Dante thrust at her was the second worst. In the end, as hungry as she was, she’d been unable to kill the old lady and Zebulon, seeing her struggle, stepped in and broke the woman’s neck when Dante wasn’t looking. She’d never know if it was out of pity for her or fear of Dante that he did it. She pretended to partake but drank as little as she could get away with as Dante watched. Which was hard because she needed the blood as much as she despised murdering to get it. If she killed and drank she’d be as bad as her captors. Like them, she’d be a ghoul. Just the tiny amount of human blood trickling through her body changed her. She could feel it. She heard the thoughts of the others around her with more clarity and felt so much stronger. Dante, monster that he was, had been right about that. In her frustration as they raced through the night woods away from the house she noticed trees and limbs bending before and around her, buried rocks shook in the earth, as she passed through them. The others, busy moving through the forest, didn’t see these things and she wisely kept her new abilities to herself. She loathed the vampires for what they were and what they were making her do so much she was sure it would warp her soul. If she even had one left to warp. After they fled the house she grieved for the carnage they’d left behind and guilt overwhelmed her for not being able to stop it. She hated herself so much after the family’s massacre she couldn’t look at herself in a mirror. But that night was when her plan to destroy the other vampires took root and began to grow. They locked her in the room again that morning and the next morning and the morning after that. In between they dragged her along on their night hunts. As hard as she tried to avoid killing–Zebulon covered for her and always made the killing stroke–and drinking human blood, most nights she was forced to ingest some of it. Dante’s will, his blackmailing and the hunger continuing to grow inside like a ravenous beast did the rest. Slowly her powers increased and she hid them, biding her time. She was evolving. Her brown hair was streaked with silver, her skin as white and hard as alabaster, her eyes in the dark were diamonds. As she grew swifter and stronger the other vampires, except Dante and the one called Aloysius, almost seemed to accept her. But Dante, Zebulon said, was only seeing how far her transformation would go. An experiment for his amusement only. She feared what would happen when it went as far as it could. Or too far. Would Dante rid himself of her then? Probably so. He despised humans and thought of her as a mutant, which was barely one breath above a human. “Dante’s been bored for a long time,” Zebulon admitted once. “You’re his new pet.” “Well, some love their pets,” she’d replied with a trace of irony. “Not he. He tires of them easily.” “Then what?” “He has them for breakfast.” At first Jenny learned everything she could about her captors but Zebulon was the only one who’d actually talk to her. The others tolerated her because Dante demanded it. She was Dante’s human pet. She was lonely. Lost. She drank human blood. Sometimes she thought the only thing that still tied her to her old life, the good mortal she’d once been, was the love she had for Teddy and Sarah. She could see and hear them in her head as they lived their lives; when Laurie helped them pick out their day’s clothes or when Andy, who she finally deduced they were staying with, made them supper. They spent time with Andy, Joey or Laurie, scrambled into their beds each night, worried about, prayed over and missed her–and she could only watch. Listen. From a distance. Missing them too. As she could only watch as the townspeople’s and those she loved searched for her everywhere. The woods. The town. Nearby towns. Plastered her picture over telephone poles, the news and the Internet. They wouldn’t find her. Andy, bless his heart, helped care for her children as if they were his own and trampled through the woods and creeks, nearby hospitals and towns, searching for her day after day. Never giving up. Joey was right. The man must care for her. Poor Andy. It all broke her heart. But it kept her human. Her children and her old life haunted and beckoned her through the empty days of sleeping in locked rooms and grisly nights of spreading terror and mayhem, but she couldn’t go home. Not until she found a way to destroy those who held her. If it wasn’t already too late. She wondered if she was becoming as much a monster as Dante and his associates. But something was happening that only she knew about. Her great secret, and she was careful to hide what she could do. Pretending to be weak. Frightened at times when, instead, she was getting more powerful every day, every minute. Every second. She’d watched the others closely and seen what they were capable of, what they could do. Especially Dante. And she could do more. Soon, she began to hope, when the time was right, she’d take back her freedom. And she’d destroy them as well. Forever.",

      "content": "Chapter 17 Jenny Jenny didn’t know why they were keeping her alive. The first night they whisked her off to a sprawling house nestled on a cliff among thick woods and put her alone in a room. They’d traveled like the wind. How far they’d gone she didn’t know but it was a long way. Maybe even out of the county or the state. She wasn’t sure. They locked the door and the windows, chained her to the bed. The links were made of iron, heavy, and circled her wrists, and the chain was spiked to the floor. She’d have to gnaw off her own hands to break her bonds. “Don’t try to escape,” Dante warned. “We know where your brother and his wife live and work. If you run we’ll kill them. Bring them here; make you watch. Your children, too.” That had settled that. She lay in the room, on the bed, fighting her growing hunger, and listening to the rain pelting the roof. She had to play for time. If Joey did what she prayed he’d do, he’d hide her kids. They’d be safe. If he were real smart he’d also hide Laurie and himself. Only then could she take the chance. Escape. Yet even as she thought of getting away, she knew it was hopeless. She, her children, her family and friends couldn’t hide forever. There was no witness protection program from vampires. Or not any that she was aware of. She had to think of another plan. The vampires left her alone, or she thought they left her alone, for a time. The house grew quiet. They were probably out hunting and slaughtering innocents. It made her sick. Here she was tied up like a Thanksgiving turkey and not doing anything to stop them. Her hunger became a torment. She gazed with longing at the windows and the woods beyond. Full of game, and blood, that she couldn’t partake of. Sleep was difficult but she dozed in and out. Waiting. What did they want from her? If they were going to kill her why not just do it? Did they have something worse planned for her? Don’t think about it. Don’t. The house became noisy again. The drapes were pulled, darkening the room, but there was a sliver of light along the bottom. It must be morning. Dante appeared by her bedside. “Why haven’t you killed me yet?” she asked. “Oh, so you are awake?” His voice was throaty, mesmerizing, for a monster. The room was full of pale light. The sun was beginning to rise and she could see him. He looked human. Unbelievably tall and muscled, silver hair worn long and shaggy. His eyes gleamed blackish silver, when he tilted his head. Empty eyes. She wondered about his teeth. He smiled and bared them. His fangs were long, sharp and, unlike hers, filled his mouth in triple rows. When his lips smiled again they were normal. “I heard your thoughts. In this respect we’re like your mythical vampires.” “Our vampires?” She didn’t want to banter with him but she couldn’t stop herself. If she was to fight them, the more she knew about them the better. “Well, what you humans think vampires are like.” “Are there real vampires, then?” “Our distant cousins, you mean? There once were many, hundreds of your centuries ago. They came from our realm during your cavemen days. They’ve died out since. Or most of them have. Survival of the fittest, you know.” Her eyes blinked. “Your kind killed them all?” She wanted so badly to say, nah, nah, nah, nah…you didn’t. I’ve seen, destroyed, some of your brethren before. They still exist here in our world. But she was too shrewd to taunt him like that. Best to keep that a secret. If she could. She shut the thought out of her head. Go away. Go away. His laughter wasn’t human. It came from behind him. She looked to see if there was someone else there, but there was only him. “We did. Most fun we ever had. You humans aren’t half as much sport, let me tell you. We out run, out think and out fight you. And because most of you don’t believe in us we get away with it.” An echo of laughter. His thin lips didn’t move. “If they were like you why did you kill them?” “Excellent question. Because they were competition. Underneath they were nothing like us. They were mindless, hungry animals that had no purpose but to drink the blood we needed to exist.” “And you and your friends do have a purpose?” “We do. But that is a discussion for another time.” She opted not to press her luck and let it drop. “So, you said you were from another planet…dimension…what?” “Another place and time actually.” It was as if she were in a weird nightmare. “You’re an alien time traveler?” He actually laughed. “Your kind would call us that.” “Why are you here?” He seemed to consider answering or not, then shrugged, and did. “Our realm has no food left. Unless we feed on each other.” “So you can’t go home?” He thought about that, too, for a moment, examining her. “Why would we want to? The food–all the blood and more–we need is here. But no. The doorway closed long ago and except for a few of us with the power to travel back and forth, we’re stranded, you might say. Then again we need the hunt as much as the blood. We’re not like you. Sheep. Lemmings. You know, gutless.” She shivered. Vile. That’s what they were. It made no difference where they came from. Evil was evil. “We kill to survive so if that makes us evil, so be it.” “Killing to survive isn’t but butchering intelligent sentient beings and reveling in it is.” “Oh you humans see everything so black and white, don’t you? It isn’t. There’re so many of you, billions, what difference if there’s a few hundred less or so?” Dante sat down on the edge of the bed and leaned over to look at her; studying her as one might study a rare captured animal. His long thin fingers traced around her eyes and down her face. He touched her hair. She cringed but the chain kept her from moving out of his reach. “So soft,” he muttered. “Are you going to kill me?” There, she’d asked. It would be better to know one way or another. If she was going to die she might as well die fighting. “We were. At first. Now you’ve piqued our curiosity. Why didn’t you die in St. Louis? What makes you the one exception in a million that our bite turned you into one of us? Why do you have some of our powers and some we don’t have?” Some we don’t have? “This blending hasn’t ever happened before?” She finally understood her allure to them. “Humans becoming one of us? Not that I know of. Not that any of us have known of. There were myths we’ve heard through the centuries, yet none of us have seen. For some reason you are one of those exceptions.” “What are you going to do with me then?” But Dante wasn’t there. The room around her was empty. Damn. She’d had more questions to ask. She hadn’t learned near enough to help or to break the hold they had over her. She’d realized one thing, the most important, though. She’d been right, escaping from these alien vampires, as she’d begun to think of them, wouldn’t be the answer. She must destroy them. There was no other way she, those she loved and their future victims would ever be safe. If they didn’t kill her first. God, she missed her children. She was worried about them. Closing her eyes she concentrated and saw them. They were some place she didn’t recognize. A cozy kitchen filled with oak cabinets and lots of wood trim, an oak table and chairs. Outside the window there were trees. So it wasn’t Joey and Laurie’s apartment. Her children were getting ready for school. Laurie was feeding them breakfast and trying her best to settle their fears over Jenny’s absence. “Your mother will be found. You’ll see. The entire town is searching. But until she returns you two have to keep hoping for the best, do what your mom would want you to do. You need to make her proud. Just don’t tell anyone where you’re staying, understand? It’s very important. Promise!” Teddy was eating raisin bran, his head down. “Okay,” he mumbled. Sarah, in jeans and a red sweater–the warm sweater Jenny had bought last week because the weather was turning chilly–was sitting at the table with her Gameboy. The one Jeff had gotten her the Christmas before. They both looked so sad and it broke Jenny’s heart. But they were okay. Alive. They had a roof over their heads, food in their stomachs, clothes on their backs and people to care for them who loved them almost as much as Jenny did. Joey and Laurie would protect them. Sarah scooted closer to her brother as if being near to him made her feel safer. “I miss Mom, don’t you?” Sarah whispered. Teddy looked at her. “Me too. But we got to have faith like Uncle Joey says. We’ll get her back. Soon.” “Wish we were still going to school.” “You know what they said. It’s safer if we don’t for a while. In case those men are looking for us. Same with us not letting people know we’re here or seeing us.” “Yeah, I know.” Sarah let out a sigh. “It’s best.” Their words and actions brought a faint smile because if she never returned she knew her brother and sister-in-law would raise her children with firmness and love. That gave Jenny some peace of mind. Voices outside her room brought her to the present. She couldn’t let her jailers hear her thoughts and consciously blanked them out. She couldn’t let them see where her children were. They were out of danger for now and that’s the way she wanted them to stay. It made what she was planning easier, knowing that. Eventually, even with the growing hunger throbbing like fire through her veins and muscles; her fears, she slipped into a restless sleep. Chained as she was, it wasn’t easy to get comfortable, but she had to conserve her strength. Had to be ready. For whatever was coming. *** They woke her as the third night seeped into the room. The one called Zebulon unlocked her chains and dragged her to her feet. She was unsteady. Weakened because she hadn’t fed in days and stiff because of her chained captivity. Her legs didn’t work at first. What was wrong with her? Then terror swallowed her. Woke her up. Was she going to die now? Was this it? “No, you’re not going to die,” Zebulon confided. “Yet.” He led her out the door and through a lavishly accessorized and decorated home. Money, she thought. On her way through she wondered what had happened to the owners. Most likely dead, stuffed in a closet somewhere or stacked up in the basement. Bloodless flattened cadavers. Outside it was a drab day. There was a blowing wind and leaves flew around her head like dark snow. “Where are we going?” she asked as Zebulon shoved her down a trail behind the house. “Dante wants you to come along on our next hunt.” At least she wasn’t going to die. Wait…oh, God. “Hunt?” “He thought it was time you fed. Learned the correct way to treat the cattle.” “You mean humans?” He sent her an exasperated look. “Of course, humans. It’s what keeps us strong.” Human blood. Oh no. She didn’t want to do that. He pushed her onward but she halted in her tracks. “Don’t make Dante wait. He isn’t happy when he has to wait for anyone or anything. And you don’t want to see him unhappy. Trust me.” She didn’t trust him but of the four vampires he seemed the most sympathetic. He acknowledged and actually, not like Dante’s sadistic goading, talked to her while the other two acted as if she weren’t there. Plodding through the woods, she lost track of time. No moon so there was no light, yet she saw what was around her clear enough as her mind furiously tried to find a way to get rid of her jailers. They joined the others outside of a dark house. Dante looked over his shoulder and smiled. “Good you’re here. We’ve got a family ripe to be picked. There are five of them and there are five of us. Two old ones, two of middle years and one young one. They’re asleep now on the second floor. “It’s time you tasted human blood. See what it can do for you. You’ll be surprised.” “I won’t kill anyone. I won’t–” Dante was at her side, his hand gripping her arm so tightly she cried out in shock. Pain wasn’t something she’d felt much of since her turning. Apparently, her captors could inflict it easily on her. She didn’t know why, but that knowledge didn’t make her happy. “You’ll do what I tell you or someone you love will die before the night is over. Your brother, perhaps? I can get there and back before you miss me. Your children have gone into hiding but he has that rat hole diner of his and is easy to find. So is his wife. Do you understand me?” There were so many things she could have said but she uttered none of them. Defying him in front of the others would only enrage him more. “Yes.” Going into that house and being a part of the family’s brutal deaths was the worst nightmare she’d ever endured. She’d been unconscious during her husband’s murder, but she was wide awake during the slaughter. And being forced to drink the blood of the old woman Dante thrust at her was the second worst. In the end, as hungry as she was, she’d been unable to kill the old lady and Zebulon, seeing her struggle, stepped in and broke the woman’s neck when Dante wasn’t looking. She’d never know if it was out of pity for her or fear of Dante that he did it. She pretended to partake but drank as little as she could get away with as Dante watched. Which was hard because she needed the blood as much as she despised murdering to get it. If she killed and drank she’d be as bad as her captors. Like them, she’d be a ghoul. Just the tiny amount of human blood trickling through her body changed her. She could feel it. She heard the thoughts of the others around her with more clarity and felt so much stronger. Dante, monster that he was, had been right about that. In her frustration as they raced through the night woods away from the house she noticed trees and limbs bending before and around her, buried rocks shook in the earth, as she passed through them. The others, busy moving through the forest, didn’t see these things and she wisely kept her new abilities to herself. She loathed the vampires for what they were and what they were making her do so much she was sure it would warp her soul. If she even had one left to warp. After they fled the house she grieved for the carnage they’d left behind and guilt overwhelmed her for not being able to stop it. She hated herself so much after the family’s massacre she couldn’t look at herself in a mirror. But that night was when her plan to destroy the other vampires took root and began to grow. They locked her in the room again that morning and the next morning and the morning after that. In between they dragged her along on their night hunts. As hard as she tried to avoid killing–Zebulon covered for her and always made the killing stroke–and drinking human blood, most nights she was forced to ingest some of it. Dante’s will, his blackmailing and the hunger continuing to grow inside like a ravenous beast did the rest. Slowly her powers increased and she hid them, biding her time. She was evolving. Her brown hair was streaked with silver, her skin as white and hard as alabaster, her eyes in the dark were diamonds. As she grew swifter and stronger the other vampires, except Dante and the one called Aloysius, almost seemed to accept her. But Dante, Zebulon said, was only seeing how far her transformation would go. An experiment for his amusement only. She feared what would happen when it went as far as it could. Or too far. Would Dante rid himself of her then? Probably so. He despised humans and thought of her as a mutant, which was barely one breath above a human. “Dante’s been bored for a long time,” Zebulon admitted once. “You’re his new pet.” “Well, some love their pets,” she’d replied with a trace of irony. “Not he.

That she did it to save them. They feel abandoned for the second time. First their father is killed and then their mother leaves. So I can’t give up.” “I know. You’re a good brother.” The kids were planted in front of the television in the living room while he and Andy talked over coffee in Andy’s kitchen. Jenny had been missing for almost a month. “We won’t give up,” Andy said. “That local television station in Stanton is airing another story on her tomorrow night. Could be it’ll generate some leads. Someone’s had to have seen her or knows something about her whereabouts. She can’t have just vanished into thin air.” “People do all the time. Vanish, I mean.” Joey said what he thought he had to say, knowing what he knew. “And last time we mostly got a lot of calls from crackpots and unbalanced nuts.” “Shame Detective Bradley had to go back to St. Louis yesterday.” “He’d used up all his vacation time. But he promised he’d check in with us regularly now that the murders have resumed. He’s following them from there; hoping his department will lend him to ours so he can continue the investigation because he’s so involved with the case.” “He’s a smart cop, I hope they let him. We need him.” Andy was finishing up the supper dishes at the sink; dried off his hands and draped the towel over the rod attached inside the lower cabinet. He was the only person Joey knew of, besides Jenny, who didn’t have a dishwasher and did them by hand. “I heard about those two men whose bodies were found thirty miles from here last weekend. That makes how many deaths since Jenny went missing?” Joey knew the number but didn’t say it. He shook his head. “Too many.” And he had little doubt the vampires who’d taken Jenny were responsible. Damn them to hell. So far he hadn’t told Andy about them. What they were really up against. He’d tried to many times but just couldn’t do it. Andy was a down-to-earth kind of guy who didn’t believe in anything that wasn’t easily explained. Joey inwardly laughed every time he thought of spilling the beans to his friend about what Jenny really was and who’d taken her. Andy would think the stress of Jenny’s abduction had just plain unhinged him. The abduction as a simple kidnapping was enough knowledge for the part Andy had to play. As far as Andy knew the same people who were killing townspeople (for whatever reason a killer kills) were the same ones who’d taken Jenny. For reasons unknown. “They took my sister and we’re worried they might return for the kids because they saw them; can identify them,” Joey had revealed that first night. “Not that they remember a thing about the abduction. The fright must have emptied their minds of it. But to be safe we need to hide them somewhere for a while.” He’d had to lie to protect the truth. “You think Jenny’s kidnapping has something to do with the attack on her and her husband in St. Louis? She saw something she shouldn’t have? Knows something she shouldn’t know?” “That’s possible.” Joey let him believe it. Basically it was true. “The kids can hide out at my place,” Andy had immediately offered that first night. “I want to help.” And the children were still there. Both he and Laurie were careful not to draw attention to where Andy lived. They came and went in secret or in the dark. Fearing the vampires would get to the children at school somehow, Joey had taken both of them out for a while. He’d told the principal it was because of the kidnapping and the fear the kidnappers might come after them as well. It was best if they went into total hiding for a time. No one had questioned it. Not yet anyway. Eventually they’ll need to return to school, but not now. The principal, under the circumstances, also had thought it was best. Joey wished Bradley were still around. It was nice having a believer to confide in, a believer to have his back. Beneath everything Joey was worried sick for his sister. A month and not a sign of her. Not a peep. If she were still alive she would have somehow found a way–a telephone call, a hastily scribbled postcard, an e-mail, something–to get in touch with him or her children. His worst fear was that she was already dead. Long dead. But, in his heart, he didn’t feel she was. But he didn’t know what to do. The search for Jenny had wound down. It wasn’t merely the time factor, after weeks people had to go on with their lives and the police on to other cases, but the weather had turned unusually chilly. Rainy. Halloween had come and gone. The holidays were coming and people tended to forget one missing woman, especially when the slayings started up again. Joey, his niece and nephew couldn’t forget. They grieved each day for their sister and their mother. Yet Joey and Laurie had the diner to tend to. With Jenny gone they had two more mouths to feed and the diner was their livelihood. Andy’s help was a godsend. Joey closed up the farmhouse. Every chance he got he went out and looked for Jenny, vowing he’d never give up. Knowing, if it were the other way around, she’d never give up looking for him. And the weeks went by.",

If she were still alive she would have somehow found a way–a telephone call, a hastily scribbled postcard, an e-mail, something–to get in touch with him or her children. His worst fear was that she was already dead. Long dead. But, in his heart, he didn’t feel she was. But he didn’t know what to do. The search for Jenny had wound down. It wasn’t merely the time factor, after weeks people had to go on with their lives and the police on to other cases, but the weather had turned unusually chilly. Rainy. Halloween had come and gone. The holidays were coming and people tended to forget one missing woman, especially when the slayings started up again. Joey, his niece and nephew couldn’t forget. They grieved each day for their sister and their mother. Yet Joey and Laurie had the diner to tend to. With Jenny gone they had two more mouths to feed and the diner was their livelihood. Andy’s help was a godsend. Joey closed up the farmhouse. Every chance he got he went out and looked for Jenny, vowing he’d never give up. Knowing, if it were the other way around, she’d never give up looking for him. And the weeks went by.",

      "content": "Chapter 19 Sarah “How long do we have to stay here with Andy?” Sarah asked one drizzly morning, as she and her brother were getting up and dressed. She’d gotten up and heard the rain tap dancing on the roof. She told her brother it sounded like a thousand baby deer feet. Outside the window the sky was crowded with fat ugly looking clouds that took all the light away. It could have been nighttime it was so dark. Andy said a big storm was coming in. Lots of lightning and thunder. “It’s going to be a bad one,” he’d said. “We’re going to stay in the house today and hope for the best.” Sometimes, she thought, Andy was too protective. Always watching them and wanting to know where they were going. Not that they went much of anywhere since her mom left. They didn’t. But then she felt safer in the house with Andy and Teddy. She shivered in her pajamas. It was cold, too, for Florida, which her mom had said was mostly warm all the time. Andy said it was the coldest November he could recall. “I don’t know,” Teddy grumbled, down on his knees peeking under the bed looking for his lost shoe. He was always losing something. Which was weird because the room they were staying in wasn’t that big. Heck, Andy’s house wasn’t that big but it was nice. It had two bathrooms like their old house in Millstadt had had, a screened in porch and a deck behind it that overlooked a section of the woods. She liked it because it had three televisions. Almost one in every room. Staring out the window into the falling wetness, she went on, “I mean I like Andy and all. I know he and mom were friends. But I miss home. My own room.” Then in a whisper, “And mom.” She traced the letters MOM in the glass’s condensation. She drew a heart by it. Amadeus, hiding under the bed covers, was waking up. The cat meowed a good morning to them and stretched. It was still a runt (Andy believed it’d never be a big cat no matter what) even with all the food they fed it. And they fed it a lot. It loved table scraps, mostly meat, especially turkey and chicken. “Good Morning to you, too, kitty.” Sarah turned around, scooped up the kitten and, snuggling it close, moved to the window again. Her eyes were on the misty woods beyond the house. Amadeus climbed onto her shoulder, purring and talking in her ear. Its tongue licked her neck and she stroked its soft fur. Teddy came up behind her and put a hand on her other shoulder. “Ah, Sarah, don’t start crying again, okay? Your face is gonna freeze that way and you don’t want to look like that when mom comes back, do you? All sorrowful like? Eyes all bloodshot?” “No.” She sniffled and wiped the tears off her face with her fingers. “Mom wouldn’t want you to be so sad. She’s coming back. I know it. She wouldn’t leave us alone forever. She loves us.” “How can you be so sure? Dad hasn’t come back.” “Dad died,” her brother spoke somberly. “He can’t come back.” “Mom could be dead, too.” She almost hated to say the words. Words had power, she thought. If you said them they might come true. “Mom isn’t dead.” Her brother acted as if he were mad at her. His face got red, his fists clenched like he wanted to hit something or someone. “She’s just…missing. She’ll come back. I know it.” She snorted. “Yeah, when? Why is she missing? Still gone? It’s been forever. How can she stay away from us all this time, not even call us, if she loves us so much?” “Someone’s keeping her from us, that’s what. Those men. She has a reason for not coming. But give her time. She’ll find a way.” Her brother met her gaze and something crossed between them. They both knew their mother loved them. That wasn’t in doubt. It was everything else. She shrugged away from him, dropped the kitten on the bed and grabbed up the clothes she was going to wear. Comfortable clothes because they were, as usual, only going to hang around the house. She was getting tired of being in hiding as Uncle Joey put it. Danger or not. Gosh they hadn’t even gone out trick-or-treating for Halloween. All they’d done was dress up in costumes and masks and went to Joey’s diner for a special Halloween supper. They had to get out sometimes, Andy said. The night was okay. The place was all decorated up and there were lots of people there dressed as witches, werewolves and funny looking aliens. Kind of a party all evening long. People coming and going. Eating and laughing as a radio behind the counter played scary music. There’d been bowls of free candy everywhere. Uncle Joey gave her a bag of her favorite kind (Milky Ways and chocolate covered marshmallow pumpkins) to take home. In hiding. Being bored, is what she called it. She liked school. Learning. Books. Teachers. The friends she’d begun to make. She liked being able to play outside, go to the library and shop. Things they weren’t allowed to do now. All she wanted was to have things be normal again. Like that was ever going to happen. She felt like Alice down the rabbit hole, except she hadn’t gotten out of that first room Alice had found herself in. “I’m going to the bathroom downstairs and get dressed,” she said. “See you at breakfast.” “See you there.” Her brother had taken her place at the window as she left the room. She was worried about Teddy, too. He wasn’t talking much. Holding it inside. Not for the first time she wished she was older, smarter, and knew what to do for him. She could barely keep from crying all the time herself. How could she hope to help him? She hugged him a lot. Tried to make him laugh. Maybe that would help some. Tagged after him everywhere he went. He was getting a little peeved at her for that, though. She hated being a silly girl. There wasn’t anything she could do to help find her mother. They wouldn’t even let her search like the grownups were doing. They wanted her to sit in Andy’s house, watch television, videos, read books, and keep quiet. She should be looking for her mom with everyone else. Bella, the girl in the Twilight books, would have been out there looking. That girl was so brave. That girl lives in a book. She isn’t real. Her heart began to skip around like it was jumping rope. Those bad men had been real. Oh, she wasn’t afraid of the woods, no matter how dark it was. It was those men who’d stomped into their house that awful day and been so mean to Teddy and her. Hurt them. They were the ones who took her mom. Bad, bad men. They’d been creepy and hadn’t spoken much. So strong. Their skin so clammy to the touch. Their eyes had glittered strangely in the shadows beneath the trees. When they’d touched her, her mind had filled with horrible pictures and then had gone blank. She’d watched herself from far away. Maybe they’d been vampires? Yeah, sure. Only in books and movies. She had a wild imagination but she knew the difference between real and not real. Vampires were definitely not real. Like unicorns and Tinker Bell, which she used to really be into before the Twilight books came along. An unbelievable thought came to her then, What if vampires were real? And that’s what those men had been. No. No. No. That would make the unreal real and that would be way too scary. To think there were really monsters out in the world. Nah. After she was dressed she went into the kitchen. Amadeus trailed, slinking and popping out at her every now and again, behind her. She fed the cat and poured a bowl of cereal. Andy came in from the deck and, going into the refrigerator, got her milk to put in her cereal. “Good morning, Sarah.” “Good morning, Andy.” “Storm will be here any minute. I felt the first drops of rain when I was standing out there a minute ago.” She looked through the sliding glass doors. The trees were whipping back and forth and the sky was a sickly green shade. Like the sky in the beginning of the Wizard of Oz movie they’d watched a few nights ago. “Have we heard anything yet?” Andy would know what she was asking. She asked it every morning, every night. Have you heard anything about my mother? And as he did every day he shook his head. “No word yet. Nothing. I’m sorry.” He squeezed her shoulder gently and leaning down, gave her a hug. She looked up. “You think we’ll hear something tonight or tomorrow?” “We can only hope.” He sat down across from her and opened the morning newspaper he had delivered every day to the house. She knew better than to say more. Andy was sad enough. She’d seen it. He must have liked her mom a lot. He must miss her, too. Be worried about her. “When are Teddy and I going back to school?” “You know, your Uncle Joey and I were talking about that yesterday. Probably after the Thanksgiving holiday. You’ll still need to be careful but we think it’s safe.” “Yeah!” She threw her hands up in a gesture of childish happiness. It was something. At least going back to school would give her and Teddy something to do other than to sit around moping all day waiting for their mother to come home. She was sick of television and anyway there wasn’t much on during the day except those stupid soap operas and game shows. They’d already watched most of Andy’s DVD’s. In a low voice she asked, “Are those bad men gone now? Is that why we’re safe?” Teddy had wandered into the kitchen and taken the box of Pop Tarts (chocolate with white icing was his flavor of the week) out of the cabinet and dropped two into the toaster. He looked as if he’d been crying again. Her brother and Andy exchanged a look. Teddy knew everything before she did. He and Andy were like best buddies or something. Keeping secrets from her. Making hand signs and faces behind her back. Most of the time she didn’t mind. Teddy needed someone to confide in. She had Laurie and Uncle Joey. Teddy needed someone, too. “We’re not sure about those men, but they haven’t been seen or heard of since they took you and your brother. There’s been surveillance on the farmhouse and so far no one’s been seen nosing around it.” She was an intuitive child so she knew Andy was holding something back. It had to be the murders. She watched the news some nights and the woman on Channel 5 said there’d been no new ones for over a week. She figured those bad men had something to do with them. So if the murders were gone then perhaps those bad men were too. It was just a thought. “They wanted mom, that’s what they wanted. Not us. That’s why we’re safe, right?” “That’s what we think.” She smiled at Andy. “So we’re going back to school. Does that mean we’re leaving here? Where we going to live?” “For now your Uncle Joey and Aunt Laurie and I are going to share your living arrangements. They have to run the diner, I’m still not working, and since I can do most of my job applications online and on the telephone I want to keep helping, at least until I find a job. Plus, I have a furnished guest room with twin beds and, as you must remember, they don’t.” “Yeah,” Teddy groused, “those air beds are not comfortable. Too low to the ground. Too squishy for me.” “Oh, I liked them,” she interjected. “It was like floating on a cloud.” “Yeah, sure. A squishy cloud.” Andy rustled her brother’s hair and told him, as he always did, that he needed a haircut. She also knew another reason why they were staying with Andy. He was lonely. No job. Not many friends. Their being here seemed to make him happy. “Is that arrangement okay with you?” Andy asked her. “Fine with me.” She liked Andy and since her dad died and her mom had been gone it was nice to have him around as well as her aunt and uncle. They were all almost like a family. In many ways Andy was a lot like her father had been. Funny. Patient. Loved to play board and computer games. Cards. Watch movies with them on the sofa. He was pesky like their dad had been, too. Always asking questions and stuff about their day. She’d decided she liked him. The world outside suddenly lit up like fireworks and the roar of thunder boomed around them like an angry roaring animal. She got up from the table and moved to the glass doors, the bowl of cereal in her hands and Amadeus bouncing around her feet. The cat was scared of storms and whenever there was one it wouldn’t leave her alone. Had to be in her lap or under her feet. Better yet, safe in her arms. Another flash and shriek and Amadeus was scuttling up her jeans like a fast moving cockle burr; yowling like a crazy cat until it was cuddled and trembling around her neck. All three of them laughed. It felt good because it’d been a long time since they had.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 Jenny Jenny had been patiently waiting. If she wanted to defeat the vampires she’d have to discover their weakness and use it against them. She was stronger every day, learning new things, still hiding them. Soon she’d be ready. All she had to do was have an opportunity and she was working on that. For some reason, she found she couldn’t blink herself away. Couldn’t transport like the day she’d first escaped them. It’d only been the one time, though. As if being with them, or Dante, kept her tethered. She never knew if it was on purpose. If Dante knew she could do it and prevented her or if there was some other reason. If he could do it. Yet she never saw any of them transport to another place in an instant as she’d done. They could travel swiftly, but not in the blink of an eye. It was a mystery. Strange. Though almost from the beginning, after a small rebellion or two to make it look good, she mimicked their habits and tried to get them to believe she was becoming one of them. Make them think she enjoyed slaying people and drinking their blood, enjoyed basking in her new existence. They had no idea, though, how powerful she was becoming. No idea. And she fought to keep it that way. Zebulon, for a reason she couldn’t understand, was not unkind to her. He gave her clean clothes when hers became filthy and torn. He was the one who provided her with a traveling bag to put her necessities in. A brush and shampoo for her hair, a toothbrush and toothpaste. A razor and shaving cream. Things she needed. Playing along was the only way she could survive. It wasn’t easy because they were so vicious and merciless to their victims. She was becoming a pretty darn good actress. The other two, Aloysius and Balthazar, she’d come to believe, were both shadows, mindless automatons that followed Dante’s orders without question and had little, to her knowledge anyway, personality of their own. They both had the silverish hair and black glittering eyes. Both were at least seven feet tall. Staring up at them, as with Dante, she felt like a Hobbit. All three towered over her. No wonder they thought they were gods. Aloysius, when he wasn’t killing was a morosely quiet one who didn’t seem to notice she was there most of the time. All he cared about was the hunt and the blood. He hadn’t said one word to her the entire time she’d been with them, other than to snap or snarl at her. He was truly an enigma; one she didn’t ever want to get to know better. At times, she wondered if there wasn’t something else really wrong with him besides being a bloodsucking monster. Maybe Dante had driven him totally insane. Wouldn’t surprise her. Balthazar, on the other hand, was the heaviest and tallest of the three, by a few inches at least, and talked, with barely any accent at all, incessantly. Just not to her, as he let her know constantly, who was beneath him. He chatted away at his victims as he tormented and eventually killed them. He yakked away to imaginary people all the time, too. Jenny came to believe he was as crazy as Aloysius. If the creatures they were could be crazy. Maybe they were all like that in the place they came from. He played word games with his make-believe friends, as well, and he always won. He read invisible books to them. Sounded like gobbledygook to her. His eyes, unlike Dante’s, weren’t empty. Just demented. Jenny steered clear of Balthazar as much as she could. Dante, on the other hand, haunted her every move. Ceaselessly observed her. His grand experiment. His little trained pet. She was so careful around him. At times she read his mind and she overheard that he didn’t trust her. Often she’d direct a trivial thought at him like pick up that rock on the ground before him or go out that door he just came in and he’d do it without comprehending he had, and then slowly her suggestions grew more important. Then she started in on the others. Each time one of them obeyed her without knowing they had she concealed a smile. She had a plan and she was working her way towards it. For the first time in a long time she had hope. But it would take a long time, she knew that. A long time. She’d have to be patient. So patient. And the days. The weeks went by. And she grew stronger. *** The storm drove them to find shelter for the night. Dante didn’t like getting wet. The house they’d broken into was in a part of Florida she wasn’t familiar with. The southern tip on the ocean. For weeks the four of them had followed Dante further and further away from Summer Haven and she’d been relieved. The more miles between these beasts and her family and home, the better. She lived in fear that he’d go back for her children. Hurt or kill them. If only to torture her. The kitchen had grimy floors and scratched cabinets. Tattered yellow curtains hung limp over dirty glass. All and all a shabby excuse for a place where a family would eat their meals together. It made her long for her cheery kitchen with the yellow walls. There was food in the cabinets and in the refrigerator. She tried eating some when the others weren’t watching. It wouldn’t stop the blood lust she felt from morning to night but it filled her stomach and kept her moving. Some nights, out on the hunt she’d sneakily catch a rabbit or some other small animal and drink from them. She’d become so fast, she could do it without the others seeing she had. Another secret she hid from them. Between the two forms of nourishment she stayed alive. Barely. And it kept her from drinking too much human blood when she was forced to. It was the only thing keeping her sane. In the house’s kitchen was a window much like hers at home. Looking out of it into the rain she had another image of her children. So real she could have reached out and touched them. Sarah was standing before a window peering out into the rain. She was crying. Amadeus in her arms making those tiny cute sounds it always did. Teddy came up behind her and put his hand on her small shoulder to comfort her. They missed and were worried about her. Oh, and how she missed them. Her arms ached to wrap around them. Her eyes wanted so badly to see their sweet faces and their innocent smiles…her ears wanted so badly to hear their voices and laughter. She sighed. It won’t be long, my sweet ones. It won’t be long, I promise. I’ll find a way to get home to you. I’ll find a way for us to be together and safe again. “Don’t get too comfortable,” Zebulon’s voice broke into her reverie. “Dante wants to go out as soon as it gets dark.” He was behind her one moment and when she twisted her neck to say something, he was gone. He did that a lot. Letting her know what was going on but not sticking around to talk much afterwards. He was afraid of their leader. They all were. She didn’t know why Zebulon wasn’t as mean to her as the others but she was grateful. Not that they were friends or anything. If given the chance she’d dispose of him without a second thought. And, probably, he her. She didn’t fool herself. She was a prisoner. They could kill her any time they desired and never let her forget it. Behind her, deeper in the house, she heard the cries of the men who could have been brothers or friends living together, as they died. They’d barricaded themselves in a back bedroom. She couldn’t care who they were. The least she knew about them and their lives the better because she couldn’t help them. Or save them. They were doomed. Her guilt was bad enough. Thank God no children this time. She’d had her belly full of dead children. Dante liked to feed on the young ones, as he called them. Their blood was sweeter. Untainted. Oh Lord, I hate him. I hate all of them. There was a series of gunshots; the humans must have had guns tucked away in that bedroom, more screams and sudden silence. Dante’s laughter. It was always the same. “Toss the bodies out in the back yard,” she heard him say. “I don’t want to look at them. Stupid humans. That’ll teach them to think they can fight us.” More laughter. “They really thought a gun could hurt us. Ha! Nothing can. When will these sheep learn?” Her head drooped, her body tensed, and she struggled with the familiar rage as it welled up inside her. She loathed her wardens with every inch of her heart and soul. She had to find a way to get rid of them. Get away. Return home to her children whom she missed so much it was as cruel a punishment as the gnawing hunger in her blood, or being with Dante and the others. “Too bad there were just two of them,” Dante’s voice was arrogant. “Not enough for all of us. The rest of you will have to wait for supper. Leave me now.” A reprieve. She hadn’t been forced to kill or drink their blood and was relieved. Dante seemed to have more power than the other three, or so she thought because it was hard to tell…except perhaps her now? Because he was older or stronger, or for some reason she wasn’t privy to, and didn’t know. She’d asked Zebulon once how long they’d been trapped on her world and all he’d replied was, “More years than you would believe. And some of us far longer than others.” Perhaps that explained why Dante was the most bloodthirsty, cruelest, of them. Though how he’d gotten that way probably didn’t matter. He just was. She daydreamed endlessly of slitting his throat, cutting his head off, or burning him up like one of those little straw voodoo dolls until he was a pile of ashes–after she’d filled his torso with long sharp needles. Incinerating him as Jeff and her had done years ago to that first pack of vampires. But how would she do that? Hmm. Lock them someplace they couldn’t get out of and torch it? She only had to find the right place and the right time. With her mind, make them stay there until their flesh and bones turned black. And so the seed of her plan was born and began to grow. She knew she couldn’t take this life much longer. Her soul was dying. And when it was completely gone, would she become like them? A demon? The storm pounded outside for another hour and when night claimed the world Dante led them out to hunt down more food. Heaven help her. It was to be another night of violence and death. If she could have wept she would have. If she could have lay down and died, she would have. But that night changed everything. They came across three teenagers, two girls and a boy, parked on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. The rain hadn’t let up and the kids couldn’t see the road well enough to drive so they’d pulled over. The car’s windows were foggy and the rain sliced around the white Blazer as the nearby trees swayed in the heavy wind. A perfect night for evil. A bad night for innocence. As the other nights Zebulon covered for her and she drank the blood from the dead girl. But Dante caught them and went into a rage. He grabbed the boy, the last one alive, and pushed him at her. “You drink and end him. Right now. Or you die.” The others were observing with coldness hidden behind their secretive faces. Zebulon was a stone statue. He couldn’t help her. Lightning illuminated the area around the car, the surrounding woods, and the terror on the boy’s face. He looked like Teddy. About the same age or a little older. His pale hair fell across his flushed face, his brown eyes were pleading for pity. For mercy. He’d seen his sisters–because that’s what they’d turned out to be–die in front of him. His sobs tore her shriveling heart apart. “Do it now!” Dante, at her side, painfully twisted her neck, forcing her mouth towards the boy’s neck. “Or you’ll die and I’ll go back and get those mewling kids of yours and that brother, his wife and your friend. And I’ll make sure they suffer so much before they die.” At that moment Jenny wished he’d just end her existence. She couldn’t slaughter the boy. But when Dante threatened to hurt her children, those she loved, her fury, a red-hot fire in her gut, exploded. She flung her mind at him and then her fists and he went down at her feet. He went down. By her strength of will alone. Her victory was short lived. He regained control, his lethal eyes flashing, and rose from the ground to face her. The other vampires, once they’d stopped gawking in shock, grabbed and held her. “You’re getting braver, Mutant. Stronger. I underestimated you and won’t do that again. Experiment over. I don’t need the trouble you bring. I’ve learned what I wanted to know. I don’t need you. Not anymore. Perhaps it’s time for you to go.” His hands closed around her neck. She felt herself lifted into the air. Her feet swinging. This could be it, she thought. End of the road. She wondered what death would be like and closed her eyes. Through the rain and storm noises a siren screeched, coming their way. Flickering crimson lights cut through the night and beamed across the wet tree trunks. Before the teenagers had been pulled from the car, one of them had called the cops. Of course. Teenagers had cell phones. It was time to leave. Swearing, Dante dropped her, spun around and snapped the boy’s neck. The body crumpled into the muddy grass. Jenny shrieked and threw herself at Dante but Zebulon stepped between them and drug her away, his whisper a hiss, “Don’t be stupid. You can’t beat him. Think of your children.” She collapsed in his arms. He was right, and it made her feel worse. She might have been able to beat Dante, him alone, but there were the other three. Might wasn’t good enough. She had to be sure before she tried again. Prepared. She had to have her plan to wipe them out in place first and foolproof. Or her family would never be safe. She had to exterminate all of them. Yes, even Zebulon. Though he’d shown her less malice, he was still a heartless killer. The five of them sped away through the night trees. When they arrived at the house they’d procured for the night Dante locked her in the cellar as punishment. He seemed to have forgotten her death sentence. “If I can’t trust you to behave. Perhaps a few days alone in the dark without sustenance will change your mind.” He dropped the piece of wood into the slots on the outside of the door, imprisoning her. Jenny was relieved to be alone. She’d felt a new strength course through her body as she’d attacked Dante and knew soon she’d be able to defeat him. It was good Zebulon had stopped her. She could have overpowered Dante but not all four of them at once. She would have lost. And they’d still be alive to continue their killing sprees. To kill Teddy and Sarah and anyone else they wanted. She needed to be smarter than them. Think. More than anything, as she’d seen that boy die she knew she wanted, needed, to go home to her children. More than anything. To protect them always against monsters like those who’d taken her. On the other hand, she burned to be free of them and wanted them gone forever in the worst way. Huddled in a corner of the cellar, horrified at what the vampires were probably doing out beyond the moldy walls–what if they were off rounding up her children or killing them, right now–and afraid of what was going to happen to her, she suddenly knew how to do it. Zebulon had let slip the first few days she’d been with them something about the only thing that could kill them was beheading or fire. She’d paid attention. She’d remembered. Once her eyes had adjusted to the dark she looked around. She was in an old fashioned concrete-walled cellar. A large one, but still a cellar. If she could lure the four into a place like this, lock them in and torch the house above and around it…she could destroy them. Why not this cellar? The locks on the outside door were strong as were the walls. No windows. She pulled herself to her feet and explored with hands and fingers. Her sight, when she concentrated, clearing up so she could almost see everything through a red haze. A large can of gasoline was stashed in a corner. A box of rags and a pile of covers were in another. Wooden shelves lined the walls. More than enough gas. More than enough fodder to burn. She found a box of matches on a concrete ledge next to the shelves. Shelves that were chock full of junk and would go up like dry kindling if touched by fire. In fact, the cellar was a hoarders dream. It’d make a great blazing bonfire. If she could keep them from getting out of it before the flames could do their work. There was another room, again with no windows, in the rear with a heavy metal door that had a huge padlock on the outside…even better. If she could lure them into it but keep herself outside, her plan could work. Conceivably. The house was made of and shingled in wood. Just a tinder box waiting to burst into flames. Why not now? Here? Why not? She’d been perfecting her mind control over the four vampires for weeks. Each time getting more and more domination over them. She’d wanted to gain more, but now there wasn’t time. In her heart, she knew she had to strike now. She’d had a premonition that the four were planning something really terrible. Soon. The time to destroy them was now. She thought of a way to entrap them, prayed it would work, and after preparing things around her, forced herself to sleep so she’d be ready. All her strength, her guile and her new abilities would be needed to pull off her plan. Waking from the noise of the vampires’ return, she moved to the other side of her prison closer to the main exit and waited. Upstairs she heard them fighting. Yelling at each other. Scuffling. They did that often. Dissention in the ranks, she supposed. Or their hunt hadn’t gone well. Their appetite unsatisfied. They were still hungry. Which would be even better for her. When they were hungry they weren’t as vigilant. Or as cautious. This is a crazy idea, she told herself. Crazy. No way could it work. But she was going to do it anyway. She couldn’t be with them one more day, one more minute. Something horrendous was about to happen. Maybe they were going to hit a school or a crowd of people at a mall. Whatever it was, it’d be really, really bad. This must work or she would die. And she no longer cared if she did. Taking the chance of ridding the world of them was worth it. As she’d come to believe, as long as she was with them, their prisoner, her family would be in danger. They and she’d never be free. Concentrating with everything she had, she sent a silent call to Dante and the others to come downstairs. Her mind strained, lulled and tugged at theirs. Every ounce of her strength, all her desperation, was put into it. Come to the cellar…there are humans hiding in the room at the back…fresh victims…fresh blood…down here. Come. And they did. All four of them. Her cage opened. “We think someone’s hiding down here.” Dante’s voice was strangely toneless. His eyes a little glassy. He looked at her but didn’t see her as he walked past to the small room on the other side of the cellar. She faked being weak. Uncaring. Lying against the wall by the door, lethargic. No threat at all. “Yes, we heard something,” he muttered after glancing and seeing the sorry state she was in. Satisfied she wasn’t capable of causing any trouble, his back turned to her and his hand went to the handle of the metal door. “Yes, I heard it, too. I think there are children,” she closed her eyes tightly for a moment as she pushed the thoughts and the words out, “hiding in a corner of that room behind the door. Three or more. I heard them crying. If not for me they would have come out and escaped. I’ve made sure they didn’t. I’ve saved them for you.” “Children? Hiding in here?” Dante repeated. His hand was turning the handle. Opening the door. It was a black pit inside. She pushed at Dante’s and the others’ minds again. Hard. Harder. Straining every fiber of her being. Using every trace she had left of her fading humanity and her new powers. Children. Fresh blood. Go inside and look in the far corner. You’re sooo hungry. Their blood is so sweet. Zebulon and Balthazar had caught up with Dante, their faces eager, their eyes slack. Shoulders hunched. Stooping down because of their height, they crowded in behind him and peered into the dark space. Aloysius was the only one who seemed suspicious. He lagged behind the others, his inhuman eyes on her. He halted before her, glared at her, but she gave one stronger mind push and like a reluctant lemming he followed after the others. It was working. She got up from the floor, picked up the gas can and slipped the matches out of her pocket. Making sure she kept her mind as vacant as possible to what she was doing, she went on tiptoes towards the vampires. If any of them suspected, the game would be over. She’d strewn rags and blankets all around, framing the metal door. Stealthily her body edged towards the smaller room. The vampires had entered it. She moved to the door and, as quietly as she could, closed it. Turned the key she’d found on a shelf and locked it. Her heart was beating so loud she thought she was having a heart attack. Hurry now! Before they sensed her true intention. Before they awoke from her mind control. She couldn’t believe it had worked. Stay. Stay. All is well, she told them. Rest. She sprinkled gas over everything in wide swathes and wildly threw lit matches as she backed out of the cellar. The fire, a hungry beast, took hold and the room blazed into hell. There. Done! She heard nothing, not a sound from the vampires inside. She didn’t know what they were doing in there, but she didn’t care. It was time for her to go. Stay. You are tired. Sleep. Sleep. Sprinting out the cellar door, she swung around with trembling hands and dropped the thick wooden beam down into the latches, locking the main exit from the outside. There were no sounds, no thoughts she could detect in the cellar or behind the metal door. She blocked her thoughts. Theirs. And waited. There were only the shrieks of the fire and its all-consuming flames. She only then let herself imagine the vampires realizing what she’d done. How she’d trapped and beaten them. How she, their powerless little mutant, had bested them. She imagined them yelling and raging at her to let them out…and then she imagined them screaming in shock and agony as they burned to cinders. Gone forever! For the first time in months Jenny smiled. She’d done it. It’d almost been too easy. As dawn tinged the horizon on another gray day she lingered outside beneath the shade of a towering tree and watched the house burn. The cellar and the lower floors went first and then the upper floor. The accelerant helped it go quickly and completely. Inside she cheered, but also prayed that the vampires couldn’t, wouldn’t get out. And that no one called the fire department before the building was reduced to ashes. No one did. It was an isolated house. Far from a town. The structure was soon a smoldering pile of fiery embers, a sea of flattened burnt wood. One big charcoal pit. She heard nothing from inside it. No voices, no thoughts. Just blessed silence. The vampires–even Dante–were no longer there. Her back slid down against the tree trunk, the release draining everything from her, and remained there for hours. Waiting. Watching. She had to be sure none of them had survived. If any of them did they’d kill her, her whole family, probably all of Summer Haven, and that’d be the end of it. As the hours passed nothing moved beneath the destruction. The sun was high in the sky, the embers cooling, as she turned and walked away. She kept to the shade, though on such an overcast day the sun wouldn’t bother her that much. Her smile was back. She was going home. She was safe. Her family was safe. It was a great day though it had begun to rain and, suddenly, even though she was free of the vampires, she found she still couldn’t transport herself anywhere. She tried over and over, but couldn’t. It didn’t matter. Perhaps it was weariness. Lack of blood. Didn’t matter. Because she’d won. She was free. She could finally and at long last go home. Sometime later she came up to a modest brick house and knocking at the door, asked the old woman who answered if she could make a phone call. The old woman, white hair haphazardly piled on her skinny head, and dressed in a baggy housedress that had seen better days, was distrustful of strangers at first but Jenny reassured her with her thoughts and the woman let her in. Jenny called Joey and asked him to come and get her. She didn’t have to ask twice. She was going home to her children.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 Jenny Jenny had been patiently waiting. If she wanted to defeat the vampires she’d have to discover their weakness and use it against them. She was stronger every day, learning new things, still hiding them. Soon she’d be ready. All she had to do was have an opportunity and she was working on that. For some reason, she found she couldn’t blink herself away. Couldn’t transport like the day she’d first escaped them. It’d only been the one time, though. As if being with them, or Dante, kept her tethered. She never knew if it was on purpose. If Dante knew she could do it and prevented her or if there was some other reason. If he could do it. Yet she never saw any of them transport to another place in an instant as she’d done. They could travel swiftly, but not in the blink of an eye. It was a mystery. Strange. Though almost from the beginning, after a small rebellion or two to make it look good, she mimicked their habits and tried to get them to believe she was becoming one of them. Make them think she enjoyed slaying people and drinking their blood, enjoyed basking in her new existence. They had no idea, though, how powerful she was becoming. No idea. And she fought to keep it that way. Zebulon, for a reason she couldn’t understand, was not unkind to her. He gave her clean clothes when hers became filthy and torn. He was the one who provided her with a traveling bag to put her necessities in. A brush and shampoo for her hair, a toothbrush and toothpaste. A razor and shaving cream. Things she needed. Playing along was the only way she could survive. It wasn’t easy because they were so vicious and merciless to their victims. She was becoming a pretty darn good actress. The other two, Aloysius and Balthazar, she’d come to believe, were both shadows, mindless automatons that followed Dante’s orders without question and had little, to her knowledge anyway, personality of their own. They both had the silverish hair and black glittering eyes. Both were at least seven feet tall. Staring up at them, as with Dante, she felt like a Hobbit. All three towered over her. No wonder they thought they were gods. Aloysius, when he wasn’t killing was a morosely quiet one who didn’t seem to notice she was there most of the time. All he cared about was the hunt and the blood. He hadn’t said one word to her the entire time she’d been with them, other than to snap or snarl at her. He was truly an enigma; one she didn’t ever want to get to know better. At times, she wondered if there wasn’t something else really wrong with him besides being a bloodsucking monster. Maybe Dante had driven him totally insane. Wouldn’t surprise her. Balthazar, on the other hand, was the heaviest and tallest of the three, by a few inches at least, and talked, with barely any accent at all, incessantly. Just not to her, as he let her know constantly, who was beneath him. He chatted away at his victims as he tormented and eventually killed them. He yakked away to imaginary people all the time, too. Jenny came to believe he was as crazy as Aloysius. If the creatures they were could be crazy. Maybe they were all like that in the place they came from. He played word games with his make-believe friends, as well, and he always won. He read invisible books to them. Sounded like gobbledygook to her. His eyes, unlike Dante’s, weren’t empty. Just demented. Jenny steered clear of Balthazar as much as she could. Dante, on the other hand, haunted her every move. Ceaselessly observed her. His grand experiment. His little trained pet. She was so careful around him. At times she read his mind and she overheard that he didn’t trust her. Often she’d direct a trivial thought at him like pick up that rock on the ground before him or go out that door he just came in and he’d do it without comprehending he had, and then slowly her suggestions grew more important. Then she started in on the others. Each time one of them obeyed her without knowing they had she concealed a smile. She had a plan and she was working her way towards it. For the first time in a long time she had hope. But it would take a long time, she knew that. A long time. She’d have to be patient. So patient. And the days. The weeks went by. And she grew stronger. *** The storm drove them to find shelter for the night. Dante didn’t like getting wet. The house they’d broken into was in a part of Florida she wasn’t familiar with. The southern tip on the ocean. For weeks the four of them had followed Dante further and further away from Summer Haven and she’d been relieved.

It won’t be long, I promise. I’ll find a way to get home to you. I’ll find a way for us to be together and safe again. “Don’t get too comfortable,” Zebulon’s voice broke into her reverie. “Dante wants to go out as soon as it gets dark.” He was behind her one moment and when she twisted her neck to say something, he was gone. He did that a lot. Letting her know what was going on but not sticking around to talk much afterwards. He was afraid of their leader. They all were.

It was always the same. “Toss the bodies out in the back yard,” she heard him say. “I don’t want to look at them. Stupid humans. That’ll teach them to think they can fight us.” More laughter. “They really thought a gun could hurt us. Ha! Nothing can. When will these sheep learn?” Her head drooped, her body tensed, and she struggled with the familiar rage as it welled up inside her. She loathed her wardens with every inch of her heart and soul. She had to find a way to get rid of them. Get away.

The rain hadn’t let up and the kids couldn’t see the road well enough to drive so they’d pulled over. The car’s windows were foggy and the rain sliced around the white Blazer as the nearby trees swayed in the heavy wind. A perfect night for evil. A bad night for innocence. As the other nights Zebulon covered for her and she drank the blood from the dead girl. But Dante caught them and went into a rage. He grabbed the boy, the last one alive, and pushed him at her. “You drink and end him. Right now. Or you die.” The others were observing with coldness hidden behind their secretive faces. Zebulon was a stone statue. He couldn’t help her. Lightning illuminated the area around the car, the surrounding woods, and the terror on the boy’s face. He looked like Teddy. About the same age or a little older. His pale hair fell across his flushed face, his brown eyes were pleading for pity. For mercy. He’d seen his sisters–because that’s what they’d turned out to be–die in front of him. His sobs tore her shriveling heart apart. “Do it now!” Dante, at her side, painfully twisted her neck, forcing her mouth towards the boy’s neck. “Or you’ll die and I’ll go back and get those mewling kids of yours and that brother, his wife and your friend. And I’ll make sure they suffer so much before they die.” At that moment Jenny wished he’d just end her existence. She couldn’t slaughter the boy. But when Dante threatened to hurt her children, those she loved, her fury, a red-hot fire in her gut, exploded. She flung her mind at him and then her fists and he went down at her feet. He went down. By her strength of will alone. Her victory was short lived. He regained control, his lethal eyes flashing, and rose from the ground to face her. The other vampires, once they’d stopped gawking in shock, grabbed and held her. “You’re getting braver, Mutant. Stronger. I underestimated you and won’t do that again. Experiment over. I don’t need the trouble you bring. I’ve learned what I wanted to know. I don’t need you. Not anymore. Perhaps it’s time for you to go.” His hands closed around her neck. She felt herself lifted into the air. Her feet swinging. This could be it, she thought. End of the road. She wondered what death would be like and closed her eyes. Through the rain and storm noises a siren screeched, coming their way. Flickering crimson lights cut through the night and beamed across the wet tree trunks. Before the teenagers had been pulled from the car, one of them had called the cops. Of course. Teenagers had cell phones. It was time to leave. Swearing, Dante dropped her, spun around and snapped the boy’s neck. The body crumpled into the muddy grass. Jenny shrieked and threw herself at Dante but Zebulon stepped between them and drug her away, his whisper a hiss, “Don’t be stupid. You can’t beat him. Think of your children.” She collapsed in his arms. He was right, and it made her feel worse. She might have been able to beat Dante, him alone, but there were the other three. Might wasn’t good enough. She had to be sure before she tried again. Prepared. She had to have her plan to wipe them out in place first and foolproof. Or her family would never be safe. She had to exterminate all of them. Yes, even Zebulon. Though he’d shown her less malice, he was still a heartless killer. The five of them sped away through the night trees. When they arrived at the house they’d procured for the night Dante locked her in the cellar as punishment. He seemed to have forgotten her death sentence. “If I can’t trust you to behave. Perhaps a few days alone in the dark without sustenance will change your mind.” He dropped the piece of wood into the slots on the outside of the door, imprisoning her. Jenny was relieved to be alone. She’d felt a new strength course through her body as she’d attacked Dante and knew soon she’d be able to defeat him. It was good Zebulon had stopped her. She could have overpowered Dante but not all four of them at once. She would have lost. And they’d still be alive to continue their killing sprees. To kill Teddy and Sarah and anyone else they wanted. She needed to be smarter than them. Think. More than anything, as she’d seen that boy die she knew she wanted, needed, to go home to her children. More than anything. To protect them always against monsters like those who’d taken her. On the other hand, she burned to be free of them and wanted them gone forever in the worst way. Huddled in a corner of the cellar, horrified at what the vampires were probably doing out beyond the moldy walls–what if they were off rounding up her children or killing them, right now–and afraid of what was going to happen to her, she suddenly knew how to do it. Zebulon had let slip the first few days she’d been with them something about the only thing that could kill them was beheading or fire. She’d paid attention. She’d remembered. Once her eyes had adjusted to the dark she looked around. She was in an old fashioned concrete-walled cellar. A large one, but still a cellar. If she could lure the four into a place like this, lock them in and torch the house above and around it…she could destroy them. Why not this cellar? The locks on the outside door were strong as were the walls. No windows. She pulled herself to her feet and explored with hands and fingers. Her sight, when she concentrated, clearing up so she could almost see everything through a red haze. A large can of gasoline was stashed in a corner. A box of rags and a pile of covers were in another. Wooden shelves lined the walls. More than enough gas. More than enough fodder to burn. She found a box of matches on a concrete ledge next to the shelves. Shelves that were chock full of junk and would go up like dry kindling if touched by fire. In fact, the cellar was a hoarders dream. It’d make a great blazing bonfire. If she could keep them from getting out of it before the flames could do their work. There was another room, again with no windows, in the rear with a heavy metal door that had a huge padlock on the outside…even better. If she could lure them into it but keep herself outside, her plan could work. Conceivably. The house was made of and shingled in wood. Just a tinder box waiting to burst into flames. Why not now? Here? Why not? She’d been perfecting her mind control over the four vampires for weeks. Each time getting more and more domination over them. She’d wanted to gain more, but now there wasn’t time. In her heart, she knew she had to strike now. She’d had a premonition that the four were planning something really terrible. Soon. The time to destroy them was now. She thought of a way to entrap them, prayed it would work, and after preparing things around her, forced herself to sleep so she’d be ready. All her strength, her guile and her new abilities would be needed to pull off her plan. Waking from the noise of the vampires’ return, she moved to the other side of her prison closer to the main exit and waited. Upstairs she heard them fighting. Yelling at each other. Scuffling. They did that often. Dissention in the ranks, she supposed. Or their hunt hadn’t gone well. Their appetite unsatisfied. They were still hungry. Which would be even better for her. When they were hungry they weren’t as vigilant. Or as cautious. This is a crazy idea, she told herself. Crazy. No way could it work. But she was going to do it anyway. She couldn’t be with them one more day, one more minute. Something horrendous was about to happen. Maybe they were going to hit a school or a crowd of people at a mall. Whatever it was, it’d be really, really bad. This must work or she would die. And she no longer cared if she did. Taking the chance of ridding the world of them was worth it. As she’d come to believe, as long as she was with them, their prisoner, her family would be in danger. They and she’d never be free. Concentrating with everything she had, she sent a silent call to Dante and the others to come downstairs. Her mind strained, lulled and tugged at theirs. Every ounce of her strength, all her desperation, was put into it. Come to the cellar…there are humans hiding in the room at the back…fresh victims…fresh blood…down here. Come. And they did. All four of them. Her cage opened. “We think someone’s hiding down here.” Dante’s voice was strangely toneless. His eyes a little glassy. He looked at her but didn’t see her as he walked past to the small room on the other side of the cellar. She faked being weak. Uncaring. Lying against the wall by the door, lethargic. No threat at all. “Yes, we heard something,” he muttered after glancing and seeing the sorry state she was in. Satisfied she wasn’t capable of causing any trouble, his back turned to her and his hand went to the handle of the metal door. “Yes, I heard it, too. I think there are children,” she closed her eyes tightly for a moment as she pushed the thoughts and the words out, “hiding in a corner of that room behind the door. Three or more. I heard them crying. If not for me they would have come out and escaped. I’ve made sure they didn’t. I’ve saved them for you.” “Children? Hiding in here?” Dante repeated. His hand was turning the handle. Opening the door. It was a black pit inside. She pushed at Dante’s and the others’ minds again. Hard. Harder. Straining every fiber of her being. Using every trace she had left of her fading humanity and her new powers. Children. Fresh blood. Go inside and look in the far corner. You’re sooo hungry. Their blood is so sweet. Zebulon and Balthazar had caught up with Dante, their faces eager, their eyes slack. Shoulders hunched. Stooping down because of their height, they crowded in behind him and peered into the dark space. Aloysius was the only one who seemed suspicious. He lagged behind the others, his inhuman eyes on her. He halted before her, glared at her, but she gave one stronger mind push and like a reluctant lemming he followed after the others. It was working. She got up from the floor, picked up the gas can and slipped the matches out of her pocket. Making sure she kept her mind as vacant as possible to what she was doing, she went on tiptoes towards the vampires. If any of them suspected, the game would be over. She’d strewn rags and blankets all around, framing the metal door. Stealthily her body edged towards the smaller room. The vampires had entered it. She moved to the door and, as quietly as she could, closed it. Turned the key she’d found on a shelf and locked it. Her heart was beating so loud she thought she was having a heart attack. Hurry now! Before they sensed her true intention. Before they awoke from her mind control. She couldn’t believe it had worked. Stay. Stay. All is well, she told them. Rest. She sprinkled gas over everything in wide swathes and wildly threw lit matches as she backed out of the cellar. The fire, a hungry beast, took hold and the room blazed into hell. There. Done! She heard nothing, not a sound from the vampires inside. She didn’t know what they were doing in there, but she didn’t care. It was time for her to go. Stay. You are tired. Sleep. Sleep. Sprinting out the cellar door, she swung around with trembling hands and dropped the thick wooden beam down into the latches, locking the main exit from the outside. There were no sounds, no thoughts she could detect in the cellar or behind the metal door. She blocked her thoughts. Theirs. And waited. There were only the shrieks of the fire and its all-consuming flames. She only then let herself imagine the vampires realizing what she’d done. How she’d trapped and beaten them. How she, their powerless little mutant, had bested them. She imagined them yelling and raging at her to let them out…and then she imagined them screaming in shock and agony as they burned to cinders. Gone forever! For the first time in months Jenny smiled. She’d done it. It’d almost been too easy. As dawn tinged the horizon on another gray day she lingered outside beneath the shade of a towering tree and watched the house burn. The cellar and the lower floors went first and then the upper floor. The accelerant helped it go quickly and completely. Inside she cheered, but also prayed that the vampires couldn’t, wouldn’t get out. And that no one called the fire department before the building was reduced to ashes. No one did. It was an isolated house. Far from a town. The structure was soon a smoldering pile of fiery embers, a sea of flattened burnt wood. One big charcoal pit. She heard nothing from inside it. No voices, no thoughts. Just blessed silence. The vampires–even Dante–were no longer there. Her back slid down against the tree trunk, the release draining everything from her, and remained there for hours. Waiting. Watching. She had to be sure none of them had survived. If any of them did they’d kill her, her whole family, probably all of Summer Haven, and that’d be the end of it. As the hours passed nothing moved beneath the destruction. The sun was high in the sky, the embers cooling, as she turned and walked away. She kept to the shade, though on such an overcast day the sun wouldn’t bother her that much. Her smile was back. She was going home. She was safe. Her family was safe. It was a great day though it had begun to rain and, suddenly, even though she was free of the vampires, she found she still couldn’t transport herself anywhere. She tried over and over, but couldn’t. It didn’t matter. Perhaps it was weariness. Lack of blood. Didn’t matter. Because she’d won. She was free. She could finally and at long last go home. Sometime later she came up to a modest brick house and knocking at the door, asked the old woman who answered if she could make a phone call. The old woman, white hair haphazardly piled on her skinny head, and dressed in a baggy housedress that had seen better days, was distrustful of strangers at first but Jenny reassured her with her thoughts and the woman let her in. Jenny called Joey and asked him to come and get her. She didn’t have to ask twice. She was going home to her children.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 Jenny She told her story to Joey on the return drive to Summer Haven. He was so choked up with joy and relief that they had her back, unharmed, there were tears in his eyes and he hadn’t stopped smiling and looking at her. “I can’t believe you’re okay,” he said over and over. “I’d begun to think the worst. We all did. We didn’t hear from you. We were all so scared.” “Oh, there were times I didn’t think I’d make it, either. I lived minute to minute. I guess fate had something else in store for me. It gave me my life back.” He caught her up on Teddy and Sarah. She’d been surprised to hear that Andy had stepped in and helped with them. Let them live with him. But she was grateful. It was awkward at first, she had the feeling Joey was unsure of her, frightened, even. “No, brother, I haven’t turned into a sadistic bloodthirsty murderer even though I was their captive for a long time. If anything, Joey,” she’d whispered and laid a hand on his arm, “I found out just how different I was from them. Never having ever been human maybe they had no scruples, compassion or pity to begin with. They wallowed in being cruel. In tormenting their victims. I’m not like that, thank God. I don’t know why, but I’m not. In some ways the experience has helped me come to terms with what I’ve become. I know now that I’m not a monster. “And in the end I was stronger than them. Or strong enough to lure them into a trap and spring it. Damn lucky, too, I’d say. Being locked in that cellar the way I was; it having no windows, that inner room and all that flammable material lying around. I saw my chance and took it.” She rocked her head gently from side to side, trying not to remember the depraved things she’d witnessed. Been a part of. She had to always remember…it’d been against her will. “You sure they’re dead?” Joey asked for the fifth time. A niggling doubt taunted her deep inside somewhere but she ignored it. “I’m sure. I doused that house with gasoline, torched it, and didn’t leave until there was nothing left but a pile of smoldering rubble. If they’d survived it I would have known. They weren’t the forgiving kind. I’d be dead instead of them. “And I didn’t hear them in my head afterwards. I don’t hear them now.” “That’s good then, huh?” He grinned widely at her again. His eyes full of relief. “It is.” “Hey, Sis, what’s with all the silver in your hair? Makes you look scary weird.” She reached up and touched the unruly strands. “My new look.” Then she grinned back at him. “I’ll dye it as soon as I get home. Don’t want to scare the kids.” “Yeah.” After Joey had picked her up and made sure she was okay he’d used his cell phone to call Andy. Told him the good news and asked him to take the children to the farmhouse. “We should be there in about four hours.” She listened to the conversation and found she could hear Andy clearly on the other end. He was ecstatic she was okay and coming home. He said he’d have pizzas waiting at the farmhouse for everyone when they got there. Of course, he didn’t know she wouldn’t be able to eat them. He, as everyone else besides Joey, still thought she’d been abducted by bad humans. Joey telephoned his wife. She was closing the diner for the day and was coming for the celebration, too. Jenny couldn’t wait to get home. The trip seemed to last forever. When finally there she couldn’t stop hugging and kissing Teddy and Sarah, so thrilled to be with them again; they so happy to have her back. Amadeus, who hadn’t grown an inch she thought, leapt into her arms and started licking her face, meowing. She could have sworn the cat was saying missed you, missed you. Everyone was crying, except her, everyone was happy. Relieved beyond measure. The nightmare was over. She’d miraculously escaped from her kidnappers and was home. Safe. Hallelujah. Being home again was a euphoric dream. In the farmhouse with its homey comforts, her family and friends around her again, the vampires and the threat that had been tormenting her gone forever, she felt herself come alive again. Hope was rekindled. She could go on with her life. She’d cherish it more because she’d been so close to losing it all. Nothing made a person appreciate what they had more than that. “Don’t ever leave us again, Mom,” Sarah cried when she first threw her small body into her arms. “I missed you so bad!” The child wept as Jenny stroked her head and held her close. It felt good to have her baby in her embrace. The world was right again. Teddy held back for a moment, as if he couldn’t believe his eyes, and then he, too, ran up and clamped his arms around her. “Mom, I thought I’d never see you again.” He tried to hide his tears but when he pulled away she saw them glistening on his cheeks. “I love you,” he breathed soft and low; red faced. It was the best present he could have given her. Andy, when he saw her, wrapped his arms around her and kissed her. On the lips. She was so startled she didn’t know what to say. There it was in the softness of his kiss. In his gaze and in the smile on his face. Joy and relief. The beginning of love. Joey was right. Andy did have deep feelings for her. His love was just another complication as far as she was concerned but she was so grateful to be home nothing else mattered. They were sitting at Jenny’s kitchen table. Jenny, Teddy, Sarah, Joey, Laurie and Andy. It was late afternoon. The day still overcast. But the light coming in the windows was a soft shade of rose. Pizza boxes littered the table. Some were empty. “I never gave up believing you were alive, Jenny,” Andy was saying. “None of us did. That you’d be home again. And here you are. Safe and sound. It’s almost unbelievable. A miracle really. Can you talk about it?” His words were hesitant. She put her hands up, glancing at the others in turn. “All of you want to know what happened to me all these weeks? What I went through? Who took me and why? How I escaped?” Andy had an expectant expression on his face. Joey had a worried one on his. She was careful with what she said next because her children, all wide eyes and sharp ears, were listening, too. “Are we still in danger?” Teddy asked in a low voice. “Are those men who took us, took you, still out there?” She shook her head. “No. And they were the same men that have been taking the people around here.” She didn’t tell her son they also killed them. He didn’t need to know that. She wasn’t about to confess what had actually happened to her so she spun out the cover lie she’d created on the ride home. “They broke into the house. I guess looking for food, money, guns or something. They knew the police were looking for them and wanted, I guess, some hostages for protection. I convinced them to take me instead of you children. They didn’t kill me. Seems one of them was a fan of my books.” She laughed softly, as if it were an inside joke. She looked at Andy now. “So I was a curiosity to them. A celebrity. Maybe they thought they could get money for me. Ha. I told them I wasn’t worth a dime. Most authors aren’t.” “At first they fought among themselves as to what to do with me. Then I persuaded them into letting me chronicle their lives and it kept me alive. Flattery works even with criminals. The chance to be famous, to be written about, is a strong bait. “I learned their habits, pretended to take notes for a book about them, waited for my chance, and when it came, a moment when their guard was down, I flew the coop. I called the cops on them. We don’t have to be afraid any longer. I know what they look like. Who they are. They’d been planning to disappear from the area, flee to Canada, I think, and when I escaped I’m sure they took off. They’re long gone.” Her story was full of holes, and she was aware of how skeptical Andy and Laurie seemed by it, but they were so thankful to have her home they didn’t challenge what she said. “Anything else, right now, I don’t want to talk about.” They accepted her reticence as a sign of trauma; her fragile state of body and mind, like her silvered hair, which only Sarah had the nerve to inquire about. Jenny told her fright had done it, but she’d fix it tomorrow. Sarah accepted that explanation with an innocence only a child could have. “Mom, they were strange men, though, weren’t they?” Sarah asked suddenly. “They were giants. They moved faster than the wind. They had sharp teeth, too.” Jenny, her heart jumping, was quick to explain. “Well, they were tall. They could run fast, too.” “They was giants,” her daughter repeated. Teddy, his eyes lowered, said nothing. Jenny wondered how much he remembered about the men who’d taken them, but the boy didn’t add anything to what his sister had said and she was glad of that. Andy was already staring at her in an odd way. “There’s more, isn’t there?” Andy whispered, sidling up beside her, when she went to pour a cup of coffee. Earlier in the day, while she’d made her way through the woods to find a telephone to call Joey, she’d fed on small animals. Good thing, or she’d be starving about now. And Andy would be looking like a good snack. “I can’t talk about it, Andy. Not yet. It’s too difficult.” And it was. But not for the reasons she was trying to convince Andy of. She hated lying. Too much had happened too fast. She needed time to let everything soak in. Needed time to organize her thoughts. Get her story straight. Recharge. Truly realize she was safe and home. “Well, I’m here when you want to talk,” Andy said in a soft voice. “Anytime. I won’t judge, either. You saved your children’s lives. In the end, saved your own life. I’m sure you did what you had to to survive. I admire you for that. In my eyes you’re a resourceful, valiant woman.” “Thank you, Andy.” She hadn’t been able to meet his eyes. “And thank you for taking care of Teddy and Sarah like you did. I don’t know how I’m going to repay you.” “I wanted to help. It was a pleasure and we became great friends. It was nice having someone other than myself to care about. Got my mind off my problems.” “You did more than most friends would have done. You put off your own life to help my kids. You’re a good man, Andy.” He gently ran his hand down the side of her face and she tried not to flinch. “I’m glad you think that. It made everything worthwhile then.” After all the catching up was finished, Joey took her aside into the living room. Amadeus followed and climbed up one leg of her jeans. She caught the kitten under its skinny belly and kissed it on its little face. “Detective Bradley’s coming over later this evening. I thought I’d warn you.” “I thought he went back to St. Louis?” “He did. Soon as I heard from you this morning I called him and let him know you were free. He said he wanted to speak to you in person and was catching the next flight out.” She groaned. “He couldn’t wait until tomorrow? I’ve had an awful time of it. I was hoping for a quiet night alone with my kids after I got rid of the company.” Her brother laughed, lounging against the wall in the front room. The sun was setting and there were shadows everywhere. “Nah, you’re not getting rid of us that quick. It’s a party. You’re lucky we haven’t alerted everyone in town yet or you’d have an enormous crowd here. We thought we’d wait until tomorrow for that. “I also called Chief Donald. I imagine he’ll be here soon. He wants to talk to you, too.” “I bet he does.” “The news media will be here as soon as they get wind of your return. I didn’t call them but I’m sure someone will leak the news sooner or later.” “Aaaah…better later,” she moaned. “Or never.” “You don’t have to talk to them. Just lock the doors and don’t answer. Give me a written statement and I’ll make it for you. No muss, no fuss.” “Thanks, Joey. I’ll probably do that.” She was tired, more of the mind than the body, but she was okay. Her nightmare was over. She was free. Home with her children. Suddenly the wonder of it all made her giddy. She didn’t even care that Chief Donald and Detective Bradley were on their way. Joey was right. It was a party. She could stay awake all night. “The detective knows about the vampires,” Joey let the cat out of the bag. “You can tell him what really happened during your abduction, but what are you going to say to Chief Donald?” “I’ve been thinking about that. I’ll figure out something. The vampires are gone, the murders will stop. The cops will fade out of the picture. All will end well. In time it’ll be yesterday’s news and the Chief’s interest will go somewhere else. I’ll just play for time.” The kids came into the room and pulled her back into the kitchen with Andy and Laurie. They didn’t want her out of their sight for long. Chief Donald knocked on the door as they were eating the last of the pizza and Joey invited him in. Sitting at the table with the rest of them, Jenny gave him the same yarn, more or less, she’d given Andy, the children and Laurie. He listened, nodding, and didn’t say anything until she was done. “So that’s your story, huh?” His face was emotionless but she thought she detected a hint of cynicism. “They butchered all their victims around here but are now no longer a threat because they’ve vamoosed up to Canada? They kidnapped you, let you live because you’re an author, and you got away from them? Unhurt?” “That’s the story.” She thought he was going to say something else but he didn’t. He looked at Joey, who was twiddling his thumbs across the table, and released a large sigh. Closed his notebook. “Is that all, Chief Donald?” she asked, yawning. Acting exhausted so he’d get the clue. “For now. I’ll send a sketch artist out tomorrow to draw up likenesses. The F.B.I. could come out eventually and question you. Now that other states, another country is involved. You sure you don’t want to visit the hospital; have them check you out? I’d feel better if you did.” Her breath caught. “No. I’ve had more than enough hospital time. Whatever happened to me during my abduction, I’m dealing with it. I just want to get some rest. Be with my family. Go back to work and resume my life. Normalcy. That’s all I need to be myself again.” “Okay. It’s your call. You look and sound sane to me.” An authentic grin graced his face and even more surprising, he got up and gave her a quick hug. “I’m real happy you’re okay. Your kids, your brother, were a basket case. Andy wasn’t much better.” He sent a sidelong glance at him. Andy nodded back, all serious. “Everyone in town was praying for you,” Chief Donald told her. He must have had a hard day, his uniform was wrinkled and there were dirt stains on his pants. “There’s going to be a lot of relieved people when they hear the good news. I’m sure by tomorrow morning it’ll be all the buzz at your brother’s diner. The entire town will know soon after. Expect lots of congratulatory telephone calls and spontaneous amiable meetings on the streets. Some may even find themselves at your door with homemade goodies for you and your family. You’ve been the talk of the town for weeks.” After she ushered the police officer from the house and closed the door she looked at Joey, who’d followed them. She could hear the others talking in the kitchen. Laurie was laughing. Sarah was singing some silly song along with Andy. “I don’t think he believed a word of what I said, but he sure seemed happy that I made it out alive. Sweet of him.” “It is. I guess with age we’re all getting nicer. Even Rusty Donald.” In the kitchen she announced, “I’m exhausted. Party’s over. Time for everyone to go home. Come back tomorrow.” They griped some but got up to leave. “Come on by for breakfast everyone,” Laurie offered. “At the diner. On the house.” “Thanks Laurie,” Jenny said. The next day was Saturday. “If I’m up to it I just might take you up on that. But not too early.” “No, not too early. For you we’ll make breakfast anytime.” “Thanks.” “I’ll drop Laurie at home and come back.” Joey was looking at her. Laurie’s attention was taken by saying goodnight to the kids. “Joey, you don’t have to stick around any longer if you’re tired. It’s after eleven. It’s been a long day for both of us. Go on home with your wife.” “You sure?” He spoke so the others couldn’t hear. “Detective Bradley is the next spirit to appear to you tonight, Scrooge.” A ghost of a chuckle. “Sure you can handle him alone?” “Oh, he’s the easy one. I can tell him the truth, mostly, and not have to lie my ass off.” “That you can.” Her brother stretched, yawned. “You know, I am bushed. Worrying for weeks and driving all day does that to me. I think I will go home with Laurie” “Then go.” She watched him and his wife drive off in his truck. Andy was the last to go. She could tell he really wanted to stay and talk more but she used her exhaustion as an excuse. “Another time, Andy. I appreciate all you’ve done. The kids and all. But right now I really need time with them and rest. My own bed. I’m so tired. Tommorow?” He accepted that and left with a gentle smile, saying, “But when you want to talk, be it anytime day or night. I’m here. Don’t forget that.” There was something in the way he looked at her that tipped her off that he suspected there was more to the story she’d given everyone and he knew it. “I won’t forget.” Then she gently closed the door behind him and rejoined her kids. The house was silent and as welcome as an old fluffy robe. The night dark and no longer filled with monsters she was afraid of. She’d defeated them. Later that night, in her children’s bedrooms she stroked their warm foreheads and brushed the hair from their sleeping faces. Laid soft kisses on their cheeks and smiled as they stirred in their sleep. Her heart was content for the first time in a long while. She didn’t care that she was a vampire, she could deal with it, but to be with her children again and to know they were alive and safe was the sweetest feeling she’d ever known. “I’m never going to leave you again. Wild horses couldn’t drag me away. I promise,” she whispered to each of them before going downstairs to wait for the detective. She drifted into a peaceful sleep on the couch with the kitten, a ball of warm fur, curled on her lap. Its purr rumbled in the quiet house until it fell asleep. Jenny had no dreams. Just heavenly guilt-free, horror-free rest. She was home. She. Was. Safe. Bradley arrived two hours later. She woke to the knocking at the door and let him in. He stepped inside and gave her a huge hug. “How was your flight?” “Bumpy. There was a storm over Missouri. But I made it. I’m here.” The cat hissed at the intruder, tiny back up and fur sticking out like a porcupine, protecting its mistress. “Amadeus, behave yourself. You remember Detective Bradley.” Jenny scooped the cat up in her hands and put it on the couch behind her where it continued to protest. Sounded more like a mouse growling. The detective looked at her. “You’re one damn lucky woman, Jenny Sanders. You lived through that attack in St. Louis and now you’ve survived captivity with the monsters who took you.” “I’m damn lucky, yes,” she responded with a wan smile. He wasn’t fooled. “What did you do? How did you beat them? Escape?” Though the detective believed in the vampires, she hoped he hadn’t guessed the truth about her being one. Though at times, she wondered if he suspected something, too. He stared intently at her, waiting for…what she didn’t know. His thoughts were unreadable. Perhaps his will was a wall she couldn’t break through. She was beginning to understand there were some people whose minds she couldn’t breach and she didn’t know why. Apparently he was sometimes one of them. “Were they the ones who killed your husband? Were they really vampires?” he asked. She nodded. “And more. You have no idea. Come on in and I’ll tell you all about it and them.” She warmed up leftover pizza and coffee for him. They had the conversation. The story, ninety-five percent truth, was different from the one she’d told everyone else but Joey. Bradley thought she’d trapped and burned the vampires utilizing just normal human cunning. And luck. The story worked or so she hoped. “So the vampires–God, I still have a hard time saying that–let you trick and lock them in a cellar and burn it down around their ears? Just like that?” “Well, yes. But as I said, I was unbelievably lucky.” “How did you get them into the cellar?” “I’d convinced them I wouldn’t betray them or run away. I couldn’t escape without knowing they were no longer a danger to my family. I told them there were humans hiding down in the cellar. That I’d heard them. Children. “They hadn’t fed yet, couldn’t wait to see for themselves and filed into the room easy as you please. I slammed the door and bolted it behind them. I couldn’t believe they fell for it. I didn’t hang around. I set the place on fire with gasoline I’d found down there. Once outside I watched the place burn down to the ground. I went to a neighboring house to call the fire department. I made sure the fire had done its damage first. Made sure the vampires were destroyed.” “Pretty clever of you. So that by the time the firefighters showed up it was all over?” “Yep.” Detective Bradley scratched his day old beard. “Not that they didn’t deserve it. I know, for you, it was the only way. But I would have liked to have captured at least one of them for interrogation. Study. Hell, just to see for myself what a vampire really looks and acts like.” “Might have gotten yourself killed and a bunch of others, too. You still want undeniable proof.” He nodded. “You got me there. I mean, I believe vampires exist but there’s a tiny part of me that’s still a skeptic. I need to be sure.” Inwardly she sighed. “I know the feeling. I’m sorry. I had no choice. Destroying them was more important than coming back with a live specimen.” Her voice fell to a whisper. “They were killing every night and were as volatile as nitroglycerin. I was terrified for my own life every second. I had to do what I did the way I did it.” His gaze returned to her and his voice was resigned. “Don’t be sorry. You did the right thing. They were monsters. Who are we fooling? I’ve seen the crime scenes. No jail cell or police force I know of could have contained them. If what I suspect was true, the powers they had, no natural way any human could have dealt with them. You did us a huge favor. “Are you sure they’re dead?” “Very. There was nothing left but ashes.” “Then it’s finally over.” Reclining in his chair, his hands gathered up his notebook and pen. There was weariness in his every move. Tonight he looked old. “Feels like I’ve been chasing these creatures forever. I can’t believe it’s over. Thank God.” Five years, she thought, since his daughter’s death. Yes, it would seem like forever. “I’ll be traveling down there to examine the burnt building. I won’t have peace of mind until I can find what’s left of them.” “Their remains?” That puzzled her. “Yes.” “Won’t be any. One of them once told me when they die they don’t leave anything behind. Not even melted flesh or bone fragments. Just ashy residue. Nothing you can connect to a once living being.” “You know that, also, do you, from the last time you crispy-crittered that gang of them in the theater?” She almost laughed, but didn’t. “I do.” “Ah. Well, I’m going down there to see for myself anyway. Can you draw me a simple map of where the house is and where the cellar was located?” “I can do that.” They talked a little longer. She drew him the map and described where the cellar’s inner room had been. “I know you’ve been through an ordeal so I’ll get out of here and leave you alone. And Jenny, if I didn’t say it before, I’ll say it now. I’m overjoyed you got away alive. So grateful those monsters are gone. I can’t thank you enough. My daughter can finally rest in peace.” “My husband and all the others that died by their hands, as well.” For the second time he wrapped her in a bear hug. Somewhere along the way they’d become friends. It was nice to have someone else on her and Joey’s side. Someone else who believed in what they knew to be true. She wished she could trust him enough to tell him she was infected. Oh well. “You driving down there right now?” “I am. Get it done. I’ll swing by here one last time and see how you’re doing before I fly back to St. Louis. I’ve already taken too many days off. I can’t afford to lose my job. Not with jobs the way they are these days.” “I know. I’m thankful my job’s waiting for me. Joey said he’d talked to my boss and I can come back any time I want. He didn’t replace me.” “Nice boss.” “He is. Like the rest of the town. They’ve been good to my children and me. Joey says there’s a party tomorrow at the diner. The whole town, no doubt, will be there.” She feigned irritation. “I suppose there’ll be plenty of questions for me to answer. Oh, boy.” “I’ll hurry back then.” He smiled as he got up from the table. “After weeks eating there most every day I’ve become addicted to your brother’s food. There going to be cake?” “Most likely.” She laughed and walked him to the door. “Good night.” “Good night, lucky lady.” Out in the dark, as his rented car puttered down the ribbon of road, it was no more than flashes that at first caught her eye, a line of small luminous orbs that skittered around the corner of the house towards the backyard so rapidly she immediately doubted she’d seen them. But she had. Her eyesight was really good these days. What were they? She ran through the house and out into the yard behind it, her eyes searching. There was nothing. Whatever they’d been they were gone. An uneasy certainty blossomed in the pit of her stomach. Ghosts. They were ghosts. She remembered what the librarian had told her. The girl at the store. She remembered the rumors about the farmhouse being haunted. The sightings. She was too sleepy to fret over it on top of all she’d been through. She’d worry tomorrow, as she’d feed tomorrow. Right before dawn before the kids got up. Vampire or not, her bed embraced her like a cloud. Her room was heaven. She fell asleep. No dreams. Not a one. And that was a good thing. She felt as if she’d been released from hell and her freedom, being with her children again, was sweeter than anything she’d ever tasted. Anything she ever would.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 Jenny She told her story to Joey on the return drive to Summer Haven. He was so choked up with joy and relief that they had her back, unharmed, there were tears in his eyes and he hadn’t stopped smiling and looking at her. “I can’t believe you’re okay,” he said over and over. “I’d begun to think the worst. We all did. We didn’t hear from you. We were all so scared.” “Oh, there were times I didn’t think I’d make it, either. I lived minute to minute. I guess fate had something else in store for me. It gave me my life back.” He caught her up on Teddy and Sarah. She’d been surprised to hear that Andy had stepped in and helped with them. Let them live with him. But she was grateful. It was awkward at first, she had the feeling Joey was unsure of her, frightened, even. “No, brother, I haven’t turned into a sadistic bloodthirsty murderer even though I was their captive for a long time. If anything, Joey,” she’d whispered and laid a hand on his arm, “I found out just how different I was from them. Never having ever been human maybe they had no scruples, compassion or pity to begin with. They wallowed in being cruel. In tormenting their victims. I’m not like that, thank God. I don’t know why, but I’m not. In some ways the experience has helped me come to terms with what I’ve become. I know now that I’m not a monster. “And in the end I was stronger than them. Or strong enough to lure them into a trap and spring it. Damn lucky, too, I’d say. Being locked in that cellar the way I was; it having no windows, that inner room and all that flammable material lying around. I saw my chance and took it.” She rocked her head gently from side to side, trying not to remember the depraved things she’d witnessed. Been a part of. She had to always remember…it’d been against her will. “You sure they’re dead?” Joey asked for the fifth time. A niggling doubt taunted her deep inside somewhere but she ignored it. “I’m sure. I doused that house with gasoline, torched it, and didn’t leave until there was nothing left but a pile of smoldering rubble. If they’d survived it I would have known. They weren’t the forgiving kind. I’d be dead instead of them. “And I didn’t hear them in my head afterwards. I don’t hear them now.” “That’s good then, huh?” He grinned widely at her again. His eyes full of relief. “It is.” “Hey, Sis, what’s with all the silver in your hair? Makes you look scary weird.” She reached up and touched the unruly strands. “My new look.” Then she grinned back at him. “I’ll dye it as soon as I get home. Don’t want to scare the kids.” “Yeah.” After Joey had picked her up and made sure she was okay he’d used his cell phone to call Andy. Told him the good news and asked him to take the children to the farmhouse. “We should be there in about four hours.” She listened to the conversation and found she could hear Andy clearly on the other end. He was ecstatic she was okay and coming home. He said he’d have pizzas waiting at the farmhouse for everyone when they got there. Of course, he didn’t know she wouldn’t be able to eat them. He, as everyone else besides Joey, still thought she’d been abducted by bad humans. Joey telephoned his wife. She was closing the diner for the day and was coming for the celebration, too. Jenny couldn’t wait to get home. The trip seemed to last forever. When finally there she couldn’t stop hugging and kissing Teddy and Sarah, so thrilled to be with them again; they so happy to have her back. Amadeus, who hadn’t grown an inch she thought, leapt into her arms and started licking her face, meowing. She could have sworn the cat was saying missed you, missed you. Everyone was crying, except her, everyone was happy. Relieved beyond measure. The nightmare was over. She’d miraculously escaped from her kidnappers and was home. Safe. Hallelujah. Being home again was a euphoric dream. In the farmhouse with its homey comforts, her family and friends around her again, the vampires and the threat that had been tormenting her gone forever, she felt herself come alive again. Hope was rekindled. She could go on with her life. She’d cherish it more because she’d been so close to losing it all. Nothing made a person appreciate what they had more than that. “Don’t ever leave us again, Mom,” Sarah cried when she first threw her small body into her arms. “I missed you so bad!” The child wept as Jenny stroked her head and held her close. It felt good to have her baby in her embrace. The world was right again. Teddy held back for a moment, as if he couldn’t believe his eyes, and then he, too, ran up and clamped his arms around her. “Mom, I thought I’d never see you again.” He tried to hide his tears but when he pulled away she saw them glistening on his cheeks. “I love you,” he breathed soft and low; red faced. It was the best present he could have given her. Andy, when he saw her, wrapped his arms around her and kissed her. On the lips. She was so startled she didn’t know what to say. There it was in the softness of his kiss. In his gaze and in the smile on his face. Joy and relief. The beginning of love. Joey was right. Andy did have deep feelings for her. His love was just another complication as far as she was concerned but she was so grateful to be home nothing else mattered. They were sitting at Jenny’s kitchen table. Jenny, Teddy, Sarah, Joey, Laurie and Andy. It was late afternoon. The day still overcast. But the light coming in the windows was a soft shade of rose. Pizza boxes littered the table. Some were empty. “I never gave up believing you were alive, Jenny,” Andy was saying. “None of us did. That you’d be home again. And here you are. Safe and sound. It’s almost unbelievable. A miracle really. Can you talk about it?” His words were hesitant. She put her hands up, glancing at the others in turn. “All of you want to know what happened to me all these weeks? What I went through? Who took me and why? How I escaped?” Andy had an expectant expression on his face. Joey had a worried one on his. She was careful with what she said next because her children, all wide eyes and sharp ears, were listening, too. “Are we still in danger?” Teddy asked in a low voice. “Are those men who took us, took you, still out there?” She shook her head. “No. And they were the same men that have been taking the people around here.” She didn’t tell her son they also killed them. He didn’t need to know that. She wasn’t about to confess what had actually happened to her so she spun out the cover lie she’d created on the ride home. “They broke into the house. I guess looking for food, money, guns or something. They knew the police were looking for them and wanted, I guess, some hostages for protection. I convinced them to take me instead of you children. They didn’t kill me. Seems one of them was a fan of my books.” She laughed softly, as if it were an inside joke. She looked at Andy now. “So I was a curiosity to them. A celebrity. Maybe they thought they could get money for me. Ha. I told them I wasn’t worth a dime. Most authors aren’t.” “At first they fought among themselves as to what to do with me. Then I persuaded them into letting me chronicle their lives and it kept me alive. Flattery works even with criminals. The chance to be famous, to be written about, is a strong bait. “I learned their habits, pretended to take notes for a book about them, waited for my chance, and when it came, a moment when their guard was down, I flew the coop. I called the cops on them. We don’t have to be afraid any longer. I know what they look like. Who they are. They’d been planning to disappear from the area, flee to Canada, I think, and when I escaped I’m sure they took off. They’re long gone.” Her story was full of holes, and she was aware of how skeptical Andy and Laurie seemed by it, but they were so thankful to have her home they didn’t challenge what she said. “Anything else, right now, I don’t want to talk about.” They accepted her reticence as a sign of trauma; her fragile state of body and mind, like her silvered hair, which only Sarah had the nerve to inquire about. Jenny told her fright had done it, but she’d fix it tomorrow. Sarah accepted that explanation with an innocence only a child could have. “Mom, they were strange men, though, weren’t they?” Sarah asked suddenly. “They were giants. They moved faster than the wind. They had sharp teeth, too.” Jenny, her heart jumping, was quick to explain. “Well, they were tall. They could run fast, too.” “They was giants,” her daughter repeated. Teddy, his eyes lowered, said nothing. Jenny wondered how much he remembered about the men who’d taken them, but the boy didn’t add anything to what his sister had said and she was glad of that. Andy was already staring at her in an odd way. “There’s more, isn’t there?” Andy whispered, sidling up beside her, when she went to pour a cup of coffee. Earlier in the day, while she’d made her way through the woods to find a telephone to call Joey, she’d fed on small animals. Good thing, or she’d be starving about now. And Andy would be looking like a good snack. “I can’t talk about it, Andy. Not yet. It’s too difficult.” And it was. But not for the reasons she was trying to convince Andy of. She hated lying. Too much had happened too fast. She needed time to let everything soak in. Needed time to organize her thoughts. Get her story straight. Recharge. Truly realize she was safe and home. “Well, I’m here when you want to talk,” Andy said in a soft voice. “Anytime. I won’t judge, either. You saved your children’s lives. In the end, saved your own life. I’m sure you did what you had to to survive. I admire you for that. In my eyes you’re a resourceful, valiant woman.” “Thank you, Andy.” She hadn’t been able to meet his eyes. “And thank you for taking care of Teddy and Sarah like you did. I don’t know how I’m going to repay you.” “I wanted to help. It was a pleasure and we became great friends. It was nice having someone other than myself to care about. Got my mind off my problems.” “You did more than most friends would have done. You put off your own life to help my kids. You’re a good man, Andy.” He gently ran his hand down the side of her face and she tried not to flinch. “I’m glad you think that. It made everything worthwhile then.” After all the catching up was finished, Joey took her aside into the living room. Amadeus followed and climbed up one leg of her jeans. She caught the kitten under its skinny belly and kissed it on its little face. “Detective Bradley’s coming over later this evening. I thought I’d warn you.” “I thought he went back to St. Louis?” “He did. Soon as I heard from you this morning I called him and let him know you were free. He said he wanted to speak to you in person and was catching the next flight out.” She groaned. “He couldn’t wait until tomorrow? I’ve had an awful time of it. I was hoping for a quiet night alone with my kids after I got rid of the company.” Her brother laughed, lounging against the wall in the front room. The sun was setting and there were shadows everywhere. “Nah, you’re not getting rid of us that quick. It’s a party. You’re lucky we haven’t alerted everyone in town yet or you’d have an enormous crowd here. We thought we’d wait until tomorrow for that. “I also called Chief Donald. I imagine he’ll be here soon. He wants to talk to you, too.” “I bet he does.” “The news media will be here as soon as they get wind of your return. I didn’t call them but I’m sure someone will leak the news sooner or later.” “Aaaah…better later,” she moaned. “Or never.” “You don’t have to talk to them. Just lock the doors and don’t answer. Give me a written statement and I’ll make it for you. No muss, no fuss.” “Thanks, Joey. I’ll probably do that.” She was tired, more of the mind than the body, but she was okay. Her nightmare was over. She was free. Home with her children. Suddenly the wonder of it all made her giddy. She didn’t even care that Chief Donald and Detective Bradley were on their way. Joey was right. It was a party. She could stay awake all night. “The detective knows about the vampires,” Joey let the cat out of the bag. “You can tell him what really happened during your abduction, but what are you going to say to Chief Donald?” “I’ve been thinking about that. I’ll figure out something. The vampires are gone, the murders will stop. The cops will fade out of the picture. All will end well. In time it’ll be yesterday’s news and the Chief’s interest will go somewhere else. I’ll just play for time.” The kids came into the room and pulled her back into the kitchen with Andy and Laurie. They didn’t want her out of their sight for long. Chief Donald knocked on the door as they were eating the last of the pizza and Joey invited him in. Sitting at the table with the rest of them, Jenny gave him the same yarn, more or less, she’d given Andy, the children and Laurie. He listened, nodding, and didn’t say anything until she was done. “So that’s your story, huh?” His face was emotionless but she thought she detected a hint of cynicism. “They butchered all their victims around here but are now no longer a threat because they’ve vamoosed up to Canada? They kidnapped you, let you live because you’re an author, and you got away from them? Unhurt?” “That’s the story.” She thought he was going to say something else but he didn’t. He looked at Joey, who was twiddling his thumbs across the table, and released a large sigh. Closed his notebook. “Is that all, Chief Donald?” she asked, yawning. Acting exhausted so he’d get the clue. “For now. I’ll send a sketch artist out tomorrow to draw up likenesses. The F.B.I. could come out eventually and question you. Now that other states, another country is involved. You sure you don’t want to visit the hospital; have them check you out? I’d feel better if you did.” Her breath caught. “No. I’ve had more than enough hospital time. Whatever happened to me during my abduction, I’m dealing with it. I just want to get some rest. Be with my family. Go back to work and resume my life. Normalcy. That’s all I need to be myself again.” “Okay. It’s your call. You look and sound sane to me.” An authentic grin graced his face and even more surprising, he got up and gave her a quick hug. “I’m real happy you’re okay. Your kids, your brother, were a basket case. Andy wasn’t much better.” He sent a sidelong glance at him. Andy nodded back, all serious. “Everyone in town was praying for you,” Chief Donald told her. He must have had a hard day, his uniform was wrinkled and there were dirt stains on his pants. “There’s going to be a lot of relieved people when they hear the good news. I’m sure by tomorrow morning it’ll be all the buzz at your brother’s diner. The entire town will know soon after. Expect lots of congratulatory telephone calls and spontaneous amiable meetings on the streets. Some may even find themselves at your door with homemade goodies for you and your family. You’ve been the talk of the town for weeks.” After she ushered the police officer from the house and closed the door she looked at Joey, who’d followed them. She could hear the others talking in the kitchen. Laurie was laughing. Sarah was singing some silly song along with Andy. “I don’t think he believed a word of what I said, but he sure seemed happy that I made it out alive. Sweet of him.” “It is. I guess with age we’re all getting nicer. Even Rusty Donald.” In the kitchen she announced, “I’m exhausted. Party’s over. Time for everyone to go home. Come back tomorrow.” They griped some but got up to leave. “Come on by for breakfast everyone,” Laurie offered. “At the diner. On the house.” “Thanks Laurie,” Jenny said. The next day was Saturday. “If I’m up to it I just might take you up on that. But not too early.” “No, not too early. For you we’ll make breakfast anytime.” “Thanks.” “I’ll drop Laurie at home and come back.” Joey was looking at her. Laurie’s attention was taken by saying goodnight to the kids. “Joey, you don’t have to stick around any longer if you’re tired. It’s after eleven. It’s been a long day for both of us. Go on home with your wife.” “You sure?” He spoke so the others couldn’t hear. “Detective Bradley is the next spirit to appear to you tonight, Scrooge.” A ghost of a chuckle. “Sure you can handle him alone?” “Oh, he’s the easy one. I can tell him the truth, mostly, and not have to lie my ass off.” “That you can.” Her brother stretched, yawned. “You know, I am bushed. Worrying for weeks and driving all day does that to me. I think I will go home with Laurie” “Then go.” She watched him and his wife drive off in his truck. Andy was the last to go. She could tell he really wanted to stay and talk more but she used her exhaustion as an excuse. “Another time, Andy. I appreciate all you’ve done. The kids and all. But right now I really need time with them and rest. My own bed. I’m so tired. Tommorow?” He accepted that and left with a gentle smile, saying, “But when you want to talk, be it anytime day or night. I’m here. Don’t forget that.” There was something in the way he looked at her that tipped her off that he suspected there was more to the story she’d given everyone and he knew it. “I won’t forget.” Then she gently closed the door behind him and rejoined her kids. The house was silent and as welcome as an old fluffy robe. The night dark and no longer filled with monsters she was afraid of. She’d defeated them. Later that night, in her children’s bedrooms she stroked their warm foreheads and brushed the hair from their sleeping faces. Laid soft kisses on their cheeks and smiled as they stirred in their sleep. Her heart was content for the first time in a long while. She didn’t care that she was a vampire, she could deal with it, but to be with her children again and to know they were alive and safe was the sweetest feeling she’d ever known. “I’m never going to leave you again. Wild horses couldn’t drag me away. I promise,” she whispered to each of them before going downstairs to wait for the detective. She drifted into a peaceful sleep on the couch with the kitten, a ball of warm fur, curled on her lap. Its purr rumbled in the quiet house until it fell asleep. Jenny had no dreams. Just heavenly guilt-free, horror-free rest. She was home. She. Was. Safe. Bradley arrived two hours later. She woke to the knocking at the door and let him in. He stepped inside and gave her a huge hug. “How was your flight?” “Bumpy. There was a storm over Missouri. But I made it. I’m here.” The cat hissed at the intruder, tiny back up and fur sticking out like a porcupine, protecting its mistress. “Amadeus, behave yourself. You remember Detective Bradley.” Jenny scooped the cat up in her hands and put it on the couch behind her where it continued to protest. Sounded more like a mouse growling. The detective looked at her. “You’re one damn lucky woman, Jenny Sanders. You lived through that attack in St. Louis and now you’ve survived captivity with the monsters who took you.” “I’m damn lucky, yes,” she responded with a wan smile. He wasn’t fooled. “What did you do? How did you beat them? Escape?” Though the detective believed in the vampires, she hoped he hadn’t guessed the truth about her being one. Though at times, she wondered if he suspected something, too. He stared intently at her, waiting for…what she didn’t know. His thoughts were unreadable. Perhaps his will was a wall she couldn’t break through. She was beginning to understand there were some people whose minds she couldn’t breach and she didn’t know why. Apparently he was sometimes one of them. “Were they the ones who killed your husband? Were they really vampires?” he asked. She nodded. “And more. You have no idea. Come on in and I’ll tell you all about it and them.” She warmed up leftover pizza and coffee for him. They had the conversation. The story, ninety-five percent truth, was different from the one she’d told everyone else but Joey. Bradley thought she’d trapped and burned the vampires utilizing just normal human cunning. And luck. The story worked or so she hoped. “So the vampires–God, I still have a hard time saying that–let you trick and lock them in a cellar and burn it down around their ears? Just like that?” “Well, yes. But as I said, I was unbelievably lucky.” “How did you get them into the cellar?” “I’d convinced them I wouldn’t betray them or run away. I couldn’t escape without knowing they were no longer a danger to my family. I told them there were humans hiding down in the cellar. That I’d heard them. Children. “They hadn’t fed yet, couldn’t wait to see for themselves and filed into the room easy as you please. I slammed the door and bolted it behind them. I couldn’t believe they fell for it. I didn’t hang around. I set the place on fire with gasoline I’d found down there. Once outside I watched the place burn down to the ground. I went to a neighboring house to call the fire department. I made sure the fire had done its damage first. Made sure the vampires were destroyed.” “Pretty clever of you. So that by the time the firefighters showed up it was all over?” “Yep.” Detective Bradley scratched his day old beard. “Not that they didn’t deserve it. I know, for you, it was the only way. But I would have liked to have captured at least one of them for interrogation. Study. Hell, just to see for myself what a vampire really looks and acts like.” “Might have gotten yourself killed and a bunch of others, too. You still want undeniable proof.” He nodded. “You got me there. I mean, I believe vampires exist but there’s a tiny part of me that’s still a skeptic. I need to be sure.” Inwardly she sighed. “I know the feeling. I’m sorry. I had no choice. Destroying them was more important than coming back with a live specimen.” Her voice fell to a whisper. “They were killing every night and were as volatile as nitroglycerin. I was terrified for my own life every second. I had to do what I did the way I did it.” His gaze returned to her and his voice was resigned. “Don’t be sorry. You did the right thing. They were monsters. Who are we fooling? I’ve seen the crime scenes. No jail cell or police force I know of could have contained them. If what I suspect was true, the powers they had, no natural way any human could have dealt with them. You did us a huge favor. “Are you sure they’re dead?” “Very. There was nothing left but ashes.” “Then it’s finally over.” Reclining in his chair, his hands gathered up his notebook and pen. There was weariness in his every move. Tonight he looked old. “Feels like I’ve been chasing these creatures forever. I can’t believe it’s over. Thank God.” Five years, she thought, since his daughter’s death. Yes, it would seem like forever. “I’ll be traveling down there to examine the burnt building. I won’t have peace of mind until I can find what’s left of them.” “Their remains?” That puzzled her. “Yes.” “Won’t be any. One of them once told me when they die they don’t leave anything behind. Not even melted flesh or bone fragments. Just ashy residue. Nothing you can connect to a once living being.” “You know that, also, do you, from the last time you crispy-crittered that gang of them in the theater?” She almost laughed, but didn’t. “I do.” “Ah. Well, I’m going down there to see for myself anyway. Can you draw me a simple map of where the house is and where the cellar was located?” “I can do that.” They talked a little longer. She drew him the map and described where the cellar’s inner room had been. “I know you’ve been through an ordeal so I’ll get out of here and leave you alone. And Jenny, if I didn’t say it before, I’ll say it now. I’m overjoyed you got away alive. So grateful those monsters are gone. I can’t thank you enough. My daughter can finally rest in peace.” “My husband and all the others that died by their hands, as well.” For the second time he wrapped her in a bear hug. Somewhere along the way they’d become friends. It was nice to have someone else on her and Joey’s side. Someone else who believed in what they knew to be true. She wished she could trust him enough to tell him she was infected. Oh well. “You driving down there right now?” “I am. Get it done. I’ll swing by here one last time and see how you’re doing before I fly back to St. Louis. I’ve already taken too many days off. I can’t afford to lose my job. Not with jobs the way they are these days.” “I know. I’m thankful my job’s waiting for me. Joey said he’d talked to my boss and I can come back any time I want. He didn’t replace me.” “Nice boss.” “He is. Like the rest of the town. They’ve been good to my children and me. Joey says there’s a party tomorrow at the diner. The whole town, no doubt, will be there.” She feigned irritation. “I suppose there’ll be plenty of questions for me to answer. Oh, boy.” “I’ll hurry back then.” He smiled as he got up from the table. “After weeks eating there most every day I’ve become addicted to your brother’s food. There going to be cake?” “Most likely.” She laughed and walked him to the door. “Good night.” “Good night, lucky lady.” Out in the dark, as his rented car puttered down the ribbon of road, it was no more than flashes that at first caught her eye, a line of small luminous orbs that skittered around the corner of the house towards the backyard so rapidly she immediately doubted she’d seen them. But she had. Her eyesight was really good these days. What were they? She ran through the house and out into the yard behind it, her eyes searching. There was nothing. Whatever they’d been they were gone. An uneasy certainty blossomed in the pit of her stomach. Ghosts. They were ghosts. She remembered what the librarian had told her. The girl at the store. She remembered the rumors about the farmhouse being haunted. The sightings. She was too sleepy to fret over it on top of all she’d been through. She’d worry tomorrow, as she’d feed tomorrow. Right before dawn before the kids got up. Vampire or not, her bed embraced her like a cloud. Her room was heaven. She fell asleep. No dreams. Not a one. And that was a good thing. She felt as if she’d been released from hell and her freedom, being with her children again, was sweeter than anything she’d ever tasted. Anything she ever would.",

      "content": "Chapter 22 The Ghost She was hunting in the murky woods the next morning before the day began, trying not to think about the radiant orbs she’d seen the night before outside the house. Her hunger made that easy. She had weeks of starving to offset. Now, she found, it was easy to hypnotize the animals and gently take only what she needed from them. It made her happy to know she’d finally mastered it. The hardest thing was resuming the animal blood after she’d had a taste of human; though because of Zebulon she’d never drank much. It didn’t matter. She looked at people now and again craved their blood. It took willpower not to give in. Last night, with all the people around her, had been difficult. Every time she felt the urge, images of her children rose in her mind and somehow she’d fought it off. It would take time to be where she’d been before she’d been abducted. It’d take work. Again it didn’t matter. When Teddy and Sarah had clomped downstairs in the morning and she gathered them in her arms, all was right in her world. She hummed an old Dylan song as she made them bacon and eggs. Just so happy to be with them again. After breakfast the doorbell rang and Sarah skipped off to answer it. “Mom, it’s Andy!” “Couldn’t stay away, huh?” Jenny teased when Sarah dragged him by the hand into the kitchen. “Nope, I couldn’t.” His eyes studied her face. There was a silly grin on his. “I just had to make sure last night wasn’t a dream, Jenny. You’re really okay. Really home. “I missed these monkeys, too.” He tousled her daughter’s hair and the girl threw him an amused look. “I got used to seeing them every day, their shenanigans. Taking care of them.” Jenny, in a long-sleeved shirt to cover her cold flesh, stood behind Teddy, her arms wrapped around his shoulders. “Oh, I understand. They grow on you.” She laid a kiss on her son’s head. “And Joey sent me over here to bring you three to the diner for breakfast.” “We already had breakfast,” Sarah piped up. “Well, then for lunch.” “It’s a welcome home party, isn’t it?” she guessed. “A big one. I just left there and there must be fifty people waiting to see you. See you’re all right. The place is packed.” “Ain’t going to get out of it, am I?” “Nope. All of you get on your glad rags and I’ll ferry you to party central.” So they did. It was a bright sunny day but with sunglasses and her usual getup she found the sunlight didn’t affect her as it once had. She didn’t need a hat at all. Her body was adapting. She had the feeling one day she would be able to walk in the sun again. The gathering at the diner wasn’t as bad as she thought it’d be. It touched her so many people were there to welcome her home though the smell of their warm blood was unnerving at first. She got over it. And there was cake. Detective Bradley never showed up and she began to worry. *** When she got home she called Bradley’s cell phone. It went to voice message, she left a few words and hung up. Six hours and three messages later she hadn’t gotten a hold of him. She called his department’s telephone number and talked to his partner, Ross Colter. “No, I haven’t heard from Ben since he flew out yesterday. That’s not like him. We keep in close contact, especially when he’s on a case. When was the last time you heard from him?” “I saw him last night. But he isn’t answering his cell phone. I’ve tried for hours.” “Well, let’s give him until tomorrow. Ben can be mysterious when he wants to be. To tell you the truth, I’ve been concerned myself about the guy since his daughter died. He hasn’t been the same. Acting secretive and all. Always running off to God knows where to do God knows what. Reading all these books on the occult.” She didn’t comment on that but finished the phone call with, “Detective Colter, if you hear from him will you please call me?” “Is this to do with a case? The one he’s working on?” It was easier to say, “It is.” “Okay. Tell you what. If I hear from him I’ll tell him you called and to please call you. Would that do?” “It would.” “And if you hear from him, Mrs. Sanders, ask him to report in or contact me, please?” “I’ll do that. Thank you, Detective Colter. It was nice talking to you.” “Same here. So delighted to know you’re back home and okay. Ben was really worried about you.” “Thank you.” She hung up, her uneasiness growing, and finished getting clothes ready for Sarah and Teddy to wear the next day to school. Now that there was no longer a threat it was time for them to go back. They’d missed enough. The rest of the evening, preparing and eating supper, spending time with her children and doing the things they used to do, was so normal it nearly lulled her into believing the last weeks hadn’t happened. But they had. Sudden jarring memories would sneak up on her and the horror of those days and nights she’d spent with the vampires would stop the blood in her veins; take her breath away. Detective Bradley had mentioned the possibility of a delayed reaction to the ordeal she’d gone through. Her mind said: This must be what he was talking about. Nightmare vignettes…during the day. As the hours went by she began to think there was something else going on. She couldn’t shake the dread that grew stronger every hour. Something still isn’t right. Something. The children went to bed. Joey phoned to check up on her. He’d been worse than a mother hen since she’d returned. She luxuriated in the joy of being home. Being alone again. Free and safe. Was this what a prisoner felt like once he’d come home from prison? Probably. When the kids were asleep and there was no chance Andy or anyone else would stop by she entered the woods. Disquiet heavy upon her she kept the farmhouse with its faint lights emanating from the windows always in her sight. It was a chilly late November night. Even in Florida, at times, it felt like Illinois to her. Then again that fall, the locals said, was unseasonably cold. No moon showed through the clouds, but she could see everything. Her speed and her strength had increased. It was as if she were changing every moment into something…else. A hybrid far superior to the original. The fox she’d caught and drank from had wobbled away into the underbrush when she was first aware someone or something was tracking her. She kept pivoting around thinking she could catch them. There was never anyone or anything there. She hurried home. When she got near the house she saw those strange illuminated orbs again bouncing and moving around it. Shaking her head, shutting her eyes for a second, they were still there when she opened them. She chased the lights around the side of the house where they evaporated before her eyes. Where they really ghosts? She didn’t know but she had no doubt they were haunting her, her home, for a reason. Trying to tell her something. But what? She went to bed, though she had a hard time sleeping, even with the gentle rain that had begun. Tap, tapping so softly on the roof. Her mind was so uneasy. Where was Detective Bradley…what were those strange lights…and why did she feel so troubled? The telephone call came in the middle of the night. It shattered not only her rest but also her new sense of security. Scared Amadeus. The cat had been snuggling under the covers beside her and had, for no reason she could see, began meowing. It wiggled from her grasp and flew off the bed, ran to the window and jumped up on the windowsill. Something outside had captured its attention. It sat frozen, staring out into the rainy night. Jenny answered the phone. “Mrs. Jenny Sanders?” “Yes?” She sat up in bed. The house was so quiet. The dark so deep. She could hear the rain on the gutters and the leaves of the trees. “I hate to wake you, but it’s important. This is Detective Colter, Ben Bradley’s partner? I talked to you earlier today, remember?” “I remember.” There was something in the man’s voice that presaged bad news. Real bad news. “What’s wrong?” “I thought you should know, Detective Bradley was involved in a car accident tonight.” “A car accident? Is he okay?” “No, I’m sorry to say, it was a fatal accident. Ben’s dead.” She heard the shocked sadness in the man’s voice. She felt it inside her. Oh no. “What happened?” Now she was wide awake. The rain was drumming harder on the house. The wind wept softly. Lightning filled the room with a brilliant sunburst. “We aren’t sure yet. I just got the news from a State Trooper, Will Smitherton, who found him. He said it seemed as if the rental car must have somehow gone off the road and into a deep culvert. Rolled. Slick country roads. The hard rain. The car was totaled. Ben was dead.” “I’m so sorry, Detective Colter. He talked about you; said you two weren’t only partners but longtime friends. You played poker every week. Liked to go to the shooting range together. I liked him.” “He was one in a million, for sure. A fine man and a good cop. The best. He had a sixth sense when it came to catching bad guys.” The man’s voice caught. He was in pain. “Anyway, I thought you should know so you stop worrying about him. He’s not going to call you now.” “Thank you. That was kind. Again, I’m so sorry.” The phone went dead. She hung up. Then buried her face in her hands. Detective Bradley was dead. Dead. She hadn’t known him that well but the loss stabbed a hole in her anyway. She had trusted him. Admired and liked him. A lot. He’d believed in vampires. He’d believed her. Now he was dead. Like Jeff. Gone forever. Of course she couldn’t shed a tear. At least she still experienced sadness and wondered if even that human emotion would someday elude her as well. She hoped not. If sadness went, would love be far behind? She didn’t know and didn’t want to. Her feeling of disquiet mingled with dread. It wasn’t just Bradley’s strange and sudden death it was…. Her eyes traveled to the window. Amadeus had stretched tiny paws up high onto the glass. Its body extended skinny and long. The cat was silent. Not a sound was coming from its furry mouth. It dropped from the sill and darted underneath the bed. Because hovering on the other side of the window’s glass, in the dark rain, was a pale figure beckoning her with ghostly hands. Come to the window. Raise it. Come. Stunned, she left the bed and moved closer. The ghost’s hand gestured in an upward motion. She opened the window. The figure somehow sparked a memory in her. The face, initially, was a swirling misty whiteness she couldn’t recognize. Then the figure, face and all, grew clear. “Jeff?” She was too astonished to utter another word. Her mind told her she was seeing things. She blinked twice, nice and slow. He was still there. Jeff. Her dead husband. Floating twelve feet off the ground. Smiling in at her. It’s me, sweetheart. I know. It’s a shock. But try to get over that because I can’t stay long. Even the afterlife has rules. “God, Jeff, I’ve missed you! The kids have, too. You won’t believe what’s happened since you’ve been gone.” There’s something I have to tell you. “Jeff. I’m a vampire. Those men who killed you, they were vampires, and they made me a vampire! It’s been so hard since you died. They kidnapped me and–” Jenny, listen! I haven’t got much time. “–Forced me to help them kill people, drink human blood. Oh, Jeff.” Her fingers reached for her husband. Seeing him again; hearing his voice, she was overcome with a crushing sense of loss. The weight of it so heavy she could barely stay upright. Jeff had been the strong one. Their protector. “They threatened our children’s lives if I didn’t go with them and do as they said. But I tricked them. I got away. I burned them to ashes like we did those vampires in the theater. Remember?” I need to warn you. “Oh, Jeff. Why does life have to be so hard? Why did you leave us?” Hush! You, Teddy and Sarah are still in danger. Listen! Her husband’s grim expression, the way his eyes bored into hers sucked the words right out of her mouth. Chastised, she whispered softly, “Tell me what you need to tell me.” I know all about the vampires, Jenny. But you were wrong. Dante wasn’t the strongest one or the leader. The quiet one, Aloysius was. He was the one with the true power; hid behind the others to conceal his position. He’s the one who can bring and will bring more of his kind into this world. And because enough years have passed, enough blood ingested, he’s acquired the power and learned the secret of bringing them here. Very soon. Many, many more like him. An army to follow him and bleed humanity dry. It’ll be an apocalypse. The world as we knew it will cease to exist. Forever. “But the vampires are dead. I destroyed them.” No. Aloysius didn’t die. He was strong enough to escape the fire. Cover his tracks. Now he wants revenge. He killed that detective friend of yours. Made it look like a car accident. It wasn’t. Aloysius tortured and killed him. Then put him in the car and crashed it. “Bradley?” She felt sick to her stomach. “No!” Yes, Detective Bradley. I’m sorry, Jenny. I know he was your friend. Aloysius is coming for Teddy and Sarah. For you. He’ll be here before dawn. You must take our children someplace else. Some place safe. Now! “Where?” Someplace Aloysius doesn’t know of. Andy’s house. “You know about Andy?” I know. He cares for you. Teddy. Sarah. He’s a good man. Go there. “But it’s the middle of the night?” Andy won’t mind. There’s not much time. Go there now. “All right. We will.” Once our kids are safe come back here and destroy Aloysius once and for all. “If I couldn’t kill him before, if he’s so strong, how can I now? Alone?” Listen and I’ll tell you. And she listened, in shocked amazement, as he told her how. She’d heard the same solution somewhere before, but she couldn’t remember where. “You sure that will work? It sounds almost too simple.” It’ll work. Trust me. I’ll be here to help you. “Jeff, I’m scared.” I know. You must do this, my love. If you want our children to live and you want to remain here with them. Aloysius will never stop until all of you are dead. He hates you. He’s afraid of you. You could ruin his plans. He knows you have great power. “I’ll try to kill him.” And Jenny? “Yes?” Tell Andy the truth about everything. He’ll be a help to you. You need to tell him anyway if this is to work. “Tell him about the vampires, past and present, everything?” She took a deep breath. “And that I’m one?” She met her husband’s unearthly eyes and all the years, the love that had once existed between them, enveloped her. The memories now tinged with a bittersweet sadness. He smiled. Everything. It’s not your fault you were turned. And you’re right, your goodness will protect you from becoming the monster you might have become. You’ll go on to fight the evil that the others are. Tell Andy. He’ll understand. He needs to know. Trust me. Trust him. You’ll need allies in the days to come. For worse is ahead. “Worse is ahead? What does that mean?” There’s no time to explain now. Go to Andy’s. Do what you have to do. Jenny, I’m afraid for you and the children. “Okay. I’ll take the kids and go to Andy’s. I’ll tell him everything.” Beneath the bed Amadeus was mewling. Hurry. Her dead husband’s ghost dissipated bit by bit. I’ll love you forever and always, my sweet Jenny. I’m proud of you. Give our children my love. I miss them so much. Tell them I’m watching over them. Always. He blinked into nothingness. The clock on the nightstand said 1:32 a.m. She called Andy. “Jenny, do you know it’s after one-thirty?” His voice a raspy whisper. “I know. I’m in trouble. Can me and the kids come over? I need your help. I’ll explain it all when I get there.” She had to give him credit. He didn’t hesitate. “Then, by all means, come over. I’ll put on a pot of coffee.” He gave her his address and she memorized it. She’d never been to his house. Tonight would be a first. “And Andy?” “Yes?” “Can I borrow that spare bow and arrow of yours? A few arrows? There also might be a few other things I’m going to need but we’ll discuss it when I get there.” He didn’t answer for a moment, then, “Why?” “Like I said I’ll tell you when I get there. We’re in a kind of hurry now. Just get the bow and arrows out for me, please?” Another pause. “Okay. I’ll get them out.” He seemed wide awake now. “Thanks Andy. See you in a few minutes. You’re saving our lives.” She didn’t give him a chance to say anything else before she hung up. Her feeling of danger had ratcheted up a thousand percent. There wasn’t much time. Danger, a devouring beast with super speed, was near and rushing at them. She telephoned Joey, woke him up, too, and told him what was going on. Where they were going and why. She left out the incident with Jeff’s ghost. The news about Bradley’s murder. What she was planning to do. There wasn’t time. He wanted to meet her at Andy’s, bless his heart, but she told him no, there was nothing he could do. Stay put. See you tomorrow. “I’ll tell you everything tomorrow. If I’m still alive.” She got the kids up and helped them quickly pack. Getting down her mother’s cardboard box tied with a shoestring from the closet shelf she dumped some of its contents into a brown paper bag and took it with her out to the car; placed it on the floor of the front passenger seat. In twenty minutes they were driving towards Andy’s and she was relieved beyond measure. Just what they absolutely needed crammed into three suitcases. Just in case. “We going to go into hiding again?” Sarah, half asleep, muttered. Amadeus was clutched in her arms. The cat wasn’t happy. It never liked being in the car. Sarah and Teddy were in their pajamas. There hadn’t been time to get them dressed. Jenny, herself, had practically jumped into a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt. Of course, she had moved really fast. “Well, duh, silly,” Teddy responded. “Hence the middle-of-the-night road trip.” “We’re going to Andy’s,” Jenny said. “Don’t ask me anything else about why. I can’t tell you.” “Yeah!” Sarah cheered. “We just left. I like being there, though. With Andy. So does kitty.” She hugged the cat until it squeaked in protest. “It’s like going to a second home.” “It wasn’t bad,” Teddy agreed. “Andy cooks better than you, Mom.” “Thanks.” She was too scared for her kids to be able to think of anything else. The further away from the farmhouse they got, the better she’d feel. The roads were washed in spectral gloom. The rain came down at a steady clip. No moonlight. The wind whipped bits of limbs and wet leaves across the car’s windshield as the wipers fought off the clingy debris. She sped into Andy’s driveway and steered the car around the curve and parked in the back of the house. The house was lit up. Andy was waiting at the front door. A confused smile on his face. “I don’t want anyone knowing we’re here. Can I put my car in your garage?” was the first thing she asked as Teddy and Sarah darted past him and into the house. “Sure. Let me grab my car keys and move it out and you can pull yours in.” After they’d done that, Andy helped settle the kids in the guest room. He’d brought out an air mattress for her and had it made, covers, pillow and all. She didn’t have the heart to tell him she might not need it. They put the children to bed and she followed him into the kitchen. “I don’t know about you,” he said, “but I could use a late night snack. All this excitement has made me hungry.” “I’m not real hungry myself. I’m too worked up. But you go ahead.” “How about a cup of hot chocolate at least?” “That I could take.” The house had fallen silent. The children, tired from the excitement and the rush over, had gone to sleep immediately. Jenny had asked Andy to turn off as many lights in the house as he could. He did it without question. In the kitchen they looked at each other. The dim fifteen-watt bulb installed above the oven spread just enough light to see what they were doing. When the cocoa was done, a sandwich made for Andy, the two of them sat face to face at the table. “Nice house,” she commented, sipping the chocolate. It actually tasted good and that pleasantly surprised her. “Like you, I renovated it myself. Put a lot of sweat and blood into it. You should have seen it before I moved in. It was a mess.” Her eyes toured the kitchen, took note of the bow and arrow in its snug leather sheath propped in the corner, and came back to him. “I really like it. So cheerfully cozy.” “That’s what I was going for.” He smiled. “Andy, I don’t know how to thank you for all of this. And everything else you’ve done since we moved here. I’m in your debt.” “Nonsense. We’re friends. We help each other if we can. Your brother taught me that years ago. In a lot of ways, I’m in your debt. I wouldn’t be the man I am now if not for Joey.” There was a softness to his words that alerted her again to the softness growing in his heart for her. His hand reached across the table to cover hers. “Now tell me what’s going on, Jenny. My curiosity’s killing me. Don’t you think you owe me a better explanation than what I’ve had so far? I know something terrible is going on in your life, besides your husband’s death and your abduction, and has been since you moved here. I’ve felt it. I’ve been patient. I’ve waited for you to tell me. But now I’d like to believe I’m a good enough friend for you to finally confide in me. I won’t judge. Just tell me.” She really hated doing what she had to do next. Her sigh was one of resignation. “You’re an exceptionally intuitive man and, yes, you deserve the truth. Finally. “First, I need these things. Time is short. I have to go back to the farmhouse, alone, for a little while. These things, along with the bow and arrows, go with me.” She slid a scrap of paper covered with words and a simple diagram towards him. “You have them? Can you do that to the arrows for me?” She’d taken the stuff out of the bag and laid them on the table. He studied the list, the drawing, and looked up at her. “Yes. And yes.” He tapped the paper with his fingers and glanced at the items on the table. “Will all this be part of the explanation I’m about to get, too?” “It will.” She met his gaze. “I’m going to give it to you right now. But I warn you…it’s going to rock your world and everything you’ve ever believed about that world. Be prepared. I don’t have a lot of time so I can’t tell you everything in detail but I’ve give you a condensed version before I leave.” “You really have to leave then?” Her shoulders slumped. “If we’re to remain safe, I do. If all goes well I’ll be back by dawn.” “Can I go with you?” “No. I’m trusting you to take care of Teddy and Sarah and if anything happens to me, protect them until Joey and Laurie can come for them.” “You’re frightening me.” “I’m sorry. Again. Time short. Shush. Here goes. All I ask is you don’t interrupt me; don’t say a word, until I’m completely finished. Okay?” He looked puzzled, his hand left hers, but he nodded his head, waiting. “Okay.” So, as they sat there in the murky kitchen with the rain falling heavily outside, she told him. Everything. Just like Jeff asked her. Or as much as she could in the small amount of time she felt she had to do it in. He took it pretty well. All things considered. Afterwards, he still tried to convince her to let him go with her, let him help, but she was adamant he didn’t. When he knew he couldn’t change her mind, he collected the objects she’d asked for, fixed what she’d wanted him to fix, and helped her load everything into his car. She drove away into the stormy night in Andy’s new Mustang a little before three and Andy, his mind almost certainly reeling from what she’d told him, a frown on his face, lingered in the doorway and watched her leave. It was strange. He’d listened to her little speech and afterwards had appeared to believe her. But she’d never forget the way he’d stared at her before she left, his gaze incredulous one second and pitying the next. Or the way he’d suddenly pulled her into his arms at the door, simply held her, begged her to be careful and told her his prayers would be with her every step of the way. Until then she’d had no idea he was religious, believed in God. Thinking about it later, it made sense. He was such a good man.",

I just left there and there must be fifty people waiting to see you. See you’re all right. The place is packed.” “Ain’t going to get out of it, am I?” “Nope. All of you get on your glad rags and I’ll ferry you to party central.” So they did. It was a bright sunny day but with sunglasses and her usual getup she found the sunlight didn’t affect her as it once had. She didn’t need a hat at all. Her body was adapting. She had the feeling one day she would be able to walk in the sun again. The gathering at the diner wasn’t as bad as she thought it’d be. It touched her so many people were there to welcome her home though the smell of their warm blood was unnerving at first. She got over it. And there was cake. Detective Bradley never showed up and she began to worry. *** When she got home she called Bradley’s cell phone. It went to voice message, she left a few words and hung up. Six hours and three messages later she hadn’t gotten a hold of him. She called his department’s telephone number and talked to his partner, Ross Colter. “No, I haven’t heard from Ben since he flew out yesterday. That’s not like him. We keep in close contact, especially when he’s on a case. When was the last time you heard from him?” “I saw him last night. But he isn’t answering his cell phone. I’ve tried for hours.” “Well, let’s give him until tomorrow. Ben can be mysterious when he wants to be. To tell you the truth, I’ve been concerned myself about the guy since his daughter died. He hasn’t been the same. Acting secretive and all. Always running off to God knows where to do God knows what. Reading all these books on the occult.” She didn’t comment on that but finished the phone call with, “Detective Colter, if you hear from him will you please call me?” “Is this to do with a case? The one he’s working on?” It was easier to say, “It is.” “Okay. Tell you what. If I hear from him I’ll tell him you called and to please call you. Would that do?” “It would.” “And if you hear from him, Mrs. Sanders, ask him to report in or contact me, please?” “I’ll do that. Thank you, Detective Colter. It was nice talking to you.” “Same here. So delighted to know you’re back home and okay. Ben was really worried about you.” “Thank you.” She hung up, her uneasiness growing, and finished getting clothes ready for Sarah and Teddy to wear the next day to school. Now that there was no longer a threat it was time for them to go back. They’d missed enough. The rest of the evening, preparing and eating supper, spending time with her children and doing the things they used to do, was so normal it nearly lulled her into believing the last weeks hadn’t happened. But they had. Sudden jarring memories would sneak up on her and the horror of those days and nights she’d spent with the vampires would stop the blood in her veins; take her breath away. Detective Bradley had mentioned the possibility of a delayed reaction to the ordeal she’d gone through. Her mind said: This must be what he was talking about. Nightmare vignettes…during the day. As the hours went by she began to think there was something else going on. She couldn’t shake the dread that grew stronger every hour. Something still isn’t right. Something. The children went to bed. Joey phoned to check up on her. He’d been worse than a mother hen since she’d returned. She luxuriated in the joy of being home. Being alone again. Free and safe. Was this what a prisoner felt like once he’d come home from prison? Probably. When the kids were asleep and there was no chance Andy or anyone else would stop by she entered the woods. Disquiet heavy upon her she kept the farmhouse with its faint lights emanating from the windows always in her sight. It was a chilly late November night. Even in Florida, at times, it felt like Illinois to her. Then again that fall, the locals said, was unseasonably cold. No moon showed through the clouds, but she could see everything. Her speed and her strength had increased. It was as if she were changing every moment into something…else. A hybrid far superior to the original. The fox she’d caught and drank from had wobbled away into the underbrush when she was first aware someone or something was tracking her. She kept pivoting around thinking she could catch them. There was never anyone or anything there. She hurried home. When she got near the house she saw those strange illuminated orbs again bouncing and moving around it. Shaking her head, shutting her eyes for a second, they were still there when she opened them. She chased the lights around the side of the house where they evaporated before her eyes. Where they really ghosts? She didn’t know but she had no doubt they were haunting her, her home, for a reason. Trying to tell her something. But what? She went to bed, though she had a hard time sleeping, even with the gentle rain that had begun. Tap, tapping so softly on the roof. Her mind was so uneasy. Where was Detective Bradley…what were those strange lights…and why did she feel so troubled? The telephone call came in the middle of the night. It shattered not only her rest but also her new sense of security. Scared Amadeus. The cat had been snuggling under the covers beside her and had, for no reason she could see, began meowing. It wiggled from her grasp and flew off the bed, ran to the window and jumped up on the windowsill. Something outside had captured its attention. It sat frozen, staring out into the rainy night. Jenny answered the phone. “Mrs. Jenny Sanders?” “Yes?” She sat up in bed. The house was so quiet. The dark so deep. She could hear the rain on the gutters and the leaves of the trees. “I hate to wake you, but it’s important. This is Detective Colter, Ben Bradley’s partner? I talked to you earlier today, remember?” “I remember.” There was something in the man’s voice that presaged bad news. Real bad news. “What’s wrong?” “I thought you should know, Detective Bradley was involved in a car accident tonight.” “A car accident? Is he okay?” “No, I’m sorry to say, it was a fatal accident. Ben’s dead.” She heard the shocked sadness in the man’s voice. She felt it inside her. Oh no. “What happened?” Now she was wide awake. The rain was drumming harder on the house. The wind wept softly. Lightning filled the room with a brilliant sunburst. “We aren’t sure yet. I just got the news from a State Trooper, Will Smitherton, who found him. He said it seemed as if the rental car must have somehow gone off the road and into a deep culvert. Rolled. Slick country roads. The hard rain. The car was totaled. Ben was dead.” “I’m so sorry, Detective Colter. He talked about you; said you two weren’t only partners but longtime friends. You played poker every week. Liked to go to the shooting range together. I liked him.” “He was one in a million, for sure. A fine man and a good cop. The best. He had a sixth sense when it came to catching bad guys.” The man’s voice caught. He was in pain. “Anyway, I thought you should know so you stop worrying about him. He’s not going to call you now.” “Thank you. That was kind. Again, I’m so sorry.” The phone went dead. She hung up. Then buried her face in her hands. Detective Bradley was dead. Dead. She hadn’t known him that well but the loss stabbed a hole in her anyway. She had trusted him. Admired and liked him. A lot. He’d believed in vampires. He’d believed her. Now he was dead. Like Jeff. Gone forever. Of course she couldn’t shed a tear. At least she still experienced sadness and wondered if even that human emotion would someday elude her as well. She hoped not. If sadness went, would love be far behind? She didn’t know and didn’t want to. Her feeling of disquiet mingled with dread. It wasn’t just Bradley’s strange and sudden death it was…. Her eyes traveled to the window. Amadeus had stretched tiny paws up high onto the glass. Its body extended skinny and long. The cat was silent. Not a sound was coming from its furry mouth. It dropped from the sill and darted underneath the bed. Because hovering on the other side of the window’s glass, in the dark rain, was a pale figure beckoning her with ghostly hands. Come to the window. Raise it. Come. Stunned, she left the bed and moved closer. The ghost’s hand gestured in an upward motion. She opened the window. The figure somehow sparked a memory in her. The face, initially, was a swirling misty whiteness she couldn’t recognize. Then the figure, face and all, grew clear. “Jeff?” She was too astonished to utter another word. Her mind told her she was seeing things. She blinked twice, nice and slow. He was still there. Jeff. Her dead husband. Floating twelve feet off the ground. Smiling in at her. It’s me, sweetheart. I know. It’s a shock. But try to get over that because I can’t stay long. Even the afterlife has rules. “God, Jeff, I’ve missed you! The kids have, too. You won’t believe what’s happened since you’ve been gone.” There’s something I have to tell you. “Jeff. I’m a vampire. Those men who killed you, they were vampires, and they made me a vampire! It’s been so hard since you died. They kidnapped me and–” Jenny, listen! I haven’t got much time. “–Forced me to help them kill people, drink human blood. Oh, Jeff.” Her fingers reached for her husband. Seeing him again; hearing his voice, she was overcome with a crushing sense of loss. The weight of it so heavy she could barely stay upright. Jeff had been the strong one. Their protector. “They threatened our children’s lives if I didn’t go with them and do as they said. But I tricked them. I got away. I burned them to ashes like we did those vampires in the theater. Remember?” I need to warn you. “Oh, Jeff. Why does life have to be so hard? Why did you leave us?” Hush! You, Teddy and Sarah are still in danger. Listen! Her husband’s grim expression, the way his eyes bored into hers sucked the words right out of her mouth. Chastised, she whispered softly, “Tell me what you need to tell me.” I know all about the vampires, Jenny. But you were wrong. Dante wasn’t the strongest one or the leader. The quiet one, Aloysius was. He was the one with the true power; hid behind the others to conceal his position. He’s the one who can bring and will bring more of his kind into this world. And because enough years have passed, enough blood ingested, he’s acquired the power and learned the secret of bringing them here. Very soon. Many, many more like him. An army to follow him and bleed humanity dry. It’ll be an apocalypse. The world as we knew it will cease to exist. Forever. “But the vampires are dead. I destroyed them.” No. Aloysius didn’t die. He was strong enough to escape the fire. Cover his tracks. Now he wants revenge. He killed that detective friend of yours. Made it look like a car accident. It wasn’t. Aloysius tortured and killed him. Then put him in the car and crashed it. “Bradley?” She felt sick to her stomach. “No!” Yes, Detective Bradley. I’m sorry, Jenny. I know he was your friend. Aloysius is coming for Teddy and Sarah. For you. He’ll be here before dawn. You must take our children someplace else. Some place safe. Now! “Where?” Someplace Aloysius doesn’t know of. Andy’s house. “You know about Andy?” I know. He cares for you. Teddy. Sarah. He’s a good man. Go there. “But it’s the middle of the night?” Andy won’t mind. There’s not much time. Go there now. “All right. We will.” Once our kids are safe come back here and destroy Aloysius once and for all. “If I couldn’t kill him before, if he’s so strong, how can I now? Alone?” Listen and I’ll tell you. And she listened, in shocked amazement, as he told her how. She’d heard the same solution somewhere before, but she couldn’t remember where. “You sure that will work? It sounds almost too simple.” It’ll work. Trust me. I’ll be here to help you. “Jeff, I’m scared.” I know. You must do this, my love. If you want our children to live and you want to remain here with them. Aloysius will never stop until all of you are dead. He hates you. He’s afraid of you. You could ruin his plans. He knows you have great power. “I’ll try to kill him.” And Jenny? “Yes?” Tell Andy the truth about everything. He’ll be a help to you. You need to tell him anyway if this is to work. “Tell him about the vampires, past and present, everything?” She took a deep breath. “And that I’m one?” She met her husband’s unearthly eyes and all the years, the love that had once existed between them, enveloped her. The memories now tinged with a bittersweet sadness. He smiled. Everything. It’s not your fault you were turned. And you’re right, your goodness will protect you from becoming the monster you might have become. You’ll go on to fight the evil that the others are. Tell Andy. He’ll understand. He needs to know. Trust me. Trust him. You’ll need allies in the days to come. For worse is ahead. “Worse is ahead? What does that mean?” There’s no time to explain now. Go to Andy’s. Do what you have to do. Jenny, I’m afraid for you and the children. “Okay. I’ll take the kids and go to Andy’s. I’ll tell him everything.” Beneath the bed Amadeus was mewling. Hurry. Her dead husband’s ghost dissipated bit by bit. I’ll love you forever and always, my sweet Jenny. I’m proud of you. Give our children my love. I miss them so much. Tell them I’m watching over them. Always. He blinked into nothingness. The clock on the nightstand said 1:32 a.m. She called Andy. “Jenny, do you know it’s after one-thirty?” His voice a raspy whisper. “I know. I’m in trouble. Can me and the kids come over? I need your help. I’ll explain it all when I get there.” She had to give him credit. He didn’t hesitate. “Then, by all means, come over. I’ll put on a pot of coffee.” He gave her his address and she memorized it. She’d never been to his house. Tonight would be a first. “And Andy?” “Yes?” “Can I borrow that spare bow and arrow of yours? A few arrows? There also might be a few other things I’m going to need but we’ll discuss it when I get there.” He didn’t answer for a moment, then, “Why?” “Like I said I’ll tell you when I get there. We’re in a kind of hurry now. Just get the bow and arrows out for me, please?” Another pause. “Okay. I’ll get them out.” He seemed wide awake now. “Thanks Andy. See you in a few minutes. You’re saving our lives.” She didn’t give him a chance to say anything else before she hung up. Her feeling of danger had ratcheted up a thousand percent. There wasn’t much time. Danger, a devouring beast with super speed, was near and rushing at them. She telephoned Joey, woke him up, too, and told him what was going on. Where they were going and why. She left out the incident with Jeff’s ghost. The news about Bradley’s murder. What she was planning to do. There wasn’t time. He wanted to meet her at Andy’s, bless his heart, but she told him no, there was nothing he could do. Stay put. See you tomorrow. “I’ll tell you everything tomorrow. If I’m still alive.” She got the kids up and helped them quickly pack. Getting down her mother’s cardboard box tied with a shoestring from the closet shelf she dumped some of its contents into a brown paper bag and took it with her out to the car; placed it on the floor of the front passenger seat. In twenty minutes they were driving towards Andy’s and she was relieved beyond measure. Just what they absolutely needed crammed into three suitcases. Just in case. “We going to go into hiding again?” Sarah, half asleep, muttered. Amadeus was clutched in her arms. The cat wasn’t happy. It never liked being in the car. Sarah and Teddy were in their pajamas. There hadn’t been time to get them dressed. Jenny, herself, had practically jumped into a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt. Of course, she had moved really fast. “Well, duh, silly,” Teddy responded. “Hence the middle-of-the-night road trip.” “We’re going to Andy’s,” Jenny said. “Don’t ask me anything else about why. I can’t tell you.” “Yeah!” Sarah cheered. “We just left. I like being there, though. With Andy. So does kitty.” She hugged the cat until it squeaked in protest. “It’s like going to a second home.” “It wasn’t bad,” Teddy agreed. “Andy cooks better than you, Mom.” “Thanks.” She was too scared for her kids to be able to think of anything else. The further away from the farmhouse they got, the better she’d feel. The roads were washed in spectral gloom. The rain came down at a steady clip. No moonlight. The wind whipped bits of limbs and wet leaves across the car’s windshield as the wipers fought off the clingy debris. She sped into Andy’s driveway and steered the car around the curve and parked in the back of the house. The house was lit up. Andy was waiting at the front door. A confused smile on his face. “I don’t want anyone knowing we’re here. Can I put my car in your garage?” was the first thing she asked as Teddy and Sarah darted past him and into the house. “Sure. Let me grab my car keys and move it out and you can pull yours in.” After they’d done that, Andy helped settle the kids in the guest room. He’d brought out an air mattress for her and had it made, covers, pillow and all. She didn’t have the heart to tell him she might not need it. They put the children to bed and she followed him into the kitchen. “I don’t know about you,” he said, “but I could use a late night snack. All this excitement has made me hungry.” “I’m not real hungry myself. I’m too worked up. But you go ahead.” “How about a cup of hot chocolate at least?” “That I could take.” The house had fallen silent. The children, tired from the excitement and the rush over, had gone to sleep immediately. Jenny had asked Andy to turn off as many lights in the house as he could. He did it without question. In the kitchen they looked at each other. The dim fifteen-watt bulb installed above the oven spread just enough light to see what they were doing. When the cocoa was done, a sandwich made for Andy, the two of them sat face to face at the table. “Nice house,” she commented, sipping the chocolate. It actually tasted good and that pleasantly surprised her. “Like you, I renovated it myself. Put a lot of sweat and blood into it. You should have seen it before I moved in. It was a mess.” Her eyes toured the kitchen, took note of the bow and arrow in its snug leather sheath propped in the corner, and came back to him. “I really like it. So cheerfully cozy.” “That’s what I was going for.” He smiled. “Andy, I don’t know how to thank you for all of this. And everything else you’ve done since we moved here. I’m in your debt.” “Nonsense. We’re friends. We help each other if we can. Your brother taught me that years ago. In a lot of ways, I’m in your debt. I wouldn’t be the man I am now if not for Joey.” There was a softness to his words that alerted her again to the softness growing in his heart for her. His hand reached across the table to cover hers. “Now tell me what’s going on, Jenny. My curiosity’s killing me. Don’t you think you owe me a better explanation than what I’ve had so far? I know something terrible is going on in your life, besides your husband’s death and your abduction, and has been since you moved here. I’ve felt it. I’ve been patient. I’ve waited for you to tell me. But now I’d like to believe I’m a good enough friend for you to finally confide in me. I won’t judge. Just tell me.” She really hated doing what she had to do next. Her sigh was one of resignation. “You’re an exceptionally intuitive man and, yes, you deserve the truth. Finally. “First, I need these things. Time is short. I have to go back to the farmhouse, alone, for a little while. These things, along with the bow and arrows, go with me.” She slid a scrap of paper covered with words and a simple diagram towards him. “You have them? Can you do that to the arrows for me?” She’d taken the stuff out of the bag and laid them on the table. He studied the list, the drawing, and looked up at her. “Yes. And yes.” He tapped the paper with his fingers and glanced at the items on the table. “Will all this be part of the explanation I’m about to get, too?” “It will.” She met his gaze. “I’m going to give it to you right now. But I warn you…it’s going to rock your world and everything you’ve ever believed about that world. Be prepared. I don’t have a lot of time so I can’t tell you everything in detail but I’ve give you a condensed version before I leave.” “You really have to leave then?” Her shoulders slumped. “If we’re to remain safe, I do. If all goes well I’ll be back by dawn.” “Can I go with you?” “No. I’m trusting you to take care of Teddy and Sarah and if anything happens to me, protect them until Joey and Laurie can come for them.” “You’re frightening me.” “I’m sorry. Again. Time short. Shush. Here goes. All I ask is you don’t interrupt me; don’t say a word, until I’m completely finished. Okay?” He looked puzzled, his hand left hers, but he nodded his head, waiting. “Okay.” So, as they sat there in the murky kitchen with the rain falling heavily outside, she told him. Everything. Just like Jeff asked her. Or as much as she could in the small amount of time she felt she had to do it in. He took it pretty well. All things considered. Afterwards, he still tried to convince her to let him go with her, let him help, but she was adamant he didn’t. When he knew he couldn’t change her mind, he collected the objects she’d asked for, fixed what she’d wanted him to fix, and helped her load everything into his car. She drove away into the stormy night in Andy’s new Mustang a little before three and Andy, his mind almost certainly reeling from what she’d told him, a frown on his face, lingered in the doorway and watched her leave. It was strange. He’d listened to her little speech and afterwards had appeared to believe her. But she’d never forget the way he’d stared at her before she left, his gaze incredulous one second and pitying the next. Or the way he’d suddenly pulled her into his arms at the door, simply held her, begged her to be careful and told her his prayers would be with her every step of the way. Until then she’d had no idea he was religious, believed in God. Thinking about it later, it made sense. He was such a good man.",

      "content": "Chapter 23 Jenny The rain’s ferocity lessened by the time she reached home. She checked the house first. It was dark and empty. But she could feel it. Someone was out there. Watching. Waiting. She sat in the lightless car behind the house and got ready. Collecting her weapon and what else she’d need once she entered the woods. Andy had given her four arrows he’d carved from aspen wood–the tips, the strange metal arrowheads from her mother’s stash, dipped in holy water from the flask she’d also retrieved from the cardboard box. Andy had skillfully split the arrows’ shafts, slid the bases of the silver arrowheads into them, and using strong nylon line had tied them on securely. She’d sat there and watched him. He’d done an expert job. She tucked the arrows into the leather sheath and slung the pouch around her shoulders. The bow she took into her hands. She remembered the comfortable feel and smell of the wood from years ago. Remembered the exhilaration she’d once known when her aim was true and the arrow flew to the target and plunged into the center. She’d loved every aspect of archery. It was an exciting sport. Maybe after this–if she lived–she’d take it up again. It was something she’d have in common with Andy. Something they could do together. Strange how all these years later the bow and arrow might save her and her kids’ lives. The Bic lighter went into her jeans pocket. She grabbed the can of gasoline Andy had given her and slid out of the car. She prayed Jeff was right about the plan. That it would work. Of course he was a ghost and could be ghosts had some inside information living people didn’t have. The woods were dark, the wind was feral, but at least the rain had stopped. Good thing. She needed it to be gone. Moving stealthily between the trees behind the house she came to the spot Jeff had reminded her of, a huge aspen tree they’d often met at when they’d been teenagers, and waited. Leaves trembled above and around her. That was the thing about aspen, their foliage whispered and soughed in the breeze. As if they were communicating among themselves. Leaf talk. She couldn’t understand a word of it. She felt Jeff’s presence before he spoke. A shiver went up her spine and a smile arched her cold lips. She looked and saw a wispy pale shape next to her. Jeff. You ready for this, sweetheart? You have everything I told you to bring? Did what I asked you to do? “Yes. I’m ready.” Then go to the left side of the farmhouse. Aloysius is there already. Better hurry if you don’t want your home to burn. “He’s going to torch the farmhouse!” He will if you don’t stop him. You burned him and his friends in that cellar so he’s going to return the favor. He doesn’t realize yet you and the kids aren’t in there. But he’ll know soon that it’s empty. So hurry. Out of spite, he’ll burn it anyway. “Are you sure these arrows will stun him long enough for me to do what I have to do? He’s not a normal vampire, you know. Not like those we killed at the theater all those years ago.” I’m sure. He may not be the run-of-the-mill bloodsucker from this world but this will work on him. I promise. I have it from a trustworthy source. The ghost laughed softly. Sounded like Jeff. Jenny nodded as the wind whipped her clothes about her. She stood under the tree in the dry spot its leaves created and tightly held the bow close. She’d always trusted her husband and wasn’t about to stop now. And there was no other way. She didn’t have a better plan. In fact she’d had no plan. Jeff’s plan was all she had. She laid the gasoline can and the bow, the pouch of arrows, beneath the tree; hiding them behind the base of the trunk. She backtracked the way she’d come. She could feel Jeff floating along with her, keeping pace. Once or twice she caught him smiling at her. His beloved face a pale glowing oval, his eyes twinkling diamonds above his ghostly smile. Jeff, but not Jeff. Her love for him was still so strong. Yet the sharpest of the pain, the bad memories of his murder, had faded. All that was left were the good ones and…love. Eternal love. Just like the old days, huh, Jenny? The two of us fighting against the evil vampires. Remember? “I remember.” Every second, every moment. Stop daydreaming. Aloysius is at the living room window. He’s ready to throw the bottles of gasoline, light the fire. Hurry! Her legs moved faster as she raced over the ground, her shoes barely touching the wet grass. When she got to the house Jeff was no longer by her side though she could feel his presence. He was still there. Somewhere. “Get away from my house,” she screamed at the shadow hulking beneath the window. “You coward. Murderer! I destroyed your friends and I’m going to take care of you, too.” Aloysius stepped away from the deeper murk of the farmhouse, pivoted around to face her. She saw his fire ravished face. The livid, bloody scars. His once long moonlit hair was burnt wisps sticking out from his disfigured head. He didn’t make a sound. Said nothing. His eyes glowed a crimson red. She could feel his disgust; almost taste his loathing. It was as hot as the fire she’d set to burn him and the others into ashes with. How had she not seen, known, he was the one of all of them with the real power? The one who, as Jeff had said, might someday be the demise of the human race? “Because you humans, even you, an abomination half-breed mutant, never see what is right in front of you.” His voice, which she’d never truly heard before was strangely alluring. Spellbinding. “Your race is doomed. It’s always been doomed. You were only waiting for someone like me–someone like us–to arrive and exterminate you. “Oh, I think you should know. I killed that detective friend of yours. He cried like a blubbering baby. I cut him up and stuffed him in his car. Wrecked it. “And…I’m the one who killed your mate. Did you know that? I slit his throat and drank every drop of his blood and laughed as I did it. I must admit, he was plucky. Not one cry.” Aloysius’s laugh cut razor sharp through her skin as her heart bled. She wanted to throw herself at him and strangle the life from his malevolent eyes. Wanted to make him hurt as much as he’d hurt her. Her husband. Her family. Her friend. No. Not yet. Follow the plan, my love, Jeff whispered in her ear. Now. “I may be only half of what you are,” she spoke, “but humans are far stronger than you think. You’re the weak one. You’re the doomed one.” She made sure her tone was condescending. “I’m going to exterminate you as I did the others. Stupid bloodsucker.” Her words did what she’d known they would do. They infuriated him. He let out one ear-splitting yell and a burning bottle soared from his fingers towards the farmhouse’s window. Only she saw Jeff step in front of the fireball and deflect it at the last moment. It exploded, a dud, in the air inches away from the glass. Aloysius looked around, then at her. “How did you do that?” he shrieked. Laughing, she stuck out her tongue and wiggled her fingers in her ears, shouting, “Catch me if you can!” She turned and ran as fast as her new speed would allow her into the woods towards the aspen tree. The moonless night was a blanket around her. The wind, voices of the souls of the victims the vampires had taken, spurred her on. She ran. For her life. She was no longer scared. All she cared about was making sure her children, her family, her town…humanity…were safe. Making sure the monster that’d killed so many innocent victims would never do so again. She had to do this. Atonement for what she was. Jeff was with her. Invisible. Keeping pace. At her side. Like he’d always been in life. Aloysius did as Jeff predicted he would. He followed her. About caught her, too. He was so fast. She was faster and kept ahead of him by inches. But still ahead. She arrived at the tree, the one with her and Jeff’s initials carved into it, and swept up the bow, the sheath of arrows, and boomeranged around the trunk to a standstill. She wasn’t even breathing hard. You can do this, Jenny. I believe in you, Jeff’s voice encouraged in her ear. When Aloysius stopped before her, gloating, thinking he’d caught her, he was positioned with his back to the tree trunk. And, faster than a human eye could see, Jenny took the first arrow, with the special silver tip, from the pouch, notched it, lifted the bow and with all her new strength pulled back and let the arrow fly. It hit Aloysius’s chest with such force it rammed through his upper body and pinned him to the tree. He screamed. The sort of scream she’d never heard before. Unearthly. Demonic. It filled her head, the world. He writhed and kicked against the tree. His arms reached for her. He wasn’t screaming out very nice things. She slid out another arrow and sent it rocketing into his left arm, pinning it to the tree as well. Another strike. She could still hit the bull’s eye. The shrieks rose to a fevered pitch and she felt him in her mind. Tearing at her flesh. Trying to distract her, command her. Kill her. She fought it. The pain. The gut-wrenching terror of something so strong, so alien in her head. Her arms were as heavy as stone. For a terrible heartbeat, she couldn’t move. Aloysius was working the arrows out from his body. Regaining his freedom. Use your last two arrows and send them, with a prayer, in with every bit of power you have, Jeff whispered. Now. With the last and best of her strength, she tugged out and notched the final arrows and sent them into the place in the vampire’s body Jeff had told her to aim for. Pinning the right arm as well. Lastly, the place here the heart should be. They went in harder and deeper than the others. This time the vampire didn’t scream, this time the sounds coming from the thing’s mouth was more than screams. It was trapped, like a bug against the tree’s wood, and it knew it. Its struggles heightened. It was so angry. Finish it, Jeff’s voice said. The arrows won’t hold it long. She picked up the can of gasoline and drenched the creature with gas. Dropping the bow, she took the Bic lighter from her pocket, and rushing at the impaled vampire she touched the tiny flame to his coat. The body went up in a whoosh of fire and black clouds. She stood back and watched, her body shaking. The creature burned and howled and screamed. But not for long. When silence reclaimed the night and the fire burnt down there was nothing left but a skeleton, blackened bones and soot drifting on the air. Before her eyes what remained dissipated on the breeze leaving only the four burnt arrows sticking out of the tree. She sunk to the ground, exhausted. The taste of soot in her mouth. The blood hunger humming in her ears like angry bees. She’d have to feed before she went home. What she’d done had taken every ounce of her strength. She fell to the ground in a heap. You did it, Jenny. It’s dead. Forever this time. You’re safe. Our children are safe. Joey and Laurie. The town. Our world. “For sure this time?” A lone drop of water fell on her face. Then another. Lightning lit up the sky. Thunder rumbled in the distance. The storm was moving off but another was coming in. For sure. It’s over. For now anyway. Go get our kids. Live your life. Try to be happy while you can. “Wait…are you going now?” I must. I did what I had to do. It’s my time. I’m sorry. I was only here to help you. “Can’t you stay, just a little longer?” Her heart was breaking again. She put her arms out to the shifting form of pale light that was dissipating as she watched. You have others to help, others to save because, and I hate to say it but must, there are more monsters in this world. They’ll be drawn to you. It’s your destiny. Mine is to go. “Jeff?” Yes? “I love you.” And I love you. I’ll always love you, Jenny. Never forget. Tell my children I love them, too. Goodbye. I’ll see you again…one day. Jeff’s ghost flickered out and he was gone. “Goodbye my love. Goodbye.” She lay on the ground, light rain pelting her skin, until she could get up. The arrows she wrenched from the tree and replaced in the pouch, then picked up the bow where she’d dropped it. With a heavy body and heart she trekked to the farmhouse, got in the car and drove back to Andy’s. She knew she had more explaining to do.",

      "content": "Chapter 23 Jenny The rain’s ferocity lessened by the time she reached home. She checked the house first. It was dark and empty. But she could feel it. Someone was out there. Watching. Waiting. She sat in the lightless car behind the house and got ready. Collecting her weapon and what else she’d need once she entered the woods. Andy had given her four arrows he’d carved from aspen wood–the tips, the strange metal arrowheads from her mother’s stash, dipped in holy water from the flask she’d also retrieved from the cardboard box. Andy had skillfully split the arrows’ shafts, slid the bases of the silver arrowheads into them, and using strong nylon line had tied them on securely. She’d sat there and watched him. He’d done an expert job. She tucked the arrows into the leather sheath and slung the pouch around her shoulders. The bow she took into her hands. She remembered the comfortable feel and smell of the wood from years ago. Remembered the exhilaration she’d once known when her aim was true and the arrow flew to the target and plunged into the center. She’d loved every aspect of archery. It was an exciting sport. Maybe after this–if she lived–she’d take it up again. It was something she’d have in common with Andy. Something they could do together. Strange how all these years later the bow and arrow might save her and her kids’ lives. The Bic lighter went into her jeans pocket. She grabbed the can of gasoline Andy had given her and slid out of the car. She prayed Jeff was right about the plan. That it would work. Of course he was a ghost and could be ghosts had some inside information living people didn’t have. The woods were dark, the wind was feral, but at least the rain had stopped. Good thing. She needed it to be gone. Moving stealthily between the trees behind the house she came to the spot Jeff had reminded her of, a huge aspen tree they’d often met at when they’d been teenagers, and waited. Leaves trembled above and around her. That was the thing about aspen, their foliage whispered and soughed in the breeze. As if they were communicating among themselves. Leaf talk. She couldn’t understand a word of it. She felt Jeff’s presence before he spoke. A shiver went up her spine and a smile arched her cold lips. She looked and saw a wispy pale shape next to her. Jeff. You ready for this, sweetheart? You have everything I told you to bring? Did what I asked you to do? “Yes. I’m ready.” Then go to the left side of the farmhouse. Aloysius is there already. Better hurry if you don’t want your home to burn. “He’s going to torch the farmhouse!” He will if you don’t stop him. You burned him and his friends in that cellar so he’s going to return the favor. He doesn’t realize yet you and the kids aren’t in there. But he’ll know soon that it’s empty. So hurry. Out of spite, he’ll burn it anyway. “Are you sure these arrows will stun him long enough for me to do what I have to do? He’s not a normal vampire, you know. Not like those we killed at the theater all those years ago.” I’m sure. He may not be the run-of-the-mill bloodsucker from this world but this will work on him. I promise. I have it from a trustworthy source. The ghost laughed softly. Sounded like Jeff. Jenny nodded as the wind whipped her clothes about her. She stood under the tree in the dry spot its leaves created and tightly held the bow close. She’d always trusted her husband and wasn’t about to stop now. And there was no other way. She didn’t have a better plan. In fact she’d had no plan. Jeff’s plan was all she had. She laid the gasoline can and the bow, the pouch of arrows, beneath the tree; hiding them behind the base of the trunk. She backtracked the way she’d come. She could feel Jeff floating along with her, keeping pace. Once or twice she caught him smiling at her. His beloved face a pale glowing oval, his eyes twinkling diamonds above his ghostly smile. Jeff, but not Jeff. Her love for him was still so strong. Yet the sharpest of the pain, the bad memories of his murder, had faded. All that was left were the good ones and…love. Eternal love. Just like the old days, huh, Jenny? The two of us fighting against the evil vampires. Remember? “I remember.” Every second, every moment. Stop daydreaming. Aloysius is at the living room window. He’s ready to throw the bottles of gasoline, light the fire. Hurry! Her legs moved faster as she raced over the ground, her shoes barely touching the wet grass. When she got to the house Jeff was no longer by her side though she could feel his presence. He was still there. Somewhere. “Get away from my house,” she screamed at the shadow hulking beneath the window. “You coward. Murderer! I destroyed your friends and I’m going to take care of you, too.” Aloysius stepped away from the deeper murk of the farmhouse, pivoted around to face her. She saw his fire ravished face. The livid, bloody scars. His once long moonlit hair was burnt wisps sticking out from his disfigured head. He didn’t make a sound. Said nothing. His eyes glowed a crimson red. She could feel his disgust; almost taste his loathing. It was as hot as the fire she’d set to burn him and the others into ashes with. How had she not seen, known, he was the one of all of them with the real power? The one who, as Jeff had said, might someday be the demise of the human race? “Because you humans, even you, an abomination half-breed mutant, never see what is right in front of you.” His voice, which she’d never truly heard before was strangely alluring. Spellbinding. “Your race is doomed. It’s always been doomed. You were only waiting for someone like me–someone like us–to arrive and exterminate you. “Oh, I think you should know. I killed that detective friend of yours. He cried like a blubbering baby. I cut him up and stuffed him in his car. Wrecked it. “And…I’m the one who killed your mate. Did you know that? I slit his throat and drank every drop of his blood and laughed as I did it. I must admit, he was plucky. Not one cry.” Aloysius’s laugh cut razor sharp through her skin as her heart bled. She wanted to throw herself at him and strangle the life from his malevolent eyes. Wanted to make him hurt as much as he’d hurt her. Her husband. Her family. Her friend. No. Not yet. Follow the plan, my love, Jeff whispered in her ear. Now. “I may be only half of what you are,” she spoke, “but humans are far stronger than you think. You’re the weak one. You’re the doomed one.” She made sure her tone was condescending. “I’m going to exterminate you as I did the others. Stupid bloodsucker.” Her words did what she’d known they would do. They infuriated him. He let out one ear-splitting yell and a burning bottle soared from his fingers towards the farmhouse’s window. Only she saw Jeff step in front of the fireball and deflect it at the last moment. It exploded, a dud, in the air inches away from the glass. Aloysius looked around, then at her. “How did you do that?” he shrieked. Laughing, she stuck out her tongue and wiggled her fingers in her ears, shouting, “Catch me if you can!” She turned and ran as fast as her new speed would allow her into the woods towards the aspen tree. The moonless night was a blanket around her. The wind, voices of the souls of the victims the vampires had taken, spurred her on. She ran. For her life. She was no longer scared. All she cared about was making sure her children, her family, her town…humanity…were safe. Making sure the monster that’d killed so many innocent victims would never do so again. She had to do this. Atonement for what she was. Jeff was with her. Invisible. Keeping pace. At her side. Like he’d always been in life. Aloysius did as Jeff predicted he would. He followed her. About caught her, too. He was so fast. She was faster and kept ahead of him by inches. But still ahead. She arrived at the tree, the one with her and Jeff’s initials carved into it, and swept up the bow, the sheath of arrows, and boomeranged around the trunk to a standstill. She wasn’t even breathing hard. You can do this, Jenny. I believe in you, Jeff’s voice encouraged in her ear. When Aloysius stopped before her, gloating, thinking he’d caught her, he was positioned with his back to the tree trunk. And, faster than a human eye could see, Jenny took the first arrow, with the special silver tip, from the pouch, notched it, lifted the bow and with all her new strength pulled back and let the arrow fly.

      "content": "Chapter 24 Christmas “God, this ham smells so good,” Joey gushed as she took it from the oven. He used a knife from the counter and sliced off a piece of the steaming meat to stuff into his mouth. “Umm, delicious. Reminds me of when we were kids, before the bad times anyway, and mom would make the holiday meals. Gosh, could she bake those sugar cookies. You know, the ones with the red and green sprinkles on them? Oh, those were heaven.” “Yeah, you and dad had it easy. You’d be out in the front room with your eyes and ears glued to the television and mom and I would be out here slaving over the hot stove. Peeling potatoes. Cutting up vegetables. Sticking those cloves in the ham; using toothpicks to hold on the round pineapple slices. Making cookies and pies from scratch. Setting the table and serving you men. Cleaning up afterwards. A lot of work.” “Yeah, those were the good old days. Now I get to peel the potatoes, cook the food, make the desserts and serve the people. Every day.” Joey smiled and she laughed. “And you love every minute of it.” “Oh, I do. But it’s nice sometimes to sit back and let someone else do it. Make the food. Serve it. Clean up after. It’s a treat.” “Well, enjoy it today because tomorrow it’ll be back to the old grind.” “Tell me about it.” He sighed. “Anything else I can do to help?” “I have it under control. Everything’s done, including the sweet potatoes and marshmallows.” She moved the ham to one of her mother’s old china platters and centered it in the middle of the table. She’d decorated it and the house so carefully. Little Christmas lights strung everywhere, silver and green tinsel on the massive tree in the living room. The family’s old ornaments hanging from the fragrant boughs. Presents piled beneath. A real Norman Rockwell Christmas. “Ooh, that does smell delicious. You even put pineapple and cherries on top of the ham like mom used to.” He filched one of the cherries and popped it in his mouth. “I know you and Teddy like it like that.” “And the table looks lovely. You gonna eat with us, Sis?” “Of course. I can actually eat a complete meal these days. Almost. Small quantities anyway. Doesn’t taste too bad, either.” She’d found the foods she’d once hated she still did and the food she’d loved, the same. Her brother hovered over the table. She could hear her children and their friends in the living room around the Christmas tree laughing and joking. Someone, sounded like Laurie, started singing Silent Night on key. A few other voices joined in. Outside the windows there was no snow. No cold weather to make it feel like Christmas, not in Florida anyway. But it felt like Christmas in her heart. She had her children in the next room. Her family. Andy. They were safe and together celebrating Christmas Eve like they used to do as children in the same house. The kitchen was full of memories. Her mother proud at the way the baked ham had turned out as she drank her wine, giggling, and her father carving the meat and making jokes so they’d all laugh. Her grandparents, too, gathered around the table passing mashed potatoes and gravy, cranberry sauce (which no one else but them liked) and everyone stuffing themselves after the meal with pumpkin and custard pie topped with the real whipped cream her father had so prided himself on whipping up every holiday. So many memories. Bad and good. Today she remembered only the good ones. Joey broke into her musing. “How are you and Andy doing?” She bumped her hip gently against her brother’s, scooted him out of the way so she could put the gravy boat beside the mashed potatoes. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” “Ah, come on. He is my best friend. He’s crazy about you, you know.” “I know.” Joey’s head bent closer to hers and he softly asked, “Is it the vampire thing?” This time she didn’t laugh. “I’m still trying to figure all that out. So is Andy.” “Oh, yeah, you telling him about it sure did blow his mind for a while, plus what happened with those vampires last month; what you did. But he’s all right with it now. He told me so.” “Did he?” “He loves you. He told me that, too, and doesn’t care what the hell you are. He knows you’re a good person no matter what. You didn’t ask to be what you are. He loves the kids. Jenny, he’s really a great guy. Don’t worry about him not having a job yet. I know Andy. He’ll find one soon. He’s got it all going for him.” “Oh, I know that. I’m lucky to have a job myself. There are lots of people out of work now. It’s not that.” “What is it, then?” If nothing else her brother was too blunt at times. She shook her head. “I’m not ready yet, Joey. Simple as that. Jeff hasn’t been dead that long.” Joey knew about Jeff’s ghost and the part he’d played in their deliverance. He still was waiting for the ghost to appear to him. So far it hadn’t. “Give me some more time. So much has happened in the last few months. I still haven’t quite come to terms with what I am these days.” She whispered, “Vampire, you know?” “Oh I understand completely. But you do feel something for the guy, don’t you?” That was an easy one. “Yes, I do. He’s my friend. Your friend. The kids love him. Perhaps someday he’ll be more. We’ll be more. We’ll see.” Her brother smiled. “Okay. I won’t pester anymore.” “Thanks.” Teddy and Sarah ran into the kitchen and hugged her at the same time. Amadeus clutched in Sarah’s arms. Her daughter drug that poor cat around everywhere like a baby. Since Jenny had come home her kids had been so affectionate and well behaved. Doing their chores and homework without complaining. She wondered how long that would last? Knowing them, not long. “Is it time to eat yet?” Sarah dropped down in a chair and Amadeus escaped, meowing, and hid beneath the table, waiting for scraps. “I’m starving.” She was dressed in her new jet-black and silver-threaded dress (back to the Twilight influence again, everything black, silver or purple, since the newest movie had come out) and looked so pretty, so grownup. Jenny had curled her long blond hair and braided the sides. The girl was going to be a knock out some day. She’d be a handful. Just like Jenny had been. Lately the child had been begging for a horse. Or two. She argued convincingly they had the room. The yard. She adored horses as Jenny had and Jenny wished she could have swung the cost. She would have loved to have horses again. They’d been one of the best things in her childhood. Can’t afford a horse right now, she’d told her daughter. Next summer maybe. “I’m starving, too.” Teddy snuck a buttered roll and crammed it into his mouth. Jenny made him sit down. “Supper’s ready,” she announced as Andy and Laurie came into the room. “And coffee’s done so help yourself. Cups on the counter with the sugar and cream. There’s soda and milk, too, in the refrigerator.” She smiled at Andy and he smiled back. A special smile. There’d been a lot of those lately. Secrets shared. Trust firm and growing. He’d accepted her vampire state so much easier than she’d thought he would and he was helping her deal with it. If the sun were too bright he’d run an errand for her. Pick up the kids from school. Do whatever she asked. Whatever she needed. He was aiding Joey with the vampire research because Jenny still hadn’t given up on finding a cure. She still had hope. “Everyone sit down and we’ll eat.” “It all looks fantastic,” Andy complimented as he settled into a chair beside her. “Thank you so much for having me over.” “You’re family now,” Jenny answered gently and when he took her hand she let him hold it for a moment, in front of everyone, before she picked up her fork. “It should taste fantastic, too,” Laurie stated. “Jenny and I have been working hard enough on it all day.” Laurie had made the pies and some of the side dishes. She’d help with the dishes afterwards. She was a good sister-in-law. The six of them sat around the table in the same kitchen Jenny and Joey had eaten in all their young lives and everyone talked and laughed. Ate the food. A family. Although, there were more than six people there. At times Jenny could have sworn her mother and father and Jeff were sitting there with them, too. They were ghosts that listened and smiled, said nothing, but were happy everyone was together. Safe and sound. She could have also sworn she heard horses whinnying outside in the fields behind the house, their hooves clomping in the hard dirt as they ran, and she smiled to herself. All that was missing was the haunting violin music. That usually came late at night wafting on the night breezes outside Joey’s restaurant, close to where the old theater had once stood. She often went there and listened. Remembered. Everything. She was so grateful everyone she loved was home. Finally.",

He loves the kids. Jenny, he’s really a great guy. Don’t worry about him not having a job yet. I know Andy. He’ll find one soon. He’s got it all going for him.” “Oh, I know that. I’m lucky to have a job myself. There are lots of people out of work now. It’s not that.” “What is it, then?” If nothing else her brother was too blunt at times. She shook her head. “I’m not ready yet, Joey. Simple as that. Jeff hasn’t been dead that long.” Joey knew about Jeff’s ghost and the part he’d played in their deliverance. He still was waiting for the ghost to appear to him. So far it hadn’t. “Give me some more time. So much has happened in the last few months. I still haven’t quite come to terms with what I am these days.” She whispered, “Vampire, you know?” “Oh I understand completely. But you do feel something for the guy, don’t you?” That was an easy one. “Yes, I do. He’s my friend. Your friend. The kids love him. Perhaps someday he’ll be more. We’ll be more. We’ll see.” Her brother smiled. “Okay. I won’t pester anymore.” “Thanks.” Teddy and Sarah ran into the kitchen and hugged her at the same time. Amadeus clutched in Sarah’s arms. Her daughter drug that poor cat around everywhere like a baby. Since Jenny had come home her kids had been so affectionate and well behaved. Doing their chores and homework without complaining. She wondered how long that would last? Knowing them, not long. “Is it time to eat yet?” Sarah dropped down in a chair and Amadeus escaped, meowing, and hid beneath the table, waiting for scraps. “I’m starving.” She was dressed in her new jet-black and silver-threaded dress (back to the Twilight influence again, everything black, silver or purple, since the newest movie had come out) and looked so pretty, so grownup. Jenny had curled her long blond hair and braided the sides. The girl was going to be a knock out some day. She’d be a handful. Just like Jenny had been. Lately the child had been begging for a horse. Or two. She argued convincingly they had the room. The yard. She adored horses as Jenny had and Jenny wished she could have swung the cost. She would have loved to have horses again. They’d been one of the best things in her childhood. Can’t afford a horse right now, she’d told her daughter. Next summer maybe. “I’m starving, too.” Teddy snuck a buttered roll and crammed it into his mouth. Jenny made him sit down. “Supper’s ready,” she announced as Andy and Laurie came into the room. “And coffee’s done so help yourself. Cups on the counter with the sugar and cream. There’s soda and milk, too, in the refrigerator.” She smiled at Andy and he smiled back. A special smile. There’d been a lot of those lately. Secrets shared. Trust firm and growing. He’d accepted her vampire state so much easier than she’d thought he would and he was helping her deal with it. If the sun were too bright he’d run an errand for her. Pick up the kids from school. Do whatever she asked. Whatever she needed. He was aiding Joey with the vampire research because Jenny still hadn’t given up on finding a cure. She still had hope. “Everyone sit down and we’ll eat.” “It all looks fantastic,” Andy complimented as he settled into a chair beside her. “Thank you so much for having me over.” “You’re family now,” Jenny answered gently and when he took her hand she let him hold it for a moment, in front of everyone, before she picked up her fork. “It should taste fantastic, too,” Laurie stated. “Jenny and I have been working hard enough on it all day.” Laurie had made the pies and some of the side dishes. She’d help with the dishes afterwards. She was a good sister-in-law. The six of them sat around the table in the same kitchen Jenny and Joey had eaten in all their young lives and everyone talked and laughed. Ate the food. A family. Although, there were more than six people there. At times Jenny could have sworn her mother and father and Jeff were sitting there with them, too. They were ghosts that listened and smiled, said nothing, but were happy everyone was together. Safe and sound. She could have also sworn she heard horses whinnying outside in the fields behind the house, their hooves clomping in the hard dirt as they ran, and she smiled to herself. All that was missing was the haunting violin music. That usually came late at night wafting on the night breezes outside Joey’s restaurant, close to where the old theater had once stood. She often went there and listened. Remembered. Everything. She was so grateful everyone she loved was home. Finally.",
