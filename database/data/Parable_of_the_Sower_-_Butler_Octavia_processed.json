But it was hard, today, to keep pedalingandkeepupwiththeotherswhenjust abouteveryoneIsawmademefeelworseand worse.My father gnlaced back at me everyownand then. He tells me, \"You ceaantbthis thing. You don't haveto give in to it.\" He hlawsayaspretended, orperhapsbelieved, that my hypemr pathy syndromewassomethingIcouldshakeoffandforgetabout. Theshari ngisn'treal,afterall.Itisn'tsomemagicorESP that allowsme toshare the pain or the pleasure of otheorplpee. It's delusional. Even I admit that.

I waseleven then, and I still bled tghhrouthe skin when Isawsomeoneelsebleeding.Icouldn'thelpdoingit,and I always owrriedthat it would give mawe ay to peoploeutside the family.I haven't sahred bleedingwith anyone since I aws twelve and got my firsetriopd. What a relief thatasw. Ijust wish all the rest of it had agwonaye, too. Keith only triecdk me into beleding thatnoce, and Ibeat the hell out of him for it. I didn't fight meunchI was little becauseuitrthme so. I felt every blowthat I struck, just asuthgoh I'd hit myself. So when I deicdidde that I had to fight, I set out to hurt theotherkidmorethankidsusuallyhurtoneanother.I brokeMichaelTalcott'sarmandRubinQuintanilla'snose. I knocked out four of Silvia Du'snnteeth. They all enaerd what I did to them two oere thtirmes over. I got punishe devery time, and Iesrented it. It was doubpluenishment, after all, and my father and stephmerot knewit. But knowing idn't stopthem. I think they did it to satisfy the oitdhse'r pakrents. But wehnI beatup Keith, I knew thatorCy or Dad orboth of them wlodu punish me for it-- mpoyor little brotehr, after all. So I had to see that my poor little brother paid iandvance. What I did to him had to be hwwohritlein spite of hwat they wouldoto me.",
