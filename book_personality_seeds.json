History had proven it endlessly fascinating as a subject, either because the obsession with what it might have contained was bounded only by the imagination or because humanity typically longs for things most ardently as a collective. All men can love a forbidden thing, generally speaking, and in most cases knowledge is precisely that; lost knowledge even more so."

But on that day, with Europe in flames, and the evil shadow of Adolf Hitler apparently falling over all the world, what was chiefly on my mind was a meeting toward which I was hastening.

I stumbled along, the toes of my boots catching on every rock, my mind a churning well of thoughts and regrets. My friends and I had striven for the impossible: to liberate the castle of ridiculously challenging foes \u2013 and won.
