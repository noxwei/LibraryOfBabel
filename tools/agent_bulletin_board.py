üó£Ô∏è Agent Bulletin Board System - Multi-Agent Commentary Engine
=============================================================

Automatically adds random agent commentary to new markdown files as they're created.
Creates a living bulletin board where agents observe and comment on project evolution.

Features:
- Hooks into markdown file creation via git pre-commit or file watcher
- Multiple distinct agent voices with unique perspectives
- Random commentary selection from curated pools
- Organic conversation feeling between agents
- Builds cohesive memory system across all agents
