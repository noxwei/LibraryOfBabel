## Architecture

### Core Components
```
agents/hr/hr_agent.py              # Main HR management system
database/schema/hr_schema.sql      # PostgreSQL HR tables and analytics
reports/hr_analytics/              # JSON fallback storage (backup only)
├── agents                         # PostgreSQL table: Agent registry
├── user_requests                  # PostgreSQL table: User interaction logs
├── agent_interactions             # PostgreSQL table: Performance tracking
├── hr_daily_reports              # PostgreSQL table: Linda's assessments
└── fallback_*.json               # JSON backup when database unavailable
```

### Database Architecture (Future-Ready 💙)
- **Primary Storage**: PostgreSQL with normalized tables and performance views
- **Fallback System**: JSON files when database is unavailable (reliability first)
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexes, triggers, and materialized views
- **Cultural Scoring**: Built-in performance calculation functions
- **Analytics Views**: Real-time workforce performance dashboards

### Data Privacy
- **Local Database**: All HR data in local PostgreSQL, never transmitted
- **Git Ignored**: Sensitive performance data excluded from version control
- **Row-Level Security**: Ready for multi-tenant scenarios (future expansion)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete interaction history with tamper-proof logging
- **Confidentiality**: Individual agent performance data kept confidential

## Management Philosophy

### Linda's Core Principles
1. **勤奋工作** (Hard Work): High performance expectations for all agents
2. **师傅带徒弟** (Master-Apprentice): Senior agents mentor junior ones
3. **严格考核** (Strict Evaluation): Regular performance reviews with clear targets
4. **持续学习** (Continuous Learning): Mandatory skill development programs
5. **设定高标准** (High Standards): Mediocrity not acceptable in competitive environment

### Performance Standards
- **Success Rate**: >90% for Grade A, >75% for Grade B, <75% requires intervention
- **Response Time**: <2000ms average for optimal performance
- **Activity Level**: Minimum 5 interactions for statistically valid assessment
- **Improvement Rate**: Expected 10% quarterly improvement in problem areas

## Setup

### Database Initialization
```bash
# Initialize HR tables in PostgreSQL
psql -U weixiangzhang -d knowledge_base -f database/schema/hr_schema.sql

# Verify tables were created
psql -U weixiangzhang -d knowledge_base -c "\dt agents user_requests agent_interactions hr_daily_reports"
```

### Migration from JSON (if needed)
```python
# Linda can migrate existing JSON data to PostgreSQL
hr = HRAgent()
hr.migrate_json_to_postgres()  # Future method for data migration
```

## Usage

### Basic Analysis
```python
from agents.hr.hr_agent import HRAgent

# Initialize HR system
hr = HRAgent()

# Run comprehensive workforce analysis
report = hr.run_hr_analysis()

# Track specific interaction
hr.log_user_request("development", "Create new feature")
hr.log_agent_interaction("agent_name", "task_completion", True, 1500.0)
```

### Key Methods
