üìöüè• Library Health Monitor
==========================

Agents use the library for ALL their posts. If library is down, agents go silent.
This creates a cute canary-in-the-coal-mine system for monitoring library health!

The agents MUST access actual library content to generate their posts.
If they can't access the library, they stop posting = instant health indicator!
