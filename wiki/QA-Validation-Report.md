## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found and Recommendations

### Minor Issues (Priority: Low)

#### 1. **Cross-Reference Links**
**Issue**: Some internal wiki links use placeholder syntax `[[Page Name]]` that needs GitHub Wiki formatting.

**Recommendation**: Update links to proper GitHub Wiki format:
```markdown
# Current (needs fixing)
See the [[Installation Guide]] for details

# Recommended
See the [Installation Guide](Installation-Guide) for details
```

**Impact**: Low - navigation still clear, but proper linking would improve UX.

#### 2. **Code Block Language Specification**
**Issue**: Some code blocks lack language specification for syntax highlighting.

**Recommendation**: Add language identifiers:
```markdown
# Current
```
code here
```

# Recommended
```python
code here
```
```

**Impact**: Low - improves code readability.

#### 3. **API Base URL Consistency**
**Issue**: Some examples use `localhost:5570` while others use `localhost:5560`.

**Recommendation**: Standardize API examples and clarify when each port is used:
- `5570`: Educational/procedural domain
- `5560`: Research domain with real ebooks

**Impact**: Low - could cause initial confusion but context usually clarifies.

### Documentation Gaps (Priority: Medium)

#### 1. **Quick Reference Cards**
**Recommendation**: Add quick reference sections for:
- **Common API endpoints** with one-liner examples
- **Reddit Bibliophile commands** for quick access
- **Troubleshooting checklist** for common issues

#### 2. **Video Walkthroughs**
**Recommendation**: Create companion video content for:
- **5-minute system overview** for newcomers
- **Installation walkthrough** for non-technical users
- **Educational demo** showing classroom use

#### 3. **Contributing Guidelines**
**Recommendation**: Add detailed contributing guidelines covering:
- **Code style standards**
- **Documentation standards**
- **Pull request process**
- **Community guidelines**
